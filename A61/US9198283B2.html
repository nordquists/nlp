<heading id="h-0002">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to semiconductor devices and in particular to transistor devices.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Modern-day electronics systems typically require multiple patterned layers of electrically or optically active materials, sometimes over a relatively large substrate. Electronics, such as radio frequency identification (RFID) tags, photovoltaics, and optical and chemical sensors, require some level of patterning in their electronic circuitry. Flat panel displays, such as liquid crystal displays or electroluminescent displays, rely upon accurately patterned sequential layers to form thin film components of the backplane. These electronic components include capacitors, transistors, and power buses. The usual combination of photolithographic patterning methods and selective etch processes has several shortcomings including high cost, difficulty with large substrates, and complexity of selective etch processes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">The feature size obtainable using traditional processing methods is limited by the resolution of the photolithography tools. Currently the minimum feature size for large area display backplanes is around 0.5 microns, and requires expensive high end equipment. Minimum feature sizes for large area substrates with less expensive equipment can be much larger. High speed circuit operation requires TFTs with high drive current, and many applications additionally require the drive current be obtained with low voltage operation. It is well known that TFT performance is improved by reducing the channel length. To move beyond the exposure limitation of feature size, vertical transistors of various architectures are currently being studied. In a vertical TFT architecture, the channel is formed perpendicular to the substrate, and therefore the channel length (L) can be controlled by the height of a layer in the transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Recent work in the fabrication of VTFT, while yielding short channel length devices, has used otherwise standard photolithographic techniques with complex semiconductor processes. For example, since it is not currently possible to put patterns directly on walls which are vertical with respect to a substrate surface, vertical wall patterning has been accomplished using a suitable temporary filler material to partially fill in a trench. The temporary filler material acts as a mask for the portions of the wall located underneath while allowing for processing of the walls above the temporary filler material. For example, when an oxide is to be deposited exclusively on vertical walls below a temporary filler material, the oxide is first deposited or produced over the entire surface of the relief. The relief or trench is initially completely filled with a suitable temporary filler material. Then, the temporary filler material is recessed back to a depth that just covers the desired oxide. After uncovered sections of the oxide are removed, the remaining temporary filler material is removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">When it is necessary that an oxide be deposited or produced only in upper regions of a vertical wall, an etching stop layer, for example, a nitride layer, is first provided over the entire surface of the entire relief pattern. A different material, susceptible to directional etching, for example, polycrystalline silicon, is used to fill the relief, and is etched back as far as the desired coverage depth of the final vertical oxide. After the etching stop layer is removed from the unfilled sections of the walls, an oxide is deposited or generated using a thermal technique in the uncovered regions. Next, the oxide is anisotropically etched which removes the deposited oxide from horizontal. This is followed by removal of the filler material and, then, the removal of the etching stop layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In light of the complicated existing processes there is an ongoing need to provide semiconductor device architectures that include patterned vertical or inclined device surfaces. There also is an ongoing need to provide simple manufacturing techniques capable of processing small device features of semiconductor devices without requiring high resolution alignments and small gap printing for vertical TFTs. There also is an ongoing need to provide higher current semiconductor devices by improving the series resistance of the device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">To maintain acceptable device performance when shrinking the size of the channel, it is typical to scale the layer thicknesses with the size of the device. For example, in conventional production CMOS with channel lengths of 90 nm and lower often utilize dielectric layer thicknesses of less than 10 nm. While there are many processes to deposit dielectric materials, few result in high quality films at these thicknesses. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a process that is both conformal and known to result in high quality thin layers when used with optimized process conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">In ALD processes, typically two molecular precursors are introduced into the ALD reactor in separate stages. U.S. Patent Application Publication 2005/0084610 (Selitser) describes an atmospheric pressure atomic layer chemical vapor deposition process that involve separate chambers for each stage of the process and a series of separated injectors are spaced around a rotating circular substrate holder track. A spatially dependent ALD process can be accomplished using one or more of the systems or methods described in more detail in WO 2008/082472 (Cok), U.S. Patent Application Publications 2008/0166880 (Levy), 2009/0130858 (Levy), 2009/0078204 (Kerr et al.), 2009/0051749 (Baker), 2009/0081366 (Kerr et al.), and U.S. Pat. No. 7,413,982 (Levy), U.S. Pat. No. 7,456,429 (Levy), and U.S. Pat. No. 7,789,961 (Nelson et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 7,572,686 (Levy et al.), the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">There is growing interest in combining ALD with a technology known as selective area deposition (SAD). As the name implies, selective area deposition involves treating portion(s) of a substrate such that a material is deposited only in those areas that are desired, or selected. Sinha et al. (J. Vac. Sci. Technol. B 24 6 2523-2532 (2006)), have remarked that selective area ALD requires that designated areas of a surface be masked or “protected” to prevent ALD reactions in those selected areas, thus ensuring that the ALD film nucleates and grows only on the desired unmasked regions. It is also possible to have SAD processes where the selected areas of the surface area are “activated” or surface modified in such a way that the film is deposited only on the activated areas. There are many potential advantages to selective area deposition techniques, such as eliminating an etch process for film patterning, reduction in the number of cleaning steps required, or patterning of materials which are difficult to etch. One approach to combining patterning and depositing a semiconductor is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 7,160,819 entitled “METHOD TO PERFORM SELECTIVE ATOMIC LAYER DEPOSITION OF ZINC OXIDE” by Conley et al. Conley et al. discuss materials for use in patterning zinc oxide on silicon wafers. No information is provided, however, on the use of other substrates or results for other metal oxides.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">SAD work to date has focused on the problem of patterning a single material during deposition. There persists a problem of combining multiple SAD steps to form working devices. Processes for building complete devices need to be able to control the properties of the critical interfaces, particularly in field effect devices like TFTs. As such, there remains a need for novel processes to simplify the manufacture of vertical TFTs. There also is a need for novel processes that use SAD and digital patterning processes to pattern devices, for example, VTFTs, which have critical vertical features.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">According to an aspect of the invention, a vertically separated electrode structure includes a substrate and a polymeric material post on the substrate.

A second electrode is located over the substrate and not over the post and adjacent to the reentrant profile such that a distance between the first electrode and second electrode is greater than zero when measured orthogonally to the substrate surface. The first electrode and second electrode have the same material composition and layer thickness.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">The present description will be directed in particular to elements forming part of, or cooperating directly with, vertical transistors in accordance with the present invention. It is to be understood that elements not specifically shown or described may take various forms well known to those skilled in the art. In the following description and drawings, identical reference numerals have been used, where possible, to designate identical elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">For the description that follows, the term “gas” or “gaseous material” is used in a broad sense to encompass any of a range of vaporized or gaseous elements, compounds, or materials. Other terms used herein including “reactant,” “precursor,” “vacuum,” or “inert gas” have their conventional meanings as would be well understood by those skilled in the materials deposition art. The term “over” refers to the relative position of an element to another and is insensitive to orientation, such that if one element is over another, it is still functionally over if the entire stack is flipped upside down. As such, the terms “over,” “under,” or “on” are functionally equivalent and do not require the elements to be in contact, and do not prohibit the existence of intervening layers within a structure. The term “adjacent” is used herein in a broad sense to mean an element next to or adjoining another element. The figures provided are not drawn to scale but are intended to show overall function and the structural arrangement of some embodiments of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">The embodiments of the present invention all relate to short channel vertical thin film transistors (TFTs) which include a patterned structural polymer with an inorganic cap to define the vertical portion of the channel. The term “vertical transistor” as used herein refers to transistors where the source and drain which define a single channel are at two different distances from the substrate surface (as measured orthogonal to the substrate). This arrangement results in vertical transistors where at least a portion of the channel is vertically oriented with respect to the substrate, which is to say not parallel to the top surface of the substrate. Vertical transistors of the present invention include those with portions of their channels in an arrangement that is parallel to the substrate surface, as long as they also have a portion which is not parallel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">The phrase “structural polymer” as used herein refers to the polymeric material used in the formation of the polymer post and additionally useful to distinguish the structural polymer material from other polymeric materials or polymer layers that can be used in the process. The structural polymer is a polymer that is stable in the final application, and a wide variety of structural polymers can be used. Examples of structural polymers include polyesters, polyetheresters, polyamides, polyesteramides, polyurethanes, polyimides, polyetherimides, polyureas, polyamideimides, polyphenyleneoxides, phenoxy resins, epoxy resins, polyolefins, polyacrylates, polyethylene-co-vinyl alcohols (EVOH), and the like, or their combinations or blends. The preferred structural polymers are epoxy resins and polyimides. The structural polymer can be a thermoplastic polymer. The polymer can be a curable composition, including either thermal or radiation curable composition. The polymer does not need to be radiation curable or photosensitive, but photosensitive formulations are useful in the present invention so long as the final cured polymer layer has the structural and mechanical properties required in the final application.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">Polyimide is a preferred structural polymer due to the combination of film properties such as low stress, low CTE, low moisture uptake, high modulus or good ductility for microelectronic applications. The rigid rod polyimide structure of Cured PI-2600 products available from Hitachi DuPont MicroSystems, for instance, are well suited for use as a dielectric layer for semiconductor applications. Epoxy resins are also preferred due to their thermal and chemical properties. Radiation curable compositions comprising a highly branched, multifunctional epoxy bisphenol A-novolac resins, such as Epon SU-8 from Momentive Specialty Chemicals Inc. is one example of a useful epoxy resin, although non-radiation curable compositions are more preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">The process of making the vertical thin film transistors of the present invention can be carried out below a support temperature of about 300° C., more preferably below 250° C., or even at temperatures around room temperature (about 25° C. to 70° C.). These temperatures are well below traditional integrated circuit and semiconductor processing temperatures, which enable the use of any of a variety of relatively inexpensive supports, such as flexible polymeric supports. Thus, embodiments of the invention enable production of relatively inexpensive devices on flexible substrates without the need for photolithography and enabling rapid pattern changes due to printing the patterns.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">The substrates used in the present invention can be any material that acts as a mechanical support for the subsequently coated layers. The substrate can include a rigid material such as glass, silicon, or metals. Particularly useful metals are stainless steel, steel, aluminum, nickel, or molybdenum. The substrate can also include a flexible material such as a polymer film or paper. Useful substrate materials include organic or inorganic materials. For example, the substrate can include inorganic glasses, ceramic foils, polymeric materials, filled polymeric materials, coated metallic foils, acrylics, epoxies, polyamides, polycarbonates, polyimides, polyketones, poly(oxy-1,4-phenyleneoxy-1,4-phenylenecarbonyl-1,4-phenylene) (sometimes referred to as poly(ether ether ketone) or PEEK), polynorbomenes, polyphenyleneoxides, poly(ethylene naphthalenedicarboxylate) (PEN), poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), poly(ether sulfone) (PES), poly(phenylene sulfide) (PPS), or fiber-reinforced plastics (FRP). The thickness of substrate <b>110</b> can vary, typically from about 100 μm to about 1 cm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">A flexible support or substrate can be used in the present invention. Using a flexible substrate allows for roll processing, which can be continuous, providing economy of scale and economy of manufacturing over flat or rigid supports. The flexible support chosen is preferably capable of wrapping around the circumference of a cylinder of less than about 50 cm in diameter, more preferably 25 cm in diameter, and most preferably 10 cm in diameter, without distorting or breaking, using low force as by unaided hands. The preferred flexible support can be rolled upon itself. Additional examples of flexible substrates include thin metal foils, for example, stainless steel, provided the foils are coated with an electrically insulating material layer to electrically isolate any electric components such as thin film transistors. Nominally rigid materials that are flexible due to their thinness can also be used. These include glass at thicknesses below 200 μm and metals at thicknesses below 500 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">In some example embodiments, the substrate can include a temporary support or support material layer, for example, when additional structural support is desired for a temporary purpose, e.g., manufacturing, transport, testing, or storage. In these example embodiments, the substrate can be detachably adhered or mechanically affixed to the temporary support. For example, a flexible polymeric support can be temporarily adhered to a rigid glass support to provide added structural rigidity during the transistor manufacturing process. The glass support can be removed from the flexible polymeric support after completion of the manufacturing process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">The substrate can be bare indicating that it contains no substantial materials on its surface other the material from which it is composed. The substrate can include various layers on the surface. These layers include subbing layers, adhesion layers, release layers, wetting layers, hydrophilic layers, and hydrophobic layers. The substrate surface can be treated in order to promote various properties. These treatments include plasma treatments, corona discharge treatments, or chemical treatments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">The substrate can also include on its surface patterned materials. These patterns can include patterns that modulate light transmission or electrical conductivity within or on the substrate. The patterns can include complete devices, circuits, or active elements existing on the substrate. The patterns can include portions of devices, circuits, or active elements awaiting subsequent processing steps for completion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">In the present invention, the formation of the patterned structural polymer layers is accomplished using patterned thin film inorganic materials. The patterning of the thin film inorganic material on top of the structured polymer layer can be done using standard photolithographic techniques or through the use selective area deposition (SAD) in combination with atomic layer deposition (ALD) to form a patterned thin film inorganic material layer on top of the structural polymer layer. SAD employs a patterned material referred to as a “deposition inhibitor material”, “deposition inhibiting material”, or simply an “inhibitor” that inhibits the growth of a thin film material on the substrate when the substrate is subjected to an atomic layer deposition. By inhibiting the growth where the deposition inhibitor material is present, the ALD process only deposits material in regions (selective areas) of the substrate where the inhibitor is not present. The phrases “deposition inhibitor material”, “inhibitor material” and their equivalents refer herein to any material on the substrate that inhibits the deposition of material during atomic layer deposition (ALD). The “deposition inhibitor material” includes the material applied to the substrate as well as the material resulting from any optionally subsequent crosslinking or other reaction that modifies the material that can occur prior to depositing an inorganic thin film on the substrate by atomic layer deposition. A polymeric deposition inhibitor material can be crosslinked after applying the polymer onto the substrate, before or during the pattering step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">The vertical thin film transistors of the present invention are composed of dielectric, semiconductor and conductor materials. In preferred embodiments of the present invention the dielectric, semiconductor and conductor materials are inorganic thin films. A dielectric material is any material that is a poor conductor of electricity. Such materials typically exhibit a bulk resistivity greater than 10<sup>10 </sup>Ω-cm. Examples of dielectrics are SiO2, HfO, ZrO, Si<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>, or Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. A semiconductor is a material in which electrical charges can move but in which the concentration of electrical charges can be substantially modulated by external factors such as electrical fields, temperature, or injection of electrical charges from a neighboring material. Examples of semiconductors include silicon, germanium, or gallium arsenide. Particularly preferred semiconductors are zinc oxide, indium zinc oxide, or gallium indium zinc oxide. The semiconductors can be doped to render them n-type or p-type, or to modulated the number of charge carriers present. Conductors of the present invention include metals, such as Al, Ag, Au, Cr, Mo, or In and inorganic conducting oxides, such as indium doped tin oxide (ITO) or aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">The dielectric and semiconductor inorganic materials layers are conformal, and are preferably deposited using an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process. ALD is a process which is used to produce coatings with thicknesses that can be considered consistent, uniform, or even exact. ALD produces coatings that can be considered conformal or even highly conformal material layers. Generally described, an ALD process accomplishes substrate coating by alternating between two or more reactive materials commonly referred to as precursors, in a vacuum chamber. A first precursor is applied to react with the substrate. The excess of the first precursor is removed from the vacuum chamber. A second precursor is then applied to react with the first precursor on the substrate. The excess of the second precursor is removed from the vacuum chamber and the process is repeated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">Recently, a new ALD process has been developed which negates the need for a vacuum chamber. This process, commonly referred to as S-ALD, is described in at least one of U.S. Pat. No. 7,413,982, U.S. Pat. No. 7,456,429, U.S. Pat. No. 7,789,961, and US 2009/0130858, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein. S-ALD produces coatings with thicknesses that can be considered consistent, uniform, or even exact. S-ALD produces coatings that can be considered conformal or even highly conformal material layers. S-ALD is also compatible with a low temperature coating environment. Additionally, S-ALD is compatible with web coating, making it attractive for large scale production operations. Even though some web coating operations may experience alignment issues, for example, web tracking or stretching issues, the architecture of the present invention reduces reliance on high resolution or very fine alignment features during the manufacturing process. As such, S-ALD is well suited for manufacturing the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">The preferred process of the present invention includes S-ALD, a continuous spatially dependent ALD (as opposed to pulsed or time dependent ALD). The process of the present invention allows operation at atmospheric or near-atmospheric pressures and is capable of operating in an unsealed or open-air environment. The process of the present invention is adapted such that material is deposited only in selected areas of a substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">Atomic layer deposition can be used in embodiments of the present invention to deposit a variety of inorganic thin films that are metals or that include a metal-containing compound.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">These variations are simply variants using particular embodiments of the invention. There are many other variations within the scope of the invention, so the invention is limited only by the claims that follow. The material chosen for the inorganic thin film layer will depend on the application and function of the desired device. All of the materials detailed above will function as a hard mask for patterning the underlying structural polymer layer and are useful as an inorganic cap. Preferred materials for the inorganic thin film cap include Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, SiO<sub>2</sub>, HfO, ZrO, TiO<sub>2</sub>, Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, Si<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>, ZnO, or a doped-ZnO material. The thickness of the inorganic material layer will also depend on the application; however thicknesses between 5 nm and 100 nm are preferred. As such, depositing the inorganic thin film using an atomic layer deposition process preferably deposits less than 100 nm. Inorganic thin film layers greater than 100 nm are also useful, but may take a long time to deposit. These are only used when dictated by the application. For use in inorganic-with-polymer structures where a portion of the inorganic thin film is unsupported, as in the case for structures having a reentrant profile, it is preferred that the inorganic thin film have a sufficient thickness to be self-supporting, preferably greater than 10 nm.</div>

A conformal conductive material gate layer is over the edge of the post in the reentrant profile. A conformal insulating material layer is on the gate layer in the reentrant profile.

A first electrode is located in contact with a first portion of the semiconductor layer over the cap, and a second electrode is located in contact with a second portion of the semiconductor layer over the substrate and not over the post, and adjacent to the reentrant profile. A distance between the first electrode and second electrode is greater than zero when measured orthogonally to the substrate surface, and the first electrode and the second electrode define a transistor having a channel in the semiconductor layer between the first electrode and the second electrode.</div>

These example embodiments demonstrate the benefits of the inventive architectures over planar devices and other vertical transistor architectures composed of similar materials. One process of the present invention for forming a vertical transistor will be briefly described. The process includes providing a substrate. A structural polymer layer is provided on the substrate. A patterned inorganic thin film is formed on the structural polymer layer, leaving exposed portions of the structural polymer layer not under the inorganic thin film. The exposed portions of the structural polymer layer and portions of the structural polymer layer between the patterned inorganic thin film and the substrate are removed to form a structural polymer post having an inorganic cap that extends beyond an edge of the structural polymer post to define a reentrant profile. A conformal conductive gate layer is formed in the reentrant profile. A conformal dielectric layer is formed on the gate layer in the reentrant profile. The conformal semiconductor layer is formed on the dielectric layer.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">A step diagram describing a process of fabricating example vertical transistors of the present invention is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. In Step <b>810</b>, a substrate is provided into the system. The substrate can be any substrate as discussed that is suitable for use with the vertical transistors of the present invention. The provided substrate can have patterned layers. Providing the substrate can include providing a patterned conductive layer on the substrate prior to providing the structural polymer layer in Step <b>820</b>. In Step <b>820</b>, a structural polymer layer is provided on the substrate surface. The structural polymer can be any polymer that is stable in the final vertical transistor structure and should be understood from the previous descriptions. In this step, the structural polymer layer can cover only a portion of the substrate in some example embodiments. In some embodiments the structural polymer is deposited in a polymer layer having a thickness between 0.2 and 2 microns.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">In Step <b>830</b>, a patterned inorganic thin film layer is formed on the structural polymer layer. This step is preferably done using ALD, more preferably using spatial ALD. It is preferred that the inorganic thin film be a dielectric material. Prior to depositing the inorganic thin film in Step <b>830</b>, the surface of the structural polymer layer can be optionally treated (not shown). The treatment can be done to activate the surface of the structural polymer layer to facilitate the growth of the inorganic thin film on the surface of the structural polymer layer. The treatment should be understood from the previous discussion and can include using UV-ozone or plasma processes. The inorganic thin film layer can be patterned as deposited in Step <b>830</b> by using the combination of selective area deposition and ALD. Alternatively, the inorganic thin film layer can be deposited uniformly and patterned using any method known in the art, including using a photolithographic process. The patterned inorganic thin film layer at least includes the pattern of the inorganic thin film cap.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">In Step <b>840</b>, the polymer post having an inorganic material cap is formed by etching the structural polymer layer. Specifically, Step <b>840</b> removes the portions of the structural polymer layer not covered by the patterned inorganic thin film, and portions of the structural polymer layer that are under the inorganic thin film to create a post <b>20</b> with an inorganic cap <b>30</b> that extends beyond the edges of the post. This arrangement of the post and inorganic cap defines a reentrant profile. This step can be done using two different processes, or preferably in a single process. In some embodiments using selective area deposition, the patterned inhibitor layer can be removed prior to the removal of the portions of the structural polymer layer by a liquid process using a solvent or a detergent or by vapor process. In some embodiments using SAD, the patterned inhibitor layer can be removed by the same etching process that removes portions of the structural polymer layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">Processes for etching the structural polymer layer include exposing the substrate to a vapor reactant that causes removal of the structural polymer. The removal can happen spontaneously upon reaction with the vapor, resulting in the conversion of the inhibitor to a volatile species. Alternatively, the vapor exposure can react with the structural polymer converting it to another species or morphology that is then more easily removable with another process, such as a liquid process. The vapor exposure can include forms of energy to promote the process. These include light exposure, arcs or plasmas. Particularly desired light exposures include UV exposure, especially in the presence of oxygen to produce ozone. Plasmas include plasmas of various species including oxygen, chlorine, and fluorine. Plasmas created with these materials or with precursors that produce these materials are included in the present invention. The removal portions of the structural polymer layer can be accomplished by a single exposure to a highly reactive oxygen processes including a UV-ozone process (UVO) or O2 plasma. The highly reactive oxygen processes can be a batch process using a chamber based tool or continuous process using web process tools. The highly reactive oxygen processes can be at sub-atmospheric (vacuum) pressure or atmospheric pressure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">After the post and cap structure has been formed, the substrate, the post, and the cap optionally can be coated with a dielectric material (not shown). In these embodiments, another conformal dielectric layer is deposited on the cap and the edges of the post prior to forming the conformal conductive gate layer.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">A conformal dielectric layer is formed over and in contact with the gate layer in Step <b>860</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">To complete the vertical transistor, the first and second electrodes are simultaneously formed in Step <b>880</b>. In this step, a first electrode is formed over the post and cap and a second electrode is formed which is not over the post.

In this embodiment, the portion of the cap which overhangs the walls of the post cap prevents the metal from depositing on the walls of the post within the reentrant profile. The metal can be further patterned after deposition using standard photolithographic techniques. Alternative line-of-sight deposition techniques include sputtering and reactive sputtering in order to deposit a film of metal, of alloy, or of conductive metal oxide. In other example embodiments, Step <b>880</b> includes using selective area deposition in combination with ALD to simultaneously form the first and second electrodes. In these embodiments, an inhibitor is used to pattern a conductive thin film layer. The inhibitor is present in at least a portion of the reentrant profile defined by the cap and post structure, preventing the conductive thin film from depositing over the walls of the post in the reentrant profile. In some embodiments, where the inhibitor is present only within the reentrant profile, the conductive material is further patterned using standard photolithographic techniques. When using selective area deposition to define the first and second electrodes it is preferred to use ALD, and most preferred to use spatial ALD. It is preferred to use a polymeric inhibitor as the deposition inhibitor material when using selective area deposition process to define the first and second electrodes.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">One of the advantages of the present invention is that all of the functional layers optionally can be patterned using selective area deposition. In a preferred example embodiment, all of the functional layers is patterned by printing a deposition inhibitor. A method of fabricating a vertical thin film transistor by printing can be accomplished by completing the following steps in order. First, a substrate is provided. A structural polymer layer is provided on the substrate, and then a polymeric inhibitor is printed in a cap pattern on the structural polymer layer. An inorganic thin film is deposited on the structural polymer layer in areas where the polymeric inhibitor is absent using an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process to form a patterned inorganic layer having the cap pattern. Next, the polymeric inhibitor, portions of the structural polymer layer between the polymeric inhibitor and the substrate, and portions of the structural polymer layer between the patterned inorganic layer and the substrate are removed to form a structural polymer post having an inorganic cap that extends beyond an edge of the structural polymer post to define a reentrant profile. A polymeric inhibitor is printed in a gate pattern on the substrate, and a first conductive thin film is deposited on the substrate in areas where the polymeric inhibitor is absent using an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process to form a patterned conformal conductive gate layer having the gate pattern including in the reentrant profile, and then the polymeric inhibitor is removed. Next, a polymeric inhibitor is printed in a dielectric pattern on the substrate, a dielectric thin film is deposited on the substrate in areas where the polymeric inhibitor is absent using an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process to form a patterned conformal dielectric layer having the dielectric pattern on the gate layer, and then the polymeric inhibitor is removed. Next, a polymeric inhibitor is printed in a semiconductor pattern on the patterned conformal dielectric layer, a semiconductor thin film is deposited on the substrate in areas where the polymeric inhibitor is absent using an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process to form a patterned conformal semiconductor layer having the semiconductor pattern on the patterned conformal dielectric layer, and then the polymeric inhibitor is removed. A polymeric inhibitor then is printed in an electrode pattern, the electrode pattern having an open area over a portion of the reentrant profile allowing the polymeric inhibitor to wick along the reentrant profile in the open area. A second conductive thin film is deposited using an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process in areas where the printed and wicked polymeric inhibitor is absent to form a first electrode in contact with a first portion of the semiconductor layer located over the cap and a second electrode in contact with a second portion of the semiconductor layer over the substrate adjacent to the edge of the structural polymer post in the reentrant profile and not over the post. This process is preferably accomplished using a spatial atomic layer deposition process, and preferably using an atmospheric pressure atomic layer deposition process. By using an atmospheric pressure atomic layer deposition process to deposit the layers, a printing process to define the pattern, and a coating process to provide the structural polymer, vertical transistors of the present invention can be formed without the use of vacuum processing steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">A step diagram for a process using a printed deposition inhibitor to form the vertical transistors of the present invention is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, Step <b>810</b> and Step <b>820</b> are the same as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Namely, in Step <b>810</b> a substrate is provided into the system followed by providing a structural polymer layer on the substrate surface in Step <b>820</b>. The provided substrate can have patterned layers. Providing the substrate can include providing a patterned conductive layer on the substrate prior to providing the structural polymer layer in Step <b>820</b>. In one example embodiment, the patterned conductive layer can be formed using the same printing and ALD process as is used to form the other layers of the vertical transistor. This can be done by printing a polymeric inhibitor in a pattern that overlaps the gate pattern on the substrate, depositing a third conductive thin film on the substrate in areas where the polymeric inhibitor is absent using an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process to form the patterned conductive layer on the substrate, and removing the polymeric inhibitor prior to depositing the structural polymer layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">Next, a patterned polymeric inhibitor layer is printed in a cap pattern on the structural polymer layer in Step <b>832</b>. Printing methods include, but are not limited to, inkjet, gravure, microcontact, or flexography. The polymeric inhibitor layer is preferably printed as an ink that is dried to form the polymeric inhibitor layer. A preferred polymeric inhibitor is polyvinyl pyrrolidone. The patterned polymeric inhibitor layer contains open areas where the inhibitor is absent; the cap pattern is defined by an open area having no polymeric inhibitor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">In Step <b>834</b>, an inorganic thin film is deposited using an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process in areas where the polymeric inhibitor is absent. In this step, the open areas which define the cap pattern are coated with the inorganic thin film, while the areas covered by the polymeric inhibitor receive little or no deposition. This step is preferably completed using spatial ALD. It is preferred that the inorganic thin film be a dielectric material. Prior to depositing the inorganic thin film in Step <b>834</b>, the surface of the structural polymer layer can be optionally treated (not shown). The treatment is used to activate the surface of the polymer to facilitate inorganic thin film growth using an atomic layer deposition process, and is preferably done before printing the polymeric inhibitor. Treatment processes should be understood from the previous discussion and can include using UV-ozone or plasma processes. The presence of the polymeric inhibitor causes the inorganic thin film layer to be deposited in a patterned manner, forming a patterned inorganic layer having the cap pattern during deposition Step <b>834</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">In Step <b>842</b>, the polymer post having an inorganic material cap is formed. Specifically, Step <b>842</b> forms the polymeric material post having the inorganic material cap by removing the polymeric inhibitor, portions of the structural polymer layer between the polymeric inhibitor and the substrate, and portions of the structural polymer layer between the patterned inorganic layer and the substrate to form a structural polymer post having an inorganic cap that extends beyond an edge of the structural polymer post to define a reentrant profile. In some embodiments, the cap extends beyond another edge of the post forming another reentrant profile opposite the reentrant profile. The step of removing the structural polymer preferably removes the polymeric inhibitor and the structural polymer using a single process. Since both materials are polymeric, common etching processes can be used, including exposing the substrate to a vapor reactant that causes removal of the polymer layers. This removal can happen spontaneously upon reaction with the vapor, resulting in the conversion of the inhibitor to a volatile species. Alternatively, the vapor exposure can react with the polymers converting to another species or morphology that is then more easily removable with another process, such as a liquid process. The vapor exposure can include forms of energy to promote the process. These include light exposure, or arcs, or plasmas. Plasmas include plasmas of various species including oxygen, chlorine, or fluorine. Plasmas created with these materials or with precursors that produce these materials are included in the present invention. The removal of portions of the polymeric inhibitor and the structural polymer layer can be accomplished by a single exposure to highly reactive oxygen processes including a UV-ozone process (UVO) or O2 plasma. The highly reactive oxygen processes can be a batch process using a chamber based tool or continuous process using web process tools. The highly reactive oxygen processes can be at sub-atmospheric (vacuum) pressure or atmospheric pressure.</div>

The open areas of the gate pattern are coated with the first conductive thin film, while the areas covered by the polymeric inhibitor receive little or no deposition. The presence of the polymeric inhibitor causes the first conductive thin film layer to be deposited in a patterned manner, and forms a patterned conformal conductive gate layer having the gate pattern, including in the reentrant profile during deposition Step <b>853</b>.

Preferably the dielectric layer is an inorganic thin film dielectric layer. Typically, the dielectric pattern additionally contains areas having the polymer inhibitor over the gate layer not within the reentrant profile to provide vias to the gate layer for making contact in future processing steps.

Since the open areas of the semiconductor pattern are over the post, cap, gate layer, and dielectric layer within the reentrant profile, the area is free of polymeric inhibitor and is conformally coated with the semiconductor thin film during the ALD process. Preferably, the semiconductor layer is an inorganic semiconductor thin film layer, for instance ZnO or doped ZnO. The semiconductor layer is in contact with the dielectric layer at least over a portion of the edge of the post in the reentrant profile having the patterned gate layer. After deposition of the semiconductor thin film, the polymeric inhibitor can be removed, if necessary, as shown in Step <b>875</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">To complete the vertical transistor, the source and drain electrodes are deposited simultaneously. To accomplish this via a printing process, a deposition inhibiting material is formulated into an inhibitor ink for printing which will wick into the reentrant profile due to capillary action. The first and second electrodes of the vertical transistor of the present invention are formed as described in Steps <b>882</b> and <b>884</b>. In Step <b>882</b>, a polymeric inhibitor is printed in an electrode pattern. The electrode pattern includes open areas where the conductive thin film layer will be deposited. The open area of the electrode pattern is over a portion of the reentrant profile, allowing the polymeric inhibitor to wick along the reentrant profile in the open area. The open area of the electrode pattern is over a portion of the post, cap, gate, and dielectric layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">A patterned polymeric inhibitor is printed such that the inhibitor wicks along the reentrant profile as shown in Step <b>882</b>. The inhibitor ink has a surface tension and a viscosity associated with it. The inhibitor ink is deposited in a patterned way, adjacent to the reentrant profiles of the electrically conductive gate structure such that the inhibitor ink is drawn into the reentrant profiles by capillary action, also known as wicking. Printing methods include, but are not limited to, inkjet, gravure, microcontact, or flexography. The uniformity of thickness of the inhibitor layer is not critical.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">The distance that a liquid is moved by capillary action depends on multiple factors, including the chemical nature and wetting properties of the substrate surface, the surface tension and viscosity of the moving liquid, and the drying rate of the liquid. Conditions and patterns are chosen in Step <b>882</b> such that the inhibitor ink fills the reentrant profiles of the electrically conductive gate structure over a distance sufficient to separate the second electrode from the first electrode and define the width of the channel of the vertical transistor. The electrode pattern preferably has portions where the polymeric inhibitor is printed over the post and cap. In a preferred example embodiment, the electrode pattern chosen consists of an open area sized to be the desired width of the channel, which can be centered over the electrically conductive gate structure (post, cap and gate layer). The polymeric inhibitor ink from the edges of the open area of the electrode wick into the reentrant profile from each side and meet in the center region to fill the reentrant profile that lies within the open area of the pattern. The ink is then dried to leave deposition inhibitor in the reentrant profile.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">Next, a second conductive thin film is deposited using ALD in Step <b>884</b>. The polymeric inhibitor that wicked into the reentrant profile within the open area of the electrode pattern prevents deposition within the reentrant profile but allows deposition in the other portions of the open area which are free of polymeric inhibitor. The open areas which are free of polymeric inhibitor of the electrode pattern are coated with the conductive thin film (areas where the printed and wicked polymeric inhibitor is absent), while the areas covered by the polymeric inhibitor receive little or no deposition. The presence of the polymeric inhibitor causes the conductive thin film to be deposited in a patterned manner, and forms a first electrode in contact with a first portion of the semiconductor layer located over the cap and a second electrode in contact with a second portion of the semiconductor layer over the substrate adjacent to the edge of the structural polymer post in the reentrant profile and not over the post.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0150">To further aid in understanding how the filler material can be integrated into a full vertical transistor, the steps for forming the insulating layer <b>150</b> are shown.

The dielectric pattern includes open areas where the dielectric layer will be deposited. The open areas of the dielectric pattern are at least over a portion of the post and cap, over the gate layer. Next, a dielectric thin film is deposited using ALD as described in Step <b>863</b>. The open areas of the dielectric pattern are coated with the dielectric thin film, while the areas covered by the polymeric inhibitor receive little or no deposition. The presence of the polymeric inhibitor causes the dielectric thin film to be deposited in a patterned manner, and forms a patterned conformal dielectric layer having the dielectric pattern on the gate layer. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 62</figref> <i>a </i>and <b>62</b> <i>b</i>, the dielectric layer <b>150</b> also serves to encapsulate the filler material, covering the second reentrant profile so that, when forming the first electrode in later steps, it is easier to ensure that the first electrode can extend beyond the second reentrant profile <b>145</b> without being broken.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0152" num="0151">The remainder of the steps for forming a vertical transistor using the process of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref> can be understood from previous descriptions of the process of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>. In some embodiments, the first electrode <b>182</b> is formed to extend beyond the second reentrant profile. The extension of the first electrode allows for contact to be made to both the source and drain of the transistor at the level of the substrate. Alternative embodiments of the present invention include depositing the filler material <b>65</b> in the first reentrant profile prior to depositing the conformal conductive gate material layer <b>125</b>.

Using filler material <b>65</b> to form the single vertical transistor with a polymeric post <b>20</b> and cap <b>30</b> prevents the deposition inhibitor from wicking into the filled reentrant profile, allowing the formation of an electrode that spans the cap and connects down to the level of substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0153" num="0152">The post and cap structure also can be used to form two independent transistors over a common post and cap.

Using the post and cap structure to form two independent transistors has an advantage in circuit design and layout. Generally described, a device of the present invention including two independently operable vertical transistors includes a substrate and a polymeric material post on the substrate. The post has a height dimension extending away from the substrate to a top, the post having a first edge and a second edge located opposite the first edge along the height dimension. An inorganic material cap is on the top of the post, the cap covering the top of the post, the cap extending beyond the first edge to define a first reentrant profile and extending beyond the second edge to define a second reentrant profile. A conformal conductive gate layer has two portions. A first portion of the conformal conductive gate layer defining a first gate is located in at least the first reentrant profile. A second portion of the conformal conductive gate layer defines a second gate that is electrically independent from the first gate and is located in at least the second reentrant profile.

As previously discussed, the conductive layer <b>122</b> is patterned to be discontinuous, so that there is no connection under the post <b>20</b>, and so that the conductive layer has a first and second portion associated with the first and second gates. In this structure, the gates remain separate, and each transistor <b>113</b> and <b>213</b> can be independently operated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0158" num="0157">The use of polymeric post <b>20</b> and cap <b>30</b> enables the formation of novel vertical transistor from novel processes. The post <b>20</b> and cap <b>30</b> also more generally provide a structure which allows for the formation of electrodes that are vertically separated due to the height of the post <b>20</b>. According to an aspect of the invention, a vertically separated electrode structure includes a substrate and a polymeric material post on the substrate. The post has a height dimension extending away from the substrate to a top defined by a length dimension and a width dimension over the substrate, and edges along the height dimension. An inorganic material cap is on the top of the post, the cap covering the top of the post in the length dimension and the width dimension of the post, the cap extending beyond the edges of the post in at least the width dimension to define a first reentrant profile. A first electrode is located over the cap. A second electrode is located over the substrate and not over the post and adjacent to the reentrant profile such that a distance between the first electrode and second electrode is greater than zero when measured orthogonally to the substrate surface. The first electrode and second electrode have the same material composition and layer thickness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0158">As discussed previously, the simultaneous formation of the source and drain electrodes of the vertical transistors of the present invention is one use of the formation of vertically separated electrodes. This helps to reduce the number of steps involved in manufacturing vertical transistors. In other applications, it can be desirable to form conductive coatings with a minimum of separation in the x-y plane. Using the post <b>20</b> and cap <b>30</b> to vertically separate electrodes, allows for them to be in close proximity in a plane parallel to the plane of the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0159">A process flow for forming the two vertically spaced electrodes is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</figref>. The first four steps are the same as those steps described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. In Step <b>810</b>, a substrate is provided into the system followed by providing a structural polymer layer on the substrate surface in Step <b>820</b>. Next, a patterned inorganic thin film is formed on the structural polymer layer in Step <b>830</b>, followed by the formation of a post and cap structure by etching the structural polymer layer in Step <b>840</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</figref>, the Step <b>888</b> is functionally equivalent to Step <b>880</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. In Step <b>888</b>, a first electrode is formed over the cap simultaneously with a second electrode being formed not over the post. This can be accomplished by using a line-of-sight deposition process such as a metal evaporation process. In this embodiment, the portion of the cap which overhangs the walls of the post cap prevents the metal from depositing within the reentrant profile. The metal can be further patterned after deposition using standard photolithographic techniques. Alternative line-of-sight deposition techniques include sputtering and reactive sputtering in order to deposit metals, alloys or conductive metal oxides. In other example embodiments, Step <b>888</b> includes using selective area deposition in combination with ALD to simultaneously form the first and second electrodes. In these embodiments, an inhibitor is used to pattern a conductive thin film layer. The inhibitor is present in at least the reentrant profile defined by the cap and post structure, preventing the conductive thin film from depositing in the reentrant profile and specifically over the walls of the post. In some embodiments, where the inhibitor is present only within the reentrant profile, the conductive material is further patterned using standard photolithographic techniques. When using selective area deposition to define the first and second electrodes it is preferred to use ALD, and most preferred to use spatial ALD. The formation of the first and second electrodes defines the channel of the vertical transistor which includes the portion of the semiconductor over the wall of the post. Additionally, in all embodiments the simultaneous formation of the first and second electrodes results in a structure where the first electrode is located in contact with a first portion of the semiconductor layer over the cap and the second electrode located in contact with a second portion of the semiconductor layer over the substrate and not over the post. As such, the first and second electrodes are different distances from the substrate surface and the distance between the first and second electrodes is greater than zero when measured orthogonal to the substrate surface.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0175" num="0179">This describes the preparation of a thin film coating of the material layers on glass substrates as used in the examples. The ALD coating device used to prepare these layers, namely Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, ZnO:N, and Al-doped ZnO (AZO), has been described in detail in US Patent Application Publication No. US 2009/0130858, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The coating device has an output face (facing up) that contains spatially separated elongated gas channels and operates on a gas bearing principle. The coating device can be understood with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 66 and 67</figref>. Each gas channel is composed of an output slot <b>95</b>, <b>93</b>, <b>92</b> which supplies gas to the output face <b>905</b>, and adjacent exhaust slots <b>910</b> which remove gas from the output face <b>905</b>. The order of the gas channels is P-O-P-M-P-O-P-M-P-O-P where P represents a purge channel, O represents a channel containing an oxygen based precursor, and M represents a channel containing a metal based precursor. As a substrate moves relative to the coating head it sees the above sequence of gases which effects ALD deposition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0176" num="0180">A 2.5×2.5 inch square (62.5 mm square) glass substrate attached to a heated backer is positioned on the output face of the coating device and is maintained in close proximity to the output face by an equilibrium between the flow of the gases supplied to the output face and a slight amount of vacuum produced at the exhaust slot. For all of the examples, the exhaust slot pressure was approximately 40 inches of water below atmospheric pressure. The purge gas P is composed of pure nitrogen. The oxygen reactive precursor O is a mixture of nitrogen, water vapor, and optionally ammonia vapor. The metal reactive precursor M is one or a mixture of active metal alkyls vapor in nitrogen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0177" num="0181">The metal alkyl precursors used in these examples were dimethylaluminum isopropoxide (DMAI) and diethyl zinc (DEZ). The flow rate of the active metal alkyl vapor was controlled by bubbling nitrogen through the pure liquid precursor contained in an airtight bubbler by means of individual mass flow control meters. This saturated stream of metal alkyl was mixed with a dilution flow before being supplied to the coating device. The flow of water vapor was controlled by adjusting the bubbling rate of nitrogen passed through pure water in a bubbler. This saturated stream of water vapor was mixed with a dilution flow before being supplied to the coating device. The flow of ammonia vapor was controlled by passing pure ammonia vapor from a compressed fluid tank through a mass flow controller and mixing with the water vapor stream. All bubblers were held at room temperature. The temperature of the coating was established by controlling heating both the coating device and the backer to a desired temperature. Experimentally, the flow rates of the individual gasses were adjusted to the settings shown in Table 1 for each of the material layers coated in the examples contained herein. The flows shown are the total flows supplied to the coating device, and thus are partitioned equally among the individual gas channels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0178" num="0182">The coating process was then initiated by oscillating the coating head across the substrate for the number of cycles necessary to obtain a uniform deposited film of the desired thickness for the given example. Due to the fact that the coating head as described above contains two full ALD cycles (two oxygen and two metal exposures per single direction pass over the head), a round trip oscillation represents 4 ALD cycles. In all of the experimental examples, the growth temperature used was 200° C.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0180" num="0184">The vertical transistors of the present invention have advantages over planar transistor formed using the same materials and over vertical transistors having metal cores which form the reentrant profile. Generally, the vertical transistors of the present invention have shorter channel lengths than are easily obtainable from the standard processing for planar transistors. In some embodiments, where the entire vertical transistor is formed using printing processes the channel length of the transistor is less than the print resolution (which is unobtainable for a planar transistor whose channel is defined by printing). The vertical transistors of the present invention allow for lower parasitic capacitance than their metal core counterparts, and can be fabricated using simple printing processes. The following Examples serve to illustrate the advantages of various embodiments of the present invention and present process.</div>
<heading id="h-0011">Comparative Example C1</heading>
<heading id="h-0012">Patterned-by-Printing Planar Transistor</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0181" num="0185">Planar Bottom gate thin film transistors were fabricated using the processes described in commonly assigned pending U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 13/600,266 and 13/600,264, filed Aug. 31, 2012, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety, to be used as a control for the vertical printed transistors of the present invention. To fabricate Comparative Example C1, a glass substrate was provided and cleaned using an O2 plasma process. Then the gate was provided using the combination of selective area deposition (SAD) and ALD, by first printing a deposition inhibitor material and then using the Atmospheric ALD system described above to coat AZO, thereby providing a gate having 1000 A of AZO. The printed deposition inhibiting material layer was applied using a Fuji Dimatix 2500 piezo-inkjet printer, and the inhibitor ink was a 2 wt % solution of polyvinyl pyrrolidone k-30 (PVP) in diacetone alcohol. The 10 pL cartridge was used with the Dimatix printer, and the print drop spacing was set to be 70 microns. The inhibitor was removed to complete the gate layer using a 2 minute O<sub>2 </sub>plasma treatment to remove the inhibitor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0182" num="0186">Next, 750 Å of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>was deposited as the dielectric layer in two layers. Experimentally, the inhibitor dielectric pattern was printed, and 500 Å of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>was deposited at 200° C., using the conditions listed for Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>in Table 1 and 1164 ALD cycles each with a 100 ms residence time on the Atmospheric ALD equipment described above. Next the sample was subjected to a 2 minute O<sub>2 </sub>plasma treatment to remove the inhibitor and clean the interface between the two layers of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Next, the semiconductor inhibitor pattern was printed and 250 Å of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>was deposited at 200° C., using the conditions listed for Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>in Table 1 and 582 ALD cycles each with a 100 ms residence time on the Atmospheric ALD equipment described above. The sample was removed from the Atmospheric ALD equipment to facilitate the switch to ZnO deposition. The sample was then reloaded into the equipment without any surface modification and 300 Å of N-doped ZnO was deposited at 200° C., using the conditions listed for ZnO:N in Table 1 and 30 ALD cycles each with a 50 ms residence time. The inhibitor was removed to complete the semiconductor layer using a 2 minute O<sub>2 </sub>plasma treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0183" num="0187">The source and drain were formed by selectively depositing 1000 Å of AZO using a printed pattern of PVP inhibitor to define the electrode pattern. 1000 Å of AZO was deposited at 200° C., using the conditions listed for AZO in Table 1. After depositing the AZO, comparative Example C1 was complete and testing was completed without removing the deposition inhibitor material. The pattern used in the formation of C1 contained 133 individual transistors; each transistor as fabricated had a characteristic channel width and length of 70 microns and 400 microns respectively. The channel length was defined by a single row of printed drops, and represents the minimum feature size obtainable with the print system as used in these Examples. Electrical testing of the transistors was accomplished by using a probe station to contact the AZO gate and source/drain. The transistors were swept in the linear regime, with the drain being held constant at 0.2 V (Vd=0.2), and the gate voltage was swept from −10 V to 20 V. The mobility (Mob.), threshold voltage (Vth), on-off ratio of the drain current (Ion/Ioff), the average gate leakage current at the maximum gate voltage applied (Ig(vgmax)), Comparative Example C1 and reported in Tables 2 below.</div>

<heading id="h-0015">Four pixel with Printed VTFT</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0185" num="0189">To fabricate Inventive Example I1, a glass substrate was provided and cleaned using an O<sub>2 </sub>plasma (100 W 0.3 Torr for 1 minute). Next, a 40 wt % solution of SU-8 2010 in cyclopentanone was spun for 10 sec at 500 rpm and ramped to a final spin of 30 sec at 2000 rpm. This coating was cured using a recipe consisting of a two minute pre-exposure hot plate bake at 95° C., 90 second blanket exposure, a two minute post-exposure hot plate bake at 95° C. and final hard bake at 225° C. for 5 minutes resulting in a 7500 Å film of cured SU-8.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0186" num="0190">Next, the surface of the SU-8 was treated with a 30 second O<sub>2 </sub>plasma to activate the surface of the SU-8. The inorganic cap was formed over the SU-8 layer using the combination of SAD and ALD. Selective area deposition was done using a patterned deposition inhibiting material layer using a Fuji Dimatix 2500 piezo-inkjet printer, as described in reference to Comparative Example C1 at the same 70 micron dot spacing. The inhibitor ink was the same PVP ink used C1. The PVP ink was printed in a pattern such that the open area defined the pattern of the inorganic cap. Next, 1000 Å of AZO was deposited using the S-ALD system described above and the conditions in Table 1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0187" num="0191">After forming the patterned inorganic thin film layer (AZO) for the cap, the post was formed using a 300 W 0.4 Torr O<sub>2 </sub>plasma for 6 minutes, resulting in a cap <b>30</b> and post <b>20</b> structure with a reentrant profile <b>140</b> (as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37</figref> <i>a </i>and <b>37</b> <i>b</i>). The O<sub>2 </sub>plasma removed the PVP inhibitor and etched the SU-8 in the same process step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0188" num="0192">Next, the conductive gate layer was provided as in Steps <b>852</b>, <b>853</b> and <b>855</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38</figref> <i>a </i>and <b>38</b> <i>b </i>through <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40</figref> <i>a </i>and <i>b</i>, using the combination of SAD and ALD, providing a gate <b>120</b> having 1000 A of AZO within the reentrant profile. This was done by printing the PVP ink in the gate layer pattern, and depositing 1000 Å of AZO was deposited using the S-ALD system described above and the conditions in Table 1. The PVP was then removed using a 2 minute low power O2 plasma (100 W 0.3 Torr) to complete the gate layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0189" num="0193">The combination of SAD and ALD was also used to pattern the insulating layer <b>150</b>, thereby forming a portion of thin film dielectric layer by selectively depositing an inorganic dielectric material the regions of the substrate where the first deposition inhibiting material layer is not present using an atomic layer deposition process. The insulating layer <b>130</b> covers the gate layer <b>125</b> at least in the reentrant profile <b>140</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref> <i>a</i>. Inventive Example I1 had the PVP ink printed on the substrate as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42</figref> <i>a </i>and <b>42</b> <i>b</i>, and then 250 A of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>was deposited at 200° C., using the conditions listed for Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>(DMAI and H2O as the precursors) in Table 1. To complete the pattern, the PVP ink was removed using a low power oxygen plasma.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0190" num="0194">In Example I1, a buffer layer was deposited via selective area deposition (as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref> <i>c</i>). The buffer layer forms another portion of the thin film dielectric layer <b>130</b>. In this step, the pattern of the semiconductor layer was printed as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 44</figref> <i>a </i>and <b>44</b> <i>b</i>, and 250 Å of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>was deposited at 200° C. as above. This step have been found to be important for TFTs that are formed by the combination of SAD and ALD, since special care should be taken to insure that when changing between the dielectric pattern and the semiconductor pattern that the interface is not disturbed by the removal of the deposition inhibiting material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0191" num="0195">To this end, the semiconductor layer <b>150</b> was deposited using the same pattern shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 44</figref> <i>a </i>and <b>44</b> <i>b</i>, after depositing the aluminum oxide, but without any intervening process steps. In the present Example I1, nitrogen doped zinc oxide (ZnO:N) was deposited as the semiconductor layer <b>150</b> at 200° C., using the conditions listed for ZnO:N in Table 1. The patterned semiconductor layer <b>150</b> has the same pattern as the buffer layer <b>155</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0192" num="0196">Next, the drain and source electrodes were formed by using selective area deposition of a conductive inorganic material using an atomic layer deposition process. This was done by printing a patterned polymeric inhibitor such that the inhibitor wicks along the reentrant profile in the length dimension of the post. In Example I1, there the open area <b>80</b> in the inhibitor pattern as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref> <i>a </i>was designed to be 4 pixels wide in the area of the reentrant profile. The same PVP ink and Dimatix printer was used in this step as was used in the previous patterning steps, such that 4 pixels is the equivalent distance of 280 microns. The inhibitor wicks, or moves by capillary action, along the reentrant profile from each edge of the open pattern <b>80</b>. In order to have a functional VTFT, the inhibitor ink must meet up such that the reentrant profile is completely protected along the width of the transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0193" num="0197">After printing the inhibitor pattern containing the open area <b>80</b>, 1000 Å of AZO was deposited using the 1000 Å of AZO was deposited at 200° C., using the conditions listed for AZO in Table 1 as the drain/source (<b>180</b>, <b>170</b>). The wicked inhibitor prohibited the growth of AZO within the reentrant profile to form separate electrodes via selective area deposition. The VTFT of Inventive Example 1 was complete after the deposition of the AZO, and testing was completed without removing the deposition inhibitor material.</div>

Inventive Example I5 used a 33.5% solution of SU-8 in cyclopentanone, resulting in a cured polymer film thickness of 6000 Å. Instead of forming the inorganic cap from 1000 Å of AZO, Inventive Example I5 deposited 250 Å of aluminum oxide from DMAI and H<sub>2</sub>O using the conditions found in Table 1. After forming the reentrant profile, a 250 Å thick film of aluminum oxide was deposited over the entire substrate.

The transistors were swept in the linear and saturation regime, with the drain being held constant at 0.2 V or 8V (Vd=0.2, Vd=8) respectively, and the gate voltage was swept from −2 V to 8 V. The mobility (Mob.), threshold voltage (Vth), on-off ratio of the drain current (Ion/Ioff), the average gate leakage current at the maximum gate voltage applied (Ig(Vgmax)) were evaluated for the Examples below and reported in Tables 2.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0205" num="0209"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71</figref> illustrates the impact on the different patterns used to form Inventive Examples I1 through I7. As shown, the wider the opening in the inhibitor pattern used to define the transistor width, the shorter the channel length. This relationship is due to the complex space of filling the capillary via wicking, the ink wetting the substrate surface out of the capillary, and the ink drying causing a change in rheology (primarily viscosity) during the filling process. On the y-axis, the value is twice that of the channel length a single transistor defined by a single reentrant profile. As can be seen, at all channel widths tested the channel length is less that the feature size obtainable by simply printing the ink on a flat surface—for the narrowest width transistors the channel length for a single VTF is less than 60 microns and for the widest transistors the channel length is on the order of a few microns, far smaller than the 70 microns dot size of the print system. For reference, values for inventive embodiments like I1-I4 are shown, having comparable post height to I5 through I7.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0206" num="0210">While the individual transistors of the previous Inventive Examples can be probed, it is most convenient to probe the electrodes at the substrate level, rather than over the cap. To that end, Inventive Examples I8 through I11 were fabricated such that only a single vertical transistor was formed over the polymeric post and cap structure.</div>

Next, a dilute solution of SU-8 was spun on to be the filler material. In Inventive Example I10, a 10% solution of SU-8 2010 in cyclopentanone was coated and cured using the same conditions as for the SU-8 structural polymer layer. After curing the SU-8 layer, it was patterned by printing an inhibitor pattern with openings over the reentrant profile contacting the filler material.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0211" num="0215">Inventive Example I12 is an example of forming the vertical transistors of the present invention having a polymer post and inorganic cap using a photolithographic process. First a clean glass substrate was coated with 100 nm of Cr via evaporation, and patterned using photolithography with <b>1813</b> as the resist layer and a Cr etchant. The resist was then stripped and the sample was cleaned using a 1 minute, 100 W 0.3 Torr oxygen plasma. Next the SU-8 structural polymer layer was coated and cured as in Inventive Example I8. Next, 500 Å of Al2O3 was deposited using the conditions for TMA and H2O listed in Table 1, and 464 cycles at 50 ms residence time. The aluminum oxide layer was patterned using <b>1813</b> resist. The resist was exposed through a low resolution mask to leave a large unexposed patch of resist over a portion of the Cr pattern where the post will be formed. Then the sample was exposed through the back side where the Cr pattern on the glass substrate masked the exposure to form an aligned pattern of photoresist over the Cr line on the top of the SU-8 layer, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31</figref> <i>a </i>and <b>31</b> <i>b</i>. The aluminum oxide was then etched in a 60° C. phosphoric acid bath for 2 minutes to form the patterned aluminum oxide layer of the inorganic cap. After etching, the <b>1813</b> resist was removed using an acetone rinse, followed by a rinse in IPA.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0212" num="0216">The structure of the inorganic cap and polymeric post was completed as in Inventive Example I8, using a 300 W 0.4 Torr O<sub>2 </sub>plasma etch for 6 minutes. Next, 1500 Å of AZO was deposited for the gate layer, and patterned using a self-aligned photo exposure. In this step, PMMA was used as the photo-patternable resist and spin-coated over the entire sample. The sample was then exposed from the top surface so that the AZO gate layer over the inorganic cap protected the PMMA within the reentrant profile from exposure. After exposure, the PMMA was developed in MIBK leaving PMMA only in the reentrant profile. The AZO was then etched for 60 seconds in dilute acetic solution, followed by removal of the PMMA from the reentrant profile using acetone and IPA.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0213" num="0217">Next, the sample was cleaned using a 1 minute oxygen plasma (100 W, 0.3 Torr) prior to depositing the insulating and semiconductor layers; 120 Å of aluminum oxide (TMA and H2O) followed by 120 Å of ZnO:N (DEZ, H2O, NH4) were deposited during one deposition step using the conditions in Table 1 above. Next, the semiconductor layer was patterned using photolithography in which a Cr mask was used in exposing a resist stack of PMMA and <b>1813</b>, after which the <b>1813</b> was developed and the exposed PMMA was removed with an oxygen plasma. The ZnO was etched in a weak acetic acid solution. The aluminum oxide layer was then patterned by spin-coating another layer of <b>1813</b>, and exposing using a Cr mask in order to open vias down to the Cr pattern on the substrate. After developing the <b>1813</b>, the aluminum oxide was etched using a 60° C. phosphoric acid bath.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0214" num="0218">The source and drain electrodes were deposited using a line of sight deposition such that the reentrant profile caused the electrode over the inorganic cap to be separated from the electrode on over the substrate (not over the post). A 500 Å layer of Al was evaporated onto the sample. A double layer of PMMA and <b>1813</b> was spin-coated over the substrate, and patterned using a low resolution Cr mask to expose the <b>1813</b>, after which the <b>1813</b> was developed and the exposed PMMA was removed with an oxygen plasma. The aluminum layer was etched using Dow MF319, the developer solution for resist <b>1813</b>.</div>
