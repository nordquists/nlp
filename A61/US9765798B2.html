<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to German Application No. 102013114037.8 filed Dec. 13, 2013, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to a hydrostatic drive system with a hydrostatic pump which is driven by a drive motor and is connected in a closed circuit with a hydrostatic motor. The hydrostatic motor is in a drive connection with a consumer. The closed circuit is formed by a first hydraulic connection and a second hydraulic connection. A pressure accumulator device can be connected with the two hydraulic connections for the storage of energy and the discharge of energy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Description of Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Hydrostatic drive systems in a closed circuit are used for the drive of a consumer in vehicles such as motor vehicles or public transit vehicles, e.g., buses, preferably for urban mass transit, and for mobile self-propelled machines, in particular industrial trucks, agricultural machines, forestry machines and construction machines, such as, for example, excavators, wheel and telescoping loaders, tractors, combine harvesters, forage harvesters, sugar beet and potato harvesters.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">With a pressure accumulator device (for the storage of energy and the discharge of energy) that can be connected with both hydraulic connections of the closed circuit, a hybrid drive concept and, thus, a hybrid function can be realized in a hydrostatic drive system with a closed circuit. The consumer can be driven in a drive phase with the energy in the pressure accumulator device during a discharge operation of the pressure accumulator device. If the pressure accumulator device is operated in a charging operation during a braking or deceleration phase of the consumer and is charged with hydraulic fluid, energy can be recovered during the braking or deceleration of the consumer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In a hydrostatic drive system in a closed circuit, it should be ensured that during the charging operation of the pressure accumulator device, during which a determined amount of hydraulic fluid is removed from the pressure accumulator device out of the high-pressure-side hydraulic connection of the closed circuit, the corresponding quantity of hydraulic fluid is made up at the low-pressure-side hydraulic connection of the closed circuit. Correspondingly, during discharge operation of the pressure accumulator device, during which a determined quantity of hydraulic fluid is fed from the pressure accumulator device to the high-pressure-side hydraulic connection of the closed circuit, it should be ensured that the corresponding quantity of hydraulic fluid is diverted from the low-pressure-side hydraulic connection of the closed circuit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">To make possible this quantity and volumetric balancing at the low-pressure-side hydraulic connection of the closed circuit during the extraction or the addition of a quantity of hydraulic fluid at the high-pressure-side hydraulic connection by the pressure accumulator device, it is known that the pressure accumulator device can be formed by a high pressure accumulator and a separate low pressure accumulator. DE 10 2007 012 121 A1 describes a generic hydrostatic drive system with a pressure accumulator device that has a high pressure accumulator and a separate low pressure accumulator that compensates for the hydraulic fluid volumetric flow of the high pressure accumulator, which is extracted or added at the high-pressure-side hydraulic connection of the closed circuit, on the low-pressure-side hydraulic connection.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">In DE 10 2007 012 121 A1, the high pressure accumulator of the pressure accumulator device can be connected with the respective high-pressure-side hydraulic connection of the closed circuit. Correspondingly, the separate low pressure accumulator of the pressure accumulator device can be connected with the respective low-pressure-side hydraulic connection of the closed circuit. A pressure accumulator device of this type with two separate pressure accumulators is complex and expensive to build and takes up a great deal of space, as a result of which the hybrid function of the pressure accumulator device entails a high level of expense and effort for the construction and operation of the system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, it is an object of this invention to provide a hydrostatic drive system in which the hybrid function of the pressure accumulator device has a simple, compact, and economical construction.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">The invention accomplishes this object in that the pressure accumulator device is a double piston accumulator. The double piston accumulator has a high-pressure-side pressure chamber and a low-pressure-side pressure chamber. The high-pressure-side pressure chamber of the double piston accumulator can be connected with one of the two hydraulic connections of the closed circuit and simultaneously the low-pressure-side pressure chamber of the double piston accumulator can be connected with the respective other hydraulic connection of the closed circuit. The invention therefore teaches that with a double piston accumulator, only one single pressure accumulator is present, which with the high-pressure-side pressure chamber performs the function of the high pressure accumulator and with the low-pressure-side pressure chamber the function of the low pressure accumulator. Thus, the pressure accumulator device occupies little space and, therefore, the hybrid construction can be implemented compactly with a double piston accumulator. Moreover, a double piston accumulator, in contrast to two separate accumulators, i.e., one high pressure accumulator and one low pressure accumulator of the prior art, has a simple and economical construction. A significant advantage of a double piston accumulator is that with a double piston accumulator, it is easily possible in a hydrostatic drive system with a closed circuit to achieve a theoretically exact balancing of the quantity of hydraulic fluid in the low-pressure-side hydraulic connection during the extraction or addition of a quantity of hydraulic fluid on the high-pressure-side hydraulic connection, so that the quantity and volumetric balance in the two hydraulic connections of the closed circuit is guaranteed with little added construction effort or expense.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">In one advantageous embodiment of the invention, the double piston accumulator has a housing in which two pistons are located so that they can be displaced longitudinally and are rigidly connected with each other by a coupling part, in particular, a piston rod. Between the two pistons, the housing is provided with a partition through which the coupling part extends. Each piston has a coupling-part-side pressure chamber and an opposite piston-side pressure chamber. A double piston accumulator of this type has a simple and robust construction. The two pistons also make it possible in a simple manner to have pressure chambers with equal areas available to perform the function of the high pressure accumulator and the low pressure accumulator, which thereby guarantees an exact compensation of the quantity of hydraulic fluid in the low-pressure-side hydraulic connection during the extraction or the addition of a quantity of hydraulic fluid to the high-pressure-side hydraulic connection with little extra construction effort or expense.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment of the invention, the coupling-part-side pressure chamber of the first piston forms the high-pressure-side pressure chamber and the coupling-part-side pressure chamber of the second piston forms the low-pressure-side pressure chamber. The coupling-part-side pressure chambers of the two pistons, which chambers have equal areas, therefore form the high-pressure-side pressure chamber and the low-pressure-side pressure chamber of the double piston accumulator.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">In an alternative embodiment of the invention, the piston-side pressure chamber of the first piston forms the high-pressure-side pressure chamber and the piston-side pressure chamber of the second piston forms the low-pressure-side pressure chamber. The piston-side pressure chambers of the two pistons, which chambers have equal areas, therefore form the high-pressure-side pressure chamber and the low-pressure-side pressure chamber of the double piston accumulator.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">The high-pressure-side pressure chamber can be realized in a simple manner in the double piston accumulator if the pressure chamber of the first piston that faces the high-pressure-side pressure chamber is under a precharge.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">In one advantageous embodiment of the invention, the pressure chamber of the first piston under a precharge is a precharge pressure chamber which is precharged with a gas pressure. The double piston accumulator therefore forms a hydropneumatic accumulator element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">The low-pressure-side pressure chamber can be implemented in a simple manner in the double piston accumulator if the pressure chamber of the second piston facing the low-pressure-side pressure chamber of the second piston is depressurized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">In one embodiment of the invention, the high-pressure-side pressure chamber of the double piston accumulator is connected in a fixed manner to one of the two hydraulic connections of the closed circuit and the low-pressure-side pressure chamber of the double piston accumulator is connected in a fixed manner to the other hydraulic connection of the closed circuit. A connection of this type of the double piston accumulator to the two hydraulic connections of the closed circuit has a simple construction from a switching point of view and makes it possible to charge the high-pressure-side pressure chamber of the double piston accumulator on the primary side with energy from the drive motor. The energy stored in the double piston accumulator can then be used during a drive phase of the consumer to drive the consumer in a selected direction of movement of the consumer, so that the double piston accumulator makes it possible to provide a boost for the drive motor in a drive phase of the consumer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">In one embodiment of the invention, a valve device is provided with which, in a first control position, the high-pressure-side pressure chamber of the double piston accumulator is connected to the first hydraulic connection of the closed circuit and the low-pressure-side pressure chamber of the double piston accumulator is simultaneously connected to the second hydraulic connection of the closed circuit, and in a second control position, the high-pressure-side pressure chamber of the double piston accumulator is connected to the second hydraulic connection of the closed circuit and the low-pressure-side pressure chamber of the double piston accumulator is simultaneously connected to the first hydraulic connection of the closed circuit. With a valve device of this type, it becomes possible to optionally connect the high-pressure-side pressure chamber and the low-pressure-side pressure chamber of the double piston accumulator with each of the two hydraulic connections of the closed circuit. With a valve device of this type, in combination with a double piston accumulator, it is possible in a simple manner for both directions of movement of the consumer to charge the high-pressure-side pressure chamber of the double piston accumulator during a braking phase of the consumer and thus to recover the braking energy of the consumer. The valve device also makes it possible to then use the energy stored in the double piston accumulator during a drive phase of the consumer to drive the consumer for both directions of movement of the consumer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">In one advantageous embodiment of the invention, the valve device is in communication by means of a first connecting line with the first hydraulic connection of the closed circuit, by means of the second connecting line with the second hydraulic connection of the closed circuit, by means of a high pressure accumulator line with the high-pressure-side pressure chamber of the double piston accumulator, and by means of a low pressure accumulator line with the low-pressure-side pressure chamber of the double piston accumulator.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">In the first control position, the valve device connects the first connecting line with the high pressure accumulator line and the second connecting line with the low pressure accumulator line, and in the second control position connects the first connecting line with the low pressure accumulator line and the second connecting line with the high pressure accumulator line. With a valve device of this type, it becomes possible in a simple manner for both directions of movement of the consumer, to recover the braking energy during a braking phase of the consumer and to drive the consumer with the double piston accumulator during a drive phase of the consumer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">In one development of the invention, the valve device has a closed position, in which the connection of the connecting lines with the high pressure accumulator line and/or the low pressure accumulator line is shut off. With a closed position of this type, the hybrid function formed by the double piston accumulator can be deactivated in a simple manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">In one embodiment of the invention, the valve device is a four-port, two-position control valve that has the first control position and the second control position. With a control valve of this type, it is possible with little added construction effort or expense to form the hybrid function with the double piston accumulator in both directions of movement of the consumer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">In an alternative embodiment of the invention, the valve device is a four-port, three-position control valve, which has the first control position and the second control position and is provided with the closed position as a middle position. With a control valve of this type, it is possible with little extra construction effort or expense, to form the hybrid function with the double piston accumulator in both directions of movement of the consumer and to deactivate the hybrid function by means of the closed position.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">In an alternative embodiment of the invention, the valve device is formed by a plurality of individual valves. The design of the valve device as a distributed construction with a plurality of individual valves, e.g. simple switching valves, also makes it possible with little added construction effort or expense, to form the hybrid function with the double piston accumulator in both directions of movement of the consumer as well as to deactivate the hybrid function.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">In one advantageous embodiment of the invention, the valve device can have a first shuttle valve which is connected to the first connecting line and to the second connecting line, and is connected on the output side to the low pressure accumulator line, and a second shuttle valve which is connected on the input side to the first connecting line and to the second connecting line, and on the output side to the high pressure accumulator line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">In the first control position, the first shuttle valve advantageously connects the second connecting line with the low pressure accumulator line, and in the second control position the first connecting line with the low pressure accumulator line, and the second shuttle valve, in the first control position, connects the first connecting line with the high pressure accumulator line, and in the second control position connects the second connecting line with the high pressure accumulator line. With a valve device formed by two shuttle valves, it becomes possible in a simple manner to recover the braking energy for both directions of movement of the consumer during a braking phase of the consumer, and during a drive phase of the consumer to drive the consumer with the double piston accumulator.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">In an alternative embodiment of the invention, a controlled deactivation of the hybrid function formed by the double piston accumulator can be achieved with little added construction effort or expense if at least one switching valve with a closed position and an open position is provided, which is associated with the high-pressure-side pressure chamber or the low-pressure-side pressure chamber of the double piston accumulator.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">The valve device can be a switching valve or a proportional valve.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">In the drive system of the invention, the hydrostatic pump is a variable pump with a variable displacement volume, preferably a bilaterally variable displacement pump, and the hydrostatic motor is a constant motor with a fixed displacement volume or a variable motor with a variable displacement volume.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">To vary the displacement volume of the variable pump and/or of the variable motor, an electronic control device is advantageously provided in which operating strategies are stored to charge the high-pressure-side pressure chamber of the double piston accumulator, as a function of the operating conditions of the drive system, with energy from the drive motor and/or during braking operation of the consumer with braking energy from the consumer. It therefore becomes possible to charge the high-pressure-side pressure chamber of the double piston accumulator during certain operating conditions in which excess energy occurs at the drive motor and/or during braking operation of the consumer with the braking energy that occurs to make it possible to recover the energy. The electronic control device is in communication with corresponding signal generators, on the basis of which the respective operating condition and/or braking operation of the consumer can be determined, for example, an accelerator pedal device or a brake pedal when the consumer is the traction drive of a vehicle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">In the drive system of the invention, operating strategies are stored in the electronic control device to use the hydraulic fluid from the charged high-pressure-side pressure chamber of the double piston accumulator, depending on the operating conditions of the drive system, to drive the hydrostatic motor and/or to drive the hydrostatic pump. As a result of the drive of the hydrostatic motor with hydraulic fluid from the charged high-pressure-side pressure chamber of the double piston accumulator, a booster drive of the running drive motor can be achieved. If the hydraulic fluid from the charged high-pressure-side pressure chamber of the double piston accumulator is used to drive the hydrostatic pump, the hydrostatic pump can be used as a hydraulic starter of the shutoff drive motor. The double piston accumulator of the invention can therefore be used to assist the running drive motor and/or as a hydraulic starter in the framework of a start-stop function of the drive motor, whereby an economical start-stop function of the drive motor can be achieved on account of the robust construction and operation of the hydrostatic displacement machine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">To be able to start the shutoff internal combustion engine in combination with the hydrostatic pump, in one development of the invention the variable displacement motor can be set to a displacement volume of zero, and during the drive of the hydrostatic pump by the hydraulic fluid from the charged high-pressure-side pressure chamber of the double piston accumulator, the variable displacement motor is set to a displacement volume of zero. It thus becomes possible for hydraulic fluid from the charged high-pressure-side pressure chamber of the double piston accumulator not to drive the hydrostatic motor and to flow only to the hydrostatic pump, where it can be used to start the shutoff drive motor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">The switching valve can advantageously be actuated electrically and for its actuation is in communication with the electronic control device. The hybrid function formed by the double piston accumulator can therefore be activated and deactivated by means of the electronic control device by a corresponding actuation of the switching valve in a simple manner as a function of the operating conditions of the drive system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">In one embodiment of the invention, the valve device can be actuated electronically and for its actuation is in communication with the electronic control device. With the electronic control device, the valve device can be actuated in a simple manner as a function of the operating conditions of the drive system to charge or discharge the high-pressure-side pressure chamber of the double piston accumulator.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">In one alternative embodiment of the invention, the valve device can be actuated hydraulically, and for its actuation is connected with the hydraulic connections of the closed circuit. A hydraulically controlled valve device of this type, which is controlled by the pressures present in the hydraulic connections of the closed circuit, therefore forms a hydraulically controlled shuttle valve that controls the connection of the high-pressure-side pressure chamber and of the low-pressure-side pressure chamber of the double piston accumulator with the two hydraulic connections.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">A first control pressure line is advantageously provided which runs from the first hydraulic connection of the closed circuit to a control surface of the valve device that acts in the direction of the first control position, and a second control pressure line is provided which runs from the second hydraulic connection of the closed circuit to a control surface of the valve device that acts in the direction of the second control position. It is thereby possible in a simple manner to connect the high-pressure-side hydraulic connection of the closed circuit with the high-pressure-side pressure chamber of the double piston accumulator and the low-pressure-side hydraulic connection of the closed circuit with the low-pressure-side pressure chamber of the double piston accumulator.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">The consumer can be in the form of a slewing gear of a vehicle driven by the hydrostatic motor. With the double piston accumulator of the invention, on the vehicle with the slewing gear such as a mobile machine in the form of an excavator, during braking operation of the slewing gear, energy can be recovered and the drive motor can be assisted during the acceleration of the slewing gear.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">Alternatively, the consumer can be the traction drive of a vehicle, for example a drive axle with at least two driven drive wheels driven by the hydrostatic motor. With the double piston accumulator, on a vehicle with a traction drive comprising one drive axle, energy can be recovered during braking operation of the vehicle and the drive motor can be boosted during the acceleration of the vehicle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">Alternatively, the consumer can be a winch, for example a crane winch.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">In one development of the invention, the hydrostatic drive of the invention can be a continuously variable hydrostatic branch of a power split transmission.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">The invention further relates to a vehicle with a hydrostatic drive system of the invention. With the double piston accumulator, which can be in communication with the hydraulic connections of the hydrostatic circuit, it is possible to create a compact serial hybrid in a vehicle in a simple and economical manner.</div>
