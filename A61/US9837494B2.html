<heading id="h-0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method for growing Group III nitride semiconductor crystal on a mesa-formed substrate and a Group III nitride semiconductor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Background Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">When a Group III nitride semiconductor light-emitting device is produced by crystal growth of Group III nitride semiconductor on a sapphire substrate, a technique has been developed to form mesas on a Group III nitride semiconductor growing surface of the sapphire substrate to improve the light extraction performance (e.g. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (kokai) Nos. 2004-200523 and 2005-101566).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (kokai) No. 2003-526907 discloses that a mesa stripe pattern is formed on a sapphire substrate, a GaN is vertically grown on the top surface of the mesa, and further laterally grown, thereby obtaining a GaN semiconductor having a low threading dislocation density.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">However, when Group III nitride semiconductor is grown on the mesa-formed sapphire substrate by these methods, voids are formed on side surfaces of the dents or mesas, resulting in a problem that crystallinity and flatness of Group III nitride semiconductor are deteriorated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (kokai) No. 2003-318441 discloses that sides in planar view of dents or mesas intersect with an a-plane of the sapphire substrate. When the dents or mesas are formed in such a manner, GaN is grown on the top surfaces of the mesas of the sapphire substrate and the bottom surfaces of the dents, and GaN is difficult to grow on side surfaces of the mesas or dents. As the growth progresses, the crystals are combined together, thereby obtaining GaN having superior crystallinity and high flatness, with no void formed therein. On the other hand, when the sides in planar view of the dents or mesas are parallel to the a-plane of the sapphire substrate, lateral growth of the GaN grown on the dents or mesas is slow. Therefore, a space near the side surfaces of the dents or mesas is difficult to be buried with GaN, and the surface flatness of GaN is deteriorated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (kokai) No. 2011-77265 discloses that all side surfaces of mesas on a substrate having an a-plane or c-plane main surface are the surfaces which inhibit the crystal growth of Group III nitride semiconductor. It is also disclosed that when the mesas are hexagonal prisms, the angle between each side of hexagons in planar view and the m-axis is 15°.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">When the Group III nitride semiconductor is grown in a direction perpendicular to the main surface from the top surfaces of the mesas and the bottom surfaces of the dents, there is an advantage that the threading dislocation density is reduced on the most upper surface of the grown semiconductor because the threading dislocation is bent laterally through the facet growth. However, there is a disadvantage that the threading dislocation density is uneven on the upper surface of the grown semiconductor layer because the laterally bent threading dislocation is concentrated in the vicinity of a boundary between the dents and the mesas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">When the Group III nitride semiconductor is vertically grown on the top surfaces of the mesas and the bottom surfaces of the dents on the mesa-formed substrate, steps need to be buried by laterally growing the Group III nitride semiconductor. That is, after the Group III nitride semiconductor was grown under the growth conditions where growth is faster in a direction perpendicular to the main surface of the substrate, it is necessary to grow the Group III nitride semiconductor under the growth conditions where growth is faster in a lateral direction. Therefore, there is a problem that the production method is complicated.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">In view of the foregoing, an object of the present invention is to establish a method for producing a Group III nitride semiconductor having good crystallinity with steps thereof buried without changing the growth conditions. It is also to make the threading dislocation density uniform and even on the top surface of the grown semiconductor layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">In a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for producing a Group III nitride semiconductor comprising forming mesas on a main surface of a substrate, and growing Group III nitride semiconductor in a c-axis direction of Group III nitride semiconductor on the top surfaces of the mesas and the bottom surfaces of the dents, wherein</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">side surfaces of the mesas and the dents are formed so as to satisfy the following conditions:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">a plane, which is most parallel to the side surfaces among low-index planes of the growing Group III nitride semiconductor, is a m-plane (1-100); and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">when a projected vector obtained by orthogonally projecting a normal vector of the side surface to the main surface is defined as a lateral vector, an angle formed by the lateral vector and a projected vector obtained by orthogonally projecting a normal vector of the m-plane of the growing Group III nitride semiconductor to the main surface is 0.5° or more and 6° or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">The above angle is defined as a smaller angle of the angles formed by two intersecting vectors. The substrate may be material having any crystal structure as long as the Group III nitride semiconductor is grown in the c-axis of Group III nitride semiconductor on the top surfaces of the mesas and the bottom surfaces of the dents. For example, a substrate formed of at least one of a group consisting of sapphire, SiC, Si, and ZnO, Group III nitride semiconductor substrate such as GaN, AlN substrate or a template substrate in which an epitaxial layer of Group III nitride semiconductor such as GaN is formed on a substrate made of any material, may be used. When the template substrate is used, mesas may be formed only on the epitaxial layer or so as to extend from the epitaxial layer to the substrate. The processed side surfaces of the mesas or dents may be perpendicular to the main surface of the substrate, but there may be an inclination caused by etching or an intentional inclination. Moreover, each processed side surface may comprise a curved plane formed by arranging a plurality of planes, each of which has different normal vector, in a vertical direction. The side surface may comprise a curved surface whose vertical cross section is arc-shaped, ellipse-shaped, parabola-shaped, or other curve-shaped. The side surface that can be considered as one plane is not necessarily a straight line along a direction parallel to the main surface of the substrate. One planar side surface may be a curve or inflected line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">In the present invention, a projected vector obtained by orthogonally projecting a normal vector of the side surface to the main surface is defined as a lateral vector, considering the case where the side surface of the mesa is not perpendicular to the main surface. That is, an inclination angle of the side surface from the surface perpendicular to the main surface is not included in the angle disclosed in the present invention. A c-axis of Group III nitride semiconductor growing in a direction perpendicular to the main surface on the top surfaces of the mesas and the bottom surfaces of the dents is basically perpendicular to the main surface, but may be slightly inclined. A m-plane terrace and an a-plane step are formed on the side surfaces of the growing Group III nitride semiconductor. The m-plane (1-100) of Group III nitride semiconductor is perpendicular to the a-plane (11-20). The growth of Group III nitride semiconductor is slow in the m-axis direction and fast in the a-axis direction. When one planar processed side surface is not a single plane, the normal vector on one processed side surface is defined as an average of normal vectors. That is, an average of normal vector surface integrals is defined as a normal vector of one side surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention is characterized by that the orientation of the processed side surface is determined so that then angle between the lateral vector obtained by orthogonally projecting a normal vector of the side surface to the main surface and the projected obtained by orthogonally projecting the normal vector of the m-plane of the growing Group III nitride semiconductor to the main surface falls within a range of 0.5° to 6°. When the side surface of Group III nitride semiconductor growing in the c-axis direction perpendicular to the main surface of the substrate on the top surfaces of the mesas and the bottom surfaces of the dents is the m-plane, Group III nitride semiconductor is facet grown so as to have a triangle cross section. Threading dislocation is bent laterally through facet growth, and the threading dislocation density is reduced on the upper surface of the grown semiconductor layer. However, unless Group III nitride semiconductor is also grown in a direction parallel to the main surface, a space among the facets cannot be buried with Group III nitride semiconductor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">In the present invention, a surface in the growing Group III nitride semiconductor, which is perpendicular to the lateral vector of the processed side surface (also perpendicular to the main surface), is rotated within a range of 0.5° to 6° from the m-plane of the Group III nitride semiconductor around an axis perpendicular to the substrate. If the c-axis is completely perpendicular to the main surface, the side surface of Group III nitride semiconductor (perpendicular to the main surface) is a plane formed by rotating the m-plane within a range of 0.5° to 6° around the c-axis. Here, the range is satisfied in the both direction of a clockwise and a counterclockwise. Therefore, the projected vector obtained by orthogonally projecting the normal vector of the a-plane of the growing Group III nitride semiconductor (the a-plane is perpendicular to the m-plane and parallel to the c-axis) to the main surface has a component in a direction of the lateral vector. As a result, Group III nitride semiconductor grows in a direction parallel to the main surface and perpendicularly to the processed side surface. Thus, lateral growth parallel to the main surface is achieved in addition to vertical growth in the c-axis direction, thereby burying the steps caused by mesa forming without changing the vertical growth conditions. With such a growth method, a high density of threading dislocation is suppressed from being concentrated in the vicinity of a boundary between the dents and the mesas, and the threading dislocation density can be even and uniform on the most upper surface of the growing semiconductor layer. The present invention is based on the above idea.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">In the above invention, when a substrate with a hexagonal crystal structure is used, the following embodiments are given. The main surface of the substrate is a c-plane of hexagonal crystal, and an angle between the lateral vector of the processed side surface and a projected vector obtained by orthogonally projecting a normal vector of a-plane (11-20) of hexagonal crystal to the main surface can be 0.5° or more and 6° or less. In this case, the a-plane of hexagonal crystal in the substrate is parallel to the m-plane of the growing Group III nitride semiconductor. Therefore, the angle between the lateral vector of the processed side surface and the projected vector obtained by orthogonally projecting the normal vector of the m-plane of the growing Group III nitride semiconductor to the main surface can be 0.5° or more and 6° or less. That is, a plane of Group III nitride semiconductor, which plain is perpendicular to the lateral vector of the processed side surface, is a plane formed by rotating the m-plane of Group III nitride semiconductor within a range of 0.5° to 6° around the c-axis. Here, the range is satisfied in the both direction of a clockwise and a counterclockwise. Such a relationship between the crystal orientation of the substrate and the crystal orientation of the growing Group III nitride semiconductor is established for the hexagonal crystal substrate having a different lattice constant from that of Group III nitride semiconductor. A representative example of such hexagonal crystal substrate is a sapphire substrate. A SiC substrate and a ZnO substrate also satisfy this relationship.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">The main surface of the substrate may be an a-plane of hexagonal crystal. An angle between the lateral vector and a projected vector obtained by orthogonally projecting a normal vector of c-plane (0001) of hexagonal crystal of the substrate to the main surface can be 0.5° or more and 6° or less. In this case, since the m-plane of hexagonal crystal of the substrate is parallel to the a-plane of Group III nitride semiconductor, the c-plane of hexagonal crystal of the substrate is parallel to the m-plane of Group III nitride semiconductor. Therefore, the angle between the lateral vector of the processed side surface and a projected vector obtained by orthogonally projecting a normal vector of the m-plane of the growing Group III nitride semiconductor to the main surface can be 0.5° or more and 6° or less. That is, a plane of Group III nitride semiconductor, which plain is perpendicular to the lateral vector, can be formed by rotating the m-plane of Group III nitride semiconductor within a range of 0.5° to 6° around the c-axis. Here, the range is satisfied in the both direction of a clockwise and a counterclockwise. Such a relationship between the crystal orientation of the substrate and the crystal orientation of the growing Group III nitride semiconductor is established for the substrate with the hexagonal crystal structure having a different lattice constant from that of Group III nitride semiconductor. A representative example of such hexagonal crystal substrate is a sapphire substrate. A SiC substrate and a ZnO substrate also satisfy this relationship.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">A substrate in which at least a portion to be mesa-formed of the main surface of the substrate comprises Group III nitride semiconductor may be used. That is, the case where the surface of Group III nitride semiconductor substrate is mesa-formed or the case where the Group III nitride semiconductor layer is mesa-formed in the template substrate in which the Group III nitride semiconductor layer is formed on the substrate is as follows. When the main surface of the substrate is a c-plane of Group III nitride semiconductor, Group III nitride semiconductor is grown in a c-axis direction on the top surfaces of the mesas and the bottom surfaces of the dents. The m-plane of Group III nitride semiconductor of the substrate is parallel to (coincides with) the m-plane of the growing Group III nitride semiconductor. Therefore, the angle between the lateral vector of the side surface and the projected vector obtained by orthogonally projecting the normal vector of the m-plane of Group III nitride semiconductor of the substrate to the main surface may be 0.5° ore mot and 6° or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">In the above invention, the mesas or dents preferably have a periodic structure where a stripe extending in a first direction on the main surface is repeated in a second direction perpendicular to the first direction. When a substrate with a hexagonal crystal structure is used and its main surface is a c-plane, each dent or mesa may have a shape of regular triangular prism, rhombic prism, regular hexagonal prism, or regular triangular pyramid having a relationship where adjacent side surfaces are intersected at 60°. A plurality of mesas or dents may be arranged at regular intervals in a honeycomb pattern. That is, it is not limited to a parallel stripe pattern where a plurality of processed side surfaces are parallel each other. In other words, as long as the orientation of each planar processed side surface satisfies the above conditions, the mesas or dents have any shape on a plane parallel to the main surface. Although the mesas or dents do not necessarily have a periodicity, uniform crystallinity can be achieved by introducing a periodicity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">The angle between the lateral vector and one of the following projected vectors is preferably 1° or more and 5° or less. More preferably, the angle is 1° or more and 2.5° or less. The projected vector is obtained by orthogonally projecting the normal vector of the m-plane of the growing Group III nitride semiconductor to the main surface; the normal vector of the a-plane of the substrate to the main surface (when the substrate with the hexagonal crystal structure such as sapphire substrate having a c-plane main surface is used); the normal vector of the c-plane of the substrate to the main surface (when the substrate with the hexagonal crystal structure having an a-plane main surface is used); and the normal vector of the m-plane of Group III nitride semiconductor to the main surface (when the substrate in which at least a portion to be mesa-formed is Group III nitride semiconductor is used).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">Moreover, in the above invention, preferably a buffer layer is formed on the mesa-formed substrate, and thereafter, Group III nitride semiconductor is grown. The buffer layer is preferably formed by the sputtering method. The buffer layer may be formed by MBE (Molecular Beam Epitaxy) or PLD (Pulse laser deposition or laser abrasion)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">A second aspect of the present invention provides a Group III nitride semiconductor having a substrate having a mesa-formed main surface, and grown in a c-axis direction of the Group III nitride semiconductor on the top surfaces of the mesas and the bottom surfaces of the dents, wherein</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">side surfaces of the mesas and the dents are formed so as to satisfy the following conditions:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">a plane, which is most parallel to the side surfaces among low-index planes of the growing Group III nitride semiconductor, is a m-plane (1-100); and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">when a projected vector obtained by orthogonally projecting a normal vector of the side surface to the main surface is defined as a lateral vector, an angle formed by the lateral vector and a projected vector obtained by orthogonally projecting a normal vector of the m-plane of the growing Group III nitride semiconductor to the main surface is 0.5° or more and 6° or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">The present invention is related to Group III nitride semiconductor grown on a mesa-formed substrate and has a feature of the crystal orientation of the processed side surface, i.e., the side surface of the mesa or the dent, and the crystal orientation of Group III nitride semiconductor grown on a mesa-formed substrate. The main surface of the substrate is a c-plane of hexagonal crystal (e.g., sapphire), and the angle between the lateral vector and the projected vector obtained by orthogonally projecting the normal vector of the a-plane (11-20) of hexagonal crystal of the substrate to the main surface can be 0.5° or more and 6° or less. In this case, since the a-plane of hexagonal crystal of the substrate is parallel to the m-plane of the growing Group III nitride semiconductor, the angle between the lateral vector and the projected vector obtained by orthogonally projecting the normal vector of the m-plane of the growing Group III nitride semiconductor to the main surface can be 0.5° or more and 6° or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">Moreover, the main surface of the substrate is an a-plane of hexagonal crystal (e.g., sapphire), and the angle between the lateral vector and the projected vector obtained by orthogonally projecting the normal vector of the c-plane (0001) of hexagonal crystal of the substrate to the main surface can be 0.5° or more and 6° or less. In this case, since the c-plane of hexagonal crystal of the substrate is parallel to the m-plane of the growing Group III nitride semiconductor, the angle between the lateral vector and the projected vector obtained by orthogonally projecting the normal vector of the m-plane of the growing Group III nitride semiconductor to the main surface can be 0.5° or more and 6° or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">When the substrate in which at least the mesa-formed portion of the main surface of the substrate comprises Group III nitride semiconductor is used, and the main surface of the substrate is a c-plane (0001) of Group III nitride semiconductor of the substrate, an angle between the lateral vector and the projected vector obtained by orthogonally projecting the normal vector of the m-plane (1-100) of Group III nitride semiconductor of the substrate to the main surface can be 0.5° or more and 6° or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">As in the first aspect of the present invention, the mesas may be formed in a plurality of parallel stripes, or in an island-like shape of regular triangular prism, rhombic prism, regular hexagonal prism, regular triangular pyramid, or rhombic pyramid, or regular hexagonal pyramid. Such shaped islands may be arranged at regular intervals in a honeycomb pattern. The angle is preferably 1° or more and 5° or less, more preferably 1° or more and 2.5° or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">A third aspect of the present invention provides a light-emitting device having a Group III nitride semiconductor according to the second aspect of the present invention. The threading dislocations are formed evenly and uniformly on the grown semiconductor layer, thereby uniforming characteristic of light-emitting device. This also improves the yield ratio of production.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">As used herein, “Group III nitride semiconductor” encompasses a semiconductor represented by the formula Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N (x+y+z=1, 0≦x, y, z≦1); such a semiconductor in which a portion of Al, Ga, or In is substituted by another Group 13 element (Group 3B element) (i.e., B or Tl), or a portion of N is substituted by another Group 15 element (Group 5B element) (i.e., P, As, Sb, or Bi). Specific examples of the Group III nitride semiconductor include those containing at least Ga, such as GaN, InGaN, AlGaN, and AlGaInN. Generally, Si is used as an n-type impurity, and Mg is used as a p-type impurity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">According to the first aspect, when the Group III nitride semiconductor is vertically grown in the c-axis direction on the top surfaces of the mesas and the bottom surfaces of the dents on the mesa-formed substrate, the normal vector of the a-plane of the growing Group III nitride semiconductor has a component perpendicular to the processed side surface and parallel to the main surface. Since the crystal growth is faster in the a-axis direction than in the m-axis direction, the Group III nitride semiconductor is also grown in the direction parallel to the main surface of the substrate. As a result, Group III nitride semiconductor is laterally grown as well as facet grown in the direction perpendicular to the main surface under the vertical growth conditions, thereby burying a space among the facets. Thus, the threading dislocation density can be reduced on the upper surface of the grown semiconductor because threading dislocation is bent laterally through facet growth. A high density of threading dislocation is not concentrated in the vicinity of a boundary between the dents or the mesas, and even and uniform threading dislocation density can be achieved on the surface of the semiconductor.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">Rotating the stripe direction of the mesa <b>2</b> is equivalent to rotating the surface perpendicular to the lateral vector t of the mesa from the a-plane of sapphire around the c-axis in increments of 0.2°.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">A principle of GaN lateral growth will next be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the relationship between the mesa stripe direction and the crystal orientation of the growing GaN. In the direction of 15.0°, that is, when the mesa stripe direction is the m-axis of sapphire (the surface perpendicular to the lateral vector of the mesa is the a-plane of sapphire), the side surface of the mesa is parallel to the m-plane of GaN, and the a-axis vector of GaN does not have a component vertical to the side surface of the mesa. As the mesa stripe direction is rotated around the c-axis in increments of 0.2° from the direction of 15.0°, the side surface of the mesa will become less parallel to the m-plane of GaN. Thus, the a-axis vector of GaN has the component vertical to the side surface of the mesa, and the vertical component of the a-axis vector of GaN gradually increases. GaN growth is faster in the a-axis direction than in the m-axis direction. Therefore, as the above angle θ is increased, lateral growth is faster in a direction of the lateral vector. However, if the angle θ is excessively increased, GaN is not facet grown.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the relationship between the angle θ and the dark spot density of cathodeluminescence images of GaN grown to a thickness of 5 μm when the angle between the lateral vector t obtained by orthogonally projecting the normal vector n of the side surface <b>4</b> of the mesa <b>2</b> to the main surface <b>21</b> of the substrate <b>20</b> and the projected vector k obtained by orthogonally projecting the normal vector of the a-plane (11-20) of sapphire to the main surface <b>21</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref> was varied. When the a-plane of sapphire is accurately perpendicular to the main surface <b>21</b>, the normal vector of the a-plane completely coincides with the projected vector k of the normal vector on the main surface. Moreover, when the mesa stripe direction is in a direction of 15° to the baseline of the sapphire substrate as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the angle θ is 0. When the angle θ is 0, the stripe direction is the m-axis of sapphire, and the angle θ is also an angle between the stripe direction of the mesa <b>2</b> and the m-axis. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows the cathodeluminescence images. High dark spot density means that the threading dislocation density is high.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, when the angle θ is 0°, that is, the side surface <b>4</b> of the mesa <b>2</b> is the a-plane of sapphire (the lateral vector is the a-axis), GaN is facet grown, resulting in an extremely rough surface. When the angle θ falls within a range of 6° to 15°, the GaN surface is smooth, but the threading dislocation density is high. When the angle θ is 15°, the side surface of the mesa is an intermediate surface between the m-plane and the a-plane of sapphire (the lateral vector is in an intermediate direction between the m-axis and the a-axis). When the angle θ is 6°, the threading dislocation density is 4×10<sup>8</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>. When the angle θ is reduced to 6° or less, the threading dislocation density is 4×10<sup>8</sup>/cm<sup>2 </sup>or less. When the angle θ is 0.5°, the threading dislocation density is reduced to 4.5×10<sup>7</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>. Therefore, when GaN can be grown to bury a space among the facets and the threading dislocation density falls within a low range, the angle θ is preferably 0.5° or more, and 6° or less. When the angle θ exceeds 6°, facet growth of GaN is difficult.</div>

As is clear from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, when the angle θ is 1.5°, 3°, and 7°, the surface is smooth. But, as the angle θ is increased, the threading dislocation density is increased. Therefore, to obtain GaN with a low threading dislocation density, the angle θ is preferably 0.5° or more and 6° or less. More preferably, the angle θ is 1° or more and 5° or less. Further preferably, the angle θ is 1° or more and 2.5° or less.</div>

However, the concave-convex shape may have any structure, for example, wherein the dents or the mesas such as regular hexagon, regular triangle, and square are periodically arranged in a dot pattern, a stripe pattern or a lattice pattern for the sapphire substrate having a c-plane main surface. Particularly preferably is the structure wherein a plurality of dents or mesas is periodically arranged at regular intervals. The dents or mesas particularly preferably have a shape of regular hexagonal prism or regular hexagonal truncated pyramid. This is because light extraction performance can be further improved when the present invention is applied to the production of light-emitting device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">In Embodiments 1 to 6, the buffer layer is formed of AlN, but it is not limited to this, and it may be formed of Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>N (x+y=1, 0≦x, y≦1). The buffer layer may be a single layer or may comprise a plurality of layers. In Embodiments 3 to 5, the buffer layer is formed by the sputtering method, but the buffer layer may be formed by MOCVD.</div>
