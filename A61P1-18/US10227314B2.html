<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) is a recognized endogenous gasotransmitter involved in multiple signaling pathways that impact various aspects of physiological and pathological processes. Such processes include, but are not limited to; pain, inflammation, neurodegenerative disorders, regulation of breathing, respiratory disorders, cutaneous injuries, regulation of blood pressure, metabolic disorders, and urinary disorders, among others. Cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE) is a key enzyme involved in the generation of H<sub>2</sub>S and an important target for therapeutic intervention in H<sub>2</sub>S-mediated pathologies and disorders. Compounds that can effectively modulate CSE activity will provide important therapeutic opportunities in disorders sensitive to H<sub>2</sub>S production.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0043">A devastating health problem in the United States and abroad is the inadequate treatment of pain. Pain can be acute or chronic and can also be categorized as nociceptive, pathologic/neuropathic, or inflammatory pain. While acute pain is usually self-limited, chronic pain persists for three months or longer. One third of all Americans suffer from some form of chronic pain, and a third of these have pain, which is resistant to current medical therapy. The economic impact of pain is equally large at approximately $100 billion annually. Severe pain syndromes reduce quality of life in patients, partly because reduced analgesic effectiveness with chronic opiate therapy (i.e., hyperalgesia and tolerance) leads to escalating doses and distressing side effects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0044">Neuropathic pain is a particular type of chronic, pathologic pain that has a complex and variable etiology. It is frequently a chronic condition attributable to complete or partial transection of a nerve, trauma or injury to a nerve, nerve plexus or soft tissue, or other conditions, including cancer and idiopathic causes. Neuropathic pain is characterized by hyperalgesia (lowered pain threshold and enhanced pain perception) and by allodynia (pain from innocuous mechanical or thermal stimuli). The condition is progressive in nature. Because the hyperesthetic component of neuropathic pain does not respond to the same pharmaceutical interventions as does more generalized and acute forms of pain, development of effective long-term treatment modalities has been problematic.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0045">The treatment of pain is of great importance in medicine. However, little progress has been made in preventing the development of neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain and hyperalgesia. Thus, there is a serious need for new agents and methods of treating pain conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0046">Endogenous hydrogen sulfide is synthesized through degradation of L-cysteine by cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE) or cystathionine-beta synthase (CBS). The enzyme cystathionine-γ-lyase (CSE) converts cystathionine to L-cysteine, yielding pyruvate, ammonia and hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) is a gasotransmitter physiologically regulating neuronal transmission and vascular tone. CBS is the predominant H<sub>2</sub>S synthesizing enzyme in the brain, while CSE preponderates in the peripheral tissues.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0047">Hydrogen sulfide in some embodiments is known to play a role in nociception by sensitizing or directly activating various ion channels (e.g., TRPV channels, TRPA1, NaV and CaV cation channels) potentially contributing to hyperalgesia as well as many other physiological processes including vasodilation (e.g., smooth muscle relaxation and/or opening of vascular smooth muscle K channels), and neuromodulation (e.g., induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation). Studies have shown that hydrogen sulfide is also associated with inflammation (e.g., hindpaw edema), acute pancreatitis, endotoxemia and sepsis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0006" num="0000">Neuropathic Pain</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0048">Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, are methods of treating neuropathic pain in an individual in need thereof. Neuropathic pain is a complex, chronic, pathologic pain state that may or may not be accompanied by an active tissue injury process. With neuropathic pain, the nerve fibers themselves may be damaged, dysfunctional or injured. These damaged nerve fibers send incorrect signals to other pain centers, potentially resulting in altered functioning at the level of the central nervous system. The impact of nerve fiber injury includes a change in nerve function both at the site of injury and areas around the injury.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0049">One example of neuropathic pain is called phantom limb syndrome. This occurs when an arm or a leg has been removed because of illness or injury, but the brain still gets pain messages from the nerves that originally carried impulses from the missing limb. These nerves now misfire and cause pain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0050">Other examples of neuropathic pain include, but are not limited to, trigeminal neuralgia, painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy, sciatica, and post-herpetic neuralgia. Trigeminal neuralgia is a chronic pain condition that affects the trigeminal nerve, which carries sensation from the face to the brain. In trigeminal neuralgia, even mild stimulation of the face, such as from brushing teeth or putting on makeup, may trigger a jolt of excruciating pain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0051">Trigeminal neuralgia can occur as short, mild attacks, however, trigeminal neuralgia can also progress, causing longer, more frequent bouts of searing pain. Trigeminal neuralgia affects women more often than men, and its more likely to occur in people who are older than 50.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0052">Medications to lessen or block the pain signals sent to the brain are the most common initial treatment for trigeminal neuralgia. Anticonvulsants such as carbazepine can be prescribed to treat trigeminal neuralgia. Carbamazepine (Tegretol, Carbatrol) is the drug most commonly prescribed, and with the most demonstrated effectiveness, for trigeminal neuralgia. Other anticonvulsant drugs used to treat trigeminal neuralgia include oxcarbazepine (Trileptal), lamotrigine (Lamictal), phenytoin (Dilantin, Phenytek) and gabapentin (Neurontin).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0053">Antispasmodic agents can also be used to treat trigeminal neuralgia. Muscle-relaxing agents such as baclofen may be used alone or in combination with carbamazepine or phenytoin. Side effects may include confusion, nausea and drowsiness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0054">Alcohol injections provide temporary pain relief by numbing the affected areas of the face. Typically, alcohol is injected into the part of the face corresponding to the trigeminal nerve branch causing pain. The pain relief isn't permanent, so repeated injections or a different procedure in the future may be needed. Side effects may include infections at the injection site, bleeding and damage to nearby nerves.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0055">Surgery is another option for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. The goal of surgery for trigeminal neuralgia is either to stop the blood vessel from compressing the trigeminal nerve or to damage the trigeminal nerve to keep it from malfunctioning. Damaging the nerve often causes temporary or permanent facial numbness, and with any of the surgical procedures, the pain can return months or years later.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0056">Surgical options for trigeminal neuralgia include gamma-knife radiosurgery (GKR); and microvascular decompression (MVD). GKR involves delivering a focused, high dose of radiation to the root of the trigeminal nerve. Because of GKR's effectiveness and safety compared with other surgical options for trigeminal neuralgia, the procedure is becoming widely used and may be offered earlier than other surgical procedures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0057">Gamma-knife radiosurgery uses radiation to damage the trigeminal nerve and reduce or eliminate pain. Relief occurs gradually and can take several weeks to begin. GKR is successful in eliminating pain for the majority of people. If pain recurs, the procedure can be repeated. Fewer than 5 percent of people who undergo this procedure experience side effects, which may include lasting loss of facial sensation. The procedure is painless and typically is done without anesthesia.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0058">Microvascular decompression (MVD) involves relocating or removing blood vessels that are in contact with the trigeminal root. During MVD, the doctor makes an incision behind the ear on the side of the pain. Then, through a small hole in the skull, part of the brain is lifted to expose the trigeminal nerve. Any artery in contact with the nerve root is directed away from the nerve, and the surgeon places a pad between the nerve and the artery. If a vein is compressing the nerve, the surgeon typically will remove it.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0059">MVD can successfully eliminate or reduce pain most of the time, but pain can recur in some people. While MVD has a high success rate, it also carries risks. There are small chances of decreased hearing, facial weakness, facial numbness, double vision, and even a stroke or death. Most people who have this procedure have no facial numbness afterward.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0060">Note that if no artery or vein appears to be compressing the nerve, part of the nerve may be severed instead. This procedure is called a rhizotomy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0061">During glycerol injection, a needle is inserted through the face and into an opening in the base of the skull. The needle is guided into the trigeminal cistern, a small sac of spinal fluid that surrounds the trigeminal nerve ganglion, where the trigeminal nerve divides into three branches, and part of its root. Images are made to confirm that the needle is in the proper location, and then a small amount of sterile glycerol is injected. After three or four hours, the glycerol damages the trigeminal nerve and blocks pain signals. Initially, this procedure relieves pain in most people. However, some people have a later recurrence of pain, and many experience facial numbness or tingling.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0062">In balloon compression of the trigeminal nerve, a hollow needle is inserted through the face and into an opening in the base of the skull. Then, a thin, flexible tube (catheter) with a balloon on the end is threaded through the needle. The balloon is inflated with enough pressure to damage the nerve and block pain signals. Balloon compression successfully controls pain in most people, at least for a while. Most people undergoing this procedure experience some facial numbness, and some experience temporary or permanent weakness of the muscles used to chew.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0063">Electric current (radiofrequency thermal rhizotomy) selectively destroys nerve fibers associated with pain. A hollow needle is placed through the face and into an opening in the skull. Once the needle is positioned, an electrode is threaded through it to the nerve root. Then the electrode is heated until it damages the nerve fibers, creating an area of injury (lesion). If the pain isn't eliminated, additional lesions may be created. Almost everyone who undergoes radiofrequency thermal rhizotomy has some facial numbness after the procedure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0064">A procedure called partial trigeminal rhizotomy involves cutting part of the trigeminal nerve at the base of the brain. Through an incision behind an ear, a quarter-sized hole is made in the skull to access the nerve. Because partial trigeminal rhizotomy cuts the nerve at its source, facial numbness is a permanent side effect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0065">Diabetic neuropathies are neuropathic disorders that are associated with diabetes mellitus. These conditions are thought to result from diabetic microvascular injury involving small blood vessels that supply nerves (vasa nervorum) in addition to macrovascular conditions that can culminate in diabetic neuropathy. Relatively common conditions which may be associated with diabetic neuropathy include third nerve palsy; mononeuropathy; mononeuropathy multiplex; diabetic amyotrophy; a painful polyneuropathy; autonomic neuropathy; and thoracoabdominal neuropathy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0066">Despite advances in the understanding of the metabolic causes of neuropathy, treatments aimed at interrupting these pathological processes have been limited. Thus, with the exception of tight glucose control, treatments are for reducing pain and other symptoms.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0067">Options for pain control include tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). A systematic review concluded that “tricyclic antidepressants and traditional anticonvulsants are better for short term pain relief than newer generation anticonvulsants.” A combination of these medications (gabapentin+nortriptyline) may also be superior to a single agent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0068">The two drugs approved by the FDA for diabetic peripheral neuropathy are the antidepressant duloxetine and the anticonvulsant pregabalin. Before trying a systemic medication, some doctors recommend treating localized diabetic periperal neuropathy with lidocaine patches.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0069">Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a nerve pain due to damage caused by the varicella zoster virus. Typically, the neuralgia is confined to a dermatomic area of the skin and follows an outbreak of herpes zoster (HZ, commonly known as shingles) in that same dermatomic area. The neuralgia typically begins when the HZ vesicles have crusted over and begun to heal, but it can begin in the absence of HZ, in which case zoster sine herpete is presumed (see Herpes zoster).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0070">Treatment options for PHN include antidepressants, anticonvulsants (such as gabapentin or pregabalin) and topical agents such as lidocaine patches or capsaicin lotion. Opioid analgesics may also be appropriate in many situations. There are some sporadically successful experimental treatments, such as rhizotomy (severing or damaging the affected nerve to relieve pain) and TENS (a type of electrical pulse therapy).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0071">Neuropathic pain often seems to have no obvious cause; but, some common causes of neuropathic pain include alcoholism; amputation; back, leg, and hip problems; chemotherapy; diabetes; facial nerve problems; HIV infection or AIDS; multiple sclerosis; shingles; and spine surgery.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0072">Symptoms may include shooting and burning pain; and tingling and numbness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0073">Some neuropathic pain studies suggest the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as Aleve or Motrin, may ease pain. Some people may require a stronger painkiller, such as those containing morphine. Anticonvulsant and antidepressant drugs seem to work in some cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0074">If another condition, such as diabetes, is involved, better management of that disorder may alleviate the pain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0075">In cases that are difficult to treat, a pain specialist may use invasive or implantable device therapies to effectively manage the pain. Electrical stimulation of the nerves involved in neuropathic pain generation may significantly control the pain symptoms.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0076">Unfortunately, neuropathic pain often responds poorly to standard pain treatments and occasionally may get worse instead of better over time. For some people, it can lead to serious disability.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0079">Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, are methods of preventing or reducing acute post-operative pain in an individual in need thereof. Post-operative pain (as a result of surgery) is usually considered normal. However, when poorly controlled, the pain can cause increased heart and respiratory rate, anxiety, nausea and vomiting, urinary retention, and elevated adrenalin and cortisol levels, or reduced immune response and increased risk of infection.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0080">Uncontrolled pain is similar to uncontrolled fear in that it promotes a “fight or flight” reaction. This reaction tends to delay wound healing and increases the complication rate including infection.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0081">Education as to the nature of the surgery or procedure is very important in order to minimize fear and anxiety pre-operatively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0082">The following have all been shown to reduce post-operative pain and surgical infection, and hasten wound healing use of non-steriod anti-inflammatories, such as ibuprofen preoperatively; injection of local anesthetic into the wound prior to suturing; more liberal prescription of post-operative analgesics; and use of intra- and post-operative epidural infusions for complex surgeries. Numerous studies also demonstrate the effectiveness of relaxation techniques, such as hypnosis and massage therapy in reducing post-operative pain.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0086">Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, are methods of treating an autoimmune disease in an individual in need thereof. Autoimmune diseases often arise from an inappropriate immune response of the body against substances and tissues normally present in the body. In other words, the immune system mistakes some part of the body as a pathogen and attacks its own cells. This may be restricted to certain organs (e.g. in autoimmune thyroiditis) or involve a particular tissue in different places (e.g. Goodpasture's disease which may affect the basement membrane in both the lung and the kidney). The treatment of autoimmune diseases is typically with immunosuppression—medication which decreases the immune response.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0087">Examples of autoimmune diseases include, but are not limited to, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), Addison's disease, agammaglobulinemia, alopecia areata, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ankylosing spondylitis, antiphospholipid syndrome, antisynthetase syndrome, atopic allergy, atopic dermatitis, autoimmune aplastic anemia, autoimmune cardiomyopathy, autoimmune enteropathy, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune hepatitis, autoimmune inner ear disease, autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, autoimmune peripheral neuropathy, autoimmune pancreatitis, autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome, autoimmune progesterone dermatitis, autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura, autoimmune urticaria, autoimmune uveitis, Balo disease/Balo concentric sclerosis, Behçet's disease, Berger's disease, Bickerstaffs encephalitis, Blau syndrome, Bullous pemphigoid, Castleman's disease, celiac disease, Chagas disease, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Churg-Strauss syndrome, cicatricial pemphigoid, Cogan syndrome, cold agglutinin disease, complement component 2 deficiency, contact dermatitis, cranial arteritis, CREST syndrome, Crohn's disease (one of two types of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease “IBD”), Cushing's Syndrome, cutaneous leukocytoclastic angiitis, Dego's disease, Dercum's disease, dermatitis herpetiformis, dermatomyositis, diabetes mellitus type 1, diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis, Dressler's syndrome, drug-induced lupus, discoid lupus erythematosus, eczema, endometriosis, enthesitis-related arthritis, eosinophilic fasciitis, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, erythema nodosum, erythroblastosis fetalis, essential mixed cryoglobulinemia, Evans syndrome, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressive, fibrosing alveolitis (or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), gastritis, gastrointestinal pemphigoid, giant cell arteritis, glomerulonephritis, Goodpasture's syndrome, Graves' disease, Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), Hashimoto's encephalopathy, Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0011" num="0000">Inflammatory Disease</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0089">Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, are methods of treating an inflammatory disease in an individual in need thereof. Inflammation is part of the complex biological response of vascular tissues to harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, or irritants. Inflammation is a protective attempt by the organism to remove the injurious stimuli and to initiate the healing process. Inflammation is not a synonym for infection, even in cases where inflammation is caused by infection. Although infection is caused by a microorganism, inflammation is one of the responses of the organism to the pathogen. However, inflammation is a stereotyped response, and therefore it is considered as a mechanism of innate immunity, as compared to adaptive immunity, which is specific for each pathogen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0090">Without inflammation, wounds and infections would never heal. Similarly, progressive destruction of the tissue would compromise the survival of the organism. However, chronic inflammation can also lead to a host of diseases, such as hay fever, periodontitis, atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and even cancer (e.g., gallbladder carcinoma). It is for that reason that inflammation is normally closely regulated by the body.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0091">Inflammation can be classified as either acute or chronic. Acute inflammation is the initial response of the body to harmful stimuli and is achieved by the increased movement of plasma and leukocytes (especially granulocytes) from the blood into the injured tissues. A cascade of biochemical events propagates and matures the inflammatory response, involving the local vascular system, the immune system, and various cells within the injured tissue. Prolonged inflammation, known as chronic inflammation, leads to a progressive shift in the type of cells present at the site of inflammation and is characterized by simultaneous destruction and healing of the tissue from the inflammatory process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0092">Inflammatory abnormalities are a large group of disorders which underlie a vast variety of human diseases. The immune system is often involved with inflammatory disorders, demonstrated in both allergic reactions and some myopathies, with many immune system disorders resulting in abnormal inflammation. Non-immune diseases with etiological origins in inflammatory processes include cancer, atherosclerosis, and ischaemic heart disease. A large variety of proteins are involved in inflammation, and any one of them is open to a genetic mutation which impairs or otherwise dysregulates the normal function and expression of that protein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0093">Examples of disorders associated with inflammation include, but are not limited to, acne vulgaris, asthma, autoimmune diseases, celiac disease, chronic prostatitis, glomerulonephritis, hypersensitivities, inflammatory bowel diseases, pelvic inflammatory disease, primary or secondary pulmonary fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, reperfusion injury, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, transplant rejection, vasculitis and interstitial cystitis. Types of inflammation include, but are not limited to, appendicitis, bursitis, colitis, cystitis, dermatitis, meningitis, phlebitis, rhinitis, tendonitis, and tonsillitis</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0216" num="0245">In some embodiments, compounds of Formula (I), (II), (IIa), (III), (IV), or (IVa) exist as enantiomers, diastereomers, or other steroisomeric forms. The compounds disclosed herein include all enantiomeric, diastereomeric, and epimeric forms as well as mixtures thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0217" num="0246">In some embodiments, compounds described herein may be prepared as prodrugs. A “prodrug” refers to an agent that is converted into the parent drug in vivo. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent drug. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug would be a compound described herein, which is administered as an ester (the “prodrug”) to facilitate transmittal across a cell membrane where water solubility is detrimental to mobility but which then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, the active entity, once inside the cell where water-solubility is beneficial. A further example of a prodrug might be a short peptide (polyaminoacid) bonded to an acid group where the peptide is metabolized to reveal the active moiety. In certain embodiments, upon in vivo administration, a prodrug is chemically converted to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound. In certain embodiments, a prodrug is enzymatically metabolized by one or more steps or processes to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0218" num="0247">Prodrug forms of the herein described compounds, wherein the prodrug is metabolized in vivo to produce a compound of (I), (II), (IIa), (III), (IV), or (IVa) as set forth herein are included within the scope of the claims. Prodrug forms of the herein described compounds, wherein the prodrug is metabolized in vivo to produce a compound of Formula (I), (II), (IIa), (III), (IV), or (IVa) as set forth herein are included within the scope of the claims. In some cases, some of the compounds described herein may be a prodrug for another derivative or active compound. In some embodiments described herein, hydrazones are metabolized in vivo to produce a compound of Formula (I), (II), (IIa), (III), (IV), or (IVa).</div>

In one aspect, formulations suitable for intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intravenous injection include physiologically acceptable sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, and sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. Examples of suitable aqueous and non-aqueous carriers, diluents, solvents, or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (propyleneglycol, polyethylene-glycol, glycerol, cremophor and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive oil) and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants. In some embodiments, formulations suitable for subcutaneous injection also contain additives such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying, and dispensing agents. Prevention of the growth of microorganisms can be ensured by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, such as parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the like. In some cases it is desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the use of agents delaying absorption, such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0233" num="0262">For intravenous injections or drips or infusions, compounds described herein are formulated in aqueous solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hank's solution, Ringer's solution, or physiological saline buffer. For transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art. For other parenteral injections, appropriate formulations include aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, preferably with physiologically compatible buffers or excipients. Such excipients are known.</div>

These ingredients are known to those skilled in the preparation of nasal dosage forms and some of these can be found in REMINGTON: THE SCIENCE AND PRACTICE OF PHARMACY, 21st edition, 2005. The choice of suitable carriers is dependent upon the exact nature of the nasal dosage form desired, e.g., solutions, suspensions, ointments, or gels. Nasal dosage forms generally contain large amounts of water in addition to the active ingredient. Minor amounts of other ingredients such as pH adjusters, emulsifiers or dispersing agents, preservatives, surfactants, gelling agents, or buffering and other stabilizing and solubilizing agents are optionally present. Preferably, the nasal dosage form should be isotonic with nasal secretions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0237" num="0266">Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use are obtained by mixing one or more solid excipient with one or more of the compounds described herein, optionally grinding the resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients include, for example, fillers such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or sorbitol; cellulose preparations such as, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, gum tragacanth, methylcellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose; or others such as: polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP or povidone) or calcium phosphate. If desired, disintegrating agents are added, such as the cross-linked croscarmellose sodium, polyvinylpyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt thereof such as sodium alginate. In some embodiments, dyestuffs or pigments are added to the tablets or dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different combinations of active compound doses.</div>

Film coatings including Opadry® typically range from about 1% to about 3% of the tablet weight.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0244" num="0273">In some embodiments, solid dosage forms, e.g., tablets, effervescent tablets, and capsules, are prepared by mixing particles of a compound with one or more pharmaceutical excipients to form a bulk blend composition. The bulk blend is readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms, such as tablets, pills, and capsules. In some embodiments, the individual unit dosages include film coatings. These formulations are manufactured by conventional formulation techniques.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0245" num="0274">In another aspect, dosage forms include microencapsulated formulations. In some embodiments, one or more other compatible materials are present in the microencapsulation material.

In some embodiments, the aqueous dispersions further includes a crystal-forming inhibitor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0248" num="0277">In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical formulations described herein are self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS). Emulsions are dispersions of one immiscible phase in another, usually in the form of droplets. Generally, emulsions are created by vigorous mechanical dispersion. SEDDS, as opposed to emulsions or microemulsions, spontaneously form emulsions when added to an excess of water without any external mechanical dispersion or agitation. An advantage of SEDDS is that only gentle mixing is required to distribute the droplets throughout the solution. Additionally, water or the aqueous phase is optionally added just prior to administration, which ensures stability of an unstable or hydrophobic active ingredient. Thus, the SEDDS provides an effective delivery system for oral and parenteral delivery of hydrophobic active ingredients. In some embodiments, SEDDS provides improvements in the bioavailability of hydrophobic active ingredients. Methods of producing self-emulsifying dosage forms include, but are not limited to, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,858,401, 6,667,048, and 6,960,563.</div>

In addition, the buccal dosage forms described herein can further include a bioerodible (hydrolysable) polymeric carrier that also serves to adhere the dosage form to the buccal mucosa. For buccal or sublingual administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets, lozenges, or gels formulated in a conventional manner.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0021" num="0000">Controlled Release Formulations</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0268" num="0297">In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical dosage forms are formulated to provide a controlled release of a compound of Formula (I), (II), (IIa), (III), (IV), or (IVa). Controlled release refers to the release of the compound from a dosage form in which it is incorporated according to a desired profile over an extended period of time. Controlled release profiles include, for example, sustained release, prolonged release, pulsatile release, and delayed release profiles. In contrast to immediate release compositions, controlled release compositions allow delivery of an agent to a subject over an extended period of time according to a predetermined profile. Such release rates can provide therapeutically effective levels of agent for an extended period of time and thereby provide a longer period of pharmacologic response while minimizing side effects as compared to conventional rapid release dosage forms. Such longer periods of response provide for many inherent benefits that are not achieved with the corresponding short acting, immediate release preparations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0269" num="0298">In some embodiments, the solid dosage forms described herein are formulated as enteric coated delayed release oral dosage forms, i.e., as an oral dosage form of a pharmaceutical composition as described herein which utilizes an enteric coating to affect release in the small intestine or large intestine. In one aspect, the enteric coated dosage form is a compressed or molded or extruded tablet/mold (coated or uncoated) containing granules, powder, pellets, beads or particles of the active ingredient and/or other composition components, which are themselves coated or uncoated. In one aspect, the enteric coated oral dosage form is in the form of a capsule containing pellets, beads or granules, which include a compound of Formula (I), (II), (IIa), (III), (IV), or (IVa), that are coated or uncoated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0270" num="0299">Any coatings should be applied to a sufficient thickness such that the entire coating does not dissolve in the gastrointestinal fluids at pH below about 5, but does dissolve at pH about 5 and above. Coatings are typically selected from any of the following:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0271" num="0300">Shellac—this coating dissolves in media of pH&gt;7; Acrylic polymers—examples of suitable acrylic polymers include methacrylic acid copolymers and ammonium methacrylate copolymers. The Eudragit series E, L, S, RL, RS and NE (Rohm Pharma) are available as solubilized in organic solvent, aqueous dispersion, or dry powders. The Eudragit series RL, NE, and RS are insoluble in the gastrointestinal tract but are permeable and are used primarily for colonic targeting. The Eudragit series E dissolve in the stomach. The Eudragit series L, L-30D and S are insoluble in stomach and dissolve in the intestine; Poly Vinyl Acetate Phthalate (PVAP)—PVAP dissolves in pH&gt;5, and it is much less permeable to water vapor and gastric fluids.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0272" num="0301">Conventional coating techniques such as spray or pan coating are employed to apply coatings. The coating thickness must be sufficient to ensure that the oral dosage form remains intact until the desired site of topical delivery in the intestinal tract is reached.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0273" num="0302">In other embodiments, the formulations described herein are delivered using a pulsatile dosage form. A pulsatile dosage form is capable of providing one or more immediate release pulses at predetermined time points after a controlled lag time or at specific sites.

In one embodiment, the pulsatile dosage form includes at least two groups of particles, (i.e. multiparticulate) each containing the formulation described herein. The first group of particles provides a substantially immediate dose of the compound of Formula (I) upon ingestion by a mammal. The first group of particles can be either uncoated or include a coating and/or sealant. In one aspect, the second group of particles comprises coated particles. The coating on the second group of particles provides a delay of from about 2 hours to about 7 hours following ingestion before release of the second dose. Suitable coatings for pharmaceutical compositions are described herein or known in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0274" num="0303">In some embodiments, pharmaceutical formulations are provided that include particles of a compound of Formula (I), (II), (IIa), (III), (IV), or (IVa) and at least one dispersing agent or suspending agent for oral administration to a subject.

A rat was placed in the box and left free to habituate for 10 minutes. A mobile infrared radiant source (96±10 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) was focused under the non-incised and then under the incised hindpaw and the paw-withdrawal latency was automatically recorded. In order to prevent tissue damage the heat source was automatically turned off after 45 seconds (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</div>

<heading id="h-0112">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0427" num="0456">The current study is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the study doctor nor the patient knows the name of the assigned drug), placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a compound of Formula (I), (II), (IIa), (III), (IV), or (IVa) in patients with postherpetic neuralgia and post-traumatic neuralgia, followed by a double blind extension and an open-label (study doctor and patient knows the name of the study drug) extension. This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a compound of Formula (I), (II), (IIa), (III), (IV), or (IVa) in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe, chronic, neuropathic pain that is not controlled with or without standard pain therapy and who have a diagnosis of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) or post-traumatic neuralgia. The total duration of the study will be approximately 130 weeks (i.e., includes screening phase, 12-week double-blind efficacy phase, double-blind safety extension phase, and the open-label safety extension phase). During the 12 week treatment and 40 week double-blind extension phases, PHN patients will receive Placebo, a Compound of Formula (I), (II), (IIa), (III), (IV), or (IVa) 1, 3, or 10 mg and post-traumatic neuralgia patients will receive placebo or a Compound of Formula (I), (II), (IIa), (III), (IV), or (IVa) 10 mg; all doses will be given as a single, subcutaneous (under the skin) (SC) injection every 28 days. During the 52-week open-label extension phase, all patients will receive a single SC injection of a Compound of Formula (I), (II), (IIa), (III), (IV), or (IVa) up to 10 mg every 4, 8, or 12 weeks.</div>
