<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a national stage filing under U.S.C. § 371 of PCT/US2017/026579, filed Apr. 7, 2017, which claims the benefit of, and priority to, U.S. provisional application No. 62/319,439, filed Apr. 7, 2016; the content of each of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Cells normally maintain a balance between protein synthesis, folding, trafficking, aggregation, and degradation, referred to as protein homeostasis, utilizing sensors and networks of pathways (Sitia et al., <i>Nature </i>426: 891-894, 2003; Ron et al., <i>Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol </i>8: 519-529, 2007). The cellular maintenance of protein homeostasis, or proteostasis, refers to controlling the conformation, binding interactions, location and concentration of individual proteins making up the proteome. Protein folding in vivo is accomplished through interactions between the folding polypeptide chain and macromolecular cellular components, including multiple classes of chaperones and folding enzymes, which minimize aggregation (Wiseman et al., <i>Cell </i>131: 809-821, 2007). Whether a given protein folds in a certain cell type depends on the distribution, concentration, and subcellular localization of chaperones, folding enzymes, metabolites and the like (Wiseman et al.). Cystic fibrosis and other maladies of protein misfolding arise as a result of an imbalance in the capacity of the protein homeostasis (proteostasis) environment to handle the reduced energetic stability of misfolded, mutated proteins that are critical for normal physiology (Balch et al., <i>Science </i>319, 916-9 (2008); Powers, et al., <i>Annu Rev Biochem </i>78, 959-91 (2009); Hutt et al., <i>FEBS Lett </i>583, 2639-46 (2009)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene which encodes a multi-membrane spanning epithelial chloride channel (Riordan et al., <i>Annu Rev Biochem </i>77, 701-26 (2008)). Approximately ninety percent of patients have a deletion of phenylalanine (Phe) 508 (ΔF508) on at least one allele. This mutation results in disruption of the energetics of the protein fold leading to degradation of CFTR in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The ΔF508 mutation is thus associated with defective folding and trafficking, as well as enhanced degradation of the mutant CFTR protein (Qu et al., <i>J Biol Chem </i>272, 15739-44 (1997)). The loss of a functional CFTR channel at the plasma membrane disrupts ionic homeostasis (Cl<sup>−</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, HCO<sub>3</sub> <sup>−</sup>) and airway surface hydration leading to reduced lung function (Riordan et al.). Reduced periciliary liquid volume and increased mucus viscosity impede mucociliary clearance resulting in chronic infection and inflammation, phenotypic hallmarks of CF disease (Boucher, <i>J Intern Med </i>261, 5-16 (2007)). In addition to respiratory dysfunction, ΔF508 CFTR also impacts the normal function of additional organs (pancreas, intestine, gall bladder), suggesting that the loss-of-function impacts multiple downstream pathways that will require correction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition to cystic fibrosis, mutations in the CFTR gene and/or the activity of the CFTR channel has also been implicated in other conditions, including for example, congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens (CBAVD), acute, recurrent, or chronic pancreatitis, disseminated bronchiectasis, asthma, allergic pulmonary aspergillosis, smoking-related lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dry eye disease, Sjogren's syndrome and chronic sinusitis, cholestatic liver disease (e.g. Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)) (Sloane et al. (2012), PLoS ONE 7(6): e39809.doi:10.1371/journal. pone.0039809; Bombieri et al. (2011), J Cyst Fibros. 2011 June; 10 Suppl 2:S86-102; (Albert et al. (2008), Clinical Respiratory Medicine, Third Ed., Mosby Inc.; Levin et al. (2005), Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci., 46(4):1428-34; Froussard (2007), Pancreas 35(1): 94-5), Son et al. (2017) J Med Chem 60(6):2401-10.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">A potential strategy for improving e.g., a drug's metabolic properties, efficacy, and/or safety profile is silicon modification. At the same time, because the general properties are similar to those of carbon, replacement of carbon by silicon would not be expected to affect e.g., the biochemical potency and/or selectivity of the drug as compared to the original chemical entity that contains only carbon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">There remains a need in the art for compounds, compositions and methods of increasing CFTR activity as well as for methods of treating CF, other CFTR-related diseases, and other maladies of protein misfolding.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0056">Individual enantiomers and diasterisomers of disclosed compounds can be prepared synthetically from commercially available starting materials that contain asymmetric or stereogenic centers, or by preparation of racemic mixtures followed by resolution methods well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. These methods of resolution are exemplified by (1) attachment of a mixture of enantiomers to a chiral auxiliary, separation of the resulting mixture of diastereomers by recrystallization or chromatography and liberation of the optically pure product from the auxiliary, (2) salt formation employing an optically active resolving agent, (3) direct separation of the mixture of optical enantiomers on chiral liquid chromatographic columns or (4) kinetic resolution using stereoselective chemical or enzymatic reagents. Racemic mixtures can also be resolved into their component enantiomers by well-known methods, such as chiral-phase liquid chromatography or crystallizing the compound in a chiral solvent. Stereoselective syntheses, a chemical or enzymatic reaction in which a single reactant forms an unequal mixture of stereoisomers during the creation of a new stereocenter or during the transformation of a pre-existing one, are well known in the art. Stereoselective syntheses encompass both enantio- and diastereoselective transformations, and may involve the use of chiral auxiliaries. For examples, see Carreira and Kvaerno, <i>Classics in Stereoselective Synthesis</i>, Wiley-VCH: Weinheim, 2009. Where a particular compound is described or depicted, it is intended to encompass that chemical structure as well as tautomers of that structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0057">The term “enantiomerically pure” means a stereomerically pure composition of a compound. For example, a stereochemically pure composition is a composition that is free or substantially free of other stereoisomers of that compound. In another example, for a compound having one chiral center, an enantiomerically pure composition of the compound is free or substantially free of the other enantiomer. In yet another example, for a compound having two chiral centers, an enantiomerically pure composition is free or substantially free of the other diastereomers.</div>

In another embodiment, a disclosed compound is in a crystalline form.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0060">Isotopically labeled compounds are also contemplated herein, which are identical to those recited herein, except that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the disclosure include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, fluorine and chlorine, such as <sup>2</sup>H, <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>14</sup>C, <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>18</sup>O, <sup>17</sup>O, <sup>31</sup>P, <sup>32</sup>P, <sup>35</sup>S, <sup>18</sup>F, and <sup>36</sup>Cl, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0061">For example, a disclosed compound may have one or more H atoms replaced with deuterium. It will be recognized that some variation of natural isotopic abundance occurs in a synthesized compound depending upon the origin of chemical materials used in the synthesis. Thus, a preparation of N-(2,4-di-tert-butyl-5-hydroxyphenyl)-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxamide wherein at least one carbon atom is replaced by silicon, or a preparation of a disclosed compound having Formula I will inherently contain small amounts of deuterated isotopologues. The concentration of naturally abundant stable hydrogen and carbon isotopes, notwithstanding this variation, is small and immaterial as compared to the degree of stable isotopic substitution of compounds of this disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0062">In the compounds of this disclosure any atom not specifically designated as a particular isotope is meant to represent any stable isotope of that atom. Unless otherwise stated, when a position is designated specifically as “H” or “hydrogen”, the position is understood to have hydrogen at its natural abundance isotopic composition. Also unless otherwise stated, when a position is designated specifically as “D” or “deuterium”, the position is understood to have deuterium at an abundance that is at least 3000 times greater than the natural abundance of deuterium, which is 0.015% (i.e., at least 45% incorporation of deuterium).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0063">The term “isotopic enrichment factor” as used herein means the ratio between the isotopic abundance and the natural abundance of a specified isotope.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0064">In other embodiments, a disclosed compound has an isotopic enrichment factor for each designated deuterium atom of at least 3500 (52.5% deuterium incorporation at each designated deuterium atom), at least 4000 (60% deuterium incorporation), at least 4500 (67.5% deuterium incorporation), at least 5000 (75% deuterium), at least 5500 (82.5% deuterium incorporation), at least 6000 (90% deuterium incorporation), at least 6333.3 (95% deuterium incorporation), at least 6466.7 (97% deuterium incorporation), at least 6600 (99% deuterium incorporation), or at least 6633.3 (99.5% deuterium incorporation).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0065">The term “isotopologue” refers to a species in which the chemical structure differs from a specific compound of this disclosure only in the isotopic composition thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0066">The term “compound,” when referring to a compound of this disclosure, refers to a collection of molecules having an identical chemical structure, except that there may be isotopic variation among the constituent atoms of the molecules. Thus, it will be clear to those of skill in the art that a compound represented by a particular chemical structure containing indicated deuterium atoms, will also contain lesser amounts of isotopologues having hydrogen atoms at one or more of the designated deuterium positions in that structure. The relative amount of such isotopologues in a compound of this disclosure will depend upon a number of factors including the isotopic purity of deuterated reagents used to make the compound and the efficiency of incorporation of deuterium in the various synthesis steps used to prepare the compound. However, as set forth above the relative amount of such isotopologues in total will be less than 49.9% of the compound. In other embodiments, the relative amount of such isotopologues in total will be less than 47.5%, less than 40%, less than 32.5%, less than 25%, less than 17.5%, less than 10%, less than 5%, less than 3%, less than 1%, or less than 0.5% of the compound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0067">Certain isotopically labeled disclosed compounds (e.g., those labeled with <sup>3</sup>H and <sup>14</sup>C) are useful in compound and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated (i.e., <sup>3</sup>H) and carbon-14 (i.e., <sup>14</sup>C) isotopes are suitable for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., <sup>2</sup>H) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence may be suitable in some circumstances. Isotopically labeled compounds can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the examples herein by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0068">In some embodiments one or more of the nitrogen atoms of a disclosed compound if present are oxidized to N-oxide.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0083">For example, provided herein is a method of treating a patient having one or more of the following mutations in the CFTR gene: G1244E, G1349D, G178R, G551S, S1251N, S1255P, S549N, S549R, G970R, or R117H, G551D, and/or G167R, and/or e.g., a patient with one or two copies of the F508del mutation, or one copy of the ΔF508 mutation and a second mutation that results in a gating effect in the CFTR protein (e.g., a patient that is heterozygous for ΔF508 and G551D mutation), a patient with one copy of the ΔF508 mutation and a second mutation that results in residual CFTR activity, or a patient with one copy of the ΔF508 mutation and a second mutation that results in residual CFTR activity, comprising administering an effective amount of a disclosed compound. As described herein, such exemplary methods (e.g., of a patient having one or mutations such as those described above) may include, for example, administering to such patient a combination therapy, e.g., administering (simultaneously or sequentially) an effective amount of VX-661 or lumacaftor to said patient and an effective amount of a disclosed compound that may act as a potentiator or a disclosed compound that may act as an amplifier. Such administration may result, for example, in increased chloride transport in human bronchial epithelial cells with e.g., one or two copies of mutations, e.g, ΔF508 mutation, as compared to administration of lumacaftor or ivacaftor alone. Another combination therapy that includes a disclosed compound may also include an effective amount of a readthrough agent (e.g., ataluren, NB124) and an effect amount of disclosed compound that may act as an amplifier or as a corrector.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0084">The phrase “combination therapy,” as used herein, refers to an embodiment where a patient is co-administered a disclosed compound, a CFTR amplifier, and optionally, one or more CFTR corrector agent(s) (e.g, VX-661 and/or lumacaftor) as part of a specific treatment regimen intended to provide the beneficial effect from the co-action of these therapeutic agents. For example, a beneficial effect of a combination may include, but is not limited to, pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic co-action resulting from the combination of therapeutic agents. For example, administration of a disclosed compound with an amplifier alone or with a CFTR corrector agent (e.g., lumacaftor or VX-661) may result in a level of function (e.g., as measured by chloride activity in HBE cells or patients that have a ΔF508 mutation, that achieves clinical improvement (or better) as compared to the chloride activity level in cells or patients with a G551D mutation receiving a corrector agent alone (e.g., lumacaftor or VX-661). Administration of disclosed therapeutic agents in combination typically is carried out over a defined time period (usually a day, days, weeks, months or years depending upon the combination selected). Combination therapy is intended to embrace administration of multiple therapeutic agents in a sequential manner, that is, wherein each therapeutic agent is administered at a different time, as well as administration of these therapeutic agents, or at least two of the therapeutic agents, in a substantially simultaneous manner. Substantially simultaneous administration can be accomplished, for example, by administering to the subject a single tablet or capsule having a fixed ratio of each therapeutic agent or in multiple, single capsules for each of the therapeutic agents. Sequential or substantially simultaneous administration of each therapeutic agent can be effected by any appropriate route including, but not limited to, oral routes, inhalational routes, intravenous routes, intramuscular routes, and direct absorption through mucous membrane tissues. The therapeutic agents can be administered by the same route or by different routes. For example, a first therapeutic agent of the combination selected may be administered by intravenous injection or inhalation or nebulizer while the other therapeutic agents of the combination may be administered orally. Alternatively, for example, all therapeutic agents may be administered orally or all therapeutic agents may be administered by intravenous injection, inhalation or nebulization.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0085">Combination therapy also can embrace the administration of the therapeutic agents as described above in further combination with other biologically active ingredients and non-drug therapies. Where the combination therapy further comprises a non-drug treatment, the non-drug treatment may be conducted at any suitable time so long as a beneficial effect from the co-action of the combination of the therapeutic agents and non-drug treatment is achieved. For example, in appropriate cases, the beneficial effect is still achieved when the non-drug treatment is temporally removed from the administration of the therapeutic agents, perhaps by a day, days or even weeks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0086">The components of a disclosed combination may be administered to a patient simultaneously or sequentially. It will be appreciated that the components may be present in the same pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and, therefore, are administered simultaneously. Alternatively, the active ingredients may be present in separate pharmaceutical carriers, such as, conventional oral dosage forms, that can be administered either simultaneously or sequentially.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0087">The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt(s)” as used herein refers to salts of acidic or basic groups that may be present in a disclosed compounds used in disclosed compositions. Compounds included in the present compositions that are basic in nature are capable of forming a wide variety of salts with various inorganic and organic acids. The acids that may be used to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of such basic compounds are those that form non-toxic acid addition salts, i.e., salts containing pharmacologically acceptable anions, including, but not limited to, malate, oxalate, chloride, bromide, iodide, nitrate, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, acid phosphate, isonicotinate, acetate, lactate, salicylate, citrate, tartrate, oleate, tannate, pantothenate, bitartrate, ascorbate, succinate, maleate, gentisinate, fumarate, gluconate, glucaronate, saccharate, formate, benzoate, glutamate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate and pamoate (i.e., 1,1′-methylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate)) salts. Compounds included in the present compositions that are acidic in nature are capable of forming base salts with various pharmacologically acceptable cations. Examples of such salts include alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts, particularly calcium, magnesium, sodium, lithium, zinc, potassium, and iron salts. Compounds included in the present compositions that include a basic or acidic moiety may also form pharmaceutically acceptable salts with various amino acids. The compounds of the disclosure may contain both acidic and basic groups; for example, one amino and one carboxylic acid group. In such a case, the compound can exist as an acid addition salt, a zwitterion, or a base salt.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0088">In an embodiment, contemplated methods may include for example, administering prodrugs of the compounds described herein, for example, prodrugs of a compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutical composition thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0089">The term “prodrug” refers to compounds that are transformed in vivo to yield a disclosed compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate of the compound. The transformation may occur by various mechanisms (such as by esterase, amidase, phosphatase, oxidative and or reductive metabolism) in various locations (such as in the intestinal lumen or upon transit of the intestine, blood or liver). Prodrugs are well known in the art (for example, see Rautio, Kumpulainen, et al., <i>Nature Reviews Drug Discovery </i>2008, 7, 255). For example, if a compound of the disclosure or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate of the compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group, a prodrug can comprise an ester formed by the replacement of the hydrogen atom of the acid group with a group such as (C<sub>1-8</sub>)alkyl, (C<sub>2-12</sub>)alkylcarbonyloxymethyl, 1-(alkylcarbonyloxy)ethyl having from 4 to 9 carbon atoms, 1-methyl-1-(alkylcarbonyloxy)-ethyl having from 5 to 10 carbon atoms, alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, 1-(alkoxycarbonyloxy)ethyl having from 4 to 7 carbon atoms, 1-methyl-1-(alkoxycarbonyloxy)ethyl having from 5 to 8 carbon atoms, N-(alkoxycarbonyl)aminomethyl having from 3 to 9 carbon atoms, 1-(N-(alkoxycarbonyl)amino)ethyl having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms, 3-phthalidyl, 4-crotonolactonyl, gamma-butyrolacton-4-yl, di-N,N—(C<sub>1-2</sub>)alkylamino-(C<sub>2-3</sub>)alkyl (such as β-dimethylaminoethyl), carbamoyl-(C<sub>1-2</sub>)alkyl, N,N-di(C<sub>1-2</sub>)alkylcarbamoyl-(C<sub>1-2</sub>)alkyl and piperidino-, pyrrolidino- or morpholino(C<sub>2-3</sub>)alkyl.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0090">Similarly, if a compound of the disclosure contains an alcohol functional group, a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of the hydrogen atom of the alcohol group with a group such as (C<sub>1-6</sub>)alkylcarbonyloxymethyl, 1-((C<sub>1-6</sub>)alkylcarbonyloxy)ethyl, 1-methyl-1-((C<sub>1-6</sub>)alkylcarbonyloxy)ethyl (C<sub>1-6</sub>)alkoxycarbonyloxy)methyl, N—(C<sub>1-6</sub>)alkoxycarbonylaminomethyl, succinoyl, (C<sub>1-6</sub>)alkylcarbonyl, α-amino(C<sub>1-4</sub>)alkylcarbonyl, arylalkylcarbonyl and α-aminoalkylcarbonyl, or α-aminoalkylcarbonyl-α-aminoalkylcarbonyl, where each α-aminoalkylcarbonyl group is independently selected from the naturally occurring L-amino acids, P(O)(OH)<sub>2</sub>, —P(O)(O(C<sub>1-6</sub>)alkyl)<sub>2 </sub>or glycosyl (the radical resulting from the removal of a hydroxyl group of the hemiacetal form of a carbohydrate).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0091">If a compound of the disclosure incorporates an amine functional group, a prodrug can be formed, for example, by creation of an amide or carbamate, an N-alkylcarbonyloxyalkyl derivative, an (oxodioxolenyl)methyl derivative, an N-Mannich base, imine or enamine. In addition, a secondary amine can be metabolically cleaved to generate a bioactive primary amine, or a tertiary amine can metabolically cleaved to generate a bioactive primary or secondary amine. For examples, see Simplicio, et al., <i>Molecules </i>2008, 13, 519 and references therein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0092">Also contemplated in certain embodiments is the use of clathrates of the compounds described herein, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the clathrates, and methods of use of the clathrates. Clathrates of a disclosed compound or a pharmaceutical composition thereof are also contemplated herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0093">As discussed above, the disclosure also contemplates administration of pharmaceutical compositions comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient and a compound described herein. A disclosed compound, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, clathrate or prodrug thereof, can be administered in pharmaceutical compositions comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. The excipient can be chosen based on the expected route of administration of the composition in therapeutic applications. The route of administration of the composition depends on the condition to be treated. For example, intravenous injection may be suitable for treatment of a systemic disorder and oral administration may be suitable to treat a gastrointestinal disorder. The route of administration and the dosage of the composition to be administered can be determined by the skilled artisan without undue experimentation in conjunction with standard dose-response studies. Relevant circumstances to be considered in making those determinations include the condition or conditions to be treated, the choice of composition to be administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, and the severity of the patient's symptoms. A pharmaceutical composition comprising a disclosed compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, clathrate or prodrug, can be administered by a variety of routes including, but not limited to, parenteral, oral, pulmonary, ophthalmic, nasal, rectal, vaginal, aural, topical, buccal, transdermal, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intradermal, intraocular, intracerebral, intralymphatic, intraarticular, intrathecal and intraperitoneal. The compositions can also include, depending on the formulation desired, pharmaceutically-acceptable, non-toxic carriers or diluents, which are defined as vehicles commonly used to formulate pharmaceutical compositions for animal or human administration. The diluent is selected so as not to affect the biological activity of the pharmacologic agent or composition. Examples of such diluents are distilled water, physiological phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solutions, dextrose solution, and Hank's solution. In addition, the pharmaceutical composition or formulation may also include other carriers, adjuvants, or nontoxic, nontherapeutic, nonimmunogenic stabilizers and the like. Pharmaceutical compositions can also include large, slowly metabolized macromolecules such as proteins, polysaccharides such as chitosan, polylactic acids, polyglycolic acids and copolymers (such as latex functionalized SEPHAROSE™, agarose, cellulose, and the like), polymeric amino acids, amino acid copolymers, and lipid aggregates (such as oil droplets or liposomes).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0094">Disclosed compositions can be administered parenterally such as, for example, by intravenous, intramuscular, intrathecal or subcutaneous injection. Parenteral administration can be accomplished by incorporating a composition into a solution or suspension. Such solutions or suspensions may also include sterile diluents such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents. Parenteral formulations may also include antibacterial agents such as, for example, benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens, antioxidants such as, for example, ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite and chelating agents such as EDTA. Buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose may also be added. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0095">Additionally, auxiliary substances, such as wetting or emulsifying agents, surfactants, pH buffering substances and the like can be present in compositions. Other components of pharmaceutical compositions are those of petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin, for example, peanut oil, soybean oil, and mineral oil. In general, glycols such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol are suitable liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0096">Injectable formulations can be prepared either as liquid solutions or suspensions; solid forms suitable for solution in, or suspension in, liquid vehicles prior to injection can also be prepared. The preparation also can also be emulsified or encapsulated in liposomes or micro particles such as polylactide, polyglycolide, or copolymer for enhanced adjuvant effect, as discussed above [Langer, <i>Science </i>249: 1527, 1990 and Hanes, <i>Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews </i>28: 97-119, 1997]. The compositions and pharmacologic agents described herein can be administered in the form of a depot injection or implant preparation which can be formulated in such a manner as to permit a sustained or pulsatile release of the active ingredient.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0097">Additional formulations suitable for other modes of administration include oral, intranasal, and pulmonary formulations, suppositories, transdermal applications and ocular delivery. For suppositories, binders and carriers include, for example, polyalkylene glycols or triglycerides; such suppositories can be formed from mixtures containing the active ingredient in the range of about 0.5% to about 10%, or about 1% to about 2%. Oral formulations include excipients, such as pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, cellulose, and magnesium carbonate. Topical application can result in transdermal or intradermal delivery. Transdermal delivery can be achieved using a skin patch or using transferosomes. [Paul et al., <i>Eur. J. Immunol. </i>25: 3521-24, 1995; Cevc et al., <i>Biochem. Biophys. Acta </i>1368: 201-15, 1998].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0098">For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the pharmaceutical compositions can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, chewing gums and the like. Tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like may also contain binders, excipients, disintegrating agent, lubricants, glidants, sweetening agents, and flavoring agents. Some examples of binders include microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin. Examples of excipients include starch or lactose. Some examples of disintegrating agents include alginic acid, corn starch and the like. Examples of lubricants include magnesium stearate or potassium stearate. An example of a glidant is colloidal silicon dioxide. Some examples of sweetening agents include sucrose, saccharin and the like. Examples of flavoring agents include peppermint, methyl salicylate, orange flavoring and the like. Materials used in preparing these various compositions should be pharmaceutically pure and non-toxic in the amounts used. In another embodiment, the composition is administered as a tablet or a capsule.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0099">Various other materials may be present as coatings or to modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain, in addition to the active ingredient, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor, and the like. For vaginal administration, a pharmaceutical composition may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0100">The pharmaceutical composition can also be administered by nasal administration. As used herein, nasally administering or nasal administration includes administering the composition to the mucus membranes of the nasal passage or nasal cavity of the patient. As used herein, pharmaceutical compositions for nasal administration of a composition include therapeutically effective amounts of the compounds prepared by well-known methods to be administered, for example, as a nasal spray, nasal drop, suspension, gel, ointment, cream or powder. Administration of the composition may also take place using a nasal tampon or nasal sponge.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0101">For topical administration, suitable formulations may include biocompatible oil, wax, gel, powder, polymer, or other liquid or solid carriers. Such formulations may be administered by applying directly to affected tissues, for example, a liquid formulation to treat infection of conjunctival tissue can be administered dropwise to the subject's eye, or a cream formulation can be administered to the skin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0102">Rectal administration includes administering the pharmaceutical compositions into the rectum or large intestine. This can be accomplished using suppositories or enemas. Suppository formulations can easily be made by methods known in the art. For example, suppository formulations can be prepared by heating glycerin to about 120° C., dissolving the pharmaceutical composition in the glycerin, mixing the heated glycerin after which purified water may be added, and pouring the hot mixture into a suppository mold.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0103">Transdermal administration includes percutaneous absorption of the composition through the skin. Transdermal formulations include patches, ointments, creams, gels, salves and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0104">In addition to the usual meaning of administering the formulations described herein to any part, tissue or organ whose primary function is gas exchange with the external environment, for purposes of the present disclosure, “pulmonary” will also mean to include a tissue or cavity that is contingent to the respiratory tract, in particular, the sinuses. For pulmonary administration, an aerosol formulation containing the active agent, a manual pump spray, nebulizer or pressurized metered-dose inhaler as well as dry powder formulations are contemplated. Suitable formulations of this type can also include other agents, such as antistatic agents, to maintain the disclosed compounds as effective aerosols.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0105">A drug delivery device for delivering aerosols comprises a suitable aerosol canister with a metering valve containing a pharmaceutical aerosol formulation as described and an actuator housing adapted to hold the canister and allow for drug delivery. The canister in the drug delivery device has a head space representing greater than about 15% of the total volume of the canister. Often, the compound intended for pulmonary administration is dissolved, suspended or emulsified in a mixture of a solvent, surfactant and propellant. The mixture is maintained under pressure in a canister that has been sealed with a metering valve.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0106">The disclosure also encompasses the treatment of a condition associated with a dysfunction in proteostasis in a subject comprising administering to said subject an effective amount of a disclosed compound that enhances, improves or restores proteostasis of a protein. Proteostasis refers to protein homeostasis. Dysfunction in protein homeostasis is a result of protein misfolding, protein aggregation, defective protein trafficking or protein degradation. For example, the disclosure contemplates s administering a disclosed compound e.g., Formula I that corrects protein misfolding, reduces protein aggregation, corrects or restores protein trafficking and/or affects protein degradation for the treatment of a condition associated with a dysfunction in proteostasis. In some aspects, a disclosed compound e.g., Formula I that corrects protein misfolding and/or corrects or restores protein trafficking is administered. In cystic fibrosis, the mutated or defective enzyme is the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). One of the most common mutations of this protein is ΔF508 which is a deletion (Δ) of three nucleotides resulting in a loss of the amino acid phenylalanine (F) at the 508th (508) position on the protein. As described above, mutated cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator exists in a misfolded state and is characterized by altered trafficking as compared to the wild type CFTR. Additional exemplary proteins of which there can be a dysfunction in proteostasis, for example that can exist in a misfolded state, include, but are not limited to, glucocerebrosidase, hexosamine A, aspartylglucosaminidase, α-galactosidase A, cysteine transporter, acid ceremidase, acid α-L-fucosidase, protective protein, cathepsin A, acid β-glucosidase, acid β-galactosidase, iduronate 2-sulfatase, α-L-iduronidase, galactocerebrosidase, acid α-mannosidase, acid β-mannosidase, arylsulfatase B, arylsulfatase A, N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase, acid β-galactosidase, N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase, acid sphingmyelinase, NPC-1, acid α-glucosidase, β-hexosamine B, heparin N-sulfatase, α-N-acetylglucosaminidase, α-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase, N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase, α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, α-neuramidase, β-glucuronidase, β-hexosamine A and acid lipase, polyglutamine, α-synuclein, TDP-43, superoxide dismutase (SOD), Aβ peptide, tau protein, transthyretin and insulin. The compounds of Formula I can be used to restore proteostasis (e.g., correct folding and/or alter trafficking) of the proteins described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0107">Protein conformational diseases encompass gain of function disorders and loss of function disorders. In one embodiment, the protein conformational disease is a gain of function disorder. The terms “gain of function disorder,” “gain of function disease,” “gain of toxic function disorder” and “gain of toxic function disease” are used interchangeably herein.

Transthyretin-associated aggregation diseases include, for example, senile systemic amyloidoses and familial amyloidotic neuropathy. Lewy body diseases are characterized by an aggregation of α-synuclein protein and include, for example, Parkinson's disease, lewy body dementia (LBD) and multiple system atrophy (SMA). Prion diseases (also known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies or TSEs) are characterized by aggregation of prion proteins. Exemplary human prion diseases are Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker Syndrome, Fatal Familial Insomnia and Kuru. In another embodiment, the misfolded protein is alpha-1 anti-trypsin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0108">In a further embodiment, the protein conformation disease is a loss of function disorder. The terms “loss of function disease” and “loss of function disorder” are used interchangeably herein. Loss of function diseases are a group of diseases characterized by inefficient folding of a protein resulting in excessive degradation of the protein. Loss of function diseases include, for example, lysosomal storage diseases. Lysosomal storage diseases are a group of diseases characterized by a specific lysosomal enzyme deficiency which may occur in a variety of tissues, resulting in the build-up of molecules normally degraded by the deficient enzyme. The lysosomal enzyme deficiency can be in a lysosomal hydrolase or a protein involved in the lysosomal trafficking.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0168">i. Ussing Measurements</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0169" num="0169">As discussed above, Ussing measurements are used to measure CFTR activity. In this method, primary lung epithelial cells (hBEs) homozygous for the Cystic Fibrosis-causing ΔF508 mutation are differentiated for a minimum of 4 weeks in an air-liquid interface on SnapWell filter plates prior to the Ussing measurements. Cells are apically mucus-washed for 30 minutes prior to treatment with compounds. The basolateral media is removed and replaced with media containing the compound of interest diluted to its final concentration from DMSO stocks. Treated cells are incubated at 37° C. and 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>for 24 hours. At the end of the treatment period, the cells on filters are transferred to the Ussing chamber and equilibrated for 30 minutes. The short-circuit current is measured in voltage clamp-mode (V<sub>hold</sub>=0 mV), and the entire assay is conducted at a temperature of 36° C.-36.5° C. Once the voltages are stabilized, the chambers are clamped, and data is recorded by pulse readings every 5 seconds. Following baseline current stabilization, the following additions can be applied and the changes in current and resistance of the cells can be monitored:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0170" num="0170">1. Benzamil to the apical chamber to inhibit ENaC sodium channel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0171" num="0171">2. Forskolin to both chambers to activate ΔF508-CFTR by phosphorylation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0172" num="0172">3. VX-770 to the apical chamber to potentiate ΔF508-CFTR channel opening.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0173" num="0173">4. CFTRinh-172 to the apical chamber to inhibit ΔF508-CFTR Cl— conductance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0174" num="0174">The inhibitable current (that current that is blocked by CFTRinh-172) is measured as the specific activity of the ΔF508-CFTR channel, and increases in response to compound in this activity over that observed in vehicle-treated samples are identified as the correction of ΔF508-CFTR function imparted by the compound tested.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0175" num="0175">The results are shown below in Table 2. (+ indicates activity &lt;200% of a corrector (VX-809 (3 uM)) with compound at 1 uM; ++ indicates activity &gt;200% of a corrector (VX-809 (3 uM)) with compound at 1 uM.</div>
