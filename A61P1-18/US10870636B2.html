<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0002">This invention was made with government support under grant number CA154303 awarded by The National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0003">The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, Erb-B1) belongs to a family of proteins, involved in the proliferation of normal and malignant cells (Artega, C. L., J. Clin. Oncol. 19, 2001, 32-40). Overexpression of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is present in at least 70% of human cancers (Seymour, L. K., Curt. Drug Targets 2, 2001, 117-133) such as, non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC), breast cancers, gliomas, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and prostate cancer (Raymond et al., Drugs 60 Suppl. 1, 2000, discussion 41-2; Salomon et al., Crit. Rev. Oneal. Hematol. 19, 1995, 183-232; Voldborg et al., Ann. Oneal. 8, 1997, 1197-1206). The EGFR-TK is therefore widely recognized as an attractive target for the design and development of compounds that can specifically bind and inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity and its signal transduction pathway in cancer cells, and thus can serve as either diagnostic or therapeutic agents. For example, the EGFR tyrosine kinase (EGFR-TK) reversible inhibitor, TARCEVA®, is approved by the FDA for treatment of NSCLC and advanced pancreatic cancer. Other anti-EGFR targeted molecules have also been approved including LAPATINIB® and IRESSA®. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are effective clinical therapies for EGFR mutant advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients (Mok, T. S., et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 361, 2009, 947-57; Paez, J. G., et al., Science. 304, 2004, 1497-500; Lynch, T. J., et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 350, 2004, 2129-39; Rosell, R., et al., Lancet Oncol. 13, 2012, 239-46). Several randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that EGFR TKIs are more effective, as measured by response rate (RR) and progression free survival (PFS), than chemotherapy when used as initial systemic treatment for advanced EGFR mutant NSCLC (Mok, T. S., et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 361, 2009, 947-57; Rosell, R., et al., Lancet Oncol. 13, 2012, 239-46; Sequist, L. V. et al., J. Clin. Oncol. 31, 2013, 3327-34; Wu, Y. L., et al., Lancet Oncol. 15, 2014, 213-22; Maemondo, M., et al. N. Engl. J. Med. 362, 2010, 2380-8; Zhou, C., et al., Lancet Oncol. 12, 2011, 735-42; Mitsudomi, T., et al., Lancet Oncol. 11, 2010, 121-8). However, the vast majority of patients will develop disease progression following successful treatment with an EGFR TKI. The most common mechanism of acquired resistance, detected in 60% of patients, is a secondary mutation in EGFR at position T790 (T790M) (Yu, H. A., et al., Clin. Cancer Res. 19, 2013, 2240-7). This mutation, leads to an increase in ATP affinity, thus making it more difficult for reversible EGFR TKIs gefitinib and erlotinib to bind the EGFR TKI domain (Yun C. H., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 105, 2008, 2070-5).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0004">Covalent EGFR inhibitors have emerged as strategies to inhibit EGFR T790M containing cancers. In preclinical models, afatinib, a covalent quinazoline based EGFR inhibitor, is effective both in models harboring only an EGFR activating mutation and in those with a concomitant T790M resistance mutation (Li, D., et al., Oncogene. 27, 2008, 4702-11). However, in lung cancer patients, afatinib is only effective in EGFR TKI naive EGFR mutant cancers and has a RR of &lt;10% in patients with NSCLC that have developed resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib (Miller V. A., et al., Lancet Oncol. 13, 2012, 528-38). Afatinib is a potent inhibitor of both mutant and wild type (WT) EGFR. Inhibition of WT EGFR leads to toxicities, including skin rash and diarrhea, which limits the ability to escalate afatinib doses in patients to those necessary to inhibit EGFR T790M. Irreversible pyrimidine EGFR inhibitors, including the tool compound WZ4002 and clinical compounds CO-1686 and AZD9291, overcome many of the limitations of afatinib (Zhou, W., et al., Nature 462, 2009, 1070-4; Walter, A. O., et al., Cancer Discov. 3, 2013, 1404-15; Cross, D. A., et al., Cancer Discov. 2014). They are not only more potent on EGFR T790M, but also selectively inhibit mutant over WT EGFR and hence should lead to increased clinical efficacy and less toxicity compared with afatinib (Zhou, W., et al.; Walter, A. O., et al; Cross, D. A., et al.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0005">Despite the clinical efficacy of irreversible pyrimidine EGFR inhibitors, it is fully anticipated that patients will ultimately develop acquired resistance to these agents. To date little is known about the mechanisms of acquired resistance and whether cross resistance will occur to all irreversible pyrimidine based and to existing EGFR inhibitors. For these reasons, there remains a need for novel and potent small molecule irreversible pyrimidine EGFR inhibitors.</div>

In some embodiments, the drug-resistant EGFR mutant comprises a sensitizing mutation, such as Del and L858R.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0157" num="0155">In some embodiments, the application provides a compound comprising an irreversible kinase inhibitor, wherein the compound inhibits kinase activity of a drug-resistant EGFR mutant harboring a sensitizing mutation (e.g., Del and L858R) and a drug-resistance mutation (e.g., T790M, L718Q, and L844V) with less than a 10-fold difference in potency (e.g., as measured by IC<sub>50</sub>) relative to an EGFR mutant harboring the sensitizing mutation but not the drug-resistance mutation. In some embodiments, the difference in potency is less than about 9-fold, 8-fold, 7-fold, 6-fold, 5-fold, 4-fold, 3-fold, or 2-fold.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0158" num="0156">In some embodiments, the application provides a compound comprising an irreversible kinase inhibitor, wherein the compound is more potent than one or more known EGFR inhibitors, including but not limited to gefitinib, erlotinib, lapatinib, WZ4002, HKI-272, CL-387,785, and AZD9291, at inhibiting the activity of EGFR containing one or more mutations as described herein, such as T790M, L718Q, L844V, L858R, and Del. For example, the compound can be at least about 2-fold, 3-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold, 25-fold, 50-fold or about 100-fold more potent (e.g., as measured by IC<sub>50</sub>) than gefitinib, erlotinib, lapatinib, WZ4002, HKI-272, CL-387,785, and AZD9291 at inhibiting the activity of the EGFR containing one or more mutations as described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0157">In some embodiments, the application provides a compound comprising an irreversible kinase inhibitor, wherein the compound is less potent than one or more known EGFR inhibitors, including but not limited to gefitinib, erlotinib, lapatinib, WZ4002, HKI -272, CL-387,785, and AZD9291, at inhibiting the activity of a wild-type EGFR. For example, the compound can be at least about 2-fold, 3-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold, 25-fold, 50-fold or about 100-fold less potent (e.g., as measured by IC<sub>50</sub>) than gefitinib, erlotinib, lapatinib, WZ4002, HKI-272, CL-387,785, and AZD9291, at inhibiting the activity of a wild-type EGFR.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0158">Potency of the inhibitor can be determined by IC<sub>50 </sub>value. A compound with a lower IC<sub>50 </sub>value, as determined under substantially similar conditions, is a more potent inhibitor relative to a compound with a higher IC<sub>50 </sub>value. In some embodiments, the substantially similar conditions comprise determining an EGFR-dependent phosphorylation level in 3T3 cells expressing a wild type EGFR, a mutant EGFR, or a fragment of any thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0159">An EGFR sensitizing mutation comprises without limitation L858R, G719S, G719C, G719A, L861Q, a deletion in exon 19 and/or an insertion in exon 20.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0160">The selectivity between wild-type EGFR and EGFR containing one or more mutations as described herein can also be measured using cellular proliferation assays where cell proliferation is completely dependent on kinase activity. For example, murine Ba/F3 cells transfected with a suitable version of wild-type EGFR (such as VIII; containing a WT EGFR kinase domain), or Ba/F3 cells transfected with L858R/T790M, Del/T790M/L718Q, L858R/T790M/L718Q or Exon 19 deletion/T790M can be used. Proliferation assays are performed at a range of inhibitor concentrations (10 μM, 3 μM, 1.1 μM, 330 nM, 110 nM, 33 nM, 11 nM, 3 nM, 1 nM) and an EC<sub>50 </sub>is calculated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0161">An alternative method to measure effects on EGFR activity is to assay EGFR phosphorylation. Wild type or mutant (L858R/T790M, Del/T790M, Del/T790M/L718Q, or L858R/T790M/L718Q) EGFR can be transfected into NIH-3T3 cells (which do not normally express endogenous EGFR) and the ability of the inhibitor (using concentrations as above) to inhibit EGFR phosphorylation can be assayed. Cells are exposed to increasing concentrations of inhibitor for 6 hours and stimulated with EGF for 10 minutes. The effects on EGFR phosphorylation are assayed by Western Blotting using phospho-specific (Y1068) EGFR antibodies.</div>

Such compounds can occur as racemates, racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, individual diastereomers, diastereomeric mixtures, and cis- or trans- or E- or Z-double isomeric forms, and other stereoisomeric forms that may be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry, as (R)- or (S)-, or as (D)- or (L)- for amino acids. All such isomeric forms of these compounds are expressly included in the present application. Optical isomers may be prepared from their respective optically active precursors by the procedures described herein, or by resolving the racemic mixtures. The resolution can be carried out in the presence of a resolving agent, by chromatography or by repeated crystallization or by some combination of these techniques which are known to those skilled in the art. Further details regarding resolutions can be found in Jacques, et al., Enantiomers, Racemates, and Resolutions (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1981). The compounds of this application may also be represented in multiple tautomeric forms, in such instances, the application expressly includes all tautomeric forms of the compounds described herein (e.g., alkylation of a ring system may result in alkylation at multiple sites, the application expressly includes all such reaction products). When the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds or other centers of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended that the compounds include both E and Z geometric isomers. Likewise, all tautomeric forms are also intended to be included. The configuration of any carbon-carbon double bond appearing herein is selected for convenience only and is not intended to designate a particular configuration unless the text so states; thus a carbon-carbon double bond depicted arbitrarily herein as trans may be cis, trans, or a mixture of the two in any proportion. All such isomeric forms of such compounds are expressly included in the present application. All crystal forms of the compounds described herein are expressly included in the present application.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0213" num="0211">In the present specification, the structural formula of the compound represents a certain isomer for convenience in some cases, but the present application includes all isomers, such as geometrical isomers, optical isomers based on an asymmetrical carbon, stereoisomers, tautomers, and the like. In addition, a crystal polymorphism may be present for the compounds represented by the formula. It is noted that any crystal form, crystal form mixture, or anhydride or hydrate thereof is included in the scope of the present application. Furthermore, so-called metabolite which is produced by degradation of the present compound in vivo is included in the scope of the present application.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0214" num="0212">“Isomerism” means compounds that have identical molecular formulae but differ in the sequence of bonding of their atoms or in the arrangement of their atoms in space. Isomers that differ in the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed “stereoisomers”. Stereoisomers that are not mirror images of one another are termed “diastereoisomers”, and stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other are termed “enantiomers” or sometimes optical isomers. A mixture containing equal amounts of individual enantiomeric forms of opposite chirality is termed a “racemic mixture”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0215" num="0213">A carbon atom bonded to four nonidentical substituents is termed a “chiral center”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0216" num="0214">“Chiral isomer” means a compound with at least one chiral center. Compounds with more than one chiral center may exist either as an individual diastereomer or as a mixture of diastereomers, termed “diastereomeric mixture”. When one chiral center is present, a stereoisomer may be characterized by the absolute configuration (R or S) of that chiral center. Absolute configuration refers to the arrangement in space of the substituents attached to the chiral center. The substituents attached to the chiral center under consideration are ranked in accordance with the Sequence Rule of Cahn, Ingold and Prelog. (Cahn et al., <i>Angew. Chem. Inter. Edit. </i>1966, 5, 385; errata 511; Cahn et al., <i>Angew. Chem. </i>1966, 78, 413; Cahn and Ingold, <i>J. Chem. Soc. </i>1951 (London), 612; Cahn et al., <i>Experientia </i>1956, 12, 81; Cahn, <i>J. Chem. Educ. </i>1964, 41, 116).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0217" num="0215">“Geometric isomer” means the diastereomers that owe their existence to hindered rotation about double bonds. These configurations are differentiated in their names by the prefixes cis and trans, or Z and E, which indicate that the groups are on the same or opposite side of the double bond in the molecule according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0218" num="0216">Furthermore, the structures and other compounds discussed in this application include all atropic isomers thereof. “Atropic isomers” are a type of stereoisomer in which the atoms of two isomers are arranged differently in space. Atropic isomers owe their existence to a restricted rotation caused by hindrance of rotation of large groups about a central bond. Such atropic isomers typically exist as a mixture, however as a result of recent advances in chromatography techniques; it has been possible to separate mixtures of two atropic isomers in select cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0219" num="0217">“Tautomer” is one of two or more structural isomers that exist in equilibrium and is readily converted from one isomeric form to another. This conversion results in the formal migration of a hydrogen atom accompanied by a switch of adjacent conjugated double bonds. Tautomers exist as a mixture of a tautomeric set in solution. In solid form, usually one tautomer predominates. In solutions where tautomerization is possible, a chemical equilibrium of the tautomers will be reached. The exact ratio of the tautomers depends on several factors, including temperature, solvent and pH. The concept of tautomers that are interconvertable by tautomerizations is called tautomerism.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0220" num="0218">Of the various types of tautomerism that are possible, two are commonly observed. In keto-enol tautomerism a simultaneous shift of electrons and a hydrogen atom occurs. Ring-chain tautomerism arises as a result of the aldehyde group (—CHO) in a sugar chain molecule reacting with one of the hydroxy groups (—OH) in the same molecule to give it a cyclic (ring-shaped) form as exhibited by glucose. Common tautomeric pairs are: ketone-enol, amide-nitrile, lactam-lactim, amide-imidic acid tautomerism in heterocyclic rings (e.g., in nucleobases such as guanine, thymine and cytosine), amine-enamine and enamine-enamine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0221" num="0219">The term “crystal polymorphs”, “polymorphs” or “crystal forms” means crystal structures in which a compound (or a salt or solvate thereof) can crystallize in different crystal packing arrangements, all of which have the same elemental composition. Different crystal forms usually have different X-ray diffraction patterns, infrared spectral, melting points, density hardness, crystal shape, optical and electrical properties, stability and solubility. Recrystallization solvent, rate of crystallization, storage temperature, and other factors may cause one crystal form to dominate. Crystal polymorphs of the compounds can be prepared by crystallization under different conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0222" num="0220">Additionally, the compounds of the present application, for example, the salts of the compounds, can exist in either hydrated or unhydrated (the anhydrous) form or as solvates with other solvent molecules. Nonlimiting examples of hydrates include monohydrates, dihydrates, etc. Nonlimiting examples of solvates include ethanol solvates, acetone solvates, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0223" num="0221">“Solvate” means solvent addition forms that contain either stoichiometric or non stoichiometric amounts of solvent. Some compounds have a tendency to trap a fixed molar ratio of solvent molecules in the crystalline solid state, thus forming a solvate. If the solvent is water the solvate formed is a hydrate; and if the solvent is alcohol, the solvate formed is an alcoholate. Hydrates are formed by the combination of one or more molecules of water with one molecule of the substance in which the water retains its molecular state as H<sub>2</sub>O.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0224" num="0222">The present application is intended to include all isotopes of atoms occurring in the present compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. By way of general example and without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen include tritium and deuterium, and isotopes of carbon include C-13 and C-14.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0225" num="0223">It is to be understood that the compounds of the present application may be depicted as different tautomers. It should also be understood that when compounds have tautomeric forms, all tautomeric forms are intended to be included in the scope of the present application, and the naming of the compounds does not exclude any tautomer form.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0226" num="0224">The synthesized compounds can be separated from a reaction mixture and further purified by a method such as column chromatography, high pressure liquid chromatography, or recrystallization.

Radiation is commonly delivered internally (implantation of radioactive material near cancer site) or externally from a machine that employs photon (x-ray or gamma-ray) or particle radiation. Where the combination therapy further comprises radiation treatment, the radiation treatment may be conducted at any suitable time so long as a beneficial effect from the co-action of the combination of the therapeutic agents and radiation treatment is achieved. For example, in appropriate cases, the beneficial effect is still achieved when the radiation treatment is temporally removed from the administration of the therapeutic agents, perhaps by days or even weeks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0306" num="0304">It will be appreciated that compounds of the application can be used in combination with an immunotherapeutic agent. One form of immunotherapy is the generation of an active systemic tumor-specific immune response of host origin by administering a vaccine composition at a site distant from the tumor. Various types of vaccines have been proposed, including isolated tumor-antigen vaccines and anti-idiotype vaccines. Another approach is to use tumor cells from the subject to be treated, or a derivative of such cells (reviewed by Schirrmacher et al. (1995) J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 121:487). In U.S. Pat. No. 5,484,596, Hanna Jr. et al. claim a method for treating a resectable carcinoma to prevent recurrence or metastases, comprising surgically removing the tumor, dispersing the cells with collagenase, irradiating the cells, and vaccinating the patient with at least three consecutive doses of about 10<sup>7 </sup>cells.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0308" num="0306">The pharmaceutical compositions of the present application comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present application formulated together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. As used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” means a non-toxic, inert solid, semi-solid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type. The pharmaceutical compositions of this application can be administered to humans and other animals orally, rectally, parenterally, intracistemally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, or drops), buccally, or as an oral or nasal spray.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0309" num="0307">Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0310" num="0308">Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0311" num="0309">In order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0352" num="0364">For the synthesis of TX2-30, the warhead part of WZ4002 was synthesized as previously shown (Nature 2009). The biotin tail was introduced following the procedure from ZW, H W et al Chem. Biol. 2010. Briefly, cell lysate was incubated with indicated concentrations of TX2-30 for 1 hour at 4 C. Excess compound was removed using DG-10 column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif.). The protein was further denatured with 8M Urea solution. The addition of Streptavidin beads (Sigma) was followed by 1 hour incubation at room temperature.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0042" num="0000">Pepsin Digestion and Peptide Analysis</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0354" num="0366">For the elucidation of the modification site, all three proteins (50 pmol each) were digested offline with pepsin in an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:1. The pepsin digestion was performed in a potassium phosphate buffer (75 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>/75 mM K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>) pH 2.5. The reaction was carried out for 5 minutes on ice. The resulting peptides were injected into a Waters nanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters, Milford, Mass.) and trapped and desalted for 3 min at 100 μL/min and then separated in 60 min by an 8%-40% acetonitrile:water gradient at 40 μL/min. The separation column was a 1.0×100.0 mm ACQUITY UPLC C18 BEH (Waters) containing 1.7 μm particles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0355" num="0367">Mass spectra were obtained with a Waters QTOF Premier equipped with standard ESI source (Waters Corp., Milford, Mass., USA). The instrument configuration was the following: capillary was 3.5 kV, trap collision energy at V, sampling cone at 37 V, source temperature of 100° C. and desolvation temperature of 250° C. Mass spectra were acquired over an m/z range of 100 to 2000. Mass accuracy was ensured by calibration with 100 fmol/μL GFP, and was less than 10 ppm throughout all experiments. Identification of the peptic fragments was accomplished through a combination of exact mass analysis and MS<sup>E12 </sup>using custom Identity Software from the Waters Corporation. MS<sup>E </sup>was performed by a series of low-high collision energies ramping from 5-25 V, therefore ensuring proper fragmentation of all the peptic peptides eluting from the LC system.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0356" num="0368">EGFR-TL (T790M/L858R) mice are generated as previously described (Li, D. et al. Cancer Cell 12, 81-93 (2007)). EGFR exon 19 Deletion-T790M (TD) inducible bitransgenic mice are similarly generated and characterized. Briefly, exon 19 deletion is introduced in the human EGFR gene through site directed mutagenesis in the pTRE2-hyg-EGFR-T790M. The constructs were then digested with Xhol to release the entire allele containing Tet-op-EGFR TD-beta-globin PolyA. Transgenic mice are then generated by injection of the construct into FVB/N fertilized eggs. Progeny are genotyped through PCR exactly the same as reported. Founders are crossed with CCSP-rtTA mice and inducible bitransgenic mice with high and inducible expression of the mutant hEGFR transgene are identified and expanded for subsequent analyses and experiments. All mice are housed in a pathogen-free environment at the Harvard School of Public Health and are handled in strict accordance with Good Animal Practice as defined by the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare, and all animal work is done with Dana-Farber Cancer Institute IACUC approval.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0357" num="0369">Cohorts of EGFR TL/CCSP-rtTA and EGFR TD/CCSP-rtTA are put on doxycycline diet at 5 weeks of age to induce the expression of mutant EGFR. These mice undergo MRI after 6 to 8 weeks of doxycycline diet to document and quantify the lung cancer burden before being assigned to various treatment study cohorts. There is a minimum of 3 mice per treatment group. Mice are then treated either with vehicle (NMP (10% 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone: 90% PEG-300) alone or a compound of Formula (I) at 25 mg/kg gavage daily. After 2 weeks of treatment, these mice undergo a second round of MRI to document their response to the treatment. MRIs and tumor burden measurement were performed as described previously (Li, D. et al. Cancer Cell 12, 81-93 (2007); Ji, H. et al. Cancer Cell 9, 485-95 (2006)).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0361" num="0373">Blood samples: Blood samples (0.06 mL) are collected from saphenous vein of each mouse at regular intervals. During each sampling point, blood samples are collected in labeled microtubes containing K2EDTA as an anticoagulant. Samples are centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min at 4±2° C. (Centrifuge Model: Kubota 3500). The recovered quantity of plasma from each sample is transferred to labeled micro-tubes. The plasma samples are stored at −70° C. until bioanalysis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0362" num="0374">Bioanalysis of samples: Bioanalytical method for the determination of a compound of Formula (I) in mouse plasma is developed using LC-MS/MS equipment. The method is partially validated prior to sample analysis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0363" num="0375">Pharmacokinetic analysis: The pharmacokinetic parameters of a compound of Formula (I) such as T<sub>max</sub>, C<sub>max</sub>, AUC, CL, V<sub>d</sub>, T<sub>1/2</sub>, and bioavailability in mouse plasma are determined from the concentration-time data using non-compartmental analysis (WinNonlin Enterprise version 5.2, Pharsight Corporation, USA).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0048" num="0000">Statistical Analyses</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0365" num="0377">Statistical analyses were performed using an unpaired two tailed Student's t-test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0366" num="0378">The selectivity between wild-type EGFR and the L858R/T790M, Exon 19 Deletion/T790M, Del/T790M/L718Q, or L858R/T790M/L718Q EGFR mutants is measured using cellular proliferation assays where cell proliferation is completely dependent on kinase activity. For example, murine Ba/F3 cells transfected with a suitable version of wild-type EGFR (containing a WT EGFR kinase domain), or Ba/F3 cells transfected with L858R/T790M, Exon 19 Deletion/T790M, Del/T790M/L718Q, or L858R/T790M/L718Q are used. Proliferation assays were performed at a range of inhibitor concentrations (10 μM, 3 μM, 1.1 μM, 330 nM, 110 nM, 33 nM, 11 nM, 3 nM, 1 nM) and an EC<sub>50 </sub>is calculated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0367" num="0379">An alternative method to measure effects on EGFR activity is to assay EGFR phosphorylation. Wild type or mutant (L858R/T790M, Del/T790M, Del/T790M/L718Q, or L858R/T790M/L718Q) EGFR was transfected into NIH-3T3 cells (which do not normally express endogenous EGFR) and the ability of the inhibitor (using concentrations as above) to inhibit EGFR phosphorylation was assayed. Cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of inhibitor for 6 hours and stimulated with EGF for 10 minutes. The effects on EGFR phosphorylation were assayed by Western Blotting using phospho-specific (Y1068) EGFR antibodies.</div>
