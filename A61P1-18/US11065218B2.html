<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Inflammation involves the activation of the immune system in response to harmful stimuli, such as, e.g., a pathogen, infection, irritant, or damage to cells. As a stereotyped response, inflammation is a mechanism of innate immunity, as compared to adaptive immunity, which is specific for each pathogen. Inflammation can be classified as either acute or chronic. Generally speaking, acute inflammation is mediated by granulocytes, while chronic inflammation is mediated by mononuclear cells such as monocytes and lymphocytes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Acute inflammation is an initial protective response of the body to remove an injurious stimulus by maintaining tissue integrity and contributing to tissue repair. It a part of the body's natural defense system against injury and disease, and in the absence of acute inflammation, wounds and infections would never heal and progressive destruction of the tissue would compromise the survival of the organism.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">The process of acute inflammation is initiated by cells already present in all tissues, mainly resident macrophages, dendritic cells, histiocytes, Kupffer cells, mastocytes, vascular endothelial cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells. At the onset of a harmful stimulus, these cells undergo activation and release inflammatory mediating and sensitizing molecules, such as, e.g., pro-inflammatory cytokines, pro-inflammatory prostaglandins, leukotrienes, histamine, serotonin, neutral proteases, bradykinin and nitric oxide. These inflammatory molecules modulate a complex series of biological events involving cellular and acellular components of the local vascular system, the immune system, and the injured tissue site to propagate and mature the inflammatory response. These events are responsible for eliciting an acute inflammatory response, typically characterized by 1) vasodilatation which increases blood flow into the tissue thereby causing erythema (redness and warmth), which may extend beyond this site (the flare response); 2) blood vessel permeability which increases plasma leakage into the tissue thereby causing edema (swelling); 3) alter the excitability of certain sensory neurons causing hypersensitivity and pain; 4) stimulate the release of inflammation inducing molecules such as, e.g., neuropeptides like substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), prostaglandins, and amino acids like glutamate, from the peripheral nerve endings; and 5) increase migration of leukocytes, mainly granulocytes, from the blood vessels into the tissue. An acute inflammatory response requires constant stimulation to be sustained and must be actively terminated when no longer needed. Hence, acute inflammation ceases once the injurious stimulus has been removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">However, severe or prolonged noxious stimulation results in a chronic inflammatory response that leads to a progressive shift in the type of cells present at the site of tissue injury. Chronic inflammation may be characterized as the simultaneous destruction and healing of tissue from the inflammatory process, with the net result of provoking injury rather than mediating repair. As such, chronic inflammation is a disease. As an inflammatory response can occur anywhere in the body, chronic inflammation has been implicated in the pathophysiology of a wide range of seemingly unrelated disorders which underlay a large and varied group of human diseases. For example, chronic inflammation is involved in diseases as diverse as cardiovascular diseases, cancers, allergies, obesity, diabetes, digestive system diseases, degenerative diseases, auto-immune disorders, and Alzheimer's disease.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Attempts to treat chronic inflammation have met with limited success. This is due, in part, to the fact that the etiology of chronic inflammation is a complex response based in part on the various inflammation inducing molecules and the multitude of inflammation mediating and sensitizing molecules that appear to elicit inflammation via redundant mechanism. In addition, besides blocking pro-inflammatory molecules, many anti-inflammatory drugs, also inhibit regulatory loops that release endogenous anti-inflammatory molecules. For example, NSAIDs reduce inflammation by blocking the enzymatic activity of cyclooxygenase, a key enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Thus, NSAIDs reduce inflammation by preventing the synthesis of all prostaglandins. However, NSAIDs not only prevents the synthesis of proinflammatory prostaglandins, these compounds also prevent the synthesis of anti-inflammatory prostaglandins. Hence, NSAIDs have limited success as they block endogenous anti-inflammatory response, which in some instances may prolong chronic inflammation. Therefore, compounds, compositions, uses, and methods preferentially inhibiting pro-inflammatory responses would be highly desirable for the treatment of chronic inflammation.</div>

<heading id="h-0003">DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">Aspects of the present specification disclose, in part, a pharmaceutical composition. As used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable” means any molecular entity or composition that does not produce an adverse, allergic or other untoward or unwanted reaction when administered to an individual. As used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable composition” is synonymous with “pharmaceutical composition” and means a therapeutically effective concentration of an active ingredient, such as, e.g., any of the therapeutic compounds disclosed herein. A pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein is useful for medical and veterinary applications. A pharmaceutical composition may be administered to an individual alone, or in combination with other supplementary active ingredients, agents, drugs or hormones.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">A pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein may optionally include a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier that facilitates processing of an active ingredient into pharmaceutically-acceptable compositions. As used herein, the term “pharmacologically-acceptable carrier” is synonymous with “pharmacological carrier” and means any carrier that has substantially no long term or permanent detrimental effect when administered and encompasses terms such as “pharmacologically acceptable vehicle, stabilizer, diluent, additive, auxiliary or excipient.” Such a carrier generally is mixed with an active compound or permitted to dilute or enclose the active compound and can be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid agent. It is understood that the active ingredients can be soluble or can be delivered as a suspension in the desired carrier or diluent. Any of a variety of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be used including, without limitation, aqueous media such as, e.g., water, saline, glycine, hyaluronic acid and the like; solid carriers such as, e.g., mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, talcum, cellulose, glucose, sucrose, magnesium carbonate, and the like; solvents; dispersion media; coatings; antibacterial and antifungal agents; isotonic and absorption delaying agents; or any other inactive ingredient. Selection of a pharmacologically acceptable carrier can depend on the mode of administration. Except insofar as any pharmacologically acceptable carrier is incompatible with the active ingredient, its use in pharmaceutically acceptable compositions is contemplated. Non-limiting examples of specific uses of such pharmaceutical carriers can be found in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems (Howard C. Ansel et al., eds., Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins Publishers, 7th ed. 1999); REMINGTON: THE SCIENCE AND PRACTICE OF PHARMACY (Alfonso R. Gennaro ed., Lippincott, Williams &amp; Wilkins, 20th ed. 2000); Goodman &amp; Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (Joel G. Hardman et al., eds., McGraw-Hill Professional, 10th ed. 2001); and Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients (Raymond C. Rowe et al., APhA Publications, 4th edition 2003). These protocols are routine procedures and any modifications are well within the scope of one skilled in the art and from the teaching herein.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">Prostaglandins mediate a local inflammatory response and are involved in all inflammatory functions through action on prostaglandin receptors and mediate inflammatory signaling including chemotaxis (macrophages, neutrophils and eosinophils), vasodilation and algesia. However, the PG-mediated inflammatory response is self-limiting (resolving). The principle resolution factor is a prostaglandin called 15dPGJ2, which is an endogenous agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) signaling. PPARγ signaling pathway 1) induces apoptosis of Macrophage M1 cells, thereby reducing the levels of Th1 pro-inflammatory cytokines and 2) promotes differentiation of monocytes into Macrophage M2 cells. Macrophage M2 cells produce and release Th2 anti-inflammatory cytokines.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are a group of nuclear receptor proteins that function as transcription factors regulating the expression of genes. All PPARs are known to heterodimerize with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and bind to specific regions on the DNA of target genes called peroxisome proliferator hormone response elements (PPREs). PPARs play essential roles in the regulation of cellular differentiation, development, and metabolism (carbohydrate, lipid, protein), and tumorigenesis of higher organisms. The family comprises three members, PPAR-α, PPAR-γ, and PPAR-δ (also known as PPAR-β). PPAR-α is expressed in liver, kidney, heart, muscle, adipose tissue, as well as other tissues. PPAR-δ is expressed in many tissues but markedly in brain, adipose tissue, and skin. PPAR-γ comprises three alternatively-spliced forms, each with a different expression pattern. PPAR-γ1 is expressed in virtually all tissues, including heart, muscle, colon, kidney, pancreas, and spleen. PPAR-γ2 is expressed mainly in adipose tissue. PPAR-γ3 is expressed in macrophages, large intestine, and white adipose tissue. Endogenous ligands for the PPARs include free fatty acids and eicosanoids. PPAR-γ is activated by PGJ2 (a prostaglandin), whereas PPAR-α is activated by leukotriene B4.</div>

There are several classes of anti-hyperlipidemic agents (also known as hypolipidemic agents). They may differ in both their impact on the cholesterol profile and adverse effects. For example, some may lower low density lipoprotein (LDL), while others may preferentially increase high density lipoprotein (HDL). Clinically, the choice of an agent will depend on the cholesterol profile of an individual, cardiovascular risk of an individual, and/or the liver and kidney functions of an individual. Examples of a suitable anti-hyperlipidemic agent include, without limitation, a fibrate, a statin, a tocotrienol, a niacin, a bile acid sequestrants (resin), a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, a pancreatic lipase inhibitor, and a sympathomimetic amine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">A therapeutic compound disclosed herein may be a fibrate. Fibrates are a class of amphipathic carboxylic acids with lipid level modifying properties. These therapeutic compounds are used for a range of metabolic disorders.

Examples of a suitable fibrate include, without limitation, Bezafibrate, Ciprofibrate, Clofibrate, Gemfibrozil, and Fenofibrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">A therapeutic compound disclosed herein may be a statin. Statins (or HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) are a class of therapeutic compounds used to lower LDL and/or cholesterol levels by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which plays a central role in the production of cholesterol in the liver. To compensate for the decreased cholesterol availability, synthesis of hepatic LDL receptors is increased, resulting in an increased clearance of LDL particles from the blood. Examples of a suitable statin include, without limitation, Atorvastatin, Fluvastatin, Lovastatin, Pitavastatin, Pravastatin, Rosuvastatin, and Simvastatin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">A therapeutic compound disclosed herein may be a tocotrienol. Tocotrienols are another class of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and may be used to lower LDL and/or cholesterol levels by inducing hepatic LDL receptor up-regulation and/or decreasing plasma LDL levels.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">A therapeutic compound disclosed herein may be a niacin. Niacins are a class of therapeutic compounds with lipid level modifying properties. For example, a niacin may lower LDL by selectively inhibiting hepatic diacyglycerol acyltransferase 2, reduce triglyceride synthesis, and VLDL secretion through a receptor HM74 and HM74A or GPR109A. These therapeutic compounds are used for a range of metabolic disorders. One non-limiting use is as an anti-hyperlipidemic agent where it may inhibit the breakdown of fats in adipose tissue. Because a niacin blocks the breakdown of fats, it causes a decrease in free fatty acids in the blood and, as a consequence, decreases the secretion of very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and cholesterol by the liver. By lowering VLDL levels, a niacin may also increase the level of HDL in blood. Examples of a suitable niacin include, without limitation, acipimox, niacin, nicotinamide, and vitamin B3.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">A therapeutic compound disclosed herein may be a bile acid sequestrant. Bile acid sequestrants (also known as resins) are a class of therapeutic compounds used to bind certain components of bile in the gastrointestinal tract. They disrupt the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids by sequestering them and preventing their reabsorption from the gut. Bile acid sequestrants are particularly effective for lowering LDL and cholesterol by sequestering the cholesterol-containing bile acids released into the intestine and preventing their reabsorption from the intestine. In addition, a bile acid sequestrant may also raise HDL levels. Examples of a suitable bile acid sequestrant include, without limitation, Cholestyramine, Colesevelam, and Colestipol.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">A therapeutic compound disclosed herein may be a cholesterol absorption inhibitor. Cholesterol absorption inhibitors are a class of therapeutic compounds that inhibits the absorption of cholesterol from the intestine. Decreased cholesterol absorption leads to an upregulation of LDL-receptors on the surface of cells and an increased LDL-cholesterol uptake into these cells, thus decreasing levels of LDL in the blood plasma. Examples of a suitable cholesterol absorption inhibitor include, without limitation, Ezetimibe, a phytosterol, a sterol and a stanol.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">A therapeutic compound disclosed herein may be a fat absorption inhibitor. Fat absorption inhibitors are a class of therapeutic compounds that inhibits the absorption of fat from the intestine. Decreased fat absorption reduces caloric intake. In one aspect, a fat absorption inhibitor inhibits pancreatic lipase, an enzyme that breaks down triglycerides in the intestine. Examples of a suitable fat absorption inhibitor include, without limitation, Orlistat.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">A therapeutic compound disclosed herein may be a sympathomimetic amine. Sympathomimetic amines are a class of therapeutic compounds that mimic the effects of transmitter substances of the sympathetic nervous system such as catecholamines, epinephrine (adrenaline), norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and/or dopamine. A sympathomimetic amine may act as an α-adrenergic agonist, a β-adrenergic agonist, a dopaminergic agonist, a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, and a COMT inhibitor. Such therapeutic compounds, among other things, are used to treat cardiac arrest, low blood pressure, or even delay premature labor. Examples of a suitable sympathomimetic amine include, without limitation, Clenbuterol, Salbutamol, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, methamphetamine, amphetamine, phenylephrine, isoproterenol, dobutamine, methylphenidate, lisdexamfetamine, cathine, cathinone, methcathinone, cocaine, benzylpiperazine (BZP), methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), 4-methylaminorex, pemoline, phenmetrazine, and propylhexedrine.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">A lipid useful in the pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein may be a pharmaceutically-acceptable fatty acid. A fatty acid comprises a carboxylic acid with a long unbranched hydrocarbon chain which may be either saturated or unsaturated. Thus arrangement confers a fatty acid with a polar, hydrophilic end, and a nonpolar, hydrophobic end that is insoluble in water. Most naturally occurring fatty acids have a hydrocarbon chain of an even number of carbon atoms, typically between 4 and 24 carbons, and may be attached to functional groups containing oxygen, halogens, nitrogen, and sulfur. Synthetic or non-natural fatty acids may have a hydrocarbon chain of any number of carbon atoms from between 3 and 40 carbons. Where a double bond exists, there is the possibility of either a cis or a trans geometric isomerism, which significantly affects the molecule's molecular configuration. Cis-double bonds cause the fatty acid chain to bend, an effect that is more pronounced the more double bonds there are in a chain. Most naturally occurring fatty acids are of the cis configuration, although the trans form does exist in some natural and partially hydrogenated fats and oils.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">The pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein act as a delivery system that enable a therapeutic compound disclosed herein to be more effectively delivered or targeted to a cell type, tissue, organ, or region of the body in a manner that more effectively inhibits a pro-inflammatory response. This inhibition results in an improved treatment of a chronic inflammation. For example, a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein may facilitate the delivery of a therapeutic compound disclosed herein into macrophages. One possible mechanism that achieves this selective biodistribution is that the pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein may be designed to take advantage of the activity of chylomicrons. Chylomicrons are relatively large lipoprotein particles having a diameter of 75 nm to 1,200 nm. Comprising triglycerides (85-92%), phospholipids (6-12%), cholesterol (1-3%) and apolipoproteins (1-2%), chylomicrons transport dietary lipids from the intestines to other locations in the body. Chylomicrons are one of the five major groups of lipoproteins, the others being VLDL, IDL, low-density lipoproteins (LDL), high-density lipoproteins (HDL), that enable fats and cholesterol to move within the water-based solution of the bloodstream.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">During digestion, fatty acids and cholesterol undergo processing in the gastrointestinal tract by the action of pancreatic juices including lipases and emulsification with bile salts to generate micelles. These micelles allow the absorption of lipid as free fatty acids by the absorptive cells of the small intestine, known as enterocytes. Once in the enterocytes, triglycerides and cholesterol are assembled into nascent chylomicrons. Nascent chylomicrons are primarily composed of triglycerides (85%) and contain some cholesterol and cholesteryl esters. The main apolipoprotein component is apolipoprotein B-48 (APOB48). These nascent chylomicrons are released by exocytosis from enterocytes into lacteals, lymphatic vessels originating in the villi of the small intestine, and are then secreted into the bloodstream at the thoracic duct's connection with the left subclavian vein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">While circulating in lymph and blood, chylomicrons exchange components with HDL. The HDL donates apolipoprotein C-II (APOC2) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) to the nascent chylomicron and thus converts it to a mature chylomicron (often referred to simply as “chylomicron”). APOC2 is the cofactor for lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity. Once triglyceride stores are distributed, the chylomicron returns APOC2 to the HDL (but keeps APOE), and, thus, becomes a chylomicron remnant, now only 30-50 nm. APOB48 and APOE are important to identify the chylomicron remnant in the liver for endocytosis and breakdown into lipoproteins (VLDL, LDL and HDL). These lipoproteins are processed and stored by competent cells, including, e.g., hepatocytes, adipocytes and macrophages. Thus, without wishing to be limited by any theory, upon oral administration of the pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein are processed into micelles while in the gastrointestinal tract, absorbed by enterocytes and assembled into nascent chylomicrons, remain associated with chylomicron remnants taken up by the liver, and ultimately loaded into macrophages.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">A pharmaceutical composition produced using the methods disclosed herein may be a liquid formulation or a solid or semi-solid formulation. A liquid formulation can be formed by using various lipids like oils of other fatty acids that remain as liquids in the temperature range desired. In an embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein is liquid at room temperature. In aspects of this embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein may be formulated to be a liquid at a temperature of, e.g., about 25° C. or higher, about 23° C. or higher, about 21° C. or higher, about 19° C. or higher, about 17° C. or higher, about 15° C. or higher, about 12° C. or higher, about 10° C. or higher, about 8° C. or higher, about 6° C. or higher, about 4° C. or higher, or about 0° C. or higher.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">A solid or semi-solid formulation disclosed herein takes advantage of the different melting point temperatures of the various adjuvants like fatty acids. Formation of a solid or semi-solid dosage form can be by modifying the respective concentrations of the fatty acids comprising a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein. For example, linolenic acid has a melting point temperature (T<sub>m</sub>) of about −11° C., linoleic acid has a T<sub>m </sub>of about −5° C., oleic acid has a T<sub>m </sub>of about 16° C., palmitic acid has a T<sub>m </sub>of about 61-62° C., and Stearic acid has a T<sub>m </sub>of about 67-72° C. Increasing the proportion(s) of palmitic, stearic or oleic acid would increase the overall melting temperature of a composition, while, conversely, increasing the proportion(s) of linoleic and linolenic acid would decrease the melting temperature of a composition. Thus, by controlling the types and amounts of the adjuvant components added, a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein can be made that is substantially solid or semi-solid at room temperature, but melts when it is ingested, and reaches body temperature. The resulting melted composition readily forms micelles which are absorbed by the intestine, assembled into chylomicrons, and ultimately absorbed by macrophages.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">Aspects of the present specification disclose, in part, treating an individual suffering from a chronic inflammation. As used herein, the term “treating,” refers to reducing or eliminating in an individual a clinical symptom of a chronic inflammation; or delaying or preventing in an individual the onset of a clinical symptom of a chronic inflammation. For example, the term “treating” can mean reducing a symptom of a condition characterized by a chronic inflammation by, e.g., at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90% at least 95%, or at least 100%. The actual symptoms associated with chronic inflammation are well known and can be determined by a person of ordinary skill in the art by taking into account factors, including, without limitation, the location of the chronic inflammation, the cause of the chronic inflammation, the severity of the chronic inflammation, and/or the tissue or organ affected by the chronic inflammation. Those of skill in the art will know the appropriate symptoms or indicators associated with a specific type of chronic inflammation and will know how to determine if an individual is a candidate for treatment as disclosed herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">Chronic inflammation symptoms include, without limitation, edema, hyperemia, erythema, bruising, tenderness, stiffness, swollenness, fever, chills, stuffy nose, stuffy head, breathing problems, fluid retention, blood clots, loss of appetite, increased heart rate, formation of granulomas, fibrinous, pus, non-viscous serous fluid, or ulcer and pain. The actual symptoms associated with a chronic inflammation are well known and can be determined by a person of ordinary skill in the art by taking into account factors, including, without limitation, the location of the inflammation, the cause of the inflammation, the severity of the inflammation, the tissue or organ affected, and the associated disorder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">Specific patterns of chronic inflammation are seen during particular situations that arise in the body, such as when inflammation occurs on an epithelial surface, or pyogenic bacteria are involved. For example, granulomatous inflammation is an inflammation resulting from the formation of granulomas arising from a limited but diverse number of diseases, include, without limitation, tuberculosis, leprosy, sarcoidosis, and syphilis. Purulent inflammation is an inflammation resulting in large amount of pus, which consists of neutrophils, dead cells, and fluid. Infection by pyogenic bacteria such as staphylococci is characteristic of this kind of inflammation. Serous inflammation is an inflammation resulting from copious effusion of non-viscous serous fluid, commonly produced by mesothelial cells of serous membranes, but may be derived from blood plasma. Skin blisters exemplify this pattern of inflammation. Ulcerative inflammation is an inflammation resulting from the necrotic loss of tissue from the epithelial surface, exposing lower layers and forming an ulcer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">A chronic inflammation symptom can be associated with a large, unrelated group of disorders which underlay a variety of diseases and disorders. The immune system is often involved with chronic inflammatory disorders, demonstrated in both allergic reactions and some myopathies, with many immune system disorders resulting in abnormal inflammation. Non-immune diseases with etiological origins in chronic inflammatory processes include cancer, atherosclerosis, and ischaemic heart disease. Non-limiting examples of disorders exhibiting chronic inflammation as a symptom include, without limitation, acne, acid reflux/heartburn, age related macular degeneration (AMD), allergy, allergic rhinitis, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, anemia, appendicitis, arteritis, arthritis, asthma. atherosclerosis, autoimmune disorders, balanitis, blepharitis, bronchiolitis, bronchitis, a bullous pemphigoid, burn, bursitis, cancer, cardiac arrest, carditis, celiac disease, cellulitis, cervicitis, cholangitis, cholecystitis, chorioamnionitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cirrhosis, colitis, congestive heart failure, conjunctivitis, cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis, cystic fibrosis, cystitis, common cold, dacryoadenitis, dementia, dermatitis, dermatomyositis, diabetes, diabetic neuropathy, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic ulcer, digestive system disease, eczema, emphysema, encephalitis, endocarditis, endometritis, enteritis, enterocolitis, epicondylitis, epididymitis, fasciitis, fibromyalgia, fibrosis, fibrositis, gastritis, gastroenteritis, gingivitis, glomerulonephritis, glossitis, heart disease, heart valve dysfunction, hepatitis, hidradenitis suppurativa, Huntington's disease, hyperlipidemic pancreatitis, hypertension, ileitis, infection, inflammatory bowel disease, inflammatory cardiomegaly, inflammatory neuropathy, insulin resistance, interstitial cystitis, interstitial nephritis, iritis, ischemia, ischemic heart disease, keratitis, keratoconjunctivitis, laryngitis, lupus nephritis, mastitis, mastoiditis, meningitis, metabolic syndrome (syndrome X), a migraine, multiple sclerosis, myelitis, myocarditis, myositis, nephritis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, obesity, omphalitis, oophoritis, orchitis, osteochondritis, osteopenia, osteomyelitis, osteoporosis, osteitis, otitis, pancreatitis, Parkinson's disease, parotitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, pemphigus vularis, pericarditis, peritonitis, pharyngitis, phlebitis, pleuritis, pneumonitis, polycystic nephritis, proctitis, prostatitis, psoriasis, pulpitis, pyelonephritis, pylephlebitis, renal failure, reperfusion injury, retinitis, rheumatic fever, rhinitis, salpingitis, sarcoidosis, sialadenitis, sinusitis, spastic colon, stenosis, stomatitis, stroke, surgical complication, synovitis, tendonitis, tendinosis, tenosynovitis, thrombophlebitis, tonsillitis, trauma, traumatic brain injury, transplant rejection, trigonitis, tuberculosis, tumor, urethritis, ursitis, uveitis, vaginitis, vasculitis, and vulvitis.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">In one embodiment, a chronic inflammation comprises a tissue inflammation. Tissue inflammation is a chronic inflammation that is confined to a particular tissue or organ. In aspect of this embodiment, a tissue inflammation comprises, e.g., a skin inflammation, a muscle inflammation, a tendon inflammation, a ligament inflammation, a bone inflammation, a cartilage inflammation, a lung inflammation, a heart inflammation, a liver inflammation, a pancreatic inflammation, a kidney inflammation, a bladder inflammation, a stomach inflammation, an intestinal inflammation, a neuron inflammation, and a brain inflammation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">In another embodiment, a chronic inflammation comprises a systemic inflammation. Although the processes involved are identical to tissue inflammation, systemic inflammation is not confined to a particular tissue but in fact overwhelms the body, involving the endothelium and other organ systems. When it is due to infection, the term sepsis is applied, with the terms bacteremia being applied specifically for bacterial sepsis and viremia specifically to viral sepsis. Vasodilation and organ dysfunction are serious problems associated with widespread infection that may lead to septic shock and death.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">In another embodiment, a chronic inflammation comprises an arthritis. Arthritis includes a group of conditions involving damage to the joints of the body due to the inflammation of the synovium including, without limitation osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, spondyloarthropathies like ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis (Reiter's syndrome), psoriatic arthritis, enteropathic arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease, Whipple disease and Behcet disease, septic arthritis, gout (also known as gouty arthritis, crystal synovitis, metabolic arthritis), pseudogout (calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease), and Still's disease. Arthritis can affect a single joint (monoarthritis), two to four joints (oligoarthritis) or five or more joints (polyarthritis) and can be either an auto-immune disease or a non-autoimmune disease.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">In another embodiment, a chronic inflammation comprises an autoimmune disorder.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">In another embodiment, a chronic inflammation comprises a vasculitis. Vasculitis is a varied group of disorders featuring inflammation of a vessel wall including lymphatic vessels and blood vessels like veins (phlebitis), arteries (arteritis) and capillaries due to leukocyte migration and resultant damage. The inflammation may affect any size blood vessel, anywhere in the body. It may affect either arteries and/or veins. The inflammation may be focal, meaning that it affects a single location within a vessel; or it may be widespread, with areas of inflammation scattered throughout a particular organ or tissue, or even affecting more than one organ system in the body. Vasculitis include, without limitation, Buerger's disease (thromboangiitis obliterans), cerebral vasculitis (central nervous system vasculitis), Churg-Strauss arteritis, cryoglobulinemia, essential cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, giant cell (temporal) arteritis, Golfer's vasculitis, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, hypersensitivity vasculitis (allergic vasculitis), Kawasaki disease, microscopic polyarteritis/polyangiitis, polyarteritis <i>nodosa</i>, polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), rheumatoid vasculitis, Takayasu arteritis, Wegener's granulomatosis, and vasculitis secondary to connective tissue disorders like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), relapsing polychondritis, Behcet's disease, or other connective tissue disorders, vasculitis secondary to viral infection.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">In another embodiment, a chronic inflammation comprises a cardiovascular disease. When LDL cholesterol becomes embedded in arterial walls, it can invoke an immune response. Chronic inflammation eventually can damage the arteries, which can cause them to burst. Cardiovascular disease is any of a number of specific diseases that affect the heart itself and/or the blood vessel system, especially the veins and arteries leading to and from the heart. There are more than 60 types of cardiovascular disorders including, without limitation, a hypertension, endocarditis, myocarditis, heart valve dysfunction, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, a diabetic cardiac conditions, blood vessel inflammation like arteritis, phlebitis, vasculitis; arterial occlusive disease like arteriosclerosis and stenosis, inflammatory cardiomegaly, a peripheral arterial disease; an aneurysm; an embolism; a dissection; a pseudoaneurysm; a vascular malformation; a vascular nevus; a thrombosis; a thrombphlebitis; a varicose veins; a stroke. Symptoms of a cardiovascular disorder affecting the heart include, without limitation, chest pain or chest discomfort (angina), pain in one or both arms, the left shoulder, neck, jaw, or back, shortness of breath, dizziness, faster heartbeats, nausea, abnormal heartbeats, feeling fatigued.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">In another embodiment, a chronic inflammation comprises a cancer. Inflammation orchestrates the microenvironment around tumors, contributing to proliferation, survival and migration. For example, fibrinous inflammation results from a large increase in vascular permeability which allows fibrin to pass through the blood vessels. If an appropriate procoagulative stimulus is present, such as cancer cells, a fibrinous exudate is deposited. This is commonly seen in serous cavities, where the conversion of fibrinous exudate into a scar can occur between serous membranes, limiting their function. In another example, a cancer is an inflammatory cancer like a NF-κB-driven inflammatory cancer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">In another embodiment, a chronic inflammation comprises a pharmacologically-induced inflammation. Certain drugs or exogenic chemical compounds are known to affect inflammation. For example, Vitamin A deficiency causes an increase in an inflammatory response. Certain illicit drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy may exert some of their detrimental effects by activating transcription factors intimately involved with inflammation (e.g. NF-κB).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">In another embodiment, a chronic inflammation comprises an infection. An infectious organism can escape the confines of the immediate tissue via the circulatory system or lymphatic system, where it may spread to other parts of the body. If an organism is not contained by the actions of acute inflammation it may gain access to the lymphatic system via nearby lymph vessels. An infection of the lymph vessels is known as lymphangitis, and infection of a lymph node is known as lymphadenitis. A pathogen can gain access to the bloodstream through lymphatic drainage into the circulatory system. Infections include, without limitation, bacterial cystitis, bacterial encephalitis, pandemic influenza, viral encephalitis, and viral hepatitis (A, B and C).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">In another embodiment, a chronic inflammation comprises a tissue or organ injury. Tissue or organ injuries include, without limitation, a burn, a laceration, a wound, a puncture, or a trauma.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">In another embodiment, a chronic inflammation comprises a transplant rejection. Transplant rejection occurs when a transplanted organ or tissue is not accepted by the body of the transplant recipient because the immune system of the recipient attacks the transplanted organ or tissue. An adaptive immune response, transplant rejection is mediated through both T cell mediated and humoral immune (antibodies) mechanisms. A transplant rejection can be classified as a hyperacute rejection, an acute rejection, or a chronic rejection. Chronic rejection of a transplanted organ or tissue is where the rejection is due to a poorly understood chronic inflammatory and immune response against the transplanted tissue. Also included in the term “transplant rejection” is a graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). GVHD is a common complication of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in which functional immune cells in the transplanted marrow recognize the recipient as “foreign” and mount an immunologic attack. It can also take place in a blood transfusion under certain circumstances. GVHD is divided into acute and chronic forms. Acute and chronic GVHD appear to involve different immune cell subsets, different cytokine profiles, somewhat different host targets, and respond differently to treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">In another embodiment, a chronic inflammation comprises a Th1-mediated inflammatory disease. In a well-functioning immune system, an immune response should result in a well balanced pro-inflammatory Th1 response and anti-inflammatory Th2 response that is suited to address the immune challenge. Generally speaking, once a pro-inflammatory Th1 response is initiated, the body relies on the anti-inflammatory response invoked by a Th2 response to counteract this Th1 response. This counteractive response includes the release of Th2 type cytokines such as, e.g., IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 which are associated with the promotion of IgE and eosinophilic responses in atopy, and also IL-10, which has an anti-inflammatory response. A Th1-mediated inflammatory disease involves an excessive pro-inflammatory response produced by Th1 cells that leads to chronic inflammation. The Th1-mediated disease may be virally, bacterially or chemically (e.g. environmentally) induced. For example, a virus causing the Th1-mediated disease may cause a chronic or acute infection, which may cause a respiratory disorder or influenza.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">In another embodiment, a chronic inflammation comprises a chronic neurogenic inflammation. Chronic neurogenic Inflammation refers to an inflammatory response initiated and/or maintained through the release of inflammatory molecules like SP or CGRP which released from peripheral sensory nerve terminals (i.e., an efferent function, in contrast to the normal afferent signaling to the spinal cord in these nerves). Chronic neurogenic inflammation includes both primary inflammation and secondary neurogenic inflammation. As used herein, the term “primary” neurogenic inflammation refers to tissue inflammation (inflammatory symptoms) that is initiated by, or results from, the release of substances from primary sensory nerve terminals (such as C and A-delta fibers). As used herein, the term “secondary” neurogenic inflammation” refers to tissue inflammation initiated by non-neuronal sources (e.g., extravasation from vascular bed or tissue interstitium-derived, such as from mast cells or immune cells) of inflammatory mediators, such as peptides or cytokines, stimulating sensory nerve terminals and causing a release of inflammatory mediators from the nerves. The net effect of both forms (primary and secondary) of chronic neurogenic inflammation is to have an inflammatory state that is maintained by the sensitization of the peripheral sensory nerve fibers. The physiological consequence of the resulting chronic neurogenic inflammation depends on the tissue in question, producing, such as, e.g., cutaneous pain (allodynia, hyperalgesia), joint pain and/or arthritis, visceral pain and dysfunction, pulmonary dysfunction (asthma, COPD), and bladder dysfunction (pain, overactive bladder).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0147" num="0320">Initially, 2,400 mg of ibuprofen was contacted directly with 2.0 mL of rapeseed oil in an attempt to dissolve a therapeutic compound directly into an adjuvant at a concentration of 1,200 mg/mL. However, ibuprofen remained insoluble in the oil and did not dissolve to substantially measureable degree. Ibuprofen remained insolubility even if the mixture was mixed by vortexing for 20 seconds, the contacting was done at 20° C. or 37° C., and/or the mixture was allowed to incubate for 24 hours at 20° C. or 37° C. The insolubility of ibuprofen in rapeseed oil was surprising given that ibuprofen has a log P value of 3.6; such a high log P value is indicative of a compound that would readily soluble in an adjuvant like oil.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0148" num="0321">Since, it was not possible to dissolve ibuprofen directly into oil, despite its high log P value, it was next tried to dissolve a therapeutic drug in a solvent to first create a solution comprising the compound. As a first step, experiments were conducted to the miscibility of a solvent in an adjuvant like oil in the absence of a therapeutic compound. In these experiments 0.5 mL ethanol was contacted with ten different volumes of rapeseed oil (Table 1). Each mixture was tested at 22° C. and at 37° C. in which the ethanol and oil were initially heated in a water bath before being mixed together. Mixing was attempted by vortex mixing for 20 seconds, and the containers were allowed to settle before visual assessment, either immediately, or after 24 hours. Each mixture was evaluated to determine whether or not the ethanol and rapeseed oil form immiscible layers, or a homogeneous mixture. The results are summarized in Table 1. Mixtures comprising solvent:adjuvant ratios of 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, and 1:6 formed immiscible layers at either 22° C. or at 37° C., either immediately or after 24 hours of incubation, indicating that the ethanol and oil did not mix well at these ratios. However, in solvent:adjuvant ratios above 1:7 a homogeneous mixture was formed under all conditions tested.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0150" num="0323">Once the appropriate ratios of alcohol and lipid necessary to form a homogenous mixture were determined, it was next determined whether contacting a therapeutic compound first in a solvent before contacting with an adjuvant would result in the compound dissolving in the solvents. To conduct these experiments, either 1,000 mg or 1,200 mg of ibuprofen was dissolved into 0.5 mL of ethanol. The resulting alcohol solution was then contacted with rapeseed oil at two different solvent:adjuvant ratios (1:2 and 1:9). Each mixture was tested at 20° C. and at 37° C. in which the ethanol solution and oil were initially heated in a water bath before being mixed together. Mixing was attempted by vortex mixing for 20 seconds, and the containers were allowed to settle before visual assessment, either immediately, or after 24 hours. Each mixture was evaluated to determine whether or not the ethanol solution and rapeseed oil form immiscible layers, or a homogeneous mixture. The results are summarized in Table 2. In contrast to the situation in the absence of a therapeutic compound, when ibuprofen is present in the ethanol, it caused the ethanol and oil to form a homogeneous mixture under all conditions tested in solvent:adjuvant ratios above 1:2. This observation was very surprising because, although not wish to be bound by any theory, it appears that a therapeutic compound may be having some effect on the manner in which an adjuvant and solvent interact with each other, such that a homogeneous mixture is formed in a way that does not occur when the therapeutic compound is absent. In addition, the results indicate that a therapeutic compound can be formulated at clinically useful concentrations.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0153" num="0326">To prepare a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein using gemfibrozil, the following formulations were examined. In these experiments, 600 mg gemfibrozil was contacted with different volumes of ethanol, as the solvent, warmed to 37° C., and the resulting solution was then contacted with different volumes of linseed oil, as the adjuvant, warmed to 37° C. (Table 3). Each formulation was evaluated to determine whether or not the ethanol and linseed oil form immiscible layers, a clear homogeneous mixture, as well as whether or not the gemfibrozil crystallized out of solution. The results are summarized in Table 3.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0154" num="0327">Like ibuprofen in Example 1 above, gemfibrozil remained insoluble in the oil alone and did not dissolve to substantially measureable degree. The formulation comprising 0.2 mL ethanol was unable to completely dissolve gemfibrozil. In addition, although the formulation comprising 0.3 mL ethanol was capable of dissolving gemfibrozil, the therapeutic compound began to crystallizing out of solution within 3 hours and complete crystallization occurred within 48 hours. All other formulations tested were capable of dissolving gemfibrozil and forming a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein. However, only the formulation comprising 0.5 mL ethanol appeared to for a stable pharmaceutical composition in that gemfibrozil remained completely dissolved after three weeks.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0157" num="0330">To prepare a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein using ibuprofen, the following formulation was performed. In these experiments, 4 g ibuprofen was contacted with 3.6 mL of ethyl acetate, as the solvent, and the resulting solution was then contacted with 76.4 mL of rapeseed oil, as the adjuvant. The resulting pharmaceutical composition had a solvent:adjuvant ratio of about 1:21. This pharmaceutical composition was then placed in a round bottom flask and subjected to low pressure on a rotary evaporator. The temperature was kept low and evaporation continued to constant weight. The total volume lost was 3.65% of the total weight. The resulting liquid no longer retained the characteristic ethyl acetate odor/taste, indicating that there was a substantial removal of ethyl acetate form the pharmaceutical composition.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0158" num="0331">This example illustrates how to make a pharmaceutical composition as disclosed herein as a solid formulation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0332">Since certain fatty acids are liquid at room temperature, while others are solid, an examination of the different fatty acids was undertaken in an effort to evaluate the potential of each fatty acid in the manufacture of a solid formulation. This understanding would enable the development of a wide array of solid formulation by adjusting the relative ratios of each fatty acid. As an initial experiment, linolenic acid, linoleic acid, palmitic acid and stearic acid were evaluated to assess whether it was possible to prepare a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein that could be formulated using only one of these fatty acids to be a solid or semi-solid at 22° C. (simulating room temperature conditions), but melt into a liquid at 37° C. (simulating internal body temperature conditions after ingestion).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0333">Four different test formulations were prepared and evaluated on their ability to form a solid dose formulation at 22° C. and melt into a homogeneous solution at 37° C. without forming a suspension (Table 4). Formulation 1 was prepared by dissolving 200 mg of Ibuprofen into 400 mg of menthol, and the resulting solution was then mixed with 200 mg of stearic acid (T<sub>m </sub>of about 67-72° C.) and heated at 60° C. for 30 minutes to form a homogeneous solution. Formulation 1 solidified immediately upon cooling to 22° C. Formulation 1 remained a solid even after incubating at 37° C. overnight. Formulation 2 was prepared by dissolving 200 mg of Ibuprofen into 400 mg of menthol, and the resulting solution was then mixed with 200 mg of palmitic acid (T<sub>m </sub>of about 61-62° C.) and heated at 60° C. for 30 minutes to form a homogeneous solution. Formulation 2 solidified about 1 hour after cooling to 22° C. Incubating at 37° C. overnight cause Formulation 2 to completely melt into a clear homogenous liquid. However, Formulation 2 once again solidified about 1 hour after cooling to 22° C. Formulation 3 was prepared by dissolving 200 mg of Ibuprofen into 400 mg of menthol, and the resulting solution was then mixed with 200 mg of linoleic acid (T<sub>m </sub>of about −5° C.) and heated at 37° C. for 2 hours to form a homogeneous solution. Formulation 3 remained a liquid, even after cooling to 22° C. for 72 hours. Formulation 4 was prepared by dissolving 200 mg of Ibuprofen into 400 mg of menthol, and the resulting solution was then mixed with 200 mg of linolenic acid (T<sub>m </sub>of about −11° C.) and heated at 37° C. for 2 hours to form a homogeneous solution. Formulation 4 remained a liquid, even after cooling to 22° C. for 72 hours.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0337">To assess whether a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein reduced gastric irritation, experiments were conducted using an intestinal erosion murine model.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0338">Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into seven experimental groups containing five animals each. After fasting overnight, the animals were challenged with one with one of seven different treatments. Group A was a control in which each mouse was orally administered 1% methylcellulose/0.5% polysorbate 80 vehicle only. Group B was a control in which each mouse was orally administered solvent/adjuvant vehicle only (gavage of 10% ethanol and 90% linseed oil). Group C was a control in which each mouse was orally administered 150 mg/kg aspirin. Group D was a control in which each mouse was orally administered 100 mg/kg ibuprofen suspended in 1% methylcellulose/0.5% polysorbate 80. Group E was the experimental group in which each mouse was administered a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein (BC1054-100) comprising 100 mg/kg of ibuprofen, 10% ethanol, and 90% linseed oil. Group F was a control in which each mouse was orally administered 100 mg/kg ibuprofen suspended in 1% methylcellulose/0.5% polysorbate 80. Group G was the experimental group in which each mouse was administered a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein (BC1054-200) comprising 200 mg/kg of ibuprofen, 10% ethanol, and 90% linseed oil. Animals were sacrificed 4 hours after treatment and the stomachs were examined for degree of hemorrhage and severity of mucosal erosive lesions. Gastric irritation was scored as follows: 0, no lesions; 1, hyperemia; 2, one or two slight lesions; 3, more than two slight lesions or severe lesions; and 4, very severe lesions. A score of 50% or more relative to Group C (aspirin-treated control group), which was set to 100%, was considered a positive score for gastric irritation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0339">Results are shown in Table 6. Group D (100 mg/kg of ibuprofen-treated control group) and Group F (200 mg/kg of ibuprofen-treated control group) produced gastric lesions that were 75% and 95%, respectively, severe as those induced by Group C (aspirin-treated control group). However, Group E (BC1054-100-treated experimental group) and Group G (BC1054-200-treated experimental group) produced gastric lesions that were 20% and 40%, respectively, as severe as those associated with Group C (aspirin-treated control group). These results demonstrate that that a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein reduced the extent to which a therapeutic compound may cause mucosal lesions and cause gastric irritation.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0341">To assess the effectiveness of a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein in treating a respiratory inflammation, experiments were conducted using a viral-induce influenza murine model.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0169" num="0342">C57BLK/6 female mice (6-7 weeks old) were divided into three experimental groups containing ten animals each. On day 1, animals received an intranasal lethal dose (50 μL total, 25 μL/nostril) of Influenza A/PR/8/34 under halothane-induced anaesthesia. On day 3, post-challenge with the virus, the animals received one of three treatments. Group A was a control in which each mouse was orally administered 335.6 μg of ibuprofen dissolved in 10 μL DMSO (no adjuvant). Group B was a control in which each mouse was orally administered solvent/adjuvant vehicle only (gavage of 10% ethanol and 90% linseed oil). Group C was the experimental group in which each mouse was administered a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein (BC1054) comprising 335.6 μg of ibuprofen, 10% ethanol, and 90% linseed oil. A dose of 335.6 μg of ibuprofen in the mouse is equivalent to 20 mg/kg/day, or 1200 mg/day for a human (the maximum standard dose for ibuprofen). Animals were weighed, and monitored for signs of infection daily for up to day 6 when all animals were culled. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> clearly shows that oral administration of the solvent/adjuvant vehicle only (Group B) had an 80% mortality rate and that oral administration of ibuprofen only (Group A) exhibited a mortality rate of 60%. However, a single oral administration of BC1054 reduced the mortality rate to only 20%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0170" num="0343">To determination of levels of IL-10 and IL-4, an ELISA was performed using a 96-well plate coated with a capture antibody for IL-10 or IL-4. Lungs collected from the culled mice were homogenized at 4° C., and the supernatant collected and stored at −70° C. until needed. Thawed samples were vortexed for 30 seconds immediately before adding to the ELISA plate. Serial dilutions were performed within the plate with both the sample and the standards by pipetting 60 μL of assay diluent into each well. The plate was sealed and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. For IL-4, 60 μL of working detector was added (Detection Antibody+SAv-HRP reagent) to each well. The plate was sealed and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. For IL-10, 60 μL of detection antibody was diluted in assay diluent to each well. Plates were washed and 60 μL of SAv-HRP enzyme was diluted in assay diluent and added to the plate. The plate was sealed and incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature. Plates were then washed ten times. 60 μL of substrate solution were added to each well and the plate was incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature in the dark. 60 μL of stop solution was added to each well and absorbance was read at 450 nm. IL-10 and IL-4 concentrations were expressed as pg/mg of lung tissue. These results indicate that a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein was effective in treating a respiratory inflammation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0171" num="0344">Results show that animals from the Group A (ibuprofen-treated control group) and Group B (solvent/adjuvant vehicle-treated control group) controls exhibited 2600 μg/mg and 2000 μg/mg of IL-10, respectively (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>). However, Group C (BC1054-treated experimental group) revealed an IL-10 concentration of 6000 μg/mg, 3-fold higher than that seen in the control animals. These result also shows that animals from the Group A (ibuprofen-treated control group) and Group B (solvent/adjuvant vehicle-treated control group) controls exhibited 6900 μg/mg and 5400 μg/mg of IL-4, respectively, while Group C (BC1054-treated experimental group) exhibited an IL-4 concentration of 8300 μg/mg (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>). Taken together, synergistic increase in IL-10 levels and/or the increase in IL-4 levels suggest that at least part of the efficacy observed for BC1054 was by inducing a switch from a Th1 to a Th2 response.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0172" num="0345">Further experiments were done to further determine which cell types were stimulated to release cytokines upon administration of a BC1054. C57BLK/6 female mice (6-7 weeks old) were divided into three experimental groups containing ten animals each. On day 1, animals received an intranasal lethal dose (50 μL total, 25 μL/nostril) of Influenza H1N1 under halothane-induced anaesthesia. On day 3, post-challenge with the virus, the animals received one of three treatments. Group A was a control in which each mouse was orally administered 335.6 μg of ibuprofen dissolved in 10 μL DMSO (no adjuvant). Group B was a control in which each mouse was orally administered solvent/adjuvant vehicle only (gavage of 10% ethanol and 90% linseed oil) (no ibuprofen). Group C was the experimental group in which each mouse was administered a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein (BC1054) comprising 335.6 μg of ibuprofen, 10% ethanol, and 90% linseed oil. Lungs collected from fatally-infected mice were homogenized at 4° C., and the supernatant collected, stored, and IL-10, TNFα and IFNγ levels measured using an ELISA.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0173" num="0346">The results show that Group A (ibuprofen-treated control group) and Group C (BC1054-treated experimental group) animals exhibited an increased IL-10 levels (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). However, these IL-10 increases were associated with very different pharmacodynamic effects, and the pattern of pro-inflammatory cytokine reduction highlights the source of the IL-10 and its relevance to the effect on survival. For example, TNFα (which is macrophage-related cytokine) was not as markedly inhibited (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) in Group A (ibuprofen-treated control group) animals, whereas the levels of IFNγ (which is a lymphocyte-derived cytokine) were markedly lowered in this group when compared to Group C (BC1054-treated experimental group) animals (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>). This cytokine release pattern was associated with a poor outcome. However, in Group C (BC1054-treated experimental group) animals, TNFα levels were markedly lowered (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>), while IFNγ levels were largely unaffected (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>). This demonstrates that a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein shows a protective effect on the H1N1-induced lethality through, in part, a macrophage-derived IL-10 levels rather than lymphocyte-derived IL10.</div>

<heading id="h-0018">Animal Model for Inflammatory Bowel Disease</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0174" num="0347">To assess the effectiveness of a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein in treating an inflammatory bowel disease, experiments were conducted using a TBS-induced colitis murine model.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0175" num="0348">C57BI/6 male mice (6-7 weeks old) were divided into seven experimental groups containing at least ten animals each. On day 0, colitis was induced in mice from Groups B-G by intrarectal administration of 100 μL of TNBS (4 mg) in 50% ethanol under isoflurane anesthesia. Animals were dosed either once or three times a day from day −1 to day 5 with one of seven different treatments. Group A was a control in which each mouse was orally administered ethanol vehicle only. Group B was a control in which each mouse was orally administered 1% methylcellulose vehicle only. Group C was a control in which each mouse was orally administered solvent/adjuvant vehicle only (gavage of 10% ethanol and 90% linseed oil). Group D was a control in which each mouse was orally administered 3 mg/kg of Prednisolone. Group E was a control in which each mouse was orally administered 20 mg/kg of ibuprofen suspended in 1% methylcellulose (1 mL/kg) (no adjuvant). Group F was the experimental group in which each mouse was administered a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein (BC1054-20) comprising 20 mg/kg of ibuprofen, 10% ethanol, and 90% linseed oil. Group G was the experimental group in which each mouse was administered a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein (BC1054-30) comprising 30 mg/kg of ibuprofen, 10% ethanol, and 90% linseed oil. All animals were weighed daily and assessed visually for the presence of diarrhea and/or bloody stool. On day 3 and on day 5 colitis severity was assessed in all animals using video endoscopy, where images were taken and colitis severity scored visually by a blinded observer on a scale from 0 to 4 as follows: 0, normal; 1, loss of vascularity; 2, loss of vascularity and friability; 3, friability and erosions; and 4, ulcerations and bleeding. Following endoscopy on day 5, animals were sacrificed and the colon removed and its length and weight measured. Serum samples were obtained and the colon was fixed in 10% formalin. An additional piece of colon tissue was collected, weighed, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0176" num="0349">Results from these experiments are shown in Table 7. Group B (TNBS-treated control group) showed a statistically significant difference in mean weight change when compared to Group A (untreated ethanol control group), all other group comparisons showed no difference in mean weight change. Group B (TNBS-treated control group) showed a statistically significant decrease in mean colon length when compared to Group A (untreated ethanol control group). Additionally, Group D (Prednisolone-treated control group), Group F (BC1054-20-treated experimental group), and Group G (BC1054-30-treated experimental group) all showed a statistically significant increase in mean colon length when compared to Group B (TNBS-treated control group). Although Group B (TNBS-treated control group) showed a statistically significant increase in mean colon weight when compared to Group A (untreated ethanol control group), all other group comparisons showed no difference in mean colon weight. With regards to the endoscopy colitis score, Group D (Prednisolone-treated control group) showed a statistically significant reduced mean colitis scores on both day 3 and day 5 when compared to Group B (TNBS-treated control group). In a similar manner, both Group F (BC1054-20-treated experimental group) and Group G (BC1054-30-treated experimental group) showed a statistically significant reduced mean colitis scores on day 5 when compared to Group B (TNBS-treated control group). These results indicate that a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein was effective in treating an inflammatory bowel disease.</div>

<heading id="h-0020">Animal Model for a Systemic Arthritis</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0178" num="0351">To assess the effectiveness of a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein in treating arthritis, experiments were conducted using an α-collagen antibody induced arthritis (ACAIA) murine model that mimics a systemic arthritis like rheumatoid arthritis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0179" num="0352">BALB/c mice, on day 0, were intravenously injected with a single inoculation with 2 mg/200 μL of an α-collagen II monoclonal antibody, followed by an intraperitoneal injection of 50 μg/200 μL of lipopolysaccaride (LPS) at day 3. From day 3 and daily until day 8 and then on days 10 and 12, paw volumes (plethysmography) and arthritis scores were taken. The same animals were also treated daily from days 0 to day 11, the animals received one of six treatments. Group A was a control in which each mouse was orally administered phosphor-buffered saline (PBS) vehicle only. Group B was a control in which each mouse was intraperitoneally administered 10 mg/kg of Enbrel in PBS. Group C was a control in which each mouse was orally administered 1% methylcellulose vehicle only. Group D was a control in which each mouse was orally administered 40 mg/kg of ibuprofen suspended in 1% methylcellulose (1 mL/kg) (no adjuvant). Group E was a control in which each mouse was orally administered solvent/adjuvant vehicle only (gavage of 10% ethanol and 90% linseed oil). Group F was the experimental group in which each mouse was orally administered a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein (BC1054-20) comprising 20 mg/kg of ibuprofen, 10% ethanol, and 90% linseed oil. Group G was the experimental group in which each mouse was orally administered a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein (BC1054-30) comprising 30 mg/kg of ibuprofen, 10% ethanol, and 90% linseed oil. Through the entire experiment (12 days), animals were checked daily for clinical signs (general observations of the health of the animal) and body weights. Total arthritis scores are determined by summing the arthritis scores of individual paws using the following grades: 0=no signs of arthritis, 1=mild but definite redness and swelling of the ankle/wrist or apparent redness or swelling limited to individual digits, regardless of the number of affected digits, 2=moderate to severe redness and swelling of the ankle/wrist, 3=redness and swelling of the entire paw including digits, 4=maximally inflamed limb with involvement of multiple joints.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0180" num="0353">The results of this experiment are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. As expected, Group B (Enbrel-treated control group) animals showed the best results, with the lowest paw thicknesses at about 1.6 mm on day 12. The two pharmaceutical compositions, Group F (BC1054-20-treated experimental group) and Group G (BC1054-30-treated experimental group) animals displayed the next best results, with Group G mice producing a paw thickness of only 1.7 mm, and Group F mice producing a paw thickness of about 1.73 mm. The negative control Group A (PBS vehicle-treated control group), Group C (methoxycellulose vehicle-treated control group), and Group E (solvent/adjuvant vehicle-treated control group) animals, as well as Group D (ibuprofen-treated control group) performed significantly worse with paw thicknesses of 1.9 mm and over when compared to Group F and Group G animals. These results indicate that a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein was effective in treating an arthritis.</div>

Ineffective standard ibuprofen treatment was subsequently ceased. At a 3 month follow up, no signs of the reactive arthritis have been observed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0182" num="0355">A 50 year old male was diagnosed with a chronically inflamed ankle after a maison neuve fracture in the ankle. The patient was taking 30 mg codeine with 500 mg paracetamol bid, along with 10 mg diclofenac tid for 8 months to control pain. He took a 5 day course of a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein (BC1054) comprising 20 mg/kg of ibuprofen, 10% ethanol, and 90% rapeseed oil (600 mg bid) and after 2 days reported a significant improvement in his pain, and then after 3 days he reported that the pain was completely controlled. He has subsequently ceased the codeine, paracetamol and diclofenac, and after a 2 month follow the patient is still pain free.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0183" num="0356">A 33 year old female diagnosed with stress related eczema, had an acute flare of moderate eczema on arms and chest. A pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein (BC1054) comprising 20 mg/kg of ibuprofen, 10% ethanol, and 90% rapeseed oil (1200 mg uid) was administered for 7 days. After a couple of hours the lesion ceased itching, after 1 day a noticeable improvement in lesion swelling was reported. 2-3 days later the eczema lesions erythema had resolved and after 7 days the lesions had completely disappeared. In the past the patient had used emollients and hydrocortisone creams, which made the lesions worse and would often lead to a course of antibiotics. The patient commented that her response to the BC1054 treatment was quick and complete, and was a marked improvement on previously pharmacological therapies.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0184" num="0357">An 85 year old male diagnosed with reactive osteoarthritis, with marked swelling and severe pain in both knee. For 1 year, the patient had been prescribed prednisolone and NSAIDS to control arthritis, with no effect. In addition the patient had taken daily glucosamine. Despite considerable pharmacological intervention, the patient regularly flared resulting in considerable restriction of mobility. The patient was given a 10 day course of a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein (BC1054) comprising 20 mg/kg of ibuprofen, 10% ethanol, and 90% rapeseed oil (400 mg tid) and experience an appreciable improvement by day 3 and a complete resolution after the completion of the course. The patient reported that his mobility was returned to normal and he has remained in remission at is 1 month examination.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0185" num="0358">A 38 years old male with reactive osteoarthritis in 1 knee, for 6 months (pain and swelling). Over that period, the patient had tried a comprehensive spectrum of pharmacological therapies: prednisolone, Humira and sulfasalazine, alongside NSAIDs to control pain. Only the sulfasalazine had any appreciable effect, however the patient disliked its side effects, so requested to come off the sulfasalazine. After 2 weeks of being sulfsalazine free, the patient experienced a flare of the reactive arthritis and commenced a 4 day course of a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein (BC1054) comprising 20 mg/kg of ibuprofen, 10% ethanol, and 90% rapeseed oil (600 mg bid), experiencing complete remission of the arthritis. After 2 weeks of being drug free, the arthritis began to flare again and the patient was put on another 4 day treatment of BC1054, again experiencing complete remission. This time the arthritis flared again 1 week later. To account for this, the patient was given a final 10 day course of BC1054. Subsequently, the arthritis remained in remission for 11 months, as per the last examination.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0186" num="0359">A 49 year old male diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia (LDL of 4.35 mmol/L) was placed on a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein (BC1054) comprising 20 mg/kg of ibuprofen, 10% ethanol, and 90% rapeseed oil (600 mg bid) for 7 days. After 5 days of treatment the patient's LDL levels had normalized to 3.89 mmol/L. The normalization of LDL level persisted for 2 months after cessation of BC1054 dosing, as determined at the last examination.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0187" num="0360">A 60 year old male newly diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia (LDL of 4.31 mmol/L) was given a course of a pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein (BC1054) comprising 20 mg/kg of ibuprofen, 10% ethanol, and 90% rapeseed oil (1200 mg uid) to lower LDL levels to within the normal range.

<heading id="h-0024">Treatment of Chronic Inflammation</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0188" num="0361">A 62 year old female complains of joint stiffness and swelling and is diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. A physician determines that the joint stiffness and swelling is due to chronic inflammation. The woman is treated by oral administration a pharmaceutical composition comprising ibuprofen as disclosed herein taken twice daily. Alternatively, the woman is treated by oral administration a pharmaceutical composition comprising aspirin as disclosed herein taken thrice daily. Alternatively, the woman is treated by oral administration a pharmaceutical composition comprising naproxen as disclosed herein taken twice daily. The woman's condition is monitored and after about 3 days of treatment the woman indicates there is reduced joint stiffness and swelling. At one and three month check-ups, the woman indicates that she continues to have reduced joint stiffness and swelling in the area treated.
