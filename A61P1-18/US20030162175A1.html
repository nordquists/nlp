<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0003" num="0003">NK cells are bone marrow-derived lymphocytes that share a common progenitor with T cells. NK cells are instrumental in innate immune responses, in particular as effector cells and as a source of cytokines necessary to control certain bacterial, parasitic, and viral infections. As effector cytolytic cells, NK cells lyse transformed cell lines as well as virus-infected cells. NK cells are regulated by a fine balance between positive and negative signals derived from membrane receptors specific for MHC class I molecules that determine their ability to mediate cytotoxicity and secrete cytokines in response to immune challenge (Lanier, <span style="display: none">[0003] </span> <i>Annu. Rev. Immunol</i>. 16:359-93 (1998)). </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0004" num="0004">NK cells appear to express two functional types of MHC class I specific receptors: (i) activation receptors which are less well characterized, and (ii) receptors that can inhibit NK cell activity (Lopez-Botet and Bellon, <span style="display: none">[0004] </span> <i>Curr Opin Immun</i>. 11:301-7 (1999); Yokoyama, <i>Curr Opin Immun</i>. 10:298-305 (1998); Lanier, <i>Cell </i>92:705-7 (1998); and Lanier, <i>Ann. Rev. Immun</i>. 16:359-93 (1998)). NK cell receptors fall into two structural forms: (i) C-type (Ca<sup>++</sup> dependent)-lectin-like receptors are disulfide linked, dimeric type II integral membrane proteins that include the human CD94 and NKG2 family (Lanier, <i>Immunity </i>6:371-78 (1997)) and the mouse Ly49 family (Yokoyoma and Seaman, <i>Ann Rev Immun </i>11:613-35 (1993)); and (ii) immunoglobulin-like receptors are usually monomeric, type I integral membrane proteins that include the human killer inhibitory receptors (KIR, p58 and p70/p140) and the activating receptors (KAR) (Lanier, <i>Annu. Rev. Immunol</i>. 16:359-93 (1998)). Despite these structural differences, studies indicate that both types of receptors are polymorphic at several levels: the receptors belong to several families of highly conserved molecules that display allelic forms; many of these molecules are expressed on subsets of NK cells and an individual NK cell may express several different receptors; the inhibitory receptors of both structural groups mediate their effects through cytoplasmic sequences termed immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs); all known members of each structural type and their isoforms are encoded by individual genes that form separate genetic complexes of clustered genes. </div>

Ly49 receptors are type II glycoproteins of the C-type (Ca++-dependent) lectin superfamily expressed as disulfide-bonded homodimers on overlapping subsets within the total NK cell population of mice and rats. Ly49 receptors recognize a trimeric MHC class I complex composed of the H-2<span style="display: none">[0006] </span> <sup>D </sup>or H-2<sup>K </sup>heavy chain, b2-microglobulin, and a bound peptide. Most, but not all, of the Ly49 receptors contain an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) in their cytoplasmic domains, which upon tyrosine phosphorylation, recruits SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) or SHP-2 that subsequently inhibits NK cell effector function. </div>

CD94 and NKG2 form a heterodimer composed of a CD94 glycoprotein that is disulfide-bonded to either an NKG2A subunit or an NKG2C subunit (Lanier, <span style="display: none">[0007] </span> <i>Annu. Rev. Immunol</i>. 16:359-93 (1998)). CD94 lacks a cytoplasmic domain, but is required for transport and membrane expression of the NKG2A or NKG2C glycoproteins. Although similar in their extracellular regions, NKG2A possesses an ITIM in its cytoplasmic domain, whereas the NKG2C molecule lacks an ITIM, but contains a basic amino acid in its transmembrane domain that may provide for association with other signaling/transducing proteins. </div>

HLA-E is not bound by NK cell inhibitory receptors (KIRs), and there is no evidence that CD94/NKG2 binds other classical class I molecules (Lanier, <span style="display: none">[0008] </span> <i>Cell </i>92:705-7 (1998)). </div>

The cytoplasmic domains of KIR2D and KIR3D molecules are heterogeneous. Isoforms that are inhibitory receptors (i.e., KIR2DL and KIR2DL) contain an uncharged transmembrane anchor, and a long cytoplasmic tail containing two ITIM motifs that bind SHP-1 and inactivate NK cells. <span style="display: none">[0011] </span> </div>

In this regard, activating KIRs, such as KIR2DS assemble with disulfide-linked dimers of DAP12, a novel immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-bearing 13 kDa protein that is similar to the z chain of the TCR (Lanier et al., <span style="display: none">[0012] </span> <i>Nature </i>391:703-7 (1998)). Engagement of these activating receptors by class I MHC protein results in activation of the cell by an as yet uncharacterized signaling pathway. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0013]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0013" num="0013">The KIRs are polygenic and display allelic polymorphism. There is an increasing number of structurally related molecules in this family, including the previously identified mouse gp49 and several newly cloned human molecules: immunoglobulin-like transcript (ILT)1, ILT3, ILT4, ILT5, ILT2/leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor-1; leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor-1; paired immunoglobulin-like receptors-A and -B; p91; and monocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (Lopez-Botet and Bellon, <span style="display: none">[0013] </span> <i>Curr Opin Immun</i>. 11:301-7 (1999)). These molecules contain between one and six immunoglobulin-like domains and are expressed by a wide range of cells, not just NK cells, such that they are not strictly killer inhibitory receptors. For example, the leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor-1 molecule is expressed by nearly every peripheral blood mononuclear cell. This contrasts with the relatively specific expression of most of the C-type lectin like receptors on NK cells. Even though the ligands for most of the immunoglobulin-like molecules are not known, they contain ITIMs and thus are probably inhibitory. </div>

The unifying characteristic is the presence of ITIM sequences in the cytoplasmic domain of these receptors that upon tyrosine phosphorylation are able to recuit SHP-1, and possibly SHP-2, to mediate the inhibitory function. The precise sequence of biochemical events that results in the negative signal is as yet only partially defined, and the mechanism may depend on the particular positive signaling receptor that is being affected. KIR, Ly49 and CD94/NKG2A receptors regulate not only cytotoxicity but can also inhibit cytokine production by T and NK cells. <span style="display: none">[0014] </span> </div>

Opin. Immunol</i>. 10:298-305 (1998)). NK cells play a major role in immune responses to invading microorganisms, particularly viruses and intracellular pathogens. Human and mouse cytomegaloviruses contain open reading frames encoding structures similar to MHC class I that can bind NK cell receptors, thereby inhibiting NK cells and enhancing viral replication; the viral structures appear to be promiscuous, highlighting the significant contribution of NK cells in innate immunity to viruses and to other intracellular pathogens (Lanier, <i>Annu. Rev. Immunol</i>. 16:359-93 (1998)). NK cells are involved in the rejection of both allogeneic bone marrow grafts and homozygous parental bone marrow grafts in heterozygous F1 recipients (known as the hybrid histocompatibility phenomenon) (Manilay and Sykes, <i>Curr. Opin. Immunol</i>. 10:532-538 (1998)). The presence of NK cells in the F1 host recognize and eliminate the parental bone marrow cells as foreign because a subset of NK cells in the recipient lacks inhibitory receptors for the parental H-2 antigens. Further, NK cells appear to regulate autoimmunity, for example, in the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. A better appreciation of the role of NK cells in normal host defense, disease pathogenesis, and graft rejection requires a precise definition of the mechanism by which NK cells are regulated. </div>

NK Cell inhibitory receptors share structural motifs in common with Ig Fc receptors, including some signaling motifs within the cytoplasmic domains (Renard, et al., <span style="display: none">[0018] </span> <i>Immunol. Rev</i>. 155:205-221 (1997)), suggesting that the two receptor types act in concert to regulate the functions of a wide variety of effector cell types. However, unlike FcRs, NK Cell inhibitory receptors generally function in an inhibitory capacity, effectively slowing or even stopping NK cell activity. As a result, the use of specific KIR antagonists, such as antibodies or soluble receptors, may be useful to alleviate their suppressive activity and allow macrophages, NK cells, and other effector cells to recognize and destroy infectious agents or malignant cells. </div>

It will be appreciated that the same type of modification may be present in the same or varying degrees at several sites in a given polypeptide. Also, a given polypeptide may contain many types of modifications. Polypeptides may be branched, for example, as a result of ubiquitination, and they may be cyclic, with or without branching. Cyclic, branched, and branched cyclic polypeptides may result from posttranslation natural processes or may be made by synthetic methods.

Cyclophilin is the major high-affinity binding protein in vertebrates for the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CSA). It exhibits a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity (PPIase or rotamase). PPIase is an enzyme that accelerates protein folding by catalyzing the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides. It is probable that CSA mediates some of its effects via an inhibitory action on PPIase. One isozyme of Cyclophilin is the Natural-killer cell cyclophilin-related protein. This large protein (about 160 Kd) is a component of a putative tumor-recognition complex involved in the function of NK cells. It contains a cyclophilin-type PPIase domain. The sequences of the different forms of cyclophilin-type PPlases are well conserved. The following consensus pattern has been developed to identify proteins containing this conserved domain (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics): [FY]-x(2)-[STCNLV]-x-F-H-[RH]-[LIVMN]-[LIVM]-x(2)-F-[LIVM]-x-Q-[AG]-G.

The human cytomegalovirus UL18 gene product is a homolog of cellular major histocompatibility (MHC) class I antigens. UL18 has been proposed to protect virus-infected cells against natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity by engaging NK cell killer inhibitory receptors (KIR) for MHC class I. It is thought that CMV-encoded MHC class I-like molecule, UL18, might take the place of host MHC class I antigens on the cell surface, engage the KIRs, and prevent NK-mediated cytotoxicity. UL18 binds to a novel immunoglobulin superfamily glycoprotein, designated Leukocyte Immunoglobulin-like Receptor (LIR-1). LIR-1 is related to KIRs, and binds cellular MHC class I antigens. The cytoplasmic domain of LIR-1 contains four putative immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs, described above).

A., et al., Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA, 85:8998-9002 (1988). A cDNA clone missing either the 5′ or 3′ end can be reconstructed to include the absent base pairs extending to the translational start or stop codon, respectively. In some cases, cDNAs are missing the start of translation, therefor. The following briefly describes a modification of this original 5′ RACE procedure. Poly A+ or total RNA is reverse transcribed with Superscript II (Gibco/BRL) and an antisense or complementary primer specific to the cDNA sequence. The primer is removed from the reaction with a Microcon Concentrator (Amicon). The first-strand cDNA is then tailed with dATP and terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (Gibco/BRL). Thus, an anchor sequence is produced which is needed for PCR amplification. The second strand is synthesized from the dA-tail in PCR buffer, Taq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Cetus), an oligo-dT primer containing three adjacent restriction sites (XhoI, SalI and ClaI) at the 5′ end and a primer containing just these restriction sites. This double-stranded cDNA is PCR amplified for 40 cycles with the same primers as well as a nested cDNA-specific antisense primer. The PCR products are size-separated on an ethidium bromide-agarose gel and the region of gel containing cDNA products the predicted size of missing protein-coding DNA is removed. cDNA is purified from the agarose with the Magic PCR Prep kit (Promega), restriction digested with XhoI or SalI, and ligated to a plasmid such as pBluescript SKII (Stratagene) at XhoI and EcoRV sites. This DNA is transformed into bacteria and the plasmid clones sequenced to identify the correct protein-coding inserts. Correct 5′ ends are confirmed by comparing this sequence with the putatively identified homologue and overlap with the partial cDNA clone. Similar methods known in the art and/or commercial kits are used to amplify and recover 3′ ends. <span style="display: none">[0093] </span> </div>

A second kit is available from Clontech which is a modification of a related technique, SLIC (single-stranded ligation to single-stranded cDNA), developed by Dumas et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 19:5227-32 (1991). The major differences in procedure are that the RNA is alkaline hydrolyzed after reverse transcription and RNA ligase is used to join a restriction site-containing anchor primer to the first-strand cDNA. This obviates the necessity for the dA-tailing reaction which results in a polyT stretch that is difficult to sequence past. <span style="display: none">[0094] </span> </div>

These methods include, but are not limited to, filter probing, clone enrichment using specific probes and protocols similar and identical to 5′ and 3′RACE. While the full length gene may be present in the library and can be identified by probing, a useful method for generating the 5′ or 3′ end is to use the existing sequence information from the original cDNA to generate the missing information. A method similar to 5′RACE is available for generating the missing 5′ end of a desired full-length gene. (This method was published by Fromont-Racine et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 21(7):1683-1684 (1993)). Briefly, a specific RNA oligonucleotide is ligated to the 5′ ends of a population of RNA presumably containing full-length gene RNA transcript and a primer set containing a primer specific to the ligated RNA oligonucleotide and a primer specific to a known sequence of the gene of interest, is used to PCR amplify the 5′ portion of the desired full length gene which may then be sequenced and used to generate the full length gene. This method starts with total RNA isolated from the desired source, poly A RNA may be used but is not a prerequisite for this procedure. The RNA preparation may then be treated with phosphatase if necessary to eliminate 5′ phosphate groups on degraded or damaged RNA which may interfere with the later RNA ligase step. The phosphatase if used is then inactivated and the RNA is treated with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase in order to remove the cap structure present at the 5′ ends of messenger RNAs. This reaction leaves a 5′ phosphate group at the 5′ end of the cap cleaved RNA which can then be ligated to an RNA oligonucleotide using T4 RNA ligase. This modified RNA preparation can then be used as a template for first strand cDNA synthesis using a gene specific oligonucleotide. The first strand synthesis reaction can then be used as a template for PCR amplification of the desired 5′ end using a primer specific to the ligated RNA oligonucleotide and a primer specific to the known sequence of the NKCR gene of interest. The resultant product is then sequenced and analyzed to confirm that the 5′ end sequence belongs to the relevant NKCR gene. <span style="display: none">[0097] </span> </div>

If in vivo immunization is used, animals may be immunized with free peptide; however, anti-peptide antibody titer may be boosted by coupling the peptide to a macromolecular carrier, such as keyhole limpet hemacyanin (KLH) or tetanus toxoid. For instance, peptides containing cysteine residues may be coupled to a carrier using a linker such as maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (MBS), while other peptides may be coupled to carriers using a more general linking agent such as glutaraldehyde. Animals such as rabbits, rats and mice are immunized with either free or carrier-coupled peptides, for instance, by intraperitoneal and/or intradermal injection of emulsions containing about 100 μg of peptide or carrier protein and Freund's adjuvant or any other adjuvant known for stimulating an immune response. Several booster injections may be needed, for instance, at intervals of about two weeks, to provide a useful titer of anti-peptide antibody which can be detected, for example, by ELISA assay using free peptide adsorbed to a solid surface. The titer of anti-peptide antibodies in serum from an immunized animal may be increased by selection of anti-peptide antibodies, for instance, by adsorption to the peptide on a solid support and elution of the selected antibodies according to methods well known in the art. <span style="display: none">[0120] </span> </div>

For example, the polypeptides of the present invention may be fused with the constant domain of immunoglobulins (IgA, IgE, IgG, IgM), or portions thereof (CH1, CH2, CH3, or any combination thereof and portions thereof) resulting in chimeric polypeptides. Such fusion proteins may facilitate purification and may increase half-life in vivo. This has been shown for chimeric proteins consisting of the first two domains of the human CD4-polypeptide and various domains of the constant regions of the heavy or light chains of mammalian immunoglobulins. See, e.g., EP 394,827; Traunecker et al., Nature, 331:84-86 (1988). Enhanced delivery of an antigen across the epithelial barrier to the immune system has been demonstrated for antigens (e.g., insulin) conjugated to an FcRn binding partner such as IgG or Fc fragments (see, e.g., PCT Publications WO 96/22024 and WO 99/04813). IgG Fusion proteins that have a disulfide-linked dimeric structure due to the IgG portion desulfide bonds have also been found to be more efficient in binding and neutralizing other molecules than monomeric polypeptides or fragments thereof alone.

In many cases, the Fc part in a fusion protein is beneficial in therapy and diagnosis, and thus can result in, for example, improved pharmacokinetic properties. (EP-A 0232 262.) Alternatively, deleting the Fc part after the fusion protein has been expressed, detected, and purified, may be desired. For example, the Fc portion may hinder therapy and diagnosis if the fusion protein is used as an antigen for immunizations. In drug discovery, for example, human proteins, such as hIL-5, have been fused with Fc portions for the purpose of high-throughput screening assays to identify antagonists of hIL-5. (See, D.

The tag serves as a matrix binding domain for the fusion protein. Extracts from cells infected with the recombinant vaccinia virus are loaded onto Ni2+ nitriloacetic acid-agarose column and histidine-tagged proteins can be selectively eluted with imidazole-containing buffers. <span style="display: none">[0125] </span> </div>

Moreover, tolerated conservative amino acid substitutions involve replacement of the aliphatic or hydrophobic amino acids Ala, Val, Leu and Ile; replacement of the hydroxyl residues Ser and Thr; replacement of the acidic residues Asp and Glu; replacement of the amide residues Asn and Gln, replacement of the basic residues Lys, Arg, and His; replacement of the aromatic residues Phe, Tyr, and Trp, and replacement of the small-sized amino acids Ala, Ser, Thr, Met, and Gly. Besides conservative amino acid substitution, variants of the present invention include (i) substitutions with one or more of the non-conserved amino acid residues, where the substituted amino acid residues may or may not be one encoded by the genetic code, or (ii) substitution with one or more of amino acid residues having a substituent group, or (iii) fusion of the mature polypeptide with another compound, such as a compound to increase the stability and/or solubility of the polypeptide (for example, polyethylene glycol), or (iv) fusion of the polypeptide with additional amino acids, such as, for example, an IgG Fc fusion region peptide, or leader or secretory sequence, or a sequence facilitating purification or (v) fusion of the polypeptide with another compound, such as albumin (including but not limited to recombinant albumin (see, e.g., U.S. Pat.

A main step in the methanol metabolization pathway is the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde using O<sub>2</sub>. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme alcohol oxidase. In order to metabolize methanol as its sole carbon source, <i>Pichia pastoris </i>must generate high levels of alcohol oxidase due, in part, to the relatively low affinity of alcohol oxidase for O<sub>2</sub>. Consequently, in a growth medium depending on methanol as a main carbon source, the promoter region of one of the two alcohol oxidase genes (AOX1) is highly active. In the presence of methanol, alcohol oxidase produced from the AOX1 gene comprises up to approximately 30% of the total soluble protein in <i>Pichia pastoris</i>. See, Ellis, S. B., et al., <i>Mol. Cell. Biol</i>. 5:1111-21 (1985); Koutz, P. J, et al., <i>Yeast </i>5:167-77 (1989); Tschopp, J. F., et al., <i>Nucl. Acids Res</i>. 15:3859-76 (1987).

Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules from non-human species antibody that binds the desired antigen having one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from the non-human species and a framework regions from a human immunoglobulin molecule. Often, framework residues in the human framework regions will be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter, preferably improve, antigen binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art, e.g., by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions.

For example, the human heavy and light chain immunoglobulin gene complexes may be introduced randomly or by homologous recombination into mouse embryonic stem cells. Alternatively, the human variable region, constant region, and diversity region may be introduced into mouse embryonic stem cells in addition to the human heavy and light chain genes. The mouse heavy and light chain immunoglobulin genes may be rendered non-functional separately or simultaneously with the introduction of human immunoglobulin loci by homologous recombination. In particular, homozygous deletion of the JH region prevents endogenous antibody production. The modified embryonic stem cells are expanded and microinjected into blastocysts to produce chimeric mice. The chimeric mice are then bred to produce homozygous offspring which express human antibodies. The transgenic mice are immunized in the normal fashion with a selected antigen, e.g., all or a portion of a polypeptide of the invention. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen can be obtained from the immunized, transgenic mice using conventional hybridoma technology. The human immunoglobulin transgenes harbored by the transgenic mice rearrange during B cell differentiation, and subsequently undergo class switching and somatic mutation. Thus, using such a technique, it is possible to produce therapeutically useful IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE antibodies. For an overview of this technology for producing human antibodies, see Lonberg and Huszar, Int. Rev. Immunol. 13:65-93 (1995).

Further, the polypeptides corresponding to SEQ ID NO: Y may be fused or conjugated to the above antibody portions to facilitate purification. One reported example describes chimeric proteins consisting of the first two domains of the human CD4-polypeptide and various domains of the constant regions of the heavy or light chains of mammalian immunoglobulins. (EP 394,827; Traunecker et al., Nature 331:84-86 (1988). The polypeptides of the present invention fused or conjugated to an antibody having disulfide-linked dimeric structures (due to the IgG) may also be more efficient in binding and neutralizing other molecules, than the monomeric secreted protein or protein fragment alone. (Fountoulakis et al., J. Biochem. 270:3958-3964 (1995)). In many cases, the Fc part in a fusion protein is beneficial in therapy and diagnosis, and thus can result in, for example, improved pharmacokinetic properties. (EP A 232,262). Alternatively, deleting the Fc part after the fusion protein has been expressed, detected, and purified, would be desired. For example, the Fc portion may hinder therapy and diagnosis if the fusion protein is used as an antigen for immunizations. In drug discovery, for example, human proteins, such as hIL-5, have been fused with Fc portions for the purpose of high-throughput screening assays to identify antagonists of hIL-5.

The use of PNAs would serve as the preferred form if the polynucleotides of the invention are incorporated onto a solid support, or gene chip. For the purposes of the present invention, a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) is a polyamide type of DNA analog and the monomeric units for adenine, guanine, thymine and cytosine are available commercially (Perceptive Biosystems). Certain components of DNA, such as phosphorus, phosphorus oxides, or deoxyribose derivatives, are not present in PNAs. As disclosed by P. E. Nielsen, M. Egholm, R. H. Berg and O. Buchardt, Science 254, 1497 (1991); and M. Egholm, O. Buchardt, L. Christensen, C. Behrens, S. M. Freier, D. A. Driver, R. H. Berg, S. K. Kim, B. Norden, and P. E. Nielsen, Nature 365, 666 (1993), PNAs bind specifically and tightly to complementary DNA strands and are not degraded by nucleases. In fact, PNA binds more strongly to DNA than DNA itself does. This is probably because there is no electrostatic repulsion between the two strands, and also the polyamide backbone is more flexible. Because of this, PNA/DNA duplexes bind under a wider range of stringency conditions than DNA/DNA duplexes, making it easier to perform multiplex hybridization. Smaller probes can be used than with DNA due to the strong binding. In addition, it is more likely that single base mismatches can be determined with PNA/DNA hybridization because a single mismatch in a PNA/DNA 15-mer lowers the melting point (T.sub.m) by 8°-20° C., vs. 4°-16° C. for the DNA/DNA 15-mer duplex. Also, the absence of charge groups in PNA means that hybridization can be done at low ionic strengths and reduce possible interference by salt during the analysis. <span style="display: none">[0334] </span> </div>

Both methods rely on binding of the polynucleotide to a complementary DNA or RNA. For these techniques, preferred polynucleotides are usually oligonucleotides 20 to 40 bases in length and complementary to either the region of the gene involved in transcription (triple helix—see Lee et al., Nucl.

Neurochem. 56:560 (1991); Oligodeoxy-nucleotides as Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla. (1988)).

Immobilization by adsorption to a well in a microtiter plate or to a membrane is preferred. In such cases, adsorption may be achieved by contacting the binding agent, in a suitable buffer, with the solid support for the suitable amount of time. The contact time varies with temperature, but is typically between about 1 hour and about 1 day. In general, contacting a well of plastic microtiter plate (such as polystyrene or polyvinylchloride) with an amount of binding agent ranging from about 10 ng to about 10 ug, and preferably about 100 ng to about 1 ug, is sufficient to immobilize an adequate amount of binding agent. <span style="display: none">[0396] </span> </div>

Thus, for example, DOPG/DOPC vesicles can be prepared by drying 50 mg each of DOPG and DOPC under a stream of nitrogen gas into a sonication vial. The sample is placed under a vacuum pump overnight and is hydrated the following day with deionized water. The sample is then sonicated for 2 hours in a capped vial, using a Heat Systems model 350 sonicator equipped with an inverted cup (bath type) probe at the maximum setting while the bath is circulated at 15EC. Alternatively, negatively charged vesicles can be prepared without sonication to produce multilamellar vesicles or by extrusion through nucleopore membranes to produce unilamellar vesicles of discrete size.

For example, MLVs containing nucleic acid can be prepared by depositing a thin film of phospholipid on the walls of a glass tube and subsequently hydrating with a solution of the material to be encapsulated. SUVs are prepared by extended sonication of MLVs to produce a homogeneous population of unilamellar liposomes. The material to be entrapped is added to a suspension of preformed MLVs and then sonicated. When using liposomes containing cationic lipids, the dried lipid film is resuspended in an appropriate solution such as sterile water or an isotonic buffer solution such as 10 mM Tris/NaCl, sonicated, and then the preformed liposomes are mixed directly with the DNA. The liposome and DNA form a very stable complex due to binding of the positively charged liposomes to the cationic DNA. SUVs find use with small nucleic acid fragments.

Rastinejad et al., <span style="display: none">[0607] </span> <i>Cell </i>56:345-355 (1989). In those rare instances in which neovascularization occurs under normal physiological conditions, such as wound healing, organ regeneration, embryonic development, and female reproductive processes, angiogenesis is stringently regulated and spatially and temporally delimited. Under conditions of pathological angiogenesis such as that characterizing solid tumor growth, these regulatory controls fail. Unregulated angiogenesis becomes pathologic and sustains progression of many neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases. A number of serious diseases are dominated by abnormal neovascularization including solid tumor growth and metastases, arthritis, some types of eye disorders, and psoriasis. See, e.g., reviews by Moses et al., <i>Biotech</i>. 9:630-634 (1991); Folkman et al., <i>N. Engl. J. Med</i>., 333:1757-1763 (1995); Auerbach et al., <i>J. Microvasc.

Briefly, the cornea is a tissue which normally lacks blood vessels. In certain pathological conditions however, capillaries may extend into the cornea from the pericorneal vascular plexus of the limbus. When the cornea becomes vascularized, it also becomes clouded, resulting in a decline in the patient's visual acuity. Visual loss may become complete if the cornea completely opacitates. A wide variety of disorders can result in corneal neovascularization, including for example, corneal infections (e.g., trachoma, herpes simplex keratitis, leishmaniasis and onchocerciasis), immunological processes (e.g., graft rejection and Stevens-Johnson's syndrome), alkali burns, trauma, inflammation (of any cause), toxic and nutritional deficiency states, and as a complication of wearing contact lenses. <span style="display: none">[0614] </span> </div>

Within further embodiments, the anti-angiogenic factors or anti-angiogenic compositions may be utilized as an adjunct to conventional steroid therapy. Topical therapy may also be useful prophylactically in corneal lesions which are known to have a high probability of inducing an angiogenic response (such as chemical burns).

The preferred site of injection may vary with the morphology of the individual lesion, but the goal of the administration would be to place the composition at the advancing front of the vasculature (i.e., interspersed between the blood vessels and the normal cornea). In most cases this would involve perilimbic corneal injection to “protect” the cornea from the advancing blood vessels. This method may also be utilized shortly after a corneal insult in order to prophylactically prevent corneal neovascularization. In this situation the material could be injected in the perilimbic cornea interspersed between the corneal lesion and its undesired potential limbic blood supply. Such methods may also be utilized in a similar fashion to prevent capillary invasion of transplanted corneas. In a sustained-release form injections might only be required 2-3 times per year.

A sequence “complementary to at least a portion of an RNA,” referred to herein, means a sequence having sufficient complementarity to be able to hybridize with the RNA, forming a stable duplex; in the case of double stranded antisense nucleic acids, a single strand of the duplex DNA may thus be tested, or triplex formation may be assayed. The ability to hybridize will depend on both the degree of complementarity and the length of the antisense nucleic acid. Generally, the larger the hybridizing nucleic acid, the more base mismatches with a RNA it may contain and still form a stable duplex (or triplex as the case may be).

While ribozymes that cleave mRNA at site specific recognition sequences can be used to destroy mRNAs, the use of hammerhead ribozymes is preferred. Hammerhead ribozymes cleave mRNAs at locations dictated by flanking regions that form complementary base pairs with the target mRNA.

The construction and production of hammerhead ribozymes is well known in the art and is described more fully in Haseloff and Gerlach, Nature 334:585-591 (1988).

Interstitial space of the tissues comprises the intercellular fluid, mucopolysaccharide matrix among the reticular fibers of organ tissues, elastic fibers in the walls of vessels or chambers, collagen fibers of fibrous tissues, or that same matrix within connective tissue ensheathing muscle cells or in the lacunae of bone.
