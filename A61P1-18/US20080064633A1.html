<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002"> The present invention relates generally to the treatment of inflammatory and fibrotic conditions. More particularly, the invention provides a method for the treatment of inflammatory and fibrotic disease using recombinant human uteroglobin (rhUG). The invention identifies novel physiological roles for UG and their applications. Even more specifically, the invention relates to the treatment of inflammatory and fibrotic conditions by administering rhUG to inhibit PLA<sub>2</sub>s in vivo and to prevent fibronectin deposition in vivo. The invention further provides a method for the treatment of neonatal RDS/BPD, a critical clinical condition of the lung, and glomerular nephropathy, a disease of the kidney, both characterized by the involvement of inflammatory and fibrotic components </div>

<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003"> The search for improved therapeutic agents for the treatment of inflammatory, as well as fibrotic diseases, has received much attention in recent years. Neonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS), a lung surfactant deficiency disease, is a condition of particular interest in that it is one of the major causes of mortality in premature neonates. While introduction of surfactant therapy dramatically improves survival of RDS patients, the development of chronic inflammatory and fibrotic disease in a significant percentage of this patient population is a major problem. Likewise, hereditary fibronectin-deposit glomerular nephropathy leads to end stage renal failure when patients' kidneys become blocked and no longer filter the blood. Hereditary glomerular nephropathy is characterized by fibronectin deposits and fibrosis of the kidneys. In both diseases, fibronectin deposition and fibrosis render the organ non-functional, and eventually, unable to support life. Thus, these patients require chronic hemodialysis or kidney transplantation. </div>

Human uteroglobin, also known as “CC10”, inhibits the activity of phospholipase A<sub>2 </sub>(PLA<sub>2</sub>) in vitro [Levin, S. W., et al. Uteroglobin inhibits phospholipase A<sub>2 </sub>activity. Life Sci. 38:1813-1819 (1986); Singh, G. et al. Clara Cell 10 kda protein (CC10): Comparison of Structure and Function to Uteroglobin. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1039:348-355 (1990); Mantile, G. et al Human Clara Cell 10 kDa Protein Is The Counterpart of Rabbit Uteroglobin. J. Biol. Chem. 268:20343-20351 (1993)]. Human uteroglobin was first isolated in 1988 as a secretion product from the Clara cells of the lungs (Singh, G., et al. Identification, Cellular Localization, Isolation and Characterization of Human Clara Cell-Specific 10 kD Protein. J. Histochem. Cytochem., 36:73-80 (1987). (The designation “CC10” was derived from “Clara cell 10 kDa”.). It is a small globular homodimeric protein, and migrates in electrophoretic gels at a size corresponding to 10 kDa (Singh, G., et al. Identification, Cellular Localization, Isolation and Characterization of Human Clara Cell-Specific 10 kD Protein. J. Histochem. Cytochem., 36:73-80 (1987). (The designation “CC10” was derived from “Clara cell 10 kDa”). Holman uteroglobin (hUG) is abundant in the adult human lung, and comprises up to about 7% of the total soluble protein (Bernard, A. et al, Protein 1 is a Secretory Protein of the Respiratory and Urogenital tracts identical to the Clara Cell Proteins. Clin. Chem. 38:434-435 (1992)). However, its expression is not fully activated in developing human fetus until the last few weeks of gestation. Consequently, the extracellular lung fluids of pre-term infants contain less human UG than those of adults, and may be deficient in these neonates (Dhanireddy, R., El-Ali, M., Murty, L., and A. B. Mukherjee, Pediatric Research 23:463A (1988) and Dhanireddy, R., Lim, M., and A. B. Mukherjee, Pediatric Research 33:323A (1993)). </div>

They play critical roles in the inflammatory response because they release arachidonic acid (AA) from cellular phospholipid reservoirs. AA is metabolized to a number of potent inflammatory mediators in a process referred to as the arachidonic acid cascade (Piomelli, D. Arachidonic Acid in Cell Signaling. Op. In Cell Biol. 5:274-280 (1993)). Several acute and chronic clinical conditions have been characterized with elevated serum or local PLA<sub>2 </sub>activity (see Table below). Native rabbit uteroglobin (UG), discovered in 1967 and purified from uteri of pregnant rabbits (Krishnan, R. S. and Daniel, J. C., Jr. “Blastokinin: Inducer and Regulator of Blastocyst Development in the Rabbit Uterus.” Science 158:490-492 (1967); Beier H. M. Verhandl Deut. Zool. Ges., Heidelberg (1968)), inhibits PLA<sub>2 </sub>activity in vitro (Levin, 1988; supra). Clinical conditions in which elevated PLA<sub>2 </sub>activity is documented are set forth in the following Table.

The “UG-like” proteins, including human UG/CC10, rat CC10, mouse CC10 and rabbit UG, exhibit species-specific and tissue-specific antigenic differences, as well as differences in their tissue distribution and biochemical activities in vitro. UG-like proteins have been described in many different contexts with regard to tissue and species of origin, and have also been identified using numerous different names, including uteroglobin, blastokinin, CC 10 kDa protein (from rat lung), urine-protein 1 or “P1” (human), progesterone-binding protein (rabbit uterus), PCB-binding protein (rat lung), and CC16 (human lung), which has created confusion in the literature. At present there are no known physiological roles for these proteins (Umland, T. C., et al. Structure of a Human Clara Cell phospholipid-binding protein-ligand, complex at 1.9 A resolution, Nature Struct. Biol. 1:538-545 (1994); Hard, T. et al, Solution Structure of Mammalian PCB-binding Protein in Complex with a PCB. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2:983-989 (1995); Umland T. C. and M. Sax.

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007"> The absence of structural identity among UG-like proteins makes it impossible to predict whether a protein will possess in vivo function based on in vitro or other activity exhibited by a structurally related protein in the context of an human therapeutic. For example, human uteroglobin binds less than 5% of the amount of progesterone than rabbit UG binds in the same assay (Singh, G., et al. Clara Cell 10 kDa Protein (CC10): Comparison of Structure and Function to Uteroglobin. Biochem Biophys Acta 1039:348-355 (1990). Human UG has a lower isoelectric point (4.6) than rabbit UG (5.4). Moreover, a UG knockout mouse recently generated to eliminate expression of UG has Clara cells which exhibit odd intracellular structures in place of UG secretion granules, but there is no other phenotype. This observation is highly significant since the anticipated phenotype was inefficient pulmonary function accompanied by pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. The knockout mouse shows no evidence of pulmonary impairment or abnormality, indicating that the UG protein has no significant role in surfactant homeostasis as had been previously suggested (Lesur, O., et al. Clara Cell Protein (CC16) Induces a Phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>-mediated Inhibition of Fibroblast Migration in Vitro. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 152:290-297 (1995); Umland, T.

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009"> Fibronectin (Fn) is a 200 kDa glycoprotein which exists in several different forms and is secreted by different tissues. Fn is an essential protein and attempts to generate knockout mice showed that it has a central role in embryogenesis. Fn also plays a key role in inflammation, cell adhesion, tissue repair and fibrosis, and is deposited at the site of injury. Plasma fibronectin, (pFn) is secreted by the liver and circulates in the plasma. In the lung, cellular Fn (cFn) is secreted upon inflammation and injury. Both types of Fn are chemotactic factors for inflammatory cells and fibroblasts. Large numbers of inflammatory cells (neutrophils) and fibroblasts infiltrate the lung during inflammatory episodes, which can lead to pulmonary fibrosis and ultimately death. Elevated levels of Fn have been detected in human clinical conditions such as neonatal RDS and BPD of the lung, and glomerular nephropathy of the kidney. </div>

</li> <heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0011"> The present invention is directed to the surprising discoveries that UG plays a central physiological role in prevention of fibronectin deposition and fibrosis and in vivo inhibition of PLA<sub>2</sub>s through a combination of experiments done in a new strain of transgenic UG “knockout” mice, and in a monkey model of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) which involves pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. The UG knockout mice exhibit lethal glomerular nephropathy and renal parenchymal fibrosis, as early and late onset diseases, respectively. Administration of recombinant human UG (rhUG) to the UG knockout mice inhibits Fn deposition in the kidneys. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0012]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0013" num="0012"> Furthermore, the actual reduction of PLA<sub>2 </sub>activity in vivo is demonstrated in the presence of UG with two experiments: 1) the phenotype of the UG knockout mice further reveals that serum PLA<sub>2 </sub>activity is significantly elevated in the absence of UG, compared to littermates possessing a functional UG gene; and 2) administration of rhUG to pre-term monkeys suffering from RDS inhibits PLA<sub>2 </sub>activity, in the extracellular fluids of the lungs. In vitro PLA<sub>2 </sub>can degrade the artificial surfactant (typically Survanta) used in treatment of RDS and rhUG can inhibit this degradation. Moreover, UG-Fn complexes can be detected in samples through the use of a new solution phase sandwich assay for the complex. The results of these experiments demonstrate that rhUG does, in fact, mediate PLA<sub>2 </sub>inhibition and Fn deposition in vivo following intratracheal or intravenous administration. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0013]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0014" num="0013"> The UG knockout mouse of the present invention further demonstrates that rhUG may be used to treat conditions in which UG is found to be deficient, or the protein itself bears a loss-of-function mutation. In particular, according to the present invention, rhUG may be used to treat or prevent inflammatory or fibrotic conditions in which functional endogenous UG is deficient in the circulation or at the site of inflammation or fibrosis. Normal ranges for UG in bodily fluids have been primarily characterized (Bernard, A., et al. Human Urinary Protein 1: Evidence for Identity with the Clara cell protein and occurrence in respiratory tract and urogenital secretions. Clin. Chim. Acta 207: 239-249 (1992)). Reductions in the levels of UG in serum and/or broncho-alveolar lavage fluids have been found in certain pulmonary inflammatory or fibrotic conditions (Lesur, O., et al. Clara Cell Protein (CC-16) Induces a Phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>-mediated Inhibition of Fibroblast Migration In Vivo. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 152: 290-297 (1995)), including pre-term infants at risk for developing neonatal BPD (Dhanireddy, R, et al. Uteroglobin-like protein in premature infants: Effect of gestational age. Pediatric Research 23: 463A (1988)). The present invention provides an understanding of the mechanisms through which therapeutic intervention through UG replacement can be achieved. Therefore, rhUG may be used to supplement deficient or defective endogenous UG to prevent or treat such inflammatory and fibrotic conditions. </div>

The presence of any said complex bound to said support is detected using, for example, anti-IgG antibody conjugated to an enzyme such as horse radish peroxidase using a standard enzymatic reaction wherein the enzyme substrate is converted to a chromogenic or fluorogenic compound which is quantitated using standard spectrophotometric or fluorometric apparatus. </div>

There was no evidence prior to the present invention that PLA<sub>2 </sub>inhibitors could reduce or prevent inflammatory disease in vivo (Glaser KB. Regulation of phospholipase A<sub>2 </sub>enzymes: selective inhibitors and their pharmacological potential. Adv Pharmacol. 32:31-66 (1995)). For example, a PLA<sub>2 </sub>inhibitor, CaNa2-EDTA, did not significantly affect the clinical outcome in pancreatitis, a condition characterized by elevated serum PLA<sub>2 </sub>activity (Tykka, H. T., et al. A Randomized Double-Blind Study Using CaNa2EDTA, a Phospholipase A<sub>2 </sub>Inhibitor, in the Management of Human Acute Pancreatitis. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 20:5-12 (1985)). Moreover, as noted above, a recently constructed putative UG knockout mouse model appears to be normal, exhibiting no signs of inflammatory disease (Stripp, 1996, supra). In addition, PLA<sub>2 </sub>enzymes affect many physiological processes and, despite extensive study of many PLA<sub>2 </sub>inhibitors, none is used in any clinical application (Sheuer, W., Phospholipase A<sub>2</sub>-Regulation and Inhibition. Klin. Wochenschr. 67:153-159 (1989)). In addition, rhUG binds to phospholipids in vitro, which precludes its use in conjunction with exogenously administered surfactant for RDS (Umland, 1994; supra). </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0022]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0023" num="0022"> There is no information on potential toxicity to humans if a bolus of rhUG is administered into the body. It has been observed that UG binds calcium (Barnes H J, et al. Structural basis for calcium binding by uteroglobins. J. Mol. Biol. (Feb 23, 1996)), suggesting that introduction of a bolus of rhUG may cause a systemic imbalance of calcium. Human UG is a growth factor for some types of cells and tumors which mitigates against the use of UG (Aoki, A., et al. Isolation of human uteroglobin from blood filtrate. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2:489-497 (1996). </div>

By the term “compensating amount” is meant an amount of rhUG required to bring the local pulmonary or systemic concentration of total UG (endogenous functional UG and rhUG) to within its normal range. More specifically, the normal range for local pulmonary concentration of endogenous functional UG is &gt;50 micrograms UG/milligram albumin (Dhanireddy, et al. 1988; supra) or &gt;500 micrograms/liter (Bernard, et al. 1992; supra).

The lung surfactant is generally present in the composition an amount of about 10-90% by weight, more usually about 20-80% by weight. The surfactant, by virtue of its very low surface tension spreads out over the internal surface of the lungs, carrying the rhUG with it.

Because native UG has a glutamic acid residue at its N-terminus, an initiator methionine will be added. Mantile et al (1993; supra) have previously shown that addition of Met-Ala-Ala (SEQ ID NO:5) at the N-terminus of recombinant hUG does not alter its activity as an inhibitor of PLA.sub.2. Nor does a Met residue at the N-terminus (which allows bacterial translational initiation) effect is activity as a PCB-binding protein (Hard et al, 1996; supra). Bam Hi sticky ends are located at both ends of the annealed gene to facilitate cloning into the Bam HI site of pBR322, which allows identification of clones by screening for sensitivity to tetracycline. Codon usage will be optimized for expression in bacteria according to Anderssen and Kurland (Codon Preferences in Free-living Microorganisms. Microbiological Reviews. 54:198-210 (1990)). Thus far, it has only been expressed from the human cDNA sequence with only moderate levels of protein expression and recovery achieved. The optimization of codon usage typically results in a higher translation efficiency and expression level. Oligos 1-4 represent the coding strand and 5-8 represent the complementary strand. Both sets are in order from 5′ to 3′, respectively, and are assembled as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0061]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0062" num="0061"> An <i>E. coli </i>host strain is constructed for expression of rhUG from the heat-inducible promoter, P<sub>L</sub>, from a bacteriophage lambda. This promoter requires the lambda repressor, cI, in order to remain inactive until the desired time of expression. The temperature sensitive cI protein (mutant c1<sub>453</sub>) binds to the P<sub>L </sub>promoter when the temperature is 32° C. or less (Sambrook, et al., 1989). When the temperature is rapidly elevated to 42° C. (i.e., less than 15°), the cI<sub>453 </sub>repressor undergoes a confirmational switch and no longer binds the P<sub>L </sub>promoter sequence. This results in overexpression of the rhUG gene. The bacterial host strain is derived from wild type <i>E. coli, </i>strain W3110, obtained from the ATCC. Wild type strains are generally regarded as more robust than typical research cloning strains and are preferred for protein production. A lysogen of this strain is constructed using a cI<sub>453</sub>, Xis- mutant of lambda phage, also obtained from the ATCC. This strain constitutively expresses the c1<sub>453 </sub>repressor. Since the lysogen is Xis-, the prophage cannot excise itself from the host chromosome, preventing replication of the phage when expression of the protein is induced. This host strain, W31108cI<sub>453</sub>, is transformed with the expression vector and maintained as described previously. Individual colony transformants are also screened for expression as described. </div>

This begins with fermentations to gauge the maximum biomass achievable (maximum OD<sub>600 </sub>and wet weight cell paste) in both minimal media, supplemented with glucose, and in rich media at 37° C., followed by a time course of the expression to determine peak uteroglobin production as a function of OD<sub>600 </sub>following induction. </div>

(The use of protease inhibitors (PMSF, leupeptin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor) is necessary in the early stages but may eventually be eliminated).

The pH of the sample buffer will be dropped to 4.2 with ammonium acetate slowly, with stirring in the cold. RhUG is known to be stable at low pH (Andersson, 1994; supra, Miele, L., et al. High level expression in <i>E. coli </i>of a dimeric, eukaryotic protein with two disulfide bridges under the control of phage T7 promoter. J. Biol. Chem. 265:6427-6435 91990)). The sample is then passed over a Sartobind filter (Sartorius Corp). At low pH, endotoxin and DNA bind with high efficiency to this membrane and are effectively removed. The UG sample is placed on a CM-Sepharose column equilibrated with 25 mM ammonium acetate, pH 4.2. (Column sizes are determined based on protein content in the sample, estimated rhUG content, and sample volume). RhUG binds to the column under these conditions. It is eluted with a linear gradient of 25 mM ammonium acetate, pH 4.2, and 120 mM ammonium acetate, pH 6.0 (Miele, L., et al., 1990; supra). This process is converted to a step gradient when a reproducible elution profile is obtained. If a second chromatography step is necessary, sample fractions are pooled and concentrated using a YM-2 membrane (Amicon). The sample is then passed over a Sephadex G-75 column equilibrated in 20 MM potassium phosphate, pH 7.2. RhUG fractions are pooled and concentrated again using the YM-2 membrane. The final sample is characterized for activity and concentration. Some aliquots of rhUG are lyophilized and stored at −70° C. with dessicant, others are stored in PBS at 4° C. </div>

Proteinuria is a condition in which abnormally high levels of albumin and other serum proteins are excreted in the urine. It is indicative of glomerular dysfunction and renal failure. Histopathological examination of the kidneys of affected animals (as described above for lungs) revealed the fulminant renal glomerular disease shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Compared with the glomeruli of the UG<sup>+/+</sup> mice, those of UG<sup>−/−</sup> mice were hypocellular and had massive eosinophilic proteinaceous deposits. The time course of the fatal renal disease in UG<sup>−/−</sup> mice was either early onset (4-5 week period) or late onset (10 month period). Those UG<sup>−/−</sup> mice that initially appeared healthy at 4 weeks of age had focal glomerular deposits at two months of age. At about 10 months, these mice had extreme cachexia similar to that of the mice dying of early onset disease. Heterozygotes had a milder form of the renal disease observed in UG<sup>−/−</sup> mice. Histopathology of the kidneys of mice with late onset disease showed not only severe glomerularopathy as in the early onset disease, but also had marked fibrosis of the renal parenchyma and tubular hyperplasia (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).

The identity of the renal deposits in the UG<sup>−/−</sup> mice was established by immunohistochemistry of kidney sections.

A kidney from a UG<sup>−/−</sup> mouse, with glomerular lesion, was fixed in formalin and embedded in epoxy resin. Thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate for examination under the electron microscope. Photomicrographs were taken either at 6000× or at 60,000×. The deposits contained primarily two types of fibrillar structures: one type of long and striated fibrils which are relatively infrequent, the other short and diffuse which are more abundant (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4E</figref> and F). Because ECM proteins, such as collagen and fibronectin, produce similar fibrillar structures, the glomerular deposits in UG<sup>−/−</sup> mice may contain these proteins. </div>

Similarly, immunofluorescence studies using antibodies specific for Fn, collagen I and III, vitronectin, laminin and osteopontin were also done. Epifluorescence was photographed using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. Fn-specific immunofluorescence in the renal glomeruli of wild-type mice was virtually undetectable (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4G</figref>), that in the glomeruli of UG<sup>−/−</sup> littermates was intense (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4H</figref>).

Immunofluoresence, using collagen I and collagen III-specific antibodies confirmed these results. Because Fn is known to interact with other ECM proteins, we also tested for the presence of laminin, vitronectin and osteopontin in the glomeruli of UG<sup>+/+</sup> and UG mice by immunohistochemistry, the results of which were negative. </div>

The results indicate that relative amounts of Fn-mRNA were essentially identical in both UG<sup>+/+</sup> and UG<sup>−/−</sup> animals. Thus, over-production of Fn-mRNA was not a likely cause of Fn-deposition in the glomeruli of UG<sup>−/−</sup> mice. We then compared the Fn-protein in the plasma, kidneys, and the liver of UG<sup>−/−</sup> and UG<sup>+/+</sup> mice by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and Western blotting. In the plasma, kidneys and the liver of wild-type mice only 220-kD Fn species could be detected; however, whereas the plasma and the liver lysate of UG<sup>−/−</sup> had the 220-kD Fn band, the kidney lysates contained another distinct, covalently linked, multimeric Fn-band (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>). </div>

Ginsberg, Cell, 83, 715 (1995), Q. Zhang and D. F. Mosher, J. Biol. Chem. 271, 33284 (1996). Because UG is a potent inhibitor of soluble phospholipase A<sub>2 </sub>(sPLA<sub>2</sub>) (Mantile et al. 1993; supra), a key enzyme in the inflammatory pathway, the lack of UG in UG<sup>−/−</sup> mice may contribute to the development of glomerulonephritis, an inflammatory renal disease (W. A. Border and E. Ruoslahti, J. Clin. Invest. 90, 1 (1992)). Moreover, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a byproduct of PLA<sub>2 </sub>hydrolysis of phosphatidic acid, causes integrin activation, Fn matrix assembly and fibrilogenesis (E. Ruoslahti, Ann. Rev. Biochem. 57, 375 (1988); R. O. Hynes, Fibronectins. New York: Springer-Verlag (1990); M. A. Chernousov, F. J. Fogarty, V. E. Koteliansky and D. F. Mosher, D. F. J. Biol. Chem. 266, 10851 (1991); Q.

Ginsberg, Cell, 83, 715 (1995), Q. Zhang and D. F. Mosher, J. Biol. Chem. 271, 33284 (1996). Thus, we measured PLA<sub>2 </sub>activity in the serum of age, sex and weight-matched UG<sup>+/+</sup> (n=3) and UG<sup>−/−</sup> mice (n=3). The animals were sacrificed and serum PLA<sub>2 </sub>activities of each sample were measured in triplicate using a PLA<sub>2</sub>-assay kit (Caymen Chemical) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Protein concentrations in the sera were determined by Bradford assay (Bio Rad) and specific activities of PLA<sub>2 </sub>were calculated. The specific activities (:mol/min/mg protein) of serum PLA<sub>2 </sub>of UG<sup>−/−</sup> mice [36+3.3 (SEM)] were significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) than those of UG<sup>+/+</sup> mice [18+2.8 (SEM)]. These results raised the possibility that higher PLA<sub>2 </sub>activity may lead to increased LPA production and consequently promote integrin activation and Fn-self aggregation in UG<sup>−/−</sup> mice. </div>

Equimolar concentrations of UG and Fn were incubated to allow any protein binding or other interactions, then immunoprecipitated with Fn-antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Western blotting, as previously described, with either Fn or UG antibody detected each protein, respectively. The results show that fibronectin co-immunoprecipitated with UG (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>). To confirm these results, the <sup>125</sup>I-UG was incubated with Fn and the complexes resolved by electrophoresis, using a 6% polyacrylamide gel under non-denaturing and non-reducing conditions (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>). Detection of a Fn-UG heteromer in the autoradiogram (lane 2) showed that soluble Fn interacts with UG in vitro. To ascertain whether Fn-UG heteromerization takes place in vivo, plasma of UG<sup>+/+</sup> and UG<sup>−/−</sup> mice was immunoprecipitated with a murine Fn antibody that does not crossreact with UG (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>). Anti-murine Fn antibody co-precipitated both Fn and UG from the plasma of UG<sup>+/+</sup>, but not from UG<sup>−/−</sup> mice, suggesting that Fn-UG heteromers are present in the plasma of UG<sup>+/+</sup> mice. Therefore, the Fn-UG complex is not simply an artifact formed in vitro but occurs naturally in the serum. </div>

SDS-PAGE and Western blotting of all Fn with UG antibody failed to detect any UG contamination. The radiolabeled complex was washed twice with PBS, solubilized in 1 N NaOH, neutralized with 1 N HCl, and radioactivity was measured by a gamma counter. In a separate experiment <sup>125</sup>I-hFn (3 :1) was incubated with 20:1 (1 mg/ml) of mouse Fn in 40:1 of HBSS, pH 7.6 in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of reduced UG (5-500:g) at room temperature for 2 hours.

The Scatchard analyses of the data from both types of binding experiments yielded straight lines with Kds of 13 nM for LTG binding to Fn and 176 nM for Fn binding to itself. These results suggest that, due to a relatively higher binding-affinity of UG for Fn, UG may effectively counteract Fn self-aggregation. Affinity-crosslinking experiments in which radio-iodinated (<sup>125</sup>I)-collagen I was incubated with unlabeled Fn in the absence or presence of UG, were also done as described above for Fn.

Twenty-four hours after the last injection, the mice were sacrificed and various organs were fixed in buffered formalin. The histological sections of the kidneys and other organs were examined by immunofluorescence (Peri, A., Cordella-Miele, E., Miele, L., and A. B. Mukherjee, J Clin.

A solution phase diagnostic assay for the detection of UG-Fn complexes is developed and the assay format is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The capture antibody, covalently linked to a solid support, is a monospecific rabbit polyclonal raised against the human protein (A. B. Mukherjee, laboratory reagent).

The solid support affords the flexibility of performing wash steps after each binding reaction in order to obtain more consistent results with a variety of sample types. The detection antibody is specific for Fn, and available from a number of commercial sources. An anti-IgG antibody, conjugated to an enzyme such as horse radish peroxidase (HRP), is then used to detect the anti-Fn IgG at the end of the molecular chain in a standard enzymatic reaction in which the enzyme substrate is converted to a chromogenic or fluorogenic compound that is quantitated with a spectrophotometer or fluorimeter (Amersham).
