<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments herein relate to compositions, methods and uses for alpha-1 antitrypsin (α-1 antitrypsin, AAT) or analog thereof having no significant serine protease activity. In certain embodiments, α-1 antitrypsin can have significantly reduced or eliminated serine protease activity. Other embodiments relate to compositions and methods for treatment of medical conditions associated with viral infections, bacterial infections, apoptosis-mediated conditions and cytokine-mediated conditions.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Normal plasma concentration of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) ranges from 1.3 to 3.5 mg/ml. Under certain conditions, AAT can behave as an acute phase reactant and increase 3-4-fold during host response to inflammation and/or tissue injury or dramatic change such as with pregnancy, acute infection, and tumors. AAT easily diffuses into tissue spaces and forms a 1:1 complex with target proteases, principally neutrophil elastase. Other enzymes such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, cathepsin G, plasmin, thrombin, tissue kallikrein, and factor Xa can also serve as substrates. The enzyme/inhibitor complex is then removed from circulation by binding to serpin-enzyme complex (SEC) receptor and catabolized by the liver and spleen. Therapeutic AAT has been commercially available since the mid 1980's and is prepared by various purification methods. Prolastin is a trademark for a purified variant of AAT. Recombinant unmodified and mutant variants of AAT produced by genetic engineering methods are available.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0004">Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Previous research has shown that replication of FHV requires protease activity amongst other activities for the cleavage of gag-pol precursor proteins. This enzymatic activity is similar to activity of renin-aspartyl protease produced by the kidney. The close relationship between renin and HIV encoded protease led to an accelerated generation of specific HIV protease inhibitors as effective agents in treatment of AIDS. Many therapeutic agents directed against HIV protease have been developed as a consequence and used successfully in AIDS patients. For example, indinavir and crixivan are aspartyl protease inhibitors, which inhibit cleavage of pre-protein of HIV by viral own protease and thereby suppress viral proliferation. These agents have had some success but more rigorous treatments for HIV are needed.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0005">Influenza Virus</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">Influenza is an orthomyxovirus. Three genera, types A, B, and C of influenza exist. Types A and B are the most clinically significant, causing mild to severe respiratory illness. Influenza B is a human virus and does not appear to be present in an animal reservoir. Type A viruses exist in both human and animal populations, with significant avian and swine reservoirs. Although relatively uncommon, it is possible for nonhuman influenza A strains to infect humans by jumping from their natural host. In one specific example, the highly lethal Hong Kong avian influenza outbreak in humans in 1997 was due to an influenza A strain H5N1 virus that was an epidemic in the local poultry population at that time. In this case, the virus killed six of the 18 patients shown to have been infected.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">Annual influenza A virus infections have a significant impact on humanity both in terms of death, between 500,000 and 1,000,000 worldwide each year. In addition, economic impact is huge resulting from direct and indirect loss of productivity during infection. One of the most dramatic events in influenza history was the so-called “Spanish Flu” pandemic of 1918-1919. In less than a year, between 20 and 40 million people died from influenza, with an estimated one fifth of the world's population infected. The virus that caused the Spanish flu was unique for several reasons, not the least of which was its ability to kill previously healthy young adults. In fact, the US military was devastated by influenza near the end of World War I, with 80% of US army deaths between 1918 and 1919 due to infection. Because it is a readily transmitted, primarily airborne pathogen, influenza A represents a serious concern.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007"> <i>Mycobacterium </i>is a genus of bacteria which are aerobic, mostly slow growing, slightly curved or straight rods, sometimes branching and filamentous, and distinguished by acid-fast staining. Typically, mycobacteria are gram-positive obligate aerobes. The genus <i>mycobacterium </i>includes the highly pathogenic organisms that cause tuberculosis (<i>M. tuberculosis </i>and sometimes <i>M. bovis</i>) and leprosy (<i>M. leprae</i>). There are, however, many other species of mycobacterium.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">Certain mycobacteria other than <i>M. tuberculosis </i>and <i>M. bovis </i>are alternatively known as non-tuberculosis mycobacteria. They are divided into four groups, also known as Runyon groups, based on pigmentation and growth rate. Each group includes several species. Group I refers to slow-growing photochromogens; Group II refers to slow-growing scotochromogens; Group III refers to slow-growing nonphotochromogens; and Group IV refers to rapidly-growing mycobacteria. The non-tuberculosis mycobacteria are also called atypical or anonymous mycobacteria.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">Tuberculosis is an acute or chronic infectious disease caused by infection with <i>M. tuberculosis</i>. Tuberculosis is a major disease in developing countries, as well as an increasing problem in developed areas of the world, with approximately 8 million new cases and 3 million deaths each year. Although the infection may be asymptomatic for a considerable period of time, the disease is most commonly manifested as an acute inflammation of the lungs, resulting in fever and a nonproductive cough. If left untreated, serious complications and death typically result.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0010">Although tuberculosis may be controlled using extended antibiotic therapy for an infected individual, such treatment is not sufficient to prevent the spread of the disease. Treatment regimens often require six to twelve months of uniterrurpted therapy. As a result, many patients do not complete the course of treatment, thus leading to ineffective treatment and development of antibiotic resistance TB. Effective vaccination and accurate, early diagnosis of the disease are needed in order to inhibit the spread of tuberculosis. Vaccination with live bacteria remains the most efficient method for inducing protective immunity. The most common <i>Mycobacterium </i>employed in the live vaccine is <i>Bacillus </i>Calmette-Guerin (BCG), an avirulent strain of <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i>. Some countries, such as the United States, however, do not vaccinate the general public because of concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of BCG. Thus, a need exists for alternative treatments to prevent the spread of TB and more rapidly treat an infected individual.</div>

Sporulation enables ready transport and distribution of large quantities of toxin-producing bacteria.</div>

In the course of the AIDS progression, many measurable clinical parameters including AAT progressively increase. In one study, it was demonstrated that AAT levels were affected in 40% of HIV-positive patients with cryptosporidial infections and none of 12 HIV-positive patients with non-cryptosporidial diarrhea. The incidence of abnormal AAT phenotypes was 16.3% in the homosexual group which was significantly different (p less than 0.03) than the 8.7% in the heterosexual group. There was no difference in the phenotype distribution between homosexuals who were anti-HIV antibody reactive and those who were non-reactive. Faecal AAT concentration was reflective of abnormal pancreatic function of paediatric HIV infection. Patients with HIV infection are known to acquire an obstructive pulmonary disease with clinical similarity to emphysema. AAT levels measured in these patients were in the lower normal range. Despite observing these clinical findings in 42% of consecutive HIV-infected patients in the clinic, no evidence of current or of previous opportunistic infection was detected. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained in a subset of these patients contained TNF and free radicals, indicating inflammation.</div>

These AAT deficient persons include a mixed population who receive, or do not receive, intravenous AAT replacement therapy. AAT allocation is not randomized in this registry, and patients receive AAT for various reasons. A recent publication describes the results of a voluntary computer-based (internet) survey of a subset of approximately 300 AAT-deficient patients followed in the NHLBI registry [Lieberman, 2000 #122]. One hundred forty-three of the 300 members of the internet subset (48%) responded to a voluntary questionnaire which included queries about subjective lung infections. A lung infection was defined as increased cough and sputum production, usually associated with change in sputum color, and with or without fever, use of antibiotics or hospitalization.</div>

The 95 patients receiving AAT replacement therapy were asked to compare the yearly incidence of lung infections before and after initiation of AAT therapy. Compared to the yearly number of lung infections reported prior to initiation of AAT therapy, a significant reduction in the number of lung infections was reported following the initiation of AAT therapy. Many patients also believed that head colds and flu were less frequent following the initiation of AAT replacement. In a separate comparison, the 95 members of the NHLBI cohort who received AAT replacement therapy were compared with the 46 who did not receive replacement therapy.

Following transplantation, the members of this study followed a strict protocol of medical management, and each receives frequent medical assessment. An extensive and detailed database is maintained on each of these patients. The database was inspected to specifically evaluate the relationship between AAT deficiency and infection with Influenza A virus or with CMV. AAT deficient patients were found to have substantial and statistically significant increases in infection with influenza A (Flu) and with cytomegalovirus (CMV). These data establish AAT deficiency as a novel risk factor for infections with Flu and with CMV.

Sporulation enables ready transport and distribution of large quantities of toxin-producing bacteria. The toxin is actually a composite consisting of 3 separate secreted proteins from the bacterium. The three proteins are protective antigen (PA), lethal factor (LF), and edema factor (EF). LF and EF directly damage cells and are thought to cause disease due to anthrax toxin exposure. PA is crucial to the virulence of anthrax toxin, since the PA molecule is designed to import both LF and EF inside the membranes of cells. In the absence of PA-induced intracellular transport, anthrax toxin is unable to effect tissue destruction, since LF and EF only function from within the cell.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0075]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0076" num="0075">Anthrax occurs as three general clinical entities: i) inhalation, ii) cutaneous, and iii) gastrointestinal forms.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0076]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0077" num="0076">1.) Inhalation anthrax is the deadliest form of the disease, and it is the one most likely to be involved in a bioweapons altercation or accident. Usually, an infected person inhales anthrax spores serendipitously, or during a bioweapons attack. Following a 1-6 day incubation period, a biphasic illness ensues. Initially, non-specific malaise/fever/dry cough/myalgias, and chest pains occurs. The second phase, 2-3 days after the first phase, consists of progression of the constitutional non-specific findings listed above, an addition to ventilatory compromise, sweating, widening of the mediastimum on radiographic studies, and edema of the neck and chest. This stage of illness is characterized by a necrotizing mediastinal lymphadenitis. This second stage of disease can rapidly progress to shock and death within 2 days, and mortality rates of up to 80% have been reported. The mechanism of death in animal models appears to be enhanced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-1. In one embodiment, disorders associated with inhalation anthrax may be reduced or prevented by administering to a subject in need of such a treatment, a composition including AAT, a fragment thereof, an analog thereof, or a compound with AAT-like activity having no significant serine protease inhibitor activity by for example, inhalation.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0077]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0078" num="0077">2) Cutaneous anthrax is the most common form of anthrax infection in humans. For example, after exposure to anthrax spores, regions of skin eruptions (cuts, abrasions, etc.), present an environment that allows anthrax organisms to emerge from the spore state, to grow, replicate, and produce anthrax toxin. Within 1 week, an area of anthrax innoculation develops a painless papule. Vesicles then form on or near the papule over the ensuing 1-2 days, followed shortly by development of fever and malaise, and a non-pitting edema surrounding the skin lesion that is due to toxin activity. The original lesion ruptures to form necrotic ulceration and enlargement resulting in formation of the eschar that characterizes cutaneous anthrax infection. In the absence of therapy, this disease carries a 20% morality. For those who recover, the eschar sloughs off in 1-2 weeks. In certain embodiments, a method for treating a subject having or exposed to cutaneous anthrax is contemplated herein. In accordance with these embodiments, a topical/cream preparation having AAT or a compound with AAT-like activity having no significant serine protease inhibitor activity can be used. Parenteral compositions, including but not limited to, AAT or a compound with AAT-like activity, but having no significant serine protease inhibitor activity, can also be co-administered in the event that systemic symptoms emerge, or such parenteral therapy can be administered prophylactically for anthrax that appears clinically to be localized to the skin.</div>

After 2-5 days, one develops nausea/vomiting/fever, and abdominal pain. Bloody diarrhea rapidly ensues, and an “acute abdomen” manifests. The pathology within the abdomen includes mucosal ulcerations. Also, hemorrhagic mesenteric lymphadenitis develops, and this is again consistent with selective activation of the anthrax toxin in serine protease-inhibitor deficient microenvironments. This disease carries a mortality rate of 50%. Certain embodiments contemplated herein concern administering a compositions to a subject having or been exposed to gastrointestinal anthrax.

In contrast, Zemaira AAT demonstrated minimal HIV suppression at 7.0 mg/ml, and near complete suppression was obtained at 15.0 mg/ml. In this exemplary method, there was a large difference in dose response demonstrating that Aralast is more potent than Zemaira as an inhibitor of HIV infection in primary PBMC. Since Aralast and Zemaira are quantified by biological activity (1.0 mg Aralast=1.0 mg Zemaira=1.0 mg of serine protease inhibitor activity), this experiment indicates that the ability of AAT to suppress HIV is independent of serine protease inhibition. If the serine protease inhibitor function of AAT accounts for the HIV suppression, Aralast and Zemaira would inhibit HIV production equivalently.</div>

These cells generate increased HIV following exposure to any of several stimuli. In these exemplary experiments, U1 cells were cultured at a density of 1×10<sup>6 </sup>cells per ml in 500 μl of medium consisting of RPMI 1640 medium with 10% [vol/vol] heat inactivated fetal calf serum, with penicillin 100 units/ml+streptomycin 100 μg/ml. Cells were cultured in wells of a polystyrene tissue culture plate with medium alone (control), with medium containing stimulus alone (3 nM IL 18), or with stimulus in the presence of AAT (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, left panel) or heat inactivated AAT (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, right panel). AAT was added to cultures 1.0 hr prior to the addition of IL-18 (interleukin 18) stimulus. Cultures were incubated for 24 hrs (37° C., 5% CO<sub>2</sub>), and then lysed with 1% (vol/vol) triton X 100 and then the lysates were assayed for HIV p24 antigen using an ELISA. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, IL-18 stimulated an increase in HIV production compared to medium alone (control) cultures. Stimulating U1 cell cultures with IL-18 in the presence of either unaltered (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, left panel) AAT or with heat inactivated AAT (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, right panel) resulted in dose dependent inhibition of stimulated HIV production. Comparing native with heat inactivated AAT showed very similar inhibition of p24 production. For both native and heat inactivated AAT, nearly complete HIV suppression induced by IL 18 was observed using AAT concentrations of 4 and 6 mg/ml. These results suggest very similar HIV suppression in this chronic infection model using native or heat inactivated AAT. Another experiment was performed using 0.8 or 5 mg/ml of AAT or HI AAT (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). For both native and heat inactivated AAT, nearly complete HIV suppression induced by IL 18 was observed using AAT of HI AAT concentrations of 5 mg/ml but not at 0.8 mg/ml. Since heat inactivation of AAT using our protocol ablates AAT serine protease inhibitory function (as documented in by an in vitro serine protease neutralization assay, data not shown), these results suggest that AAT suppression of HIV in these studies does not depend on the serine protease inhibitor function of AAT.</div>

HI AAT, or human albumin as a benign placebo protein, were introduced as a subcutaneous (sc) injection at the nape of the neck in order to separate HI AAT or albumin from LT and avoid artifact due to physical combination at the point of delivery. For the treatment arm, 2 mg of AAT was given once immediately after LT injection; and for the placebo arm, 2 mg of human albumin was given once immediately after LT injection. The results using this model of anthrax LT-induced lethality with HI AAT as a candidate therapy are summarized in the survival curves shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. As depicted, all mice given LT and placebo (n=3) died by day 5 (diamonds). In contrast, only one of the mice given LT followed by HI AAT (n=4) died through day 7 (open squares); representing an observed treatment efficacy of 75%.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0159]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0162" num="0159">In order to assess the potential for HI AAT to ameloriate symptoms associated with exposure to anthrax toxin, the mice in this experiment were also scorred on a scale of 1 to 5 for their clinical well being over time; with a score of 1 representing completely healthy and a score of 5 indicaticatin that the mice were unable to move even after prodding. As seen in Table 1, in addition to preventing the symptom of death; with one exception, HI AAT treatment also almost entirely prevented any observable clinical symptoms associated with exposure to anthrax LT.</div>
