<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">Cellular plasma membranes can be viewed as a large store of second messenger that can be enlisted in a variety of signal transduction pathways. As regards function and regulation of effector enzymes in phospholipids signaling pathways, these enzymes generate second messengers from the membrane phospholipids pool (class I PI3 kinases (e.g. PI3 Kgamma)) are dual-specific kinase enzymes, means they display both: lipid kinase (phosphorylation of phosphor-inositides) as well as protein kinase activity, shown to be capable of phosphorylation of other protein as substrates, including auto-phosphorylation as intramolecular regulatory mechanism. These enzymes of phospholipids signaling are activated in response to a variety of extra-cellular signals such as growth factors, mitogens, integrins (cell-cell interactions) hormones, cytokines, viruses and neurotransmitters such as described in Scheme 1 hereinafter and also by intra-cellular cross regulation by other signaling molecules (cross-talk, where the original signal can activate some parallel pathways that in a second step transmit signals to PI3Ks by intra-cellular signaling events), such as small GTPases, kinases or phosphatases for example. The inositol phospholipids (phosphoinositides) intracellular signaling pathway begins with binding of a signaling molecule (extra cellular ligands, stimuli, receptor dimerization, transactivation by heterologous receptor (e.g. receptor tyrosine kinase)) to a G-protein linked transmembrane receptor integrated into the plasma membrane.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">PI3K converts the membrane phospholipids PIP(4,5)<sub>2 </sub>into PIP(3,4,5)3 which in turn can be further converted into another 3′ phosphorylated form of phosphoinositides by 5′-specific phosphor-inositide phophatases, thus PI3K enzymatic activity results either directly or indirectly in the generation of two 3′-phosphoinositide subtypes that function as 2<sup>nd </sup>messengers in intra-cellular signal transduction (Trends Biochem. Sci. 22(7) p. 267-72 (1997) by Vanhaesebroeck et al.: Chem. Rev. 101(8) p. 2365-80 (2001) by Leslie et al (2001); Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. 17p, 615-75 (2001) by Katso et al. and Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 59(5) p. 761-79 (2002) by Toker et al.). Multiple PI3K insoforms categorized by their catalytic subunits, their regulation by corresponding regulatory subunits, expression patterns and signaling-specific functions (p110α, β, and γ) perform this enzymatic reaction (Exp. Cell. Res. 25 (1) p. 239-54 (1999) by Vanhaesebroeck and Katso et al., 2001, above).</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">To date, eight mammalian PI3Ks have been identified, divided into three main classes (I, II, and III) on the basis of sequence homology, structure, binding partners, mode of activation, and substrate preference in vitro. Class I PI3Ks can phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate, m and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) to produce phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PIP), phosphatidylinositol-3,4-biphosphate, and phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate, respectively. Class II PI3Ks phosphorylate PI and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate. Class III PI3Ks can only phosphorylate PI (Vanhaesebrokeck et al., 1997, above; Vanhaesebroeck et al., 1999, above and Leslie et al, 2001, above) G-protein coupled receptors mediated phosphoinositide 3′OH-kinase activation via small GTPases such as Gβγ and Ras, and consequently PI3K signaling plays a central role in establishing and coordinating cell polarity and dynamic organization of the cytoskeleton—which together provides the driving force of cells to move.</div>

The phosphorylation of Ptdlns to 3,4,5-triphosphate (Ptdlns(3,4,5)P3), Ptdlns(3,4)P2 and Ptdlns(3)P acts as second messengers for a variety of signal transduction pathways, including those essential to cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell growth, cell size, cell survival, apoptosis, adhesion, cell motility, cell migration, chemotaxis, invasion, cytoskeletal rearrangement, cell shape changes, vesicle trafficking and metabolic pathway (Katso et al., 2001, above and Mol. Med. Today 6(9) p. 347-57 (2000) by Stein). Chemotaxis—the directed movement of cells toward a concentration gradient of chemical attractants, also called chemokines is involved in many important diseases such as inflammation/auto-immunity, neurodegeneration, antiogenesis, invasion/metastasis and wound healing (Immunol. Today 21(6) p. 260-4 (2000) by Wyman et al.; Science 287(5455) p. 1049-53 (2000) by Hirsch et al.; FASEB J. 15(11) p. 2019-21 (2001) by Hirsch et al. and Nat.

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0007">Recent advances using genetic approaches and pharmacological tools have provided insights into signalling and molecular pathways that mediate chemotaxis in response to chemoattractant activated G-protein coupled receptors PI3-Kinase, responsible for generating these phosphorylated signalling products, was originally identified as an activity associated with viral oncoproteins and growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases that phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol (PI) and its phosphorylated derivatives at the 3′-hydroxyl of the inositol ring (Panayotou et al., Trends Cell Biol. 2 p. 358-60 (1992)). However, more recent biochemical studies revealed that, class I PI3 kinases (e.g. class IB isoform PI3Kγ) are dual-specific kinase enzymes, means they display both: lipid kinase (phosphorylation of phospho-inositides) as well as protein kinase activity, shown to be capable of phosphorylation of other protein as substrates, including auto-phosphorylation as intra-molecular regulatory mechanism.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0008">PI3-kinase activation, is therefore believe to be involved in a range of cellular responses including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (Parker et al., Current Biology, 5 p. 577-99 (1995); Yao et al., Science, 267 p. 2003-05 (1995)). PI3-kinase appears to be involved in a number of aspects of leukocyte activation. A p85-associated PI3-kinase activity has been shown to physically associate with the cytoplasmic domain of CD28, which is an important costimulatory molecule for the activation of T-cells in response to antigen (Pages et al., Nature, 369 p. 327-29 (1994); Rudd, Immunity 4 p. 527-34 (1996)). Activation of T cells through CD28 lowers the threshold for activation by antigen and increases the magnitude and duration of the proliferative response. These effects are linked to increases in the transcription of a number of genes including interleukin-2 (IL2), an important T cell growth factor (Fraser et al., Science 251 p. 313-16 (1991)). Mutation of CD28 such that it can longer interact with PI3-kinase leads to a failure to initiate IL2 production, suggesting a critical role for PI3-kinase in T cell activation. PI3Kγ has been identified as a mediator of G beta-gamma-dependent regulation of JNK activity, and G beta-gamma are subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (Lopez-Ilasaca et al., J. Biol. Chem. 273(5) p. 2505-8 (1998)). Cellular processes in which PI3Ks play an essential role include suppression of apoptosis, reorganization of the actin skeleton, cardiac myocyte growth, glycogen synthase stimulation by insulin, TNFα-mediated neutrophil priming and superoxide generation, and leukocyte migration and adhesion to endothelial cells.</div>

Cell. Sci. 114(Pt 16) p. 2903-10 (2001) by Lawlor et al.; Laffargue et al., 2002, above and Curr. Opinion Cell Biol. 14(2) p. 203-13 (2002) by Stephens et al.).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0010">Specific inhibitors against individual members of a family of enzymes provide invaluable tools for deciphering functions of each enzyme. Two compounds, LY294002 and wortmannin (cf. hereinafter), have been widely used as PI3-kinase inhibitors. These compounds are non-specific PI3K inhibitors, as they do not distinguish among the four members of Class I PI3-kinases. For example, the IC<sub>50 </sub>values of wortmannin against each of the various Class I PI3-kinases are in the range of 1-10 nM. Similarly, the IC<sub>50 </sub>values for LY294002 against each of these PI3-kinases is about 15-20 μM (Fruman et al., Ann. Rev. Biochem., 67, p. 481-507 (1998)), also 5-10 microM on CK2 protein kinase and some inhibitory activity on phospholipases. Wortmannin is a fungal metabolite which irreversibly inhibits PI3K activity by binding covalently to the catalytic domain of this enzyme. Inhibition of PI3K activity by wortmannin eliminates subsequent cellular response to the extracellular factor. For example, neutrophils respond to the chemokine fMet-Leu-Phe (fMLP) by stimulating PI3K and synthesizing Ptdlns (3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>. This synthesis correlates with activation of the respirators burst involved in neutrophil destruction of invading microorganisms. Treatment of neutrophils with wortmannin prevents the fMLP-induced respiratory burst response (Thelen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 91, p. 4960-64 (1994)). Indeed, these experiments with wortmannin, as well as other experimental evidence, shows that PI3K activity in cells of hematopoietic lineage, particularly neutrophils, monocytes, and other types of leukocytes, is involved in many of the non-memory immune response associated with acute and chronic inflammation.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0014" num="0011">Based on studies using wortmannin, there is evidence that PI3-kinase function is also required for some aspects of leukocyte signaling through G-protein coupled receptors (Thelen et al., 1994, above). Moreover, it has been shown that wortmannin and LY294002 block neutrophil migration and superoxide release. Cyclooxygenase inhibiting benzofuran derivatives are disclosed by John M. Janusz et al., in J. Med. Chem. 1998; Vol. 41, No. 18.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0012]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0015" num="0012">It is now well understood that deregulation of onocogenes and tumour-suppressor genes contributes to the formation for malignant tumours, for example by way of increase cell proliferation or increased cell survival. It is also now known that signaling pathways mediated by the PI3k family have a central role in a number of cell processes including proliferation and survival, and deregulation of these pathways is a causative factor a wide spectrum of human cancers and other diseases (Katso et al., <i>Annual Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. </i>2001, 17: 615-617 and Foster et al., <i>J. Cell Science, </i>2003, 116: 3037-3040).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0013]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0016" num="0013">Class I PI3K is a heterodimer consisting of a p110 catalytic subunit and a regulatory subunit, and the family is further divided into class Ia and Class Ib enzymes on the basis of regulatory partners and mechanism of regulation. Class Ia enzymes consist of three distinct catalytic subunits (p110α, p110β, and p110δ) that dimerise with five distinct regulatory subunits (p85α, p55α, p50α, p85β, and p55γ), with all catalytic subunits being able to interact with all regulatory subunits to form a variety of heterodimers. Class Ia PI3K are generally activated in response to growth factor-stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinases, via interaction of the regulatory subunit SH2 domains with specific phosphor-tyrosine residues of the activated receptor or adaptor proteins such as IRS-1. Both p110≢ and p110β are constitutively expressed in all cell types, whereas p110δ expression is more restricted to leukocyte populations and some epithelial cells. In contrast, the single Class Ib enzyme consists of a p110γ catalytic subunit that interacts with a p101 regulatory subunit. Furthermore, the Class Ib enzyme is activated in response to G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) systems and its expression appears to be limited to leucocytes.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0014]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0017" num="0014">There is now considerable evidence indicating that Class Ia PI3K enzymes contribute to tumourigenesis in a wide variety of human cancers, either directly or indirectly (Vivanco and Sawyers, <i>Nature Reviews Cancer, </i>2002, 2, 489-501). For example, the p110α subunit is amplified in some tumours such as those of the ovary (Shayesteh, et al., <i>Nature Genetics, </i>1999, 21: 99-102) and cervix (Ma et al., <i>Oncogene, </i>2000, 19: 2739-2744). More recently, activating mutations within p110a have been associated with various other tumors such as those of the colorectal region and of the breast and lung (Samuels, et al., <i>Science, </i>2004, 304, 554). Tumor-related mutations in p85a have also been identified in cancers such as those of the ovary and colon (Philp et al., <i>Cancer Research, </i>2001, 61, 7426-7429). In addition to direct effects, it is believed that activation of Class Ia PI3K contributes to tumourigenic events that occur upstream in signaling pathways, for example by way of ligan-dependent or ligand-independent activation of receptor tyrosine kinases, GPCR systems or integrins (Vara et al., <i>Cancer Treatment Reviews, </i>2004, 30, 193-204). Examples of such upstream signaling pathways include over-expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase Erb2 in a variety of tumors leading to activation of PI3K-mediated pathways (Harari et al., <i>Oncogene, </i>2000, 19, 6102-6114) and over-expression of the oncogene Ras (Kauffmann-Zeh et al., <i>Nature, </i>1997, 385, 544-548). In addition, Class Ia PI3Ks may contribute indirectly to tumourigenesis caused by various downstream signaling events. For example, loss of the effect of the PTEN tumor-suppressor phosphatase that catalyses conversion of PI(3,4,5)P3 back to P1(4,5)P2 is associated with a very broad range of tumors via deregulation of PI3K-mediated production of PI(3,4,5)P3 (Simpson and Parsons, <i>Exp. Cell Res., </i>2001, 264, 29-41). Furthermore, augmentation of the effects of other PI3K-mediated signaling events is believed to contribute to a variety of cancers, for example by activation of AKT (Nicholson and Andeson, <i>Cellular Signaling, </i>2002, 14, 381-395).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0015]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0018" num="0015">In addition to a role in mediating proliferative and survival signaling in tumor cells, there is also good evidence that class Ia PI3K enzymes will also contribute to tumourigenesis via its function in tumor-associated stromal cells. For examples, PI3K signaling is known to play an important role in mediating angiogenic events in endothelial cells in response to pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGF (abid et al., <i>Arterioscler, Thromb. Vasc. Biol., </i>2004, 24, 294-300). As Class I PI3K enzymes are also involved in motility and migration (Sawyer, Expert Opinion investing. Drugs, 2004, 13, 1-19), PI3K inhibitors should provide therapeutic benefit via inhibition of tumor cell invasion and metastasis.</div>

Receptor tyrosine kinases are involved in the regulation of cell growth and are generally termed growth factor receptors. Inappropriate or uncontrolled activation of many of these kinases, i.e. aberrant kinase growth factor receptor activity, for example by over-expression or mutation, has been shown to result in uncontrolled cell growth. Accordingly, the aberrant activity of such kinases has been linked to malignant tissue growth. Consequently, inhibitors of such kinases could provide cancer treatment methods. Growth factor receptors include, for example, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr), platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFr), erbB2, erbB4, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFr), tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin-like and epidermal growth factor homology domains (TIE-2), insulin growth factor-I (IGFI) receptor, macrophage colony stimulating factor (cfms), BTK, ckit, cmet, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors, Trk receptors (TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC), ephrin (eph) receptors, and the RET protooncogene. Several inhibitors of growth receptors are under development and include ligand antagonists, antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors and anti-sense oligonucleotides.

Inhibitors of angiogenesis related VEGFR and TIE2 are discussed above in regard to signal transduction inhibitors (both receptors are receptor tyrosine kinases). Angiogenesis in general is linked to erbB2/EGFR signaling since inhibitors of erbB2 and EGFR have been shown to inhibit angiogenesis, primarily VEGF expression. Thus, the combination of an erbB2/EGFR inhibitor with an inhibitor of angiogenesis makes sense. Accordingly, non-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be used in combination with the EGFR/erbB2 inhibitors of the present invention. For example, anti-VEGF antibodies, which do not recognize VEGFR (the receptor tyrosine kinase), but bind to the ligand; small molecule inhibitors of integrin (alpha<sub>v </sub>beta<sub>3</sub>) that will inhibit angiogenesis; endostatin and angiostatin (non-RTK) may also prove useful in combination with the disclosed erb family inhibitors.

Therefore, strategies designed to downregulate the expression of bcl-2 in tumors have demonstrated clinical benefit and are now in Phase II/III trials, namely Genta's G3139 bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotide.
