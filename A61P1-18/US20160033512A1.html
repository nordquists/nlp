<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to malignant conditions such as cancer, and in particular to methods and compositions for diagnosing certain carcinomas such as ovarian carcinoma.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Cancer includes a broad range of diseases, affecting approximately one in four individuals worldwide. The severity of the adverse impact of cancer is profound, influencing medical policy and procedure as well as society generally. Because a hallmark of many types of cancer is rapid and unregulated proliferation of malignant cells, an overarching problem in improving approaches to cancer is the need for early detection and diagnosis. Numerous attempts have been made to develop accurate and reliable criteria for diagnosing the presence of a malignant condition. In particular, efforts have been directed to the use of serologically defined antigenic markers known as tumor associated antigens, which are either uniquely expressed by cancer cells or are present at markedly higher levels in subjects having a malignant condition.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">However, due to the high heterogeneity of tumor associated antigen expression, for example the extreme diversity of carcinoma antigens, there is a need for additional tumor markers that are useful in cancer diagnosis. Many monoclonal antibodies reactive with carcinoma associated antigens are known (see, e.g., Papsidero, 1985 Semin. Surg. Oncol. 1:171, Allum et al., 1986 Surg. Ann. 18:41). These and other described monoclonal antibodies bind to a variety of different carcinoma associated antigens including glycoproteins, glycolipids and mucins (see, e.g., Fink et al., 1984 Prog. Clin. Pathol. 9:121; U.S. Pat. No. 4,737,579; U.S. Pat. No. 4,753,894; U.S. Pat. No. 4,579,827; U.S. Pat. No. 4,713,352). Many such monoclonal antibodies recognize tumor associated antigens that exhibit restricted expression on some but not other tumors originating in a given cell lineage or tissue type.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">There are only relatively few examples of tumor associated antigens that appear to be useful for identifying a particular type of malignancy. Monoclonal antibody B72.3, for example, specifically binds to a high molecular mass (&gt;106 Da) tumor-associated mucin antigen that is selectively expressed on a number of different carcinomas, including most if not all ovarian carcinomas and an overwhelming majority of non-small cell lung carcinomas, colon carcinomas and breast carcinomas (see, e.g., Johnston, 1987 Acta Cytol. 1:537; U.S. Pat. No. 4,612,282). Nevertheless, detection of cell-associated tumor markers such as the mucin antigen recognized by B72.3 following surgical resection of a tumor may be of limited usefulness for diagnostic screening, in which early detection of a malignant condition prior to accumulation of substantial tumor mass is preferred.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">An alternative to the diagnosis of a particular type of cancer by screening surgically resected specimens for tumor associated antigens, where invasive surgery is usually indicated only after detection of an accumulated tumor mass, would be to provide compositions and methods for detecting such antigens in samples obtained from subjects by non-invasive or minimally invasive procedures. In ovarian and other carcinomas, for example, there are currently a number of soluble tumor associated antigens that are detectable in samples of readily obtained biological fluids such as serum or mucosal secretions. One such marker is CA125, a carcinoma associated antigen that is also shed into the bloodstream, where it is detectable in serum (e.g., Bast et al., 1983 N. Eng. J. Med. 309:883; Lloyd et al., 1997 Int. J. Canc. 71:842). CA125 levels in serum and other biological fluids have been measured along with levels of other markers, for example, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC), tissue polypeptide specific antigen (TPS), sialyl TN mucin (STN) and placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), in efforts to provide diagnostic and/or prognostic profiles of ovarian and other carcinomas (e.g., Sarandakou et al., 1997 Acta Oncol. 36:755; Sarandakou et al., 1998 Eur. J. Gynaecol. Oncol. 19:73; Meier et al., 1997 Anticanc. Res. 17(4B):2945; Kudoh et al., 1999 Gynecol. Obstet. Invest. 47:52; Ind et al., 1997 Br. J. Obstet. Gynaecol. 104:1024; Bell et al. 1998 Br. J. Obstet. Gynaecol. 105:1136; Cioffi et al., 1997 Tumori 83:594; Meier et al. 1997 Anticanc. Res. 17(4B):2949; Meier et al., 1997 Anticanc. Res. 17(4B):3019).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">Elevated levels of serum CA125 alone or in combination with other known indicators, however, do not provide a definitive diagnosis of malignancy, or of a particular malignancy such as ovarian carcinoma. For example, elevated CA125, CEA and SCC in vaginal fluid and serum correlate most strongly with inflammation in benign gynecological diseases, relative to cervical cancer and genital tract cancers (e.g., Moore et al., 1998 Infect. Dis. Obstet. Gynecol. 6:182; Sarandakou et al., 1997 Acta Oncol. 36:755). As another example, elevated serum CA125 may also accompany neuroblastoma (e.g., Hirokawa et al., 1998 Surg. Today 28:349), while elevated CEA and SCC, among others, may accompany colorectal cancer (Gebauer et al., 1997 Anticanc. Res. 17(4B):2939). Another marker, the differentiation antigen mesothelin, is expressed on the surfaces of normal mesothelial cells and also on certain cancer cells, including epithelial ovarian tumors and mesotheliomas. Compositions and methods pertaining to mesothelin (Chang et al., 1992 Canc. Res. 52:181; Chang et al., 1992 Int. J. Canc. 50:373; Chang et al., 1992 Int. J. Canc. 51:548; Chang et al., 1996 Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 93:136; Chowdhury et al., 1998 Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 95:669; Yamaguchi et al., 1994 J. Biol. Chem. 269:805; Kojima et al., 1995 J. Biol. Chem. 270:21984) and structurally related mesothelin related antigen (MRA; see, e.g., Scholler et al., 1999 Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 96:11531) are known in the art, including uses in cancer detection and therapies as described in WO 00/50900 and in U.S. application Ser. No. 09/513,597. Thus the compelling need for additional markers to be used, including markers useful in multi-factor diagnostic screening, is apparent. (See, e.g., Sarandakou et al., 1998; Kudoh et al., 1999; Ind et al., 1997.)</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">As described in greater detail below, such additional markers might be usefully provided from within the “four-disulfide core” family of proteins, which comprises a heterogeneous group of small acid- and heat-stable molecules of divergent function and which includes human epididymal four-disulfide core protein, or “HE4” (Kirchhoff et al., 1991 Biol. Reprod. 45:350-357; Wang et al., 1999 Gene 229:101; Schummer et al., 1999 Gene 238:375). The conserved spacing of eight core cysteine residues in the amino acid sequences of four-disulfide core family member polypeptides is thought to direct the folding of these molecules into a compact and stable structure. Many of the members of the four-disulfide core family are protease inhibitors; however, for some family members, including HE4, no function has yet been definitively identified. Other members of the four-disulfide core family of proteins include Wp-protein, SLP-1, and ps20, and additional members of the four-disulfide core family of proteins have been isolated from several species. These proteins share several properties, including their small size and their heat- and acid-stable structure, which is stabilized by the four-disulfide core. These proteins are made by secretory cells, and are found in mucous secretions such as seminal plasma, milk, parotid, and cervical secretions.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">The prototype molecule of the four-disulfide core family, Wp-protein, is also known as the whey phosphoprotein, and has been cloned (Dandekar et al., 1982 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 79: 3987-3991). Whey phosphoprotein is expressed in milk at approximately 1-2 mg/ml, but is not expressed by breast carcinomas, where the gene is hypermethylated. No inhibitory activity towards proteases has been found for whey phosphoprotein. However, overexpression of the gene in transgenic animals impairs development of mammary alveolar cells (Burdon et al, 1991 Mechanisms Dev. 36: 67-74), suggesting an important role for this protein during lactation. The secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLP-1), another four-disulfide core family protein, was cloned from human cervix uteri, but is also present in other mucus secretions including seminal plasma and parotid secretions (Heinzel et al, 1986 Eur. J. Biochem. 160: 61-67). SLP-1 is a two domain protein of 12 kDa that is a potent inhibitor of trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, and cathepsin G. The crystal structure of SLP-1 complexed with chymotrypsin has been published (Grutter et al, 1988 EMBO J. 7: 345-351). These data showed that SLP-1 domains can work independently and simultaneously to inhibit different proteases, and identified a small (8 amino acids) active site in domain two that binds to chymotrypsin.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0010">Elafin is a single domain protein member of the four-disulfide core family that was isolated from human psoriatic skin to determine the amino acid sequence of this polypeptide (Wiedow et al, 1990 J. Biol. Chem. 265: 14791-14795). Elafin is a potent inhibitor of elastase, but does not exhibit apparent inhibitory activity toward other proteases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, cathepsin G or plasmin. The amino acid sequence of elafin shows 38% homology with the C-terminal region (domain 1) of SLP-1. The gene encoding the ps20 protein was recently isolated from smooth muscle, and the ps20 protein was expressed by transfection of the gene into mammalian cells (Larsen et al, 1998 J. Biol. Chem. 273: 4574-4584). ps20 was found to inhibit growth of carcinoma cells, and ps20 has been referred to as a growth inhibitor; however, no direct functional activity such as inhibition of proteases has been described so far for this protein.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0011">As noted above, no protease inhibitory activity has been identified for HE4, which was initially identified in epididymal eptithelial cells, although other small acid and heat stable proteinase inhibitors have been characterized from seminal plasma, and are thought to play a role in fertility by binding to spermatozoa and regulating the interaction of spermatozoa with the extracellular matrices of the egg (Fitz et al., in Proteases and Biological Controls, Reich, E., Rifkin, D., Shaw, E. (eds.), 1975 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., pp. 737-766; Saling, 1989 Oxf. Rev. Reprod. Biol. 11: 339-388). HE4 cDNA was first isolated from human epididymis (Kirchhoff et al., 1991 Biol. Reprod. 45:350-357), and HE4 cDNA was later detected with high frequency in cDNA libraries constructed from ovarian carcinomas (Wang et al., 1999 Gene 229:101; Schummer et al., 1999 Gene 238:375).</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0043]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0044" num="0043">The present invention pertains in part to the discovery of HE4a, a new member of the “four-disulfide core” family of proteins as described herein, which exhibits a sequence that is highly similar to, but distinct from, HE4 (Kirchhoff et al., 1991 Biol. Reproduct. 45:350-357). As described herein, HE4a (and not HE4) is most unexpectedly shown to be overexpressed in certain malignancies, for example in ovarian carcinomas, as well as in a number of other human tissues, in marked contrast to the restricted expression pattern of HE4 in human epididymal epithelial cells (Kirchhoff et al., 1991). The present invention also pertains in part to surprising advantages that derive from compositions and methods described herein, which provide detection of cell surface and/or soluble forms of certain gene products referred to herein as HE4a polypeptides that occur naturally in subjects, including elevated levels of such polypeptides in subjects having certain carcinomas (e.g., ovarian carcinomas). The invention therefore provides useful compositions and methods for the detection and diagnosis of a malignant condition in a subject by specific detection of such cell surface and/or soluble HE4a polypeptides.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0044]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0045" num="0044">As described in detail below, certain embodiments of the invention relate to HE4a polypeptides, which include soluble and cell surface forms of HE4a and HE4 polypeptides, including HE4 and HE4a polypeptide antigens and fusion proteins. In certain other embodiments, the invention relates to fragments, derivatives and/or analogs of HE4a polypeptides. Briefly, according to certain embodiments of the present invention, there is provided a method of screening for the presence of a malignant condition in a subject by contacting a biological sample from the subject with an antibody specific for a human HE4a polypeptide. The complete amino acid and nucleic acid coding sequences of HE4a polypeptides and HE4a-Ig fusion proteins are disclosed herein, including the surprising observation that a nucleic acid molecule derived from ovarian carcinoma cDNA encodes an expressed product having a sequence distinct from HE4 as described by Kirchhoff et al. (1991), and the further unexpected observation that whereas HE4 expression as disclosed by Kirchhoff et al. is limited to epididymal epithelial cells, HE4a expression according to the present disclosure is readily detectable in ovarian carcinomas.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0045]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0046" num="0045">As described herein, monoclonal antibodies that specifically recognize HE4a polypeptides are provided, such that those having ordinary skill in the art may routinely and without undue experimentation immunize a host and screen for HE4a polypeptide-specific antibody production using the present teachings along with methodologies well known in the art. For example, construction of recombinant HE4a expression vectors and host cells, including recombinant HE4a fusion proteins, is described herein and provides HE4a-specific antibodies.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0046]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0047" num="0046">From the physicochemical and immunochemical properties of HE4a polypeptides disclosed herein, and using the presently disclosed nucleic acid sequences encoding HE4a, a person having ordinary skill in the art may also prepare a recombinant HE4a polypeptide that can be used to produce and characterize specific antibodies according to well known methodologies. HE4a polypeptides can be expressed in mammalian cells, yeast, bacteria, or other cells under the control of appropriate promoters. Cell-free translation systems can also be employed to produce such proteins using RNAs derived from the HE4a polypeptide DNA coding regions disclosed herein. Appropriate cloning and expression vectors for use with prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts are described by Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Edition, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., (1989). In preferred embodiments of the invention, HE4a polypeptides are expressed in mammalian cells.</div>

The DNA may be double-stranded or single-stranded, and if single stranded may be the coding strand or non-coding (anti-sense) strand. A coding sequence which encodes an HE4a polypeptide for use according to the invention may be identical to the coding sequences provided in SEQ ID NOS:3, 4, 6, 10 or 12 or may be a different coding sequence, which, as a result of the redundancy or degeneracy of the genetic code, encodes the same HE4a polypeptide as, for example, the cDNAs of SEQ ID NOS:10 and 12. The present invention therefore provides an isolated nucleic acid molecule that encodes a HE4a antigen polypeptide having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NOS:5, 7, 11 or 13, or a nucleic acid molecule capable of hybridizing to such an HE4a polypeptide-encoding nucleic acid, or a nucleic acid molecule having a sequence complementary thereto.</div>

The percent identity may be readily determined by comparing sequences using computer algorithms well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, such as Align or the BLAST algorithm (Altschul, J. Mol. Biol. 219:555-565, 1991; Henikoff and Henikoff, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10915-10919, 1992), which is available at the NCBI website. Default parameters may be used.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0049]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0050" num="0049">Certain variants are substantially homologous to a native gene. Such polynucleotide variants are capable of hybridizing under moderately stringent conditions to a naturally occurring DNA or RNA sequence encoding a native HE4a antigen (or a complementary sequence). Suitable moderately stringent conditions include, for example, the following steps or their equivalent: prewashing in a solution of 5×SSC, 0.5% SDS, 1.0 mM EDTA (pH 8.0); hybridizing at 50° C.-65° C., 5×SSC, overnight; followed by washing twice at 65° C. for 20 minutes with each of 2×, 0.5× and 0.2×SSC containing 0.1% SDS. For additional stringency, conditions may include, for example, a wash in 0.1×SSC and 0.1% SDS at 60° C. for 15 minutes, or the equivalent. A person having ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate the parameters that may be varied as a routine matter to create appropriately stringent hybridization conditions that are in some way selective for a particular nucleic acid of interest, and will further appreciate that such conditions may be a function, inter alia, of the particular nucleic acid sequences involved in the hybridization, such as, for example, those disclosed herein as SEQ ID NOS:10 and 12, which encode HE4a polypeptides. See also, e.g., Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing, 1995, regarding selection of nucleic acid hybridization conditions.</div>

The variants of the nucleic acids encoding HE4a may be naturally occurring allelic variants of the nucleic acids or non-naturally occurring variants. As is known in the art, an allelic variant is an alternate form of a nucleic acid sequence which may have at least one of a substitution, a deletion or an addition of one or more nucleotides, any of which does not substantially alter the function of the encoded HE4a polypeptide. Thus, for example, the present invention includes nucleic acids encoding the same HE4a polypeptides as shown in SEQ ID NOS:5, 7 or 11, as well as variants of such nucleic acids, which variants may encode a fragment, derivative or analog of any of these polypeptides.</div>

Mutations can be introduced at particular loci by synthesizing oligonucleotides containing a mutant sequence, flanked by restriction sites enabling ligation to fragments of the native sequence. Following ligation, the resulting reconstructed sequence encodes an analog having the desired amino acid insertion, substitution, or deletion.</div>

Ribozymes can be targeted to any RNA transcript and can catalytically cleave such transcripts (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,272,262; U.S. Pat. No. 5,144,019; and U.S. Pat.

Other equivalents can be prepared by modification of adjacent dibasic amino acid residues to enhance expression in yeast systems in which KEX2 protease activity is present. EP 212,914 discloses the use of site-specific mutagenesis to inactivate KEX2 protease processing sites in a protein. KEX2 protease processing sites are inactivated by deleting, adding or substituting residues to alter Arg-Arg, Arg-Lys, and Lys-Arg pairs to eliminate the occurrence of these adjacent basic residues. Lys-Lys pairings are considerably less susceptible to KEX2 cleavage, and conversion of Arg-Lys or Lys-Arg to Lys-Lys represents a conservative and preferred approach to inactivating KEX2 sites.</div>

For example, because HE4a polypeptides may contain covalently attached oligosaccharide moieties (see, e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> as described in the Examples), an affinity technique such as binding of a HE4a polypeptide to a suitable immobilized lectin under conditions that permit carbohydrate binding by the lectin may be a particularly useful affinity technique. Other useful affinity techniques include immunological techniques for isolating a HE4a polypeptide, which techniques rely on specific binding interaction between antibody combining sites for antigen and antigenic determinants present in the complexes. Immunological techniques include, but need not be limited to, immunoaffinity chromatography, immunoprecipitation, solid phase immunoadsorption or other immunoaffinity methods.

Briefly, these methods involve the preparation of immortal cell lines capable of producing antibodies having the desired specificity (i.e., reactivity with the mesothelin polypeptide of interest). Such cell lines may be produced, for example, from spleen cells obtained from an animal immunized as described above. The spleen cells are then immortalized by, for example, fusion with a myeloma cell fusion partner, preferably one that is syngeneic with the immunized animal. For example, the spleen cells and myeloma cells may be combined with a membrane fusion promoting agent such as polyethylene glycol or a nonionic detergent for a few minutes, and then plated at low density on a selective medium that supports the growth of hybrid cells, but not myeloma cells. A preferred selection technique uses HAT (hypoxanthine, aminopterin, thymidine) selection. After a sufficient time, usually about 1 to 2 weeks, colonies of hybrids are observed. Single colonies are selected and tested for binding activity against the polypeptide. Hybridomas having high reactivity and specificity are preferred.

No. 5,223,409; Schlebusch et al., 1997 Hybridoma 16:47; and references cited therein). Briefly, in this method, DNA sequences are inserted into the gene III or gene VIII gene of a filamentous phage, such as M13. Several vectors with multicloning sites have been developed for insertion (McLafferty et al., Gene 128:29-36, 1993; Scott and Smith, Science 249:386-390, 1990; Smith and Scott, Methods Enzymol. 217:228-257, 1993). The inserted DNA sequences may be randomly generated or may be variants of a known binding domain for binding to a HE4a polypeptide. Single chain antibodies may readily be generated using this method. Generally, the inserts encode from 6 to 20 amino acids. The peptide encoded by the inserted sequence is displayed on the surface of the bacteriophage. Bacteriophage expressing a binding domain for a HE4a polypeptide are selected by binding to an immobilized HE4a polypeptide, for example a recombinant polypeptide prepared using methods well known in the art and nucleic acid coding sequences as disclosed herein. Unbound phage are removed by a wash, typically containing 10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, and without salt or with a low salt concentration. Bound phage are eluted with a salt containing buffer, for example. The NaCl concentration is increased in a step-wise fashion until all the phage are eluted. Typically, phage binding with higher affinity will be released by higher salt concentrations. Eluted phage are propagated in the bacteria host. Further rounds of selection may be performed to select for a few phage binding with high affinity. The DNA sequence of the insert in the binding phage is then determined. Once the predicted amino acid sequence of the binding peptide is known, sufficient peptide for use herein as an antibody specific for a HE4a polypeptide may be made either by recombinant means or synthetically. Recombinant means are used when the antibody is produced as a fusion protein. The peptide may also be generated as a tandem array of two or more similar or dissimilar peptides, in order to maximize affinity or binding.</div>

Unbound constituents of the sample are then removed from the immobilized immune complexes. Next, a second antibody specific for a HE4a antigen polypeptide is added, wherein the antigen combining site of the second antibody does not competitively inhibit binding of the antigen combining site of the immobilized first antibody to a HE4a polypeptide (e.g., a monoclonal antibody such as 2H5, 3D8 or 4H4 that is not the same as the monoclonal antibody immobilized on the solid support).

The cDNA for HE4a, identified and isolated as a differentially expressed gene product using high throughput cDNA arrays, was cloned in pSPORT as an 840 base pair fragment.

In addition, because HE4a was relatively small and the sequence did not contain any unusual structural features such as transmembrane domains or cytoplasmic targeting sequences, a fusion protein was designed that incorporated the complete HE4a gene product fused to the human IgG1 Fc domain. Primers were designed that encoded appropriate restriction sites for cloning and created the necessary in-frame fusions of protein domains for the final construct. The 5′ primer (SEQ ID NO:1, or HE4-5′) was a 39-mer that included a HindIII site, a Kozak sequence to improve expression adjacent to the first ATG, and a portion of the HE4a leader peptide based on the previously published HE4 sequence. The 3′ primer (SEQ ID NO:2, or HE4-3′-1) was a 36-mer that included an in-frame BamHI site for fusion to the human-Ig tail cDNA, with the 3′ end of the HE4 coding sequence truncated just before the STOP codon. PCR amplification reactions were performed using these two primers at 50 pmol and 1 ng HE4/pSPORT plasmid as template. Fifty microliter reactions also included 2.5 units (0.5 ml) ExTaq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa Shuzo Biomedical, Otsu, Shiga, Japan), diluted buffers and nucleotides according to package insert directions.

In a study using the above described sandwich ELISA assay and coded serum samples from approximately 400 patients (provided by Swedish Hospital, Seattle, Wash.), all samples from patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer were correctly scored as positive by the HE4a ELISA, which further predicted no false positives. It is therefore contemplated, without wishing to be bound by theory, that assaying for HE4a protein in sera and other body fluids may thereby provide a clinically beneficial complement to existing diagnostic assays for ovarian carcinoma (such as CA125). Furthermore, although the ELISA has so far been investigated with respect to its ability to aid the diagnosis of ovarian carcinoma, it should be equally applicable to any tumor that overexpresses the HE4a encoded antigen. The same ELISA, or a modification of it, should also be applicable for studies of HE4-related molecules, if future studies will identify such.</div>

Studies performed with flow cytometry, using ovarian carcinoma cell lines with a B cell line as a negative control, showed that the HE4a encoded antigen was expressed at the cell surface among some ovarian carcinomas. The cell lines used and the flow cytometry technique employed have been previously described (Hellstrom et al., 2001 Cancer Res. 61, 2420). For example, 93% of OVCAR 3 cells were positive, as were 71% of cells from ovarian cancer line 4010 and 38% of cells from ovarian cancer line HE500V, while less than 20% of cells were positive from another 10 ovarian carcinoma lines tested. This suggested that HE4a antigen at the cell surface may, according to non-limiting theory, provide a target for immunotherapeutic strategies such as HE4a-specific antibody-mediated and/or HE4a-specific T-cell mediated therapies.</div>

The increased occurrence of HE4a-specific monoclonal antibody-defined epitopes in tumors provides for the identification of HE4a epitopes that are used as targets for prophylactic or preventive vaccines with applicability in cancer therapy; such vaccines may also usefully alter (e.g., increase or decrease in a statistically significant manner relative to a suitable control) fertilization (which may in certain embodiments be reflected by demonstration of HE4a protease-inhibitory or protease-enhancing activity using well known assays for protease inhibition by members of the four-disulfide core family, such as Slp-1). A large variety of approaches to make vaccines has been identified and described in many review articles (e.g., by Hellstrom and Hellstrom, In Handbook in Experimental Pharmacology, vol. “Vaccines”, Springer, Heidelberg, p. 463, 1999). These include, but are not restricted to, the use of proteins, fusion proteins and peptides, DNA plasmids, recombinant viruses, anti-idiotypic antibodies, dendritic cells pulsed with peptide epitopes in vitro, and anti-idiotypic antibodies. The vaccines may be used alone or in combinations with adjuvants, and/or lymphokines, such as GMCSF. According to non-limiting theory, detection of circulating soluble HE4a proteins as described above would not be expected to interfere with the use of vaccines inducing T cell-mediated immunity, since the T cells recognize epitopes presented in the context of MHC molecules on cell surfaces but do not react to circulating antigen or immune complexes.</div>
