<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">Epidemiological and experimental studies support an important role for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) in the biology of human cancer. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI-3 kinase or PI3K) comprise a family of lipid and serine/threonine kinases that catalyze the transfer of phosphate to the D-3′ position of inositol lipids to produce phosphoinositol-3-phosphate (PIP), phosphoinositol-3,4-diphosphate (PIP2) and phosphoinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) that, in turn, act as second messengers in signaling cascades by docking proteins containing pleckstrin-homology, FYVE, Phox and other phospholipid-binding domains into a variety of signaling complexes often at the plasma membrane ((Vanhaesebroeck et al., Annu. Rev. Biochem 70:535 (2001); Katso et al., Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 17:615 (2001)). Of the two Class 1 PI3Ks, Class 1A PI3Ks are heterodimers composed of a catalytic p110 subunit (α, β, δ isoforms) constitutively associated with a regulatory subunit that can be p85α, p55α, p50α, p85β or p55γ. The Class 1B sub-class has one family member, a heterodimer composed of a catalytic p110γ subunit associated with one of two regulatory subunits, p101 or p84 (Fruman et al., Annu Rev. Biochem. 67:481 (1998); Suire et al., Curr. Biol. 15:566 (2005)). The modular domains of the p85/55/50 subunits include Src Homology (SH2) domains that bind phosphotyrosine residues in a specific sequence context on activated receptor and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, resulting in activation and localization of Class 1A PI3Ks. Class 1B PI3K is activated directly by G protein-coupled receptors that bind a diverse repertoire of peptide and non-peptide ligands (Stephens et al., Cell 89:105 (1997)); Katso et al., Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 17:615-675 (2001)). Consequently, the resultant phospholipid products of class I PI3K link upstream receptors with downstream cellular activities including proliferation, survival, chemotaxis, cellular trafficking, motility, metabolism, inflammatory and allergic responses, transcription and translation (Cantley et al., Cell 64:281 (1991); Escobedo and Williams, Nature 335:85 (1988); Fantl et al., Cell 69:413 (1992)).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Aberrant regulation of PI3K is one of the most prevalent events in human cancer. In some tumors, the genes for the p110α isoform, PIK3CA, and for Akt are amplified and increased protein expression of their gene products has been demonstrated in several human cancers. Further, somatic missense mutations in PIK3CA that activate downstream signaling pathways have been described at significant frequencies in a wide diversity of human cancers (Kang et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 102:802 (2005); Samuels et al., Science 304:554 (2004); Samuels et al., Cancer Cell 7:561-573(2005)).</div>

Gain of function mutations in PIK3CA have been observed in about 10% to 40% of breast cancer patients. Inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN also leads to PI3K pathway activation and has been reported in 15% to 48% of breast cancer patients. In spite of numerous treatment options for patients suffering from tumor diseases, there remains a need for effective and safe therapeutic agents and a need for their preferential use in combination therapy.</div>

A synergistic effect can be calculated, for example, using suitable methods such as the Sigmoid-Emax equation (Holford, N. H. G. and Scheiner, L. B., Clin. Pharmacokinet. 6: 429-453 (1981)), the equation of Loewe additivity (Loewe, S. and Muischnek, H., Arch. Exp. Pathol Pharmacol. 114: 313-326 (1926)) and the median-effect equation (Chou, T. C. and Talalay, P., Adv. Enzyme Regul. 22: 27-55 (1984)).

Strikingly, in PIK3CA mutant xenograft models, eribulin did not exhibit antitumor activity, while co-administration of a PI3K inhibitor (COMPOUND A hydrochloride salt or COMPOUND B) induced marked tumor regression. Moreover, addition of the PI3K inhibitor at progression to eribulin single-agent equally resulted in tumor regression. Of note, PIK3CA wild-type models likewise exhibited an increased antitumor activity with the combined therapy compared to single-agent treatments. The precise mechanism by which the combination of eribulin and a PI3K-targeting agent results in tumor regression is currently under investigation.</div>
