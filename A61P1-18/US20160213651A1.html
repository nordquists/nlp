<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">The recognition of microbial components during host infection is a key step in activating the innate immune response followed by the induction of inflammatory gene expression. Pattern-recognition receptors exemplified by tail-like receptors (TLRs) are key regulators in host response to bacterial, viral and fungal components. Central to this response is the ability to up-regulate genes involved in host protection, innate and adaptive immune cell recruitment and pathogen clearance. Although the TLR-mediated inflammatory response is critical for providing immune defense against pathogens, dysfunctional responses may lead to both acute and chronic inflammatory states manifested as sepsis, inflammation and autoimmunity. Therefore, the intensity and duration of TLR responses must be tightly controlled (Lord et al. 2009).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">In addition to TLR, recent research has focused on the discovery and characterization of a new immune gene family, known as CATERPILLER or NOD-like receptor. Mutations in several NLR genes have been associated with human disease states, including autoimmunity and inflammation. Members of the NLR gene family are involved in regulating cellular activation after exposure to specific or multiple pathogen-derived products. NLR genes are involved in regulating a variety of host defense processes. The relevance of NLR genes is most apparently revealed by the genetic analysis of patients suffering from immune and inflammatory disorders (Lord et al. 2009).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Monarch-1, also called “NOD-like receptor, pyrin domain containing 12” (NLRP12), is the best known component of NLRs. NLRP12 functions as a negative regulator of TLR- and TNFR-induced NF-κB signaling in human cells. NLRP12 blocks IRAK (IL-1R-associated kinase)-1 hyperphosphorylation/activation and facilitates the degradation of NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), leading to reduced NF-κB activation (Lich et al. 2007).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">The result of the TLR-activated NF-κB signaling is the production of several inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α. The overproduction of those cytokines leads to signs and symptoms of inflammatory diseases like allergies, autoimmune diseases and other acute/chronic inflammatory diseases. The most important diseases which are associated to an aberrant hyperactivation of the non canonical NF-kB pathway are summarized as follows (from Imani Fooladi et al. 2013; Delunardo et al. 2013; Meneghini et al. 2013; Lv et al. 2013; Monaco et al. 2004; Zhang et al. 2013; Medeiros, LaFerla. 2013; Qu et al. 2012; Wenhong et al. 2012; Qi et al. 2012; Mori T et al. 2012)):

It is a synthetic peptide-like molecule provided with an in vitro and in vivo immunomodulating action (Giagulli et al., 2009). Immune system intervenes in maintaining a homeostatic balance between our body and all foreign substances; therefore, an abnormality in this function may cause a defective or aberrant response towards non-self structures, as well as loss of tolerance toward self-antigens: in any cases, the immune system error exhibits clinically as signs of disease.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0010">Pidotimod exerts a protective action towards infectious processes (although it is free from a direct antimicrobial and antiviral action), as it has been confirmed in experimental bacterial and viral infection models and confirmed by a number of controlled clinical trials. Particularly, ex vivo studies highlighted the Pidotimod ability to increment phagocytes stimulation and relative phagocyte action, as well as the cytotoxic action of NK cells. Moreover, Pidotimod was found to increment the release of antiviral molecules (IFN-α) induced by specific stimuli (Taramelli et al. 1994).</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0012]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0012">It has been now surprisingly found that, besides being active in sustaining protective antimicrobial immune responses Pidotimod increases transcription and synthesis of the NLRP12 (Monarch 1), involved in the control of inflammation consequent to TLR activation. This Pidotimod-induced event leads to the control of production of inflammatory mediators released by immune cells upon TLR stimulation. Therefore, through this newly discovered mechanism, Pidotimod is also able to mitigate the inflammatory pathway underlying inflammation-associated diseases characterized by an aberrant hyperactivation of the non canonical NFkB pathway, where NLRP12 plays a crucial role.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0014]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0014">On the contrary, by activating Monarch-1, Pidotimod is the only drug that acts at the very early stages of the inflammatory mechanism, switching off the cascade of NF-κB activation. Compared to monoclonal antibodies, its effect is much more general and not directed onto a single inflammatory cytokine.

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0030]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0028" num="0030">1. Culture of human monocytes. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained by peripheral blood (freshly drawn or buffy coats). Monocytes were then derived from PBMCs by positive selection using anti-CD14 paramagnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec) as described (Marini et al., 2008). Upon purification, cells were shortly cultured (from 24 to 72 hours) in complete culture medium (RPMI 1640 complemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum certified low endotoxin). Some experiments were performed on a human monocytic cell line (MonoMac 6), grown according to the American type culture collection suggestion.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0031]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0029" num="0031">2. Cell treatment with Pidotimod. PBMCs, purified primary human monocytes or MonoMac 6were treated with Pidotimod, at concentrations ranging from 1 to 25 μg/mL and, for different times. In some experiments, after 6 to 48 hours from the beginning of Pidotimod treatment, cells were washed and cultured for 6-24 hours in the presence and absence of TLR 1-9 optimal ligands (Human TLR1-9 Agonist kit, Invivogen).</div>

Upon stimulation, cells were harvested and total RNA was extracted using the RNAeasy mini kit (Qiagen). RNA was then retro-transcribed and subjected to amplification. Real-time PCR was performed using the “Human “RT2 Profiler PCR microarray kit” according to the manufacturer's protocol (SABbiosciences, Qiagen). This kit allows a wide analysis of the expression of genes related to immune activation, giving a particular relevance to the expression of mediators of inflammation.</div>

Cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Protein lysates were solved by SDS-PAGE (8%) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes previously blocked for 1 hour in TBS-Tween 20 (0.1%) containing 5% BSA. To detect the presence of cytoplasmic NLRP12, a first incubation with the goat polyclonal antibody to NLRP12 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was followed by the addiction of donkey-anti-goat-HRP secondary antibody. For immunoprecipitation studies, rabbit polyclonal antibodies to NLRP12 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used to precipitate the proteins in the presence of 20 μl protein A/G coated beads (protein A/G plus, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 12 hours at 4° C. Protein complexes were washed four to six times, then incubated at 95° C. for 5 minutes and resolved by immunoblot as described above.</div>

To this scope total RNA was extracted using the semiautomated extraction system NucliSens Easymag (Biomerieux). RNA was then retro-transcribed in cDNA using the “High capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit” (Applied Biosystem). To perform gene expression studies, cDNA derived from treated or untreated cells was then subjected to PCR using specific Taqman primers-probe sets (Applied Biosystem).

The increase of cytokine synthesis is the signal of cellular response to TLR stimulation. Pidotimod disciplines the extent of inflammation by upregulating the expression of NLRP12 which reduces the amplification of inflammatory signals triggered by TLR activation. PBMCs and/or purified monocytes are stimulated or not with an optimal concentration of each TLR ligand upon being pretreated or not with 1-25 μg/mL Pidotimod, and the supernatant of the cell cultures collected after 24 hours from the stimulation onset. The presence of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, MCP-1 and IL-1β was quantified in the cultural medium through ELISA assays (Endogen).</div>

After 16 hours of treatment, Pidotimod (25 μg/ml) was able to induce a significant increase of the NOD-like receptor NLRP12 expression. The two-fold NLRP12 mRNA increase observed in the gene array in Pidotimod-stimulated cells as compared to the unstimulated ones, was confirmed by specific quantitative Real-Time PCR assays. Analysis of cells treated with different concentrations of Pidotimod (25, 5, and 1 μg/ml) at different time points of stimulation (6, 16, 24, and 48 hours of treatment) confirmed this result, showing a peak of increase in NLRP12 expression after 24 hours of stimulation when 25 and 5 μg/ml of the molecule was used (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</div>

Therefore, the effect of Pidotimod was evaluated in primary human monocytes treated with stimuli which, since they act through the TLRs, bring the monocytes to an inflammatory activated phenotype. Pidotimod treatment counteracted the extent of inflammatory mediators induced by TLR agonists. In all the samples evaluated (8 samples derived from 8 different donors), levels of specific MCP-1 consistently diminished, as representatively shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.
