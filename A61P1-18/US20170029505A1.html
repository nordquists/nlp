<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">Immune disorders encompass a wide variety of diseases with different signs, symptoms, etiologies and pathogenic mechanisms. Many of these diseases are characterised by the active involvement of pathogenic antibodies and/or pathogenic immune complexes. In some diseases such as ITP (variably called immune thrombocytopenia, immune thrombocytic purpura, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura) the target antigens for the pathogenic antibodies (Hoemberg, Scand H J Immunol, Vol 74(5), p489-495, 2011) and disease process are reasonably well understood. Such immune disorders are often treated with a variety of conventional agents, either as monotherapy or in combination. Examples of such agents are corticosteroids, which are associated with numerous side effects, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and anti-D.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Antibodies, often referred to as immunoglobulins, are Y-shaped molecules comprising two identical heavy (H) chains and two identical light (L) chains, held together by interchain disulphide bonds. Each chain consists of one variable domain (V) that varies in sequence and is responsible for antigen binding. Each chain also consists of at least one constant domain (C). In the light chain there is a single constant domain (CL). In the heavy chain there are at least three, sometimes four constant domains, depending on the isotype (CH1, CH2, CH3, CH4). IgG, IgA and IgD have three heavy chain constant domains; IgM and IgE have four.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">In humans there are five different classes or isotypes of immunoglobulins termed IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM. All these classes have the basic four-chain Y-shaped structure, but they differ in their heavy chains, termed α, δ, ε, γ and μ respectively. IgA can be further subdivided into two subclasses, termed IgA1 and IgA2. There are four sub-classes of IgG, termed IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">The Fc-domain of an antibody typically comprises at least the last two constant domains of each heavy chain which dimerise to form the Fc domain. The Fc domain is responsible for providing antibody effector functions, including determining antibody half-life, principally through binding to FcRn, distribution throughout the body, ability to fix complement, and binding to cell surface Fc receptors.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">The differences between antibody isotypes are most pronounced in the Fc-domains, and this leads to the triggering of different effector functions on binding to antigen. Structural differences also lead to differences in the polymerisation state of the antibodies. Thus IgG, IgE and IgD are generally monomeric whereas IgM occurs as both a pentamer and a hexamer, IgA occurs predominantly as a monomer in serum and as a dimer in sero-mucous secretions.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is the pooled immunoglobulin from thousands of healthy blood donors. IVIG was initially used as an IgG replacement therapy to prevent opportunistic infections in patients with low IgG levels (reviewed in Baerenwaldt , Expert Rev Olin lmmunol, Vol 6(3), p425-434, 2010). After discovery of the anti-inflammatory properties of IVIG in children with ITP (Imbach, Helv Paediatri Acta, Vol 36(1), p81-86, 1981), IVIG is now licensed for the treatment of ITP, Guillain-Barré syndrome, Kawasaki disease, and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (Nimmerjahn, Annu Rev Immunol, Vol 26, p513-533, 2008).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">In diseases involving pathogenic immune complexes it has been proposed that a minority fraction of the component immunoglobulin fraction is disproportionately effective. It is observed that traces (typically 1-5%) of IgG are present in multimeric forms within IVIG. The majority of this multimeric fraction is thought to be dimer with smaller amounts of trimer and higher forms. It has also been proposed that additional dimers may form after infusion by binding of recipient anti-idiotype antibodies. One theory is that these multimeric forms compete against immune complexes for binding to low affinity FCγ receptors due to their enhanced avidity (Augener, Blut, Vol 50, p249-252, 1985; Teeling, Blood Vol 98(4), p1095-1099, 2001; Machino, Y., Olin Exp lmmunol, Vol 162(3), p415-424, 2010; Machino, Y. et al., BBRC, Vol 418, p748-753, 2012). Another theory is that sialic acid glycoforms of IgG within IVIG, especially the presence of higher levels of α2-6 sialic acid forms, cause an alteration in FCγ receptor activation status (Samuelsson, Science, Vol 291, p484-486, 2001; Kaneko, Science, Vol 313, p670-673, 2006; Schwab, European J Immunol Vol 42, p826-830, 2012; Sondermann, PNAS, Vol 110(24), p9868-9872, 2013).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">In diseases involving pathogenic antibodies it has been proposed that the very large dose of IVIG administered to humans (1-2 g/kg) effectively overrides the normal IgG homeostasis mechanism performed by FcRn. Effectively a large dilution of recipient IgG by donor IVIG results in enhanced catabolism and a shorter serum half-life of patient pathogenic antibodies. Other proposed mechanisms for the efficacy include anti-idiotypic neutralisation of pathogenic antibodies and transient reductions in complement factors (Mollnes, Mol Immunol, Vol 34, p719-729, 1997; Crow, Transfusion Medicine Reviews, Vol 22(2), p103-116, 2008; Schwab, I. and Nimmerjahn, F. Nature Reviews Immunology, Vol 13, p176-189, 2013).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0010">There are significant disadvantages to the clinical use of IVIG. IVIG has variable product quality between manufacturers due to inherent differences in manufacturing methods and donor pools (Siegel, Pharmacotherapy Vol 25(11) p78S-84S, 2005). IVIG is given in very large doses, typically in the order of 1-2 g/kg. This large dose necessitates a long duration of infusion, (4-8 hours, sometimes spread over multiple days), which can be unpleasant for the patient and can result in infusion related adverse events. Serious adverse events can occur, reactions in IgA deficient individuals being well understood. Cytokine release can also be observed in patients receiving IVIG but this is largely minimised by careful control of dose and infusion rate. As a consequence of the large amounts used per patient and the reliance on human donors, manufacture of IVIG is expensive and global supplies are severely limited.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0011">Collectively the disadvantages of IVIG mean that there is need for improvement in terms of clinical supply, administration and efficacy of molecules able to interfere with the disease biology of pathogenic antibodies and pathogenic immune complexes.</div>

(Sorensen V. et al, J lmmunol, Vol 156, p2858-2865, 1996). The IgG3 molecules were additionally modified by substituting the leucine residue at position 309 with a cysteine residue (L309C). In some experiments, the tailpiece was omitted and the IgG3 molecules were modified with L309C only. The IgG3 molecules studied were intact immunoglobulin molecules. In contrast, the multimeric proteins of the present invention do not comprise the first heavy chain constant domain, CH1.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0026]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0027" num="0026">The inventors have found that antibody Fc domains can be multimerised into multivalent forms by engineering the presence of a cysteine residue at position 309. They have observed that the higher order valency forms result in higher avidity binding for Fc-receptors (FcR) and also elevated levels of cytokine release in human whole blood. Higher valency is desirable in certain immune indications such as ITP, GBS and CIDP, to achieve effective blockade of FcγR from pathogenic antibodies and immune complexes. Elevated cytokine release may be useful or detrimental depending upon the intended clinical use and molecular target. In targeted cell killing applications such as cancer and other proliferative disorders, elevated cytokine levels may be advantageous. Fusion of an antigen targeting moiety such as scFv, single domain antibody (for example vL, vH, vHH, shark VNAR, camelid v-region), engineered SH3 domain, or DARPin, at the N- or C-terminus of the multimeric proteins of the invention can target the multimeric Fc protein to the target cell and elicit killing through well described effector functions such as CDC, ADCC and ADCP.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0027]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0028" num="0027">These functions can be enhanced by the increased avidity of FcγR binding. In addition, high local levels of cytokines such as IFNγ and TNFα which have cytotoxic effects can augment cell killing. Local cytokines may also elicit immune cell infiltration and hence augment anti-target responses. In vaccine applications, fusion of an antigen moiety such as allergen peptide, tumour antigen or similar at the N- or C-terminus of the multimeric proteins of the invention can target the multimeric Fc protein to target cells involved in antigen presentation. Dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes and neutrophils are all capable of antigen uptake, digestion and presentation through MHC-I or MHC-II to T-cells. Hence, enhanced targeting of antigen to antigen presenting cells through increased avidity of binding to FcγR is desirable. Additionally, increased local cytokine production might further increase the immune response due to activation of or infiltration of activated immune cells. Further improvements to targeting in cell killing and vaccine approaches may be made by Fc-mutations which influence FcγR or FcRn binding.</div>

Other modified hinge regions may comprise a complete hinge region derived from an antibody of a different class or subclass from that of the heavy chain Fc-region. Alternatively, the modified hinge region may comprise part of a natural hinge or a repeating unit in which each unit in the repeat is derived from a natural hinge region. In a further alternative, the natural hinge region may be altered by converting one or more cysteine or other residues into neutral residues, such as serine or alanine, or by converting suitably placed residues into cysteine residues. By such means the number of cysteine residues in the hinge region may be increased or decreased. Other modified hinge regions may be entirely synthetic and may be designed to possess desired properties such as length, cysteine composition and flexibility.</div>

The core hinge region of human IgG4 contains the sequence CPSC (SEQ ID NO: 10) compared to IgG1 which contains the sequence CPPC. The serine residue present in the IgG4 sequence leads to increased flexibility in this region, and therefore a proportion of molecules form disulphide bonds within the same protein chain (an intrachain disulphide) rather than bridging to the other heavy chain in the IgG molecule to form the interchain disulphide. (Angel S. et al, Mol lmmunol, Vol 30(1), p105-108, 1993). Changing the serine residue to a proline to give the same core sequence as IgG1 allows complete formation of inter-chain disulphides in the IgG4 hinge region, thus reducing heterogeneity in the purified product. This altered isotype is termed IgG4P.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0080]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0076" num="0080">Human cells can express a number of membrane bound FcR's selected from FcαR, FcεR, FcγR, FcRn and glycan receptors. Some cells are also capable of expressing soluble (ectodomain) FcR (Fridman et al., (1993) J Leukocyte Biology 54: 504-512 for review). FcγR can be further divided by affinity of IgG binding (high/low) and biological effect (activating/inhibiting). Human FcγRI is widely considered to be the sole ‘high affinity’ receptor whilst all of the others are considered as medium to low. FcγRIIb is the sole receptor with ‘inhibitory’ functionality by virtue of its intracellular ITIM motif whilst all of the others are considered as ‘activating’ by virtue of ITAM motifs or pairing with the common FcγR—γchain. FcγRIIIb is also unique in that although activatory it associates with the cell via a GPI anchor. In total, humans express six ‘standard’ FcγR: FcγRI, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb, FcγRIIc, FcγRIIIa FcγRIIIb. In addition to these sequences there are a large number of sequence or allotypic variants spread across these families. Some of these have been found to have important functional consequence and so are sometimes considered to be receptor sub-types of their own. Examples include FcγRIIa<sup>H134R</sup>, FcγRIIb<sup>I190T</sup>, FcγRIIIa<sup>F158V </sup>and FcγRIIIb<sup>NA1</sup>, FcγRIIIb<sup>NA2 </sup>FcγRIII<sup>SH</sup>. Each receptor sequence has been shown to have different affinities for the 4 sub-classes of IgG: IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 (Bruhns Blood (1993) Vol 113, p3716-3725). Other species have somewhat different numbers and functionality of FcγR, with the mouse system being the best studied to date and comprising of 4 FcγR, FcγRI FcγRIIb FcγRIII FcγRIV (Bruhns, Blood (2012) Vol 119, p5640-5649). Human FcγRI on cells is normally considered to be ‘occupied’ by monomeric IgG in normal serum conditions due to its affinity for IgG1/IgG3/IgG4 (˜10<sup>−8 </sup>M) and the concentration of these IgG in serum (˜10 mg/ml). Hence cells bearing FcγRI on their surface are considered to be capable for ‘screening’ or ‘sampling’ of their antigenic environment vicariously through the bound polyspecific IgG. The other receptors having lower affinities for IgG sub-classes (in the range of (˜10<sup>−5</sup>−10<sup>−7 </sup>M) are normally considered to be ‘unoccupied’. The low affinity receptors are hence inherently sensitive to the detection of and activation by antibody involved immune complexes. The increased Fc density in an antibody immune complex results in increased functional affinity of binding ‘avidity’ to low affinity FcγR. This has been demonstrated in vitro using a number of methods (Shields R. L. et al, J Biol Chem, Vol 276(9), p6591-6604, 2001; Lux et al., J Immunol (2013) Vol 190, p4315-4323). It has also been implicated as being one of the primary modes of action in the use of anti-RhD to treat ITP in humans (Crow Transfusion Medicine Reviews (2008) Vol 22, p103-116).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0081]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0077" num="0081">Many cell types express multiple types of FcγR and so binding of IgG or antibody immune complex to cells bearing FcγR can have multiple and complex outcomes depending upon the biological context. Most simply, cells can either receive an activatory, inhibitory or mixed signal. This can result in events such as phagocytosis (e.g. macrophages and neutrophils), antigen processing (e.g. dendritic cells), reduced IgG production (e.g. B-cells) or degranulation (e.g. neutrophils, mast cells). There are data to support that the inhibitory signal from FcγRIIb can dominate that of activatory signals (Proulx Clinical Immunology (2010) 135:422-429.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0286]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0266" num="0286">An assay was designed to measure antibody-dependent phagocytosis of B cells by human macrophages. To prepare macrophages, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were first isolated from fresh blood by density-gradient centrifugation. Monocytes were then selected by incubating the PBMCs for 1 hour at 37° C. in 6-well tissue culture coated plates, followed by removal of non-adherent cells. Adherent monocytes were differentiated into macrophages by 5 day culture in macrophage-colony stimulating factor (MCSF). Human B cells were then prepared from a separate (allogeneic) donor by isolation of PBMC followed by purification of B cells by negative selection using MACS (B cell isolation kit II, Miltenyi Biotech). In some assays, B cells were labelled with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) (Molecular Probes). Differentiated macrophages and B cells were co-cultured at a 1:5 ratio in the presence of anti-CD20 mAb (rituximab) to induce antibody-dependent phagocytosis of the B cells. Multimeric proteins or controls were added at the indicated concentrations and the cells incubated at 37° C. 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>for 1-24 hrs. At the end of each time-point, cells were centrifuged and resuspended in FACS buffer at 4° C. to stop further phagocytosis and the B cells surface-stained with anti-CD19 allophycocyanin (APC) before analysis by flow cytometry. Macrophages were distinguished by their auto-fluorescence/side-scatter properties and B cells by their CFSE/CD19 labelling. CFSE-positive macrophages negative for CD19 labelling were assumed to contain engulfed B cells.</div>
