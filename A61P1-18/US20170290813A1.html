<li> <para-num num="[0001]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to the field of medicine, in particular to the treatment of cholestatic or fibrotic diseases.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">Abnormal and exaggerated deposition of extracellular matrix is the hallmark of all fibrotic diseases, including liver, pulmonary, kidney or cardiac fibrosis. The spectrum of affected organs, the progressive nature of the fibrotic process, the large number of affected persons, and the absence of effective treatment pose an enormous challenge when treating fibrotic diseases.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">In an attempt to propose new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of fibrotic diseases, the inventors found that 2-[(5-nitro-1,3-thiazol-2-yl)carbamoyl]phenyl]ethanoate (Nitazoxanide-NTZ), a synthetic antiprotozoal agent or its deuterated derivatives or its active metabolite 2-hydroxy-N-(5-nitro-2-thiazolyl)benzamide (Tizoxanide, known as TZ) in combination with statins show synergistic antifibrotic activities. Moreover, the evaluation of NTZ combined to a statin in a liver injury model revealed its capacity to reduce circulating bile acid concentration, thus reflecting the synergistic potential of this combination to treat both cholestatic (such as PBC and PSC) and fibrotic diseases.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">NTZ, first described in 1975(Rossignol and Cavier, 1975), was shown to be highly effective against anaerobic protozoa, helminths, and a wide spectrum of microbes including both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria (Rossignol and Maisonneuve, 1984; Dubreuil, Houcke et al., 1996; Megraudd, Occhialini et al., 1998; Fox and Saravolatz, 2005; Pankuch and Appelbaum, 2006; Finegold, Molitoris et al., 2009). It was first studied in humans for the treatment of intestinal cestodes (Rossignol and Maisonneuve, 1984) and it is now licensed in the United States (Alinia®, Romark laboratories) for the treatment of diarrhea caused by the protozoan parasites <i>Crystosporidium parvum </i>and <i>Giardia intestinalis</i>. NTZ has also been widely commercialized in Latin America and in India where it is indicated for treating a broad spectrum of intestinal parasitic infections (Hemphill, Mueller et al., 2006). The proposed mechanism of action by which NTZ exerts its antiparasitic activity is through the inhibition of pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) enzyme-dependent electron transfer reactions that are essential for anaerobic metabolism (Hoffman, Sisson et al., 2007). NTZ also exhibited activity against <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, which does not possess a homolog of PFOR, thus suggesting an alternative mechanism of action. Indeed, the authors showed that NTZ can also act as an uncoupler disrupting membrane potential and intra-organism pH homeostasis.(de Carvalho, Darby et al., 2011).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">The pharmacological effects of NTZ are not restricted to its antiparasitic or antibacterial activities and in recent years, several studies revealed that NTZ can also confer antiviral activity (Di Santo and Ehrisman, 2014; Rossignol, 2014). NTZ interferes with the viral replication by diverse ways including a blockade in the maturation of hemagglutinin (influenza) or VP7 (rotavirus) proteins, or the activation of the protein PKR involved in the innate immune response (for a review, see (Rossignol, 2014)). NTZ was also shown to have broad anticancer properties by interfering with crucial metabolic and prodeath signaling pathways (Di Santo and Ehrisman, 2014).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">Statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) are commonly prescribed as medications for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">There are currently 7 unique prescribed statins that include pravastatin, simvastatin, and lovastatin (which are naturally-derived from fungal fermentation) and a second group of chemically synthesized statins composed of fluvastatin, atorvastatin, rosuvasatin and pitavastatin. Although all statins contain a dihydroxy-heptanoic acid HMG-CoA like moiety, which competes for binding to HMG-CoA reductase, each statin is unique and exhibits significant differences in chemical structure, potency (ex. lC<sub>50 </sub>for HMG-CoA reductase inhibition), tissue penetration and retention, half-life, metabolism and elimination, drug-drug interactions, and safety. The mechanisms involved in the beneficial effects of statins on the prevention of cardiovascular disease have been largely attributed to the ability of these agents to inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis. Owing to the fact that 60-70% of serum cholesterol is derived from hepatic biosynthesis and that HMG-CoA reductase is the crucial, rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, it is not surprising that inhibition of this enzyme results in a dramatic reduction in circulating LDL-Cholesterol. Moreover, reduction of LDL-cholesterol leads to upregulation of hepatic LDL receptors and increase of LDL clearance. Both clinical and experimental data suggest that the sum of benefits from statin therapy may extend well beyond their favorable effects on serum cholesterol levels. These cholesterol-independent effects, described as pleiotropic effects of statins, are related to the reduced formation of isoprenoids. Indeed, inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase results not only in deprivation of intracellular mevalonate but also several downstream isoprenoid derivatives including farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate(GGPP). Both FPP and GGPP are required for posttranslational prenylation of a number of proteins (approximately 2% of total cellular proteins, (Wang, Liu et al., 2008)). Protein isoprenylation enables proper subcellular localization and trafficking of intracellular molecules. For example, non-isoprenylated GTPases remain cytosolic whereas isoprenylated GTPases harbour a FPP or GGPP lipid attachment that permits insertion and anchorage into the cell membrane, and subsequently participate in signal transduction. Therefore, inhibiting isoprenylation results in the inactivation of the small GTPases (ex Rho, Ras, Rac and Cdc42) which are essential in many cellular events (intracellular signal transduction, cellular proliferation, inflammation, motility, (for a review see (McFarlane, Muniyappa et al., 2002; Zhou and Liao, 2009; Yeganeh, Wechec et al., 2014; Kavalipati, Shah et al., 2015)). Since it has been demonstrated that the Rho GTPase and its target protein Rock are involved in the activation/differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts (Ji, Tang et al., 2014), a key event in the fibrotic process, several studies were conducted with statins to evaluate their antifibrotic properties in different pathological models. Simvastatin was shown to reduce the expression of fibrotic markers in both human and rat HSC and to confer antifibrotic properties in various animal models of fibrosis (Rombouts, Kisanga et al., 2003; Watts, Sampson et al., 2005; Wang, Zhao et al., 2013; Marrone, Maeso-Diaz et al., 2015). As well, Pitavastatin (Miyaki, Nojiri et al., 2011) and Fluvastatin (Chong, Hsu et al., 2015) were able to reduce fibrosis in the CDAA diet-induced NAFLD/NASH model. These beneficial effects of statins are not restricted to liver fibrosis. Indeed, it was demonstrated that Atorvastatin was significantly potent against bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis (Zhu, Ma et al., 2013) while Simvastatin was shown to inhibit expression of fibrotic markers in fibroblasts derived from human fibrotic lung. (Watts, Sampson et al., 2005).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">In this invention, using a phenotypic screening assay to identify potential antifibrotic agents, it was discovered that NTZ or its deuterated derivatives or its active metabolite TZ, in combination with a statin, interferes, in an additive or synergistic manner, with the activation of myofibroblasts. This effect was totally unexpected in view of the properties previously reported for these molecules. Combination of NTZ or its deuterated derivatives or TZ with a specific statin appears as a potent therapeutic strategy for diverse types of fibrotic diseases. Moreover, the evaluation of NTZ or derivatives thereof in combination with a specific statin revealed an unexpected synergistic capacity to reduce circulating bile acid concentration, thus reflecting its potential to treat both cholestatic diseases (such as PBC and PSC) and fibrotic diseases.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0101]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0043" num="0101">In the experimental part of the present application, it is shown that a combination of (i) NTZ, or TZ, with (ii) a statin may synergistically confer antifibrotic properties in activated myofibroblasts. Moreover, it is shown that combinations of (i) NTZ or TZ, with (ii) a statin can also reduce altered levels of total biliary acids in a model of liver injury. Accordingly, the present invention relates to a novel synergistic combination of active agents, comprising (i) NTZ or a derivative of NTZ such as a deuterated derivative of NTZ (NTZ-D), TZ or TZG, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of NTZ, NTZ-D, TZ or of TZG, and (ii) a statin.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0104]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0046" num="0104">NTZ, NTZ-D, TZ or of TZG, and (ii) a statin, for the manufacture of a medicament useful for the treatment of a cholestatic and fibrotic disorder. The invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising (i) NTZ, NTZ-D, TZ or of TZG, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of NTZ, NTZ-D, TZ or TZG, and (ii) a statin, said components (i) and (ii) acting synergistically as described herein. The pharmaceutical composition according to the invention is useful for treating a cholestatic or fibrotic disorder.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0105]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0047" num="0105">Although the causative agents or initiating events of fibrotic disorders are quite diverse and their pathogenesis is variable, a common feature in affected tissues is the presence of large numbers of activated fibroblasts called myofibroblasts ((Rosenbloom, Mendoza et al., 2013)). Fibrotic stimulus such as TGFβ1 can induce differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts (Leask and Abraham, 2004; Leask, 2007). Myofibroblasts are metabolically and morphologically distinctive fibroblasts whose activation play a key role during the fibrotic response. Furthermore, these myofibroblasts display unique biological functions including expression of proteins involved in extracellular matrix formation such as different forms of collagen. The induction of a-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression is a recognized hallmark of quiescent fibroblast to activated myofibroblast differentiation and can be used as a physiological read-out to evaluate the potency of the drugs that interfere with the fibrotic process. Tumor Growth β factors, and especially the Tumor Growth Factor beta 1 (TGFβ1) are recognized physiological signals that induce the phenotypic transformation of fibroblasts into profibrotic myofibroblasts that express high levels of α-SMA and high levels of extracellular matrix proteins, which are then secreted and form the fibrotic scar tissue.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0106]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0048" num="0106">Moreover, it is known that the proliferation and the activation of fibroblasts is responsible for the production of several connective tissue components (for example, collagens, elastin, proteoglycans, and hyaluronan) that constitute the extracellular matrix (Kendall and Feghali-Bostwick, 2014).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0107]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0049" num="0107">Unexpectedly, NTZ but also its active metabolite TZ and NTZ deuterated derivatives reveal antifibrotic properties since these compounds dose-dependently reduced the level of α-SMA in TGFβ-induced hepatic stellate cells and in primary fibroblasts from other organs. Moreover, NTZ and its metabolite TZ revealed anticholestatic properties by their ability to reduce circulating total bile acids in a model of liver injury.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0202]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0147" num="0202">The abnormal persistence of differentiated myofibroblasts is a characteristic of many fibrotic diseases. Following liver injury, quiescent HSCs undergo a process of activation that is characterized by a differentiation into (α-SMA)-positive myofibroblasts. In an attempt to find new antifibrotic molecules, a library of FDA-approved drugs was phenotypically screened in a model of human HSC activated with the profibrogenic cytokine TGF-β1. The level of α-SMA, a hallmark of fibrotic lesions, was used to evaluate the potency of the drugs to interfere with the fibrotic process. The screening campaign led to the identification of nitazoxanide (NTZ), which dose-dependently reduced the level of α-SMA in TGFβ-induced HSCs. Overall, NTZ exhibited an IC<sub>50 </sub>comprised between 0.1 and 3 μM (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0203]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0148" num="0203">Since it is known that NTZ is rapidly hydrolyzed into its active metabolite tizoxanide (TZ) (Broekhuysen, Stockis et al., 2000), this metabolite was also evaluated for its antifibrotic activity in HSC. TZ showed a profile similar to the parent drug with an IC<sub>50 </sub>comprised between 0.1 and 3 μM (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). Interestingly, specific statins but not all were also identified during the screening campaign. The dose-response analyses performed in the TGFβ-induced HSC model (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) reveal that the 7 tested statins are not equivalent regarding their antifibrotic properties.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0204]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0149" num="0204">Typically, Pitavastatin (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) and Fluvastatin (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>), the most potent antifibrotic statins, exhibited an IC<sub>50 </sub>below 1 μM whereas the IC<sub>50 </sub>values of Simvastatin (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>), Atorvastatin (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>), Lovastatin (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>) were generally comprised between 1 and 3 μM. Rosuvastatin (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>) revealed a significant antifibrotic activity but only at the highest doses and Pravastatin (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref>) was found inactive alone at the tested doses. It is noteworthy that the antifibrotic properties of the various statin family members do not seem to be related to their lipid lowering capacity. For example, Rosuvastatin, which is considered the most potent statin for HMG_CoA reductase Inhibition (IC50=5.4 nM; (McKenney, 2003) revealed weak antifibrotic properties.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0205]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0150" num="0205">In order to evaluate if a combination of statin with NTZ or TZ could reduce fibrosis in a synergistic manner, combination matrix experiments were performed in TGFβ-induced HSCs. Briefly, NTZ or TZ and statin solutions were serially diluted in a checkerboard format generating a 36 combinations matrix covering a large panel of statin/NTZ or statin/TZ ratios. Synergy was first determined by calculating Excess Over Bliss scores. In order to rank the different statins based on their synergism, the sum of the EOB scores obtained for each statin was also calculated. These experiments revealed that NTZ could synergize with all statins, but not with the same potency, to reduce α-SMA production in activated HSCs.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0206]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0151" num="0206">The best synergy was obtained with NTZ in combination with Pitavastatin (total EOB score of 337), followed by Simvastatin (total EOB score of 255), Fluvastatin (total EOB score of 141), Lovastatin (total EOB score of 91), Pravastatin (total EOB score of 88), and Atorvastatin (total EOB score of 73) (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B, 5B, 6B, 7B and 8B</figref>). Positive EOB score were obtained only for a few NTZ/ROSU ratios (data not shown) indicating a synergy, but weaker, comparatively to the other NTZ/statin combinations. To validate the synergism, the experimental values corresponding to high the EOB score for each NTZ/statin combination were plotted in a bar graph (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4C, 5C, 6C, 7C, and 8C</figref>).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0207]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0152" num="0207">These graphs illustrate that the combination of NTZ with Pitavastatin, Simvastatin, Fluvastatin, Lovastatin, Atorvastatin and Pravastatin show a superior antifibrotic effect that is statistically significant compared to the highest single agent (NTZ or statin). The most impressive examples are represented with Pitavastatin, Simvastatin, or Fluvastatin in which the single agents provide a weak antifibrotic activity (˜10 to 20% inhibition) at suboptimal doses, however, when combined with NTZ, reach an inhibition of α-SMA in the order of 60 to 70%. Tizoxanide, the active metabolite of NTZ, was also evaluated in combination with the statins that revealed the best synergism with NTZ, namely Pitavastatin, Simvastatin and Fluvastatin. As observed with NTZ, the TZ metabolite also synergized with these 3 statins (an example with Fluvastatin is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0208]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0153" num="0208">In addition to their antifibrotic properties, it was found that a combination of NTZ at 30 mg/kg/day with Simvastatin at 10 mg/kg/day synergized to prevent the occurrence of altered levels of circulating bile acids in a model of CCl4-induced liver injury (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). In conclusion, the applicant has discovered unexpected anticholestatic and antifibrotic activities for a combination of a compound of Formula (I) statins. These results suggest that a combination of a compound of Formula (I) with a statin can be synergistic and can provide therapeutic benefits in multiple types of cholestatic and fibrotic diseases.</div>
