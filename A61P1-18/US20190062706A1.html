<li> <para-num num="[0001]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates, inter alia, to compositions of expanded T cell populations, methods for the expansion of T cell populations and methods for using such populations of cells. In some aspects, the invention relates to compositions and methods for the selective expansion of T cell subpopulations present in mixed T cell populations, as well as T cell subpopulations produced by methods for the invention.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">The ability of T cells to recognize the universe of antigens associated with, for example, various cancers or infectious organisms is conferred by T cell antigen receptor (TCR), which is made of both an α (alpha) chain and a β (beta) chain or a γ (gamma) and a δ (delta) chain. The proteins which make up these chains are encoded by DNA, which employs a unique mechanism for generating the tremendous diversity of the TCR. This multi-subunit immune recognition receptor associates with the CD3 complex and binds to peptides presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II proteins on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Binding of TCR to the antigenic peptide on the APC is the central event in T cell activation, which occurs at an immunological synapse at the point of contact between the T cell and the APC. To sustain T cell activation, T lymphocytes typically require a second co-stimulatory signal. Co-stimulation is typically necessary for a T helper cell to produce sufficient cytokine levels that induce clonal expansion. Utilizing exogenously administered cytokines and stimulators of cell surface proteins T cells can be expanded and activated ex vivo.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Ex vivo expanded T cells are widely used in translational research and in clinical trials for the immunotherapy of cancer and opportunistic infections, and to prevent autoimmunity and graft versus host disease (GVHD) after transplantation. Although the administration of ex vivo expanded T cells has produced some positive clinical results, the complexity of the manufacturing of large number of various T cell products remains a major limitation for a broader application. While early ex vivo culture conditions only aimed at producing high T-cell numbers and resulted in cells expressing unfavorable phenotypes with low in vivo proliferative capacity, focus has been shifted towards protocols yielding T cells with better in vivo engraftment, proliferation and functionality.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Some of these earlier protocols utilized D<smallcaps>YNABEADS</smallcaps>® CD3/CD28 CTS™ in the activation and expansion of T cells. This method can produce populations of T cells that display a less differentiated phenotype and demonstrate increased anti-tumor activity and superior persistence compared to T cells expanded with soluble anti-CD3 antibody (OKT-3) and IL-2 in various in vivo models. Similar protocols using a combination of CD3 and CD28 binding and/or signaling can be used for the isolation and activation of polyclonal T cells. However, they do not provide optimal activation of antigen experienced memory T cells, such as tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and virus-specific T cells.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">The quality and quantity of the primary T-cell activation signal, and the presence and type of costimulatory ligands, cytokines and growth factors are believed to determine the overall signal delivered to the T cells and ultimately influence on the fate of the activated T cell. The successful expansion of such antigen experienced T cells depends on adequate strength of stimulation via TCR/CD3, as well as on the provision of optimal co-stimulatory signals and cytokines. Some reports show that using relatively strong CD3 signaling capability predominately expands naïve T cells and are believed to delete antigen experienced T cells due to activation-induced cell death (AICD) (Kalamasz et al., <i>Immunother </i>27:405 (2004)). Antigen experienced memory T cells and various subsets thereof have broad ranging therapeutic implications in the treatment of cancers, autoimmune disorders, inflammatory diseases, allergic diseases, and infectious diseases. Therefore, there is a long felt need for reliable, efficient and rapid way to expand specific immune subpopulations, such as antigen experienced memory T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), and Th17 cells.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention addresses this need for subpopulation specific expansion of specific T cell subtypes from the general T cell population and provides additional benefits as well.</div>

Such one or more chemokine or cytokine include those selected from the group consisting of: (a) Interleukin-1α, (b) Interleukin-2, (c) Interleukin-4, (d) Interleukin-1β, (e) Interleukin-6, (f) Interleukin-12, (g) Interleukin-15, (h) Interleukin-18, (i) Interleukin-21, and (j) Transforming growth factor β1.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0031]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0032" num="0031">Methods of the invention also include methods for the activation and expansion of T cells. Such methods include those comprising contacting mixed populations of T cells with: (a) a first agent which provides a primary activation signal to the members of a T cell subpopulation (e.g., Treg cells, Th17 cells, etc.) by stimulating a molecule on the members of the T cell subpopulation, and (b) a second agent that stimulates a molecule on the members of the T cell subpopulation that is different than the molecule stimulated by the first agent. In many instances, T cells in the population (e.g., members of the T cell subpopulation) are activated and expand. In additional instances, the first agent and the second agent may be bound to one or more solid supports. Further, the T cells may be maintained under conditions that allow for expansion (e.g., expansion of members of the T cell subpopulation). Additionally, the solid supports may be removed from contact with the T cells after a time period of less than 120 hours. In other words, the solid supports are placed in contact with the T cells for a limited time period, then removed from contact with the T cells. This time period may be from about 12 hours to about 120 hours (e.g., from about 12 hours to about 120 hours, from about 24 hours to about 120 hours, from about 36 hours to about 120 hours, from about 48 hours to about 120 hours, from about 60 hours to about 120 hours, from about 48 hours to about 96 hours, from about 60 hours to about 96 hours, from about 72 hours to about 96 hours, etc.). As discussed elsewhere herein, the first agent may an anti-CD3 antibody. Further, the second agent may also be an antibody. Additionally, the T cells may be contacted with a third agent is an antibody or a non-antibody protein (e.g., a chemokine or a cytokine).</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0045]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0046" num="0045">In some aspects, the present invention provides, inter alia, methods and compositions for the selective expansion of specific T cell subpopulations. These T cell subpopulations include, but are not limited to, Th17 cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs) and memory T cells. The specific T cell subpopulations disclosed herein can be used for the treatment of various physiological conditions, diseases, and/or disease states.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0006">Some Aspects of the Invention</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0046]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0047" num="0046">In some aspects, the invention is based upon signal types and signal intensities for the activation and/or expansion of T cell subpopulations. Along these lines, it has been observed that specific T cell subpopulations may be obtained and/or enhanced in a mixed population by selective cell surface marker stimulation. It has further been observed that variations in T cell receptor signal strength can also be used to obtain specific T cell subpopulations. In many instances, T cell subpopulations will be obtained from a mixed T cell population (e.g., total T cells obtained from peripheral blood).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0047]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0048" num="0047">Stimulation of T cell receptors can have a number of effects on a particular T cell, for example (1) no effect upon the T cell, (2) T cell activation, (3) T cell proliferation, (4) T cell polarization, (5) T cell differentiation (e.g., memory T cells), and (6) the induction of apoptosis in the T cell. The effect generated will often be a function of factors, such as the specific T cells present, the nature of the stimulatory signal(s), the ratio of the strength of multiple stimulatory signals (e.g., two, three, four, etc. signals) when multiple signals are employed, and the total or individual signal strength to which the T cell is exposed.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0048]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0049" num="0048">In many instances, T cells will be separated from other cell types prior to receptor stimulation. This may be done in a single step or in multiple steps. Exemplary methods are as follows: (1) buffy coat or apheresis isolation of mononuclear cells, (2) isolation of CD4+ cells using, for example, magnetic beads having one or more CD4 receptor binding agent, and (3) fluorescence activated cell sorting (see Example 1).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0049]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0050" num="0049">In some aspects of the invention, the ratio of two or more T cell signals are adjusted in a manner that results in selective expansion of a first set of one or more T cell subpopulations over a second set of one or more T cell subpopulations. In many instances, the first set of one or more (e.g., one, two, three, four, five, etc.) T cell subpopulations will be smaller than the second set of one or more T cell subpopulations. In some instances, the first set of one or more T cell subpopulations may comprise a single T cell subpopulation and the second set of one or more T cell subpopulations may comprise all of the other T cell subpopulations present. In some instances, a first T cell subpopulation (e.g., antigen experienced (memory) T cells) will be selectively expanded over a second T cell subpopulation (e.g., naive T cells). Further, one or more additional T cell subpopulations may expand in conjunction with the first T cell population.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0050]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0051" num="0050">In many instances, one signal will be generated by stimulation of a first T cell receptor (e.g., the CD3 receptor) and another signal will be generated by stimulation of a second, co-stimulation T cell receptor (e.g., the CD28 receptor, the CD137 receptor, the CD27 receptor, the CD5 receptor, the CD6 receptor, the ICOS receptor, the CD134 receptor, etc.). Signal ratios may be altered in manner that (a) enhances the expansion of a particular T cell population, (b) enhances the elimination of another T cell population (e.g., via apoptosis, inhibition of cell growth, by having no expansion effect, etc.), or both (a) and (b). In some instances, one or more additional T cell receptors may also be stimulated or other signals may be provided to the T cells.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0051]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0052" num="0051">Exemplary ratios of stimulation signal of a first T cell receptor to stimulation signal of a second T cell receptor will vary with the T cell subpopulation that is sought to be obtained and may be from about 50:1 to about 1:200 (e.g., about 1:5, about 1:10, about 1:15, about 1:20, about 1:40, from about 50:1 to about 1:40, from about 50:1 to about 1:30, from about 40:1 to about 1:40, from about 30:1 to about 1:40, from about 40:1 to about 1:20, from about 40:1 to about 1:10, from about 50:1 to about 1:1, from about 50:1 to about 5:1, from about 40:1 to about 5:1, from about 50:1 to about 10:1, from about 50:1 to about 15:1, from about 50:1 to about 20:1, from about 40:1 to about 5:1, from about 30:1 to about 3:1, from about 20:1 to about 3:1, from about 15:1 to about 3:1, from about 10:1 to about 5:1, from about 1:5 to about 1:10, from about 1:3 to about 1:20, from about 1:8 to about 1:25, from about 1:3 to about 1:40, from about 1:5 to about 1:50, from about 1:10 to about 1:50, from about 1:10 to about 1:100, from about 1:10 to about 1:150, from about 1:10 to about 1:200, from about 1:5 to about 1:150, from about 1:5 to about 1:200, etc.).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0052]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0053" num="0052">For purposes of illustration, signal provided by anti-CD3 antibodies and anti-CD28 antibodies may be present in a ratio of 1:10. It has been found that for expansion of some T cell subpopulations a lower amount of CD3 signal is desirable over a second signal (e.g., a CD28 signal and/or a CD137 signal). In some instances, when more than two T cell receptor signals are provided the ratio of each signal may be different or two or more of the signal ratios may be the same (e.g., two of three). As an example, CD3, CD28, and CD137 signals may be present at a ratio of 1:10:10. When each of these signals are generated by antibodies, this will generally mean that one part of an anti-CD3 antibody is present with ten parts of both anti-CD28 and anti-CD137 antibodies. This, of course, assumes that the amount of receptor stimulation is equal for each of the three receptors by their cognate antibody.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0053]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0054" num="0053">One issue for consideration is characterization of mixtures containing population of T cells generated by methods of the invention. In many instances, compositions and methods for the invention will be directed to altering the ratio of T cells of particular subpopulations in a mixture. For example, methods of the invention may result in certain types of T cells being eliminated from a mixed population by, as examples, apoptosis or dilution. Thus, one aspect of the invention relates to the amount of enhancement or depletion of a T cell population in a mixture, as well as the mixtures themselves. For example, if there are two T cell subpopulations in a mixture (e.g., Th17 T cells and Th1 T cells) and these subpopulations are present in, for example, a 1:1 ratio, then the invention includes methods in which one T cell subpopulation is increased in proportion to the other T cell subpopulation. For purposes of illustration the ratio may be altered to from about 1:1.5 to about 1:100,000 (e.g., from about 1:1.5 to about 1:100,000, from about 1:1.5 to about 1:80,000, from about 1:1.5 to about 1:50,000, from about 1:1.5 to about 1:10,000, from about 1:1.5 to about 1:5,000, from about 1:2,500 to about 1:25,000, from about 1:2,500 to about 1:60,000, from about 1:2,500 to about 1:80,000, from about 1:2,500 to about 1:100,000, from about 1:5,000 to about 1:100,000, from about 1:5,000 to about 1:80,000, from about 1:5,000 to about 1:50,000, from about 1:5,000 to about 1:25,000, etc.).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0054]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0055" num="0054">Further, the invention relates to compositions and methods for altering the ratio of T cells of particular subpopulations in a mixture, where the proportion of one T cell subpopulation is increased over another T cell subpopulation by at least 200,000 fold (e.g., from about 1,000 fold to about 200,000 fold, from about 5,000 fold to about 200,000 fold, from about 10,000 fold to about 200,000 fold, from about 20,000 fold to about 200,000 fold, from about 50,000 fold to about 200,000 fold, from about 75,000 fold to about 200,000 fold, from about 1,000 fold to about 120,000 fold, from about 5,000 fold to about 120,000 fold, from about 10,000 fold to about 120,000 fold, from about 1,000 fold to about 80,000 fold, from about 10,000 fold to about 80,000 fold, etc. An example of what is meant by “fold” is illustrated as follows. If two T cell subpopulations are present in an initial ratio of 1:2, then an alteration in their ratio to 1:8 is a 2 fold increase of one T cell subpopulation with respect to the other T cell subpopulation.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0055]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0056" num="0055">Another factor that can result is the selective expansion of individual T cell subpopulations is stimulus signal strength. By “stimulus signal strength” refers to the total signal strength on a per T cell basis. This includes the strength of the various signals (e.g., a signal stimulating a first T cell surface receptor, a signal stimulation of a second T cell surface receptor, a signal stimulation of a third T cell surface receptor, etc.) and the combined signal to which each T cell in the population is exposed to. Thus, the invention also relates to the amount of stimulatory signal received by each cell in a mixture of various T cell subpopulations. The stimulatory signal can be modulated by alterations to concentrations of stimulatory agents, ratios thereof, or ratios of surfaces comprising said stimulatory agents to cell count. In embodiments where stimulatory agents are bead-based a bead:cell ratio may be altered. A bead:cell ratio may comprise about 1:5000, about 1:2500, about 1:1000, about 1:500, about 1:250, about 1:100, about 1:90, about 1:80, about 1:70, about 1:60, about 1:50, about 1:40, about 1:30, about 1:10, about 1:9, about 1:8, about 1:7, about 1:6, about 1:5, about 1:4, about 1:3, about 1:2, about 1:1, about 2:1, about 3:1, about 4:1, about 5:1, or about 8:1, about 10:1, or about 15:1 beads per cell.</div>

Such methods result in the enhancement or depletion of specific T cells in a sample. As an example, naïve T cells, memory T cells, Th1 T cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs) stimulation of CD3 and CD28 receptors in conjunction with Interleukin-2. It has been shown that naïve T cells may be expanded while memory T cells may be depleted from a sample by the adjustment of total CD3/CD28 stimulus (see U.S. Pat. No. 8,617,884, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference). It has now been shown, related to one aspect of the invention, that different T cell subpopulations may be selectively expanded by adjusting signal ratios and total signal strength. As an example, Treg cells expand well when CD3 signal is lower than CD28 signal (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). The identification of selective expansion conditions can be used to increase the proportion of members of one T cell subpopulation over member of one or more other T cell subpopulations in a sample, even when the various cells of the various T cell subpopulations expand in response to the same stimuli. For purposes of illustration, assume that Treg T cells represent 1% of a mixed population and naïve T cells, memory T cells are represent, respectively, 1.5%, 3% of the same mixed population, stimulatory signals may be adjusted to induce elimination of memory T cells, while selectively expanding Treg T cells. The net result may be a mix population where Treg T cells represent 40% and naïve T cells, memory T cells, and Th1 T cells are represent, respectively, 2%, 0.5% and 2.5% of the mixed population.</div>

When a pathogen-derived molecule is encountered, the immune response is highly activated to ensure protection against that pathogenic organism.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0061]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0063" num="0061">The first mechanism is the non-specific (or innate) inflammatory response. The innate immune system can recognize specific molecules that are present on pathogens but not on the body itself. The second mechanism is the specific or acquired (or adaptive) immune response. Adaptive immune responses are custom tailored to the pathogen in question. The adaptive immune system evolves a specific immunoglobulin (antibody) response to many different molecules present in the pathogen, called antigens. In addition, a large repertoire of T cell receptors is sampled for their ability to bind processed forms of the antigens bound to MHC class I and II on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells (DCs).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0062]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0064" num="0062">The immune system recognizes and responds to structural differences between self and non-self proteins. Proteins that the immune system recognizes as non-self are referred to as antigens. Pathogens typically express large numbers of highly complex antigens. Acquired immunity has specific memory for antigenic structures; repeated exposure to the same antigen increases the response, which increases the level of induced protection against that particular pathogen.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0063]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0065" num="0063">Acquired immunity is mediated by specialized immune cells called B and T lymphocytes (or simply B and T cells). B cells produce and mediate their functions through the actions of antibodies. B cell-dependent immune responses are referred to as “humoral immunity,” because antibodies are detected in body fluids. T cell-dependent immune responses are referred to as “cell mediated immunity,” because effector activities are mediated directly by the local actions of effector T cells. The local actions of effector T cells are amplified through synergistic interactions between T cells and secondary effector cells, such as activated macrophages. The result is that the pathogen is killed and prevented from causing diseases.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0064]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0066" num="0064">Immune cells can require specific stimulation for activation. The use of anti-CD3/CD28, for example, provides the activation signal for some T cell population. Naïve T cells are believed to require at least two signals for activation. Signal one is antigen specific and is elicited by peptide/major histocompatibility complex (MHC) complexes presented by antigen-presenting cells (APC) and received through the T-cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 complex. For some T cell subpopulations, signal two can be delivered by antigen presenting cells and one of the candidate molecules for its receptor is the T cell antigen CD28. It is thought that when both the TCR/CD3 and CD28 T cell receptors are occupied by appropriate ligands, T cells are stimulated to proliferate and produce IL-2 (a cytokine essential for T cell proliferation), whereas occupation of the T cell receptor alone favors T cell anergy or apoptosis.</div>

Clinical trials with adoptive transfer of Tregs in transplantation, treatment of diabetes and other indications are underway. The relative frequency of Tregs in peripheral blood is approximately 1-2% of total lymphocytes implicating the necessity of ex vivo expansion of Tregs prior to adoptive transfer for most clinical applications.

Th17 cells have been found in various human tumors however their function in cancer immunity is unclear. When adoptively transferred into tumor-bearing mice, Th17 cells have been found to be more potent at eradicating melanoma than Th1 or non-polarized (Th0) T cells (Muranski et al., <i>Blood. </i>112:362-373 (2008)). Th17 cells are developmentally distinct from Th1 and Th2 lineages. Th17 cells are CD4+ cells that are responsive to IL-1R1 and IL-23R signaling and produce the cytokines IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-17AF, IL-21, IL-22, IL-26 (human), GM-CSF, MIP-3α, and TNFα. The phenotype of Th17 cells is CD3+, CD4+, CD161+. One obstacle to the use of Th17 cells for adoptive cell transfer has been the identification of robust culture conditions that can expand the Th17 cell subset, as well as their unstable phenotype in vivo (tumor microenvironment).</div>

Activation of a T cell may also induce cytokine production and/or secretion, and up- or down-regulation of expression of cell surface molecules such as receptors or adhesion molecules, or up- or down-regulation of secretion of certain molecules, and performance of regulatory or cytolytic effector functions.

The apheresis product typically contains lymphocytes, including T cells, monocytes, granulocytes, B cells, other nucleated white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. T cells can be obtained from a number of sources, including blood mononuclear cells, bone marrow, thymus, tissue biopsy, tumor, lymph node tissue, gut associated lymphoid tissue, mucosa associated lymphoid tissue, spleen tissue, or any other lymphoid tissue, and tumors. T cells can be obtained from T cell lines and from autologous or allogeneic sources, including cord blood.

The apheresis product typically contains lymphocytes, including T cells, monocytes, granulocytes, B cells, other nucleated white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Prior to exposure to a sensitizing composition and subsequent activation and/or stimulation, a source of T cells is obtained from a subject. In some embodiments, the cells collected by apheresis may be washed to remove the plasma fraction and to place the cells in an appropriate buffer or media for subsequent processing steps. In some embodiments of the invention, the cells are washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In an alternative embodiment, the wash solution lacks calcium and may lack magnesium or may lack many if not all divalent cations. As those of ordinary skill in the art would readily appreciate a washing step may be accomplished by methods known to those in the art, such as by using a semi-automated “flow-through” centrifuge (for example, the Cobe 2991 cell processor, Baxter) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After washing, the cells may be resuspended in a variety of biocompatible buffers, such as, for example, calcium (Ca)-free, magnesium (Mg)-free PBS.

In another embodiment, T cells can be isolated by incubation with a solid support to which anti-CD3 antibody is bound. One non-limiting example is anti-CD3/anti-CD28-conjugated beads, such as D<smallcaps>YNABEADS</smallcaps>® Human T-Expander CD3/CD28 (Life Technologies Corp., Cat. No. 11141D), for a time period sufficient for positive selection of the desired T cells. In a further embodiment, the time periods ranges from 30 minutes to 36 hours or longer and all integer values there between. In a further embodiment, the time period is at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 hours. In another embodiment the time period is 10 to 24 hours. In one embodiment, the incubation time period is 24 hours. Longer incubation times, such as 24 hours, can increase cell yield. Longer incubation times may be used to isolate T cells in any situation where there are few T cells as compared to other cell types. In one aspect of the present invention, enrichment of a T cell population by negative selection can be accomplished with a combination of antibodies directed to surface markers unique to the negatively selected cells. One possible method is cell sorting and/or selection via magnetic immunoadherence or flow cytometry that uses a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies direct to cell surface markers present on the cells negatively selected. In some embodiments, the fold expansion may differ based on the starting materials due to the variability of donor cells.

As a specific example, magnetic beads having bound thereto an antibody that binds to CD3 may be used to isolate CD3+ cells. Once released, CD3+ cells obtained may then be contacted with magnetic beads having bound thereto an antibody that binds to CD4. The resulting CD3+, CD4+ cells may then be contacted with magnetic beads having bound thereto an antibody that binds to CD25.

The selection for multiple characteristics simultaneously may result in number of undesired cells types “co-purifying” with the desired cell type(s).

Thus, ligands that bind to cellular components that may be detected and/or differentiated by flow cytometry systems may be used to purify/isolate T cells that have specific characteristics.

For example, if one of one or more stimulatory signal is attached to a solid phase and that solid phase is a tissue culture well, plate or bottle, the T cell population can be obtained by removal of the culture medium which contains the T cells. If the solid phase comprises for example magnetic beads, a magnetic field is used to attract the beads to the side of the vessel and the culture medium containing the T cells can then be, for example, poured off.

One way to connect proteins to supports is through biotin and avidin or streptavidin. One system that has been developed is referred to as Strep-tag® (IBA GMBH, Gottingen, Germany). This system allows for the use of an eight amino acid sequence tag (Trp-Ser-His-Pro-Gln-Phe-Glu-Lys (SEQ ID NO: 1)) that binds to streptavidin. Further, such systems allow for the release of bound cells and proteins through competitive binding with biotin. Thus, the invention includes compositions and methods for the connection of proteins (e.g., antibodies) to solid supports by streptavidin interactions, as well as purification of cells bound to such solid supports. Cell purification methods include the following. A solid support and antibody interaction is formed by avidin or streptavidin, where the antibody binds to a cell surface marker (e.g., CD4). The solid supports are separated from unbound cells, then bound cells are released. Release may occur by such methods as proteolytic cleavage of the antibody or through competition with added biotin. Such supports may be used for cell purification, as well as T cell activation.</div>

As illustrated in Table 2 using antibody ligands, solid supports may be loaded to less than 100% capacity. In many instances when this is done it will be desirable to block sites of ligand attachment from further reaction. One way of doing this is by contacting solid support with an agent (e.g., a protein) that does not have ligand binding activity relevant for the particular application (e.g., human serum albumin (HSA), bovine serum albumin (BSA), one or more antibodies that do not bind T cell receptors, etc.) (non-ligand agent) under conditions that allow for both the ligand(s) and non-ligand agent to attach with the solid support.

The use of such cells before, during, or after transplantation avoids extensive chronic graft versus host disease which may occur in patients being treated (e.g., cancer patients). The cells may be expanded immediately after harvest or stored (e.g., by freezing) prior to expansion or after expansion and prior to their therapeutic use.

In such methods a small number of T cells are removed from a patient and then manipulated and expanded ex vivo before reinfusing them into the patient. Examples of diseases which may be treated in this way are autoimmune diseases and conditions in which suppressed immune activity is desirable (e.g., for allo-transplantation tolerance). A therapeutic method could comprise providing a mammal, obtaining a biological sample from the mammal that contains T cells; expanding/activating the T cells ex vivo in accordance with the methods of the invention as described above; and administering the expanded/activated T cells to the mammal to be treated. The first mammal and the mammal to be treated can be the same or different. The mammal can generally be any mammal, such as cats, dogs, rabbits, horses, pigs, cows, goats, sheep, monkeys, or humans. The first mammal (“donor”) can be syngeneic, allogeneic, or xenogeneic.

<li> <para-num num="[0224]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0228" num="0224">The immune response to infectious diseases involves a balance of anti-pathogen and anti-inflammatory responses. T cells are heavily involved in this intricate balance. Infectious pathogens capable of eliciting a T cell response may be bacterial, viral, parasitic or fungal. Treg cells have been implicated in contributing to the chronicity of infection by <i>Helicobacter pylori </i>(Lundgren A, et al. Infect Immun 2003; 71:1755-62.), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Cabrera R, et al., Hepatology 2004; 40:1062-71.; Stoop J N, et al. Hepatology 2005; 41:771-8.; Sugimoto K, et al., Hepatology 2003; 38:1437-48.). This elevation in a particular T cell subpopulation may contribute to the prolonged nature of these infections by inapproprirately suppressing memory T cell responses. The compositions of the present invention may be utilized to specifically expand a particular T cell subpopulation and could be utilized in the treatment of such infectious diseases.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0225]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0229" num="0225">Infectious disease can be caused by direct contact with a pathogen and spread from person to person, animal to person, or from mother to unborn child. Infectious diseases can alternatively spread through indirect contact, e.g., from contact with an infected surface such as door handle, table, counter or faucet handle. Infectious diseases can further be spread via insect bites or food contamination. Certain autoimmune disorders, such as HIV or AIDS, and some cancers can increase susceptibility to infectious diseases. Certain treatment regimens that supress the immune system can also enhance susceptibility to infectious diseases. Example infectious diseases include: smallpox, malaria, tuberculosis, typhus, plague, diphtheria, typhoid, cholera, dysentery, pneumonia.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0226]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0230" num="0226">As described above, several mechanisms exist by which selective expansion of T cells may be used in the treatment of disease states. In infectious disease states, a patient suffering from the infection does not have sufficient immunity to the infectious agent. Methods of the present invention may be used to selectively expand heterologous T memory cells from a donor with immunity to a particular infectious agent and utilized in adoptive T-cell transfer. The externally expanded T cells from an infectious agent experienced donor can then be infused into a patient inflicted with the infection. In certain embodiments, T cells are administered at 1×10<sup>5</sup>, 1×10<sup>6</sup>, 1×10, 1×10<sup>8</sup>, 5×10<sup>8</sup>, 1×10<sup>9</sup>, 5×10<sup>9</sup>, 1×10<sup>10</sup>, 5×10<sup>10</sup>, 1×10<sup>11</sup>, 5×10<sup>11</sup>, or 1×10<sup>12 </sup>cells to the subject.

D<smallcaps>YNABEADS</smallcaps>® CD3/CD28 (high CD3—about 3.4) does not produce any effective Treg expansion. D<smallcaps>YNABEADS</smallcaps>® CD3/CD28 low (CD3—about 0.34) and D<smallcaps>YNABEADS</smallcaps>® CD3/CD28 mid (CD3—about 0.75) perform similar or better to the alternative Treg Stimulation Reagent.

The factors that modulate the generation of human Th17 cell development remain a matter of debate and differentiation of Th17 cells has been reported to be controlled by various transcription factors, including RORγt, IRF4, RUNX1, BATF, and STAT3 (Nalbant and Eskier, <i>Front. Biosci. </i>(Elite Ed.), 8:427-35 (2016)). Identification of robust culture conditions that can expand Th17 cells for adoptive cell transfer is desirable. D<smallcaps>YNABEADS</smallcaps>®CD3/CD28 CTS™ activation yields a T-cell product characterized by a Th1 polarized phenotype, while a weaker CD3-signal provided to the T cells under certain polarizing conditions induces Th17 development (Purvis et al., <i>Blood, </i>11:4829-37 (2010)). It has been found that an optimized CD3 signal strength can be achieved by lowering the amount of agonistic CD3 antibody conjugated to beads together with a low bead to cell ratio of 1:5. It has also been found that the weak CD3 signal together with ICOS costimulation generates a higher fraction of IL-17A producing T cells compared to beads providing CD28 costimulation.</div>

However, the commonly used medium RPMI supports only low levels of Th17 polarization. Other media richer in aromatic amino acids, precursors of arly hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) agonists, consistently results in higher Th17 expansion and demonstrate that AHR activation is essential Th17 polarization. RORγt is the master transcription factor for Th17 cells. When injected into mice, RORγt agonist result in elevated levels of Th17 cytokines, increase the level of costimulatory receptors such as CD137, and decrease expression of the co-inhibitory receptor PD-1 (Hu et al., “<i>RORg agonist regulate immune checkpoint receptors to enhance anti</i>-<i>tumor immunity” AACR abstract #</i>565, New Orleans 2016). Furthermore, T cells treated with RORγt agonist in vitro maintained low PD-1 expression following adoptive transfer.</div>
