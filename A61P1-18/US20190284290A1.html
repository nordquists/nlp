</li> <heading id="h-0004">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">TRAIL (TNF-Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand), is a member of the TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor) family of cytokines. In common with several other members of the TNF family, TRAIL is homotrimeric, exists as both surface-bound and soluble forms, and binds to several receptors that are members of the TNF-receptor superfamily. Two of these receptors, DR4 (Death Receptor 4) and DR5 (Death Receptor 5) are capable of generating an apoptotic signal. Binding of TRAIL to DR4 or DR5 at the surface of a sensitive target cell induces receptor clustering, a step that is critical for the formation of a productive a death-inducing signaling complex, and subsequent apoptosis of the target cell.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">Certain agonistic antibodies directed against DR4 or DR5 can also induce death of target cells. However, highly purified preparations of these antibodies, that are essentially free of aggregates, require additional cross-linking in order to induce optimal receptor clustering and apoptosis. This cross-linking can be provided in vitro by multi-valent agents that bind the Fc (factor crystallizable) region of antibodies, such as anti-IgG antibodies or protein G. See, e.g., Miller et al, J. Immunol., 170: 4854-4861 (2003). In preclinical animal models, the activity of agonistic anti-DR4 or DR5 antibodies is highly dependent on their interaction with receptors that bind the Fc region of IgG, suggesting that cross-linking in vivo is mediated by these Fcγ receptors. Work by ourselves and others has shown that the critical FcγRs for mediating anti-DR5 antibody crosslinking in humans are likely to be FcγRII and FcγRIIIA that are expressed primarily on myeloid and natural killer (NK) cells populations respectively. See, e.g., Wilson et al., Cancer Cell 19:101-113 (2011).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">The therapeutic potential of apoptosis induced by the TRAIL receptor system has been investigated in human clinical trials with soluble recombinant human TRAIL or agonist antibodies directed against either DR4 or DR5. Although Phase 1 and 1 b combination studies provided encouraging preliminary results, findings from randomized Phase 2 studies have failed to demonstrate an overall statistically significant clinical benefit from death receptor agonist therapies. While the reason(s) for these results are not completely understood, one possible explanation is that neither soluble TRAIL, nor anti-DR5 antibodies, induced optimal receptor clustering and therefore apoptotic signaling in patients.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">In the case of anti-DR antibodies, the requirement for interaction with FcγR-bearing cells may have limited their efficacy. For example, FcγR-bearing cells in the microenvironment of a particular tumor may be low and/or reduced as a result of chemotherapeutic toxicity. Additionally, polymorphic variation in the FCGR3A receptor on NK cells at the locus F158V (SNP ID: rs396991) can lead to significant differences in binding affinity between an antibody's Fc domain and NK cells and, as a corollary, result in significant differences in the ability of such antibodies to induce apoptosis via FcγRIIIA binding. This variability is particularly problematic as most human patients are not homozygous for the high-affinity FCGR3A V158 allele.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">Reports of synergy between an anti-DR5 antibody (AD5-10) and TRAIL in inducing apoptosis of tumor cells in vitro has been reported. Guo et al. (Journal of Biological Chemistry, 280(51): 41940-41952 (2005)). However, subsequent investigation by EI-Gazzar et al. utilizing AD5-10 found that the function of natural killer (NK) cells is necessary for the activation of DR5-mediated apoptosis. EI-Gazzar et al., Mol. Cancer Ther., 9(4): 1007-1018 (2010). In that study, in an NK-competent human ovarian cancer xenograft mouse model the tumor was eradicated but in NK-depleted mice cytotoxic activity of AD5-10 was abolished.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, what is needed in the art are agonistic anti-DR5 therapeutics that can induce effective receptor clustering in the absence of a requirement for exogenous cross-linking. Here agonistic combinations of TRAIL and anti-DR binding polypeptides or of pairs of binding polypeptides are provided that synergistically interact to induce apoptosis via DR4 and/or DR5. Thus, the present invention provides potent agonists that are independent of the requirement for interaction with immune cells.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention includes a composition for inducing DR5-mediated apoptosis of a mammalian cancer cell expressing this receptor. This apoptotic composition includes a first anti-DR5 binding polypeptide that specifically binds to the extracellular domain of a DR5 receptor of the cancer cell. The composition also includes at least one of a second anti-DR5 binding polypeptide that specifically binds to the extracellular domain of the DR5 receptor. The first binding polypeptide and the second binding polypeptide do not competitively inhibit each other from specifically binding to their cognate receptor(s). Specific binding of the first binding polypeptide and the second binding polypeptide act to cooperatively induce apoptosis of the mammalian cancer cell without requiring natural killer (NK) cell mediated cross-linking. Alternatively, or in addition, the apoptotic composition can comprise the first binding polypeptide and a tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) or a TRAIL variant that specifically binds to the DR5 receptor. TRAIL or its variant and the first binding polypeptide do not competitively inhibit each other from specifically binding their cognate receptor. Specific binding of these molecules cooperatively induces apoptosis of the mammalian cancer cell without requiring natural killer (NK) mediation of the apoptosis. In some embodiments the mammalian cancer cell is a human cancer cell. In some embodiments, the first anti-DR5 binding polypeptide and/or the second anti-DR5 binding polypeptide is an antibody, which can be a fully human antibody. In some embodiments, at least one of the first or second anti-DR5 binding polypeptides do not specifically bind to FCGR3A of NK cells. The apoptotic compositions of the invention can be administered in a therapeutically effective amount to inhibit the growth of DR5 expressing cancer in a mammal such as a human. The composition can be administered in combination with a therapeutically effective amount of a chemotherapeutic agent.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0023]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0024" num="0023">The present invention relates, in part, to compositions and methods for inducing apoptosis of DR5 and/or DR4 expressing mammalian cancer cells. The combinations of the present invention can induce apoptosis without requiring specific binding to FCGR3A and thus without requiring NK cell mediated induction of apoptosis. The present invention provides combinations that can act to mediate apoptosis via both NK cell-dependent and NK cell-independent pathways. Thus, the present invention provides for a more effective anti-cancer therapeutic than NK cell-dependent compositions which are otherwise susceptible to variations in the amount of NK cells in the tumor microenvironment as well as to differences in affinity of IgG1 antibodies to polymorphic forms of FCGR3A.</div>

Unless specific definitions are provided, the nomenclature utilized in connection with, and the laboratory procedures and techniques of biochemistry and molecular biology described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art. Standard techniques may be used for biochemical syntheses, biochemical analyses, pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery, and treatment of patients.

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0025]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0026" num="0025">The term “afucosylation” or “afucosylated” in the context of an Fc, such as an Fc-polypeptide, refers to a substantial lack of a fucose moiety covalently attached, directly or indirectly, to residue 297 of the human IgG1 Fc numbered according to the EU index (Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)), or the corresponding residue in non-IgG1 or non-human IgG1 immunoglobulins. Thus, in a composition comprising a plurality of afucosylated Fc-polypeptides at least 70% of the Fc-polypeptides will be not be fucosylated, directly or indirectly (e.g., via intervening sugars) at residue 297 of the Fc, and in some embodiments at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 99% will not be fucosylated, directly or indirectly at residue 297 of the Fc. Those of skill will recognize that in the context of the present invention it may be possible to create a biologically inactive fucosylation of an Fc that is biologically similar to afucosylation in increasing affinity to FCGR3A. Such constructs are to be understood as included within the scope of the defined term.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0026]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0027" num="0026">The term “apoptosis” refers generally to a specific programmed cell death inducing mechanism initiated by an agonist of a DR4 and/or DR5 receptor. While not bound by theory, cell death induced by agonizm of these receptors is thought to proceed via apoptosis. However, the defined term is not limited to that specific mechanism and may proceed via other forms of programmed cell death.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0027]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0028" num="0027">The term “agonist” or “agonistic” or “agonize” in the context of a binding polypeptide's activity, refers to its function in mediating induction of apoptosis via the DR5 and/or DR4 receptor in an apoptosis sensitive mammalian cancer cell, such as a human cancer cell, which expresses DR4 and/or DR5 on the cell surface. An exemplary human cancer cell sensitive to apoptosis is Colo205 (ATCC CCL-222). A DR5 agonist will induce apoptosis via DR5, a DR4 agonist will induce apoptosis via DR4, a dual DR5/DR4 agonist (e.g., TRAIL ligand or a bispecific agonistic anti-DR4/DR5 antibody) is able to induce apoptosis through both DR4 and DR5. Whether apoptotic induction is mediated via DR5 and/or DR4 can be determined using methods and reagents known in the art. Thus, for example, apoptosis sensitive DR specific cell lines are known in the art. An exemplary DR5(+)/DR4(−) cell line is WM35 (ATCC CRL-2807). An exemplary DR5(−)/DR4(+) cell line is ST486 (ATCC CRL 1647).</div>

Thus, the term “antibody” is inclusive of antibodies that are prepared, expressed, created or isolated by recombinant means, such as (a) antibodies isolated from an animal (e.g., a mouse) that is transgenic for human immunoglobulin genes, or a B-cell or hybridoma prepared therefrom, (b) antibodies isolated from a host cell transfected to express the antibody (e.g., from a transfectoma), (c) antibodies isolated from a recombinant combinatorial antibody library, and (d) antibodies prepared, expressed, created or isolated by any other means that involve splicing of immunoglobulin gene sequences to other DNA sequences. Antibodies are also inclusive of antibody fragments such as Fab, F(ab′)<sub>2</sub>, scFv (single-chain Fv), and derivatives such as diabodies. In some embodiments the antibodies of the present invention are monoclonal antibodies, such as humanized or human monoclonal antibodies. Typically, antibodies of the present invention will be IgG1 or IgG2 subclass antibodies. The antibody may bind its target with a Kd of less than about 10 nM, 5 nM, 1 nM, or 500 pM.</div>

A binding polypeptide that specifically binds to DR5 is referred to as an “anti-DR5 binding polypeptide” while a binding polypeptide that specifically binds to DR4 is referred to as an “anti-DR4 binding polypeptide.” A binding polypeptide that specifically binds to both DR5 and DR4 (such as a bispecific molecule) is referred to as an “anti-DR4/anti-DR5 binding polypeptide.” A binding polypeptide can be derivitized to increase, for example, solubility or pharmacokinetic properties. Often the binding polypeptide includes an Fc (fragment crystallizable) that can bind to FCGR3A, such as a human IgG1 Fc. Exemplary binding polypeptides include antibodies, peptibodies, and Fc-polypeptides.</div>

Thus, cooperativity can be at least partially-additive, at least fully-additive, or greater than fully-additive (i.e., synergistic) of the activity of each agent in the combination. Cooperativity can be assessed in terms of efficacy, potency, or both.</div>

Cross-linking can be achieved in vitro using exogenous cross-linking agents. Cross-linking can be achieved in vivo using endogenous (i.e., naturally occurring) cross-linkers such as FCGR3A NK cells or macrophages.</div>

The Fc of an Fc-polypeptide can, however, be linked directly or indirectly with labels, toxins, drugs, tissue-specific binding agents, and the like, to enhance the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties of the Fc-polypeptide.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0067]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0068" num="0067">In some embodiments, two or more Fc-polypeptides can be covalently bonded to one another, such as by cysteine-cysteine disulfide bonds, to create bivalent (i.e., two antigen binding sites), trivalent, or higher order structures of Fc-polypeptides. A bivalent Fc-polypeptide, such as an antibody, can be monospecific and specifically bind to a single epitope of the target, or bispecific such that it specifically binds to two unique epitopes on the same target (e.g., human DR5 or human DR4) or two unique epitopes of differing targets (e.g., human DR4 and human DR5). In additional embodiments, two or more unique or identical species of polypeptides that specifically bind to human DR4 and/or human DR5 are covalently linked to a single Fc to form an Fc-polypeptide. Thus, in some embodiments, 2, 3, or 4 of such polypeptides are covalently linked to a single Fc. Such Fc-polypeptides can be dimerized (by, for example, disulfide bonding between Fc chains to form a bivalent Fc-polypeptide), trimerized, etc. The polypeptide can be directly or indirectly attached to an Fc at or near the N- or C-terminus of the Fc or at an internal residue within the Fc. In other embodiments, a second or additional polypeptide that specifically binds to human DR4 and/or human DR5 is covalently linked to a polypeptide that itself is covalently linked to the Fc. Thus, Fc-polypeptides can comprise multiple polypeptides covalently linked, directly or indirectly, to the Fc or to a polypeptide that is itself covalently attached directly or indirectly to the Fc.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0069]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0070" num="0069">The present invention provides binding polypeptide of the present invention in compositions (“apoptotic compositions”) that act cooperatively in vitro and/or in vivo to induce apoptosis in a mammalian cancer cell expressing DR5 and/or DR4. In some embodiments, the mammalian cancer cell is a human, murine, or cynomologous monkey cancer cell. In some embodiments, the apoptotic composition comprises at least a first anti-DR5 and/or anti-DR4 binding polypeptide of the present invention and at least a second binding polypeptide that specifically binds, under specific binding conditions, to at least the same receptor as the first binding polypeptide. In this embodiment, the first and second binding polypeptides specifically bind, under specific binding conditions, to the extracellular domain of the target receptor (DR5 and/or DR4). The first binding polypeptide and second binding polypeptide of the apoptotic composition do not substantially competitively inhibit each other from specifically binding to the target receptor so as to allow for cooperativity. Instrumentation and methods of assaying and quantifying competitive inhibition, such as by competitive ELISA, are known in the art such as the AlphaLISA™ system (Perkin Elmer, Mass. USA) ELISA assay. Generally, while some degree of competitive inhibition is acceptable, it is preferably minimized. Thus, the specific binding of a first binding polypeptide should not reduce the specific binding of a second binding polypeptide (or vice-versa) by more than 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or 95%. In some embodiments of the apoptotic compositions of the present invention, at least 1, 2, 3, 4, or more of the binding polypeptides are agonistic as single agents towards the DR5 and/or DR4 expressing apoptosis sensitive mammalian cancer cells. Examples of such DR4 and/or DR5 expressing apoptosis sensitive mammalian cancer cells are discussed above and in the working examples where a number of cell lines are disclosed. In some embodiments, specific binding of the first binding polypeptide and the second binding polypeptide cooperatively induce apoptosis of the mammalian cancer cell independent of natural killer (NK) cell mediation of apoptosis. Accordingly, in some embodiments the first and/or second binding polypeptides are low-affinity (for FCGR3A) binding polypeptides, such as low-affinity Fc-polypeptides, such as but not limited to, low-affinity antibodies. While some degree of NK mediated apoptosis is permissible, NK-dependent apoptotic activity of the apoptotic composition is often less than 10%, and in some embodiments less than 5%, 3%, 2%, 1% or 0.5% of the total apoptotic activity (i.e., NK-independent+NK-dependent apoptosis). Binding polypeptides having a low-affinity for FCGR3A can lack or have a truncated Fc such that the binding polypeptide lacks the ability to bind to FCGR3A. In some embodiments a binding polypeptide of the present invention is an IgG2 Fc-polypeptide. In specific embodiments, the first and second binding polypeptides are Fc-polypeptides such as antibodies. In even more specific embodiments, the antibodies are human antibodies that specifically bind to human DR5 and/or DR4. The first and second anti-DR5 binding polypeptides can specifically bind to the same receptor (DR5 or DR4). An apoptotic composition can be a single bispecific molecule comprising a first and second binding polypeptide of the invention. In one embodiment, the single molecule is a bispecific anti-DR5 human or humanized antibody. In some embodiments, the apoptotic composition comprises conatumumab (AMG 655; Amgen Inc.) whose structure is provided in U.S. Pat. No. 7,521,048 of Gliniak et al, filed, Aug. 28, 2006, incorporated by reference herein, and disclosed therein as antibody “O” (SEQ ID NO: 30 and 64). While apoptotic compositions often comprise two binding polypeptides of the invention, 3, 4, 5, or more can be utilized. In some embodiments, the binding polypeptides of the invention are conjugated to each other directly or indirectly. Thus, a single molecule can comprise multiple species of binding polypeptide.</div>

In this embodiment, the first binding polypeptide and TRAIL do not substantially competitively inhibit each other from specifically binding to the extracellular domain of the target death receptor (DR4 and/or DR5). Generally, while some degree of competitive inhibition is acceptable, it should be minimized so as to not adversely impede mutual specific binding of the binding polypeptide and TRAIL or TRAIL variant. Thus, the specific binding of a first binding polypeptide (or TRAIL or TRAIL variant) should not reduce the specific binding of TRAIL or TRAIL variant (or the first binding polypeptide) by more than 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or 95%. In some embodiments, the apoptotic composition cooperatively induces apoptosis of the mammalian cancer cell independent of natural killer (NK) cell mediation of apoptosis. Accordingly, in some embodiments the first binding polypeptide is a low-affinity (for FCGR3A) binding polypeptide, such as a low-affinity Fc-polypeptide, often a low-affinity antibody. Thus, in some embodiments the NK-dependent apoptotic activity of the binding polypeptides of the invention is less than 10%, and in some embodiments less than 5%, 3%, 2%, 1% or 0.5% of the total apoptotic activity (i.e., NK-independent+NK-dependent apoptosis). In some embodiments, at least 1, 2, 3, 4, or more of the binding polypeptides of the apoptotic composition are agonistic as single agents towards DR5 and/or DR4 expressing apoptosis sensitive mammalian cancer cells.

Apoptosis sensitive tumor cell lines that can be used to identify apoptotic compositions of the invention are known in the art and include, but not limited to, Colo205 (colon), WM35 (colon), H1975 (lung), SK-MES-1 (lung), HCC38 (breast), H2122 (lung), SkLu1 (lung), or H460 (lung). Apoptosis assays for evaluating the efficacy and/or potency of apoptotic compositions are known in the art. See, for example, caspase activation and cell viability assays in Kaplan-Lefko et. al., Cancer Biology &amp; Therapy, 9:8, 1-14, (2010). Conveniently, a two-dimensional or higher order matrix of the binding polypeptides being evaluated for their ability to exhibit cooperativity can be created to efficiently assess candidate binding polypeptides. In a two-dimensional matrix, for example, large numbers of binding polypeptides (or binding polypeptides and TRAIL or TRAIL variant) can be arrayed in each dimension and pairwise combinations that exhibit cooperativity can thereby be efficiently and readily identified. In some embodiments, the anti-DR5 and/or anti-DR4 binding polypeptides utilized in the assay for apoptotic cooperativity are pre-selected on the basis of desired characteristics to improve the frequency of cooperative pairings. Thus, in some embodiments, the binding polypeptides (or the binding polypeptide and TRAIL or TRAIL variant) utilized in the assay do not competitively inhibit mutual specific binding to their target (i.e., DR4 and/or DR5) as discussed in more detail supra. In some embodiments, at least one of the binding polypeptides utilized in the assay and in the apoptotic composition is an agonistic binding polypeptide to DR4 and/or DR5. In some embodiments, the binding polypeptides utilized in the screening are Fc-polypeptides, such as antibodies. In some embodiments, the antibodies utilized in the screen will require a cross-linker, such as Protein G, to induce apoptosis of a sensitive cancer cell in vivo. In some embodiments, these antibodies are human monoclonal antibodies. In some embodiments, one of the cross-linking dependent antibodies is conatumumab (AMG 655; Amgen Inc).</div>

An effective amount of a therapeutic composition is administered to inhibit, halt, or reverse progression of cancers that are sensitive to DR4 and/or DR5 mediated apoptosis. Human cancer cells can be treated in vivo, or ex vivo. In ex vivo treatment of a human patient, tissue or fluids containing cancer cells are treated outside the body and then the tissue or fluids are reintroduced back into the patient. In some embodiments, the cancer is treated in a human patient in vivo by administration of the therapeutic composition into the patient. Thus, the present invention provides ex vivo and in vivo methods to inhibit, halt, or reverse progression of the tumor, or otherwise result in a statistically significant increase in progression-free survival (i.e., the length of time during and after treatment in which a patient is living with pancreatic cancer that does not get worse), or overall survival (also called “survival rate”; i.e., the percentage of people in a study or treatment group who are alive for a certain period of time after they were diagnosed with or treated for cancer) relative to treatment with a control.</div>

The primary vehicle or carrier in a pharmaceutical composition may be either aqueous or non-aqueous in nature. For example, a suitable vehicle or carrier may be water for injection or physiological saline, possibly supplemented with other materials common in compositions for parenteral administration. Neutral buffered saline or saline mixed with serum albumin are further exemplary vehicles. Other exemplary pharmaceutical compositions comprise Tris buffer of about pH 7.0-8.5, or acetate buffer of about pH 4.0-5.5, which may further include sorbitol or a suitable substitute therefore. In one embodiment of the present invention, binding agent compositions may be prepared for storage by mixing the selected composition having the desired degree of purity with optional formulation agents (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, supra) in the form of a lyophilized cake or an aqueous solution.

A particularly suitable vehicle for parenteral administration is sterile distilled water in which a binding agent is formulated as a sterile, isotonic solution, properly preserved. Yet another preparation can involve the formulation of the desired molecule with an agent, such as injectable microspheres, bio-erodible particles, polymeric compounds (polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid), beads, or liposomes, that provide for the controlled or sustained release of the product which may then be delivered via a depot injection.</div>

Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances that increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Additional pharmaceutical compositions will be evident to those skilled in the art, including formulations involving binding agent molecules in sustained- or controlled-delivery formulations. Techniques for formulating a variety of other sustained- or controlled-delivery means, such as liposome carriers, bio-erodible microparticles or porous beads and depot injections, are also known to those skilled in the art. The pharmaceutical composition to be used for in vivo administration typically must be sterile. This may be accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes. Where the composition is lyophilized, sterilization using this method may be conducted either prior to or following lyophilization and reconstitution. The composition for parenteral administration may be stored in lyophilized form or in solution.

The exact dosage will be determined in light of factors related to the subject requiring treatment. Dosage and administration are adjusted to provide sufficient levels of the active compound or to maintain the desired effect. Factors that may be taken into account include the severity of the disease state, the general health of the subject, the age, weight, and gender of the subject, time and frequency of administration, drug combination(s), reaction sensitivities, and response to therapy. Long-acting pharmaceutical compositions may be administered every 3 to 4 days, every week, or biweekly depending on the half-life and clearance rate of the particular formulation. The frequency of dosing will depend upon the pharmacokinetic parameters of the molecule in the formulation used. Typically, a composition is administered until a dosage is reached that achieves the desired effect.

In addition, an aglycosylated mutant of AMG 655 (N297A) was included that is unable to bind FcγRs and therefore lacks intrinsic activity because it is unable to be cross-linked in vivo. Previous in vivo studies with H460 have shown that this tumor is sensitive to TRAIL but almost completely resistant to AMG 655. The efficacy of AMG 655 or AMG 655 N297A in the presence or absence of TRAIL was compared. For this experiment, CB17-SCID mice approximately 6 weeks of age were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) in the right flank with 5×10<sup>6 </sup>NCI-H460 cells. When tumors reached 150-200 mm<sup>3</sup>, mice were treated with either hIgG1 (human IgG1), AMG 655 (100 μg), AMG 655-N297A (100 μg), TRAIL (60 mg/kg) or a combination of AMG 655 and TRAIL, or AMG 655-N297A and TRAIL (n=10 mice/group). All antibodies were administered via intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) twice per week for 2 weeks. TRAIL and saline control were administered i.p. daily for 5 days for 2 weeks.

Cells were then treated with a dose titration of TRAIL or AMG 655 with protein G (1 μg/mL) as indicated (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). After a further 24 hour incubation, cell viability was determined using the CellGlo® assay. Data are expressed as percent of control untreated cells. This experiment was repeated at least 3 times with similar results. The results in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> show that cooperativity between TRAIL and AMG 655 is not restricted to DR5+/DR4− (WM35) cells, and some cells that do not respond to TRAIL or AMG 655 (+protein G) can be sensitized by the combination of TRAIL+AMG 655.</div>

One of the cell lines that showed the most polarized response was SK-Lu-1. It was confirmed that SK-Lu-1 do not respond to soluble TRAIL but are responsive to AMG 655 (+protein G). Despite being unresponsive to soluble TRAIL alone, TRAIL+AMG 655 induced a strong apoptotic response that was more potent than that seen with AMG 655 (+protein G) alone. A total of 8 cell lines were tested from this response group (AMG 655&gt;TRAIL) and all show a strong cooperative interaction between AMG 655 and TRAIL.</div>

In this experiment, 1×10{circumflex over ( )}4 H838 cells/well were plated. The following day, cells were treated with either media, hIgG (1 μg/mL) or AMG 655(1 μg/mL).

For one experiment, 1×10{circumflex over ( )}5 primary human monocytes, prepared by negative selection from human PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cell) leukopacks, were plated at 1×10{circumflex over ( )}6/mL 24 hours before being treated with a dose titration of TRAIL or AMG 655+protein G (1 μg/mL). The indicated cells then received AMG 655 (5 μg/mL) (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Cells were analyzed for viability 48 hr after treatment using the ATPLite® luminescence ATP detection assay system (PerkinElmer, USA). Data shown is expressed as relative luminescence units. DR5 expression was confirmed by flow cytometry as described in Example 2. The results in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> show that primary human monocytes do not respond to either TRAIL or AMG 655 (+protein G) alone, or the combination, despite expressing surface levels of DR5.

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0089]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0090" num="0089">In a related experiment, commercially available primary human renal epithelial cells (Lonza, Walkersville, Md.) were plated at 2×10{circumflex over ( )}4 cells/well 24 hours before being treated with a dose titration of TRAIL, AMG 655+protein G (1 μg/mL), or staurosporine. The cells then received AMG 655 (5 μg/mL). After a 24 hour incubation, cell viability was determined by the ATPlite® luminescence ATP detection assay system (PerkinElmer, USA). Data was expressed as percent of control relative to untreated cells. DR5 expression was confirmed by flow cytometry as described in Example 2. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, human primary renal epithelial cells were insensitive to either TRAIL, AMG 655 (+protein G) or the combination, although they were sensitive to increased amounts of staurosporine. The lack of sensitivity was not due to poor expression of DR5, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>. This experiment was repeated twice with similar results.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0090]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0091" num="0090">Since previous reports have demonstrated that different versions of recombinant TRAIL elicit differential hepatocyte toxicity (Lawrence et al, 2001) the sensitivity of TRAIL, AMG 655 or the combination in primary human hepatocytes from three different donors was evaluated. As expected, both TRAIL and AMG 655 (+protein G) showed some dose-dependent killing activity against hepatocytes (data not shown). Confirming previous observations, LZ-TRAIL was more potent than either TRAIL or AMG 655 (+protein G). Although the combination of TRAIL+AMG 655 was more potent than TRAIL alone, maximal killing of the combination was consistently less than AMG 655+(protein G) or LZ-TRAIL. This suggests that in vitro, hepatocytes have an intermediate response to the combination of TRAIL and AMG 655 (+protein G) as compared to either agent alone.</div>

M415 neither competed nor cooperated with TRAIL. However, M410 and M412 showed cooperative behavior with TRAIL that was similar to that observed with AMG 655. These results show that not all anti-DR5 antibodies are capable of cooperating with TRAIL. The anti-DR5 mAb M413 antagonized TRAIL-mediated killing, suggesting that antibodies that compete with ligand for binding to DR5 are unlikely to demonstrate synergy with TRAIL.</div>

Thirteen days following tumor cell implantation, mice were treated with either human IgG2 (200 μg, n=10/group), 2.67.1 (IgG2 isotype)+IgG2 (100 μg each, n=8/group), 1.10.1(IgG2 isotype)+IgG2 (100 μg each, n=8/group), or 1.10.1+2.67.1 (100 μg each, n=8/group) (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). All antibodies were administered via intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) twice per week for 2 weeks.

As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, no anti-tumor efficacy was observed with either 1.10.1 or 2.67.1 antibody alone. However, significant tumor growth inhibition was observed when 1.101 and 2.67.1 were combined (p&lt;000.1). These results indicate that 1.10.1 and 2.67.1 can cooperate in vivo and that this cooperativity is independent of FcγR-mediated cross-linking, as IgG2 antibodies have low or no affinity for Fc receptor subtypes.</div>
