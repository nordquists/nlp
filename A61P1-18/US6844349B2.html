<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00057">The present invention relates to succinate and malonate complexes of E-2-Methoxy-N-(3-{4-[3-methyl-4-(6-methyl-pyridin-3-yloxy)-phenylamino]-quinazolin-6-yl}-allyl)-acetamide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00058">In one preferred embodiment of the present invention relates to monosuccinate, hemisuccinate, sesquisuccinate and di-malonate complexe of E-2-Methoxy-N-(3-{4-[3-methyl-4-(6-methyl-pyridin-3-yloxy)-phenylamino]-quinazolin-6-yl}-allyl)-acetamide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00059">The invention further relates to a method making the monosuccinate, hemisuccinate, sesquisuccinate and di-malonate complexes of E-2-Methoxy-N-(3-{4-[3-methyl-4-(6-methyl-pyridin-3-yloxy)-phenylamino]-quinazolin-6-yl}-allyl)-acetamide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00060">The complexes of the present invention are useful in the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases, such as cancers, in mammals, especially humans, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00061">The complexes of the compound of formula I have been characterized using elemental analysis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00062">The in vitro activity of the compounds of formula 1 may be determined by the following procedure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00063">The in vitro activity of the compounds of formula 1 as erbB kinase inhibitors in intact cells may be determined by the following procedure. Cells, for example 3T3 cells transfected with human EGFR (Cohen et al. J. Virology 67:5303, 1993) or with chimeric EGFR/erbB2 kinase (EGFR extracellular/erbB2 intracellular, Fazioli et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 11: 2040, 1991) are plated in 96-well plates at 12,000 cells per well in 100 μl medium (Dulbecco's Minimum Essential Medium (DMEM) with 5% fetal calf serum, 1% pen/streptomycin, 1% L-glutamine) and incubated at 37° C., 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Test compounds are solubilized in DMSO at a concentration of 10 mM, and tested at final concentrations of 0, 0.3 μM, 1 μM, 0.3 μM, 0.1 μM and 10 μM in the medium. The cells are incubated at 37° C. for 2 h. EGF (40 ng/ml final) is added to each well and cells incubate at room temperature for 15 min followed by aspiration of medium, then 100 μl/well cold fixative (50% ethanol/50% acetone containing 200 micromolar sodium orthovanadate) is added. The plate is incubated for 30 min at room temperature followed by washing with wash buffer (0.5% Tween 20 in phosphate buffered saline). Blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20, 200 μM sodium orthovanadate in phosphate buffered saline, 100 μl/well) is added followed by incubation for 2 hours at room temperature followed by two washes with wash buffer. PY54 monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody directly conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (50 μl/well, 1 μg/ml in blocking buffer) or blocked conjugate (1 μg/ml with 1 mM phosphotyrosine in blocking buffer, to check specificity) is added and the plates incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. The plate wells are then washed 4 times with wash buffer. The colorimetric signal is developed by addition of TMB Microwell Peroxidase Substrate (Kirkegaard and Perry, Gaithersburg, Md.), 50 μl, per well, and stopped by the addition of 0.09 M sulfuric acid, 50 μl per well. Absorbance at 450 nM represents phosphotyrosine content of proteins. The increase in signal in EGF-treated cells over control (non-EGF treated) represents the activity of the EGFR or EGFR/chimera respectively. The potency of an inhibitor is determined by measurement of the concentration of compound needed to inhibit the increase in phosphotyrosine by 50% (IC<sub>50</sub>) in each cell line. The selectivity of the compounds for erbB2 vs. EGFR is determined by comparison of the IC<sub>50 </sub>for the EGFR transfectant vs. that for the erbB2/EGFR chimera transfectant. Thus, for example, a compound with an IC<sub>50 </sub>of 100 nM for the EGFR transfectant and 10 nM for the erbB2/EGFR chimera transfectant is considered 10-fold selective for erbB2 kinase.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00064">Administration of the compounds of the present invention (hereinafter the “active compound(s)”) can be effected by any method that enables delivery of the compounds to the site of action. These methods include oral routes, intraduodenal routes, parenteral injection (including intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular or infusion), topical, and rectal administration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00065">The amount of the active compound administered will be dependent on the subject being treated, the severity of the disorder or condition, the rate of administration and the judgement of the prescribing physician. However, an effective dosage is in the range of about 0.001 to about 100 mg per kg body weight per day, preferably about 1 to about 35 mg/kg/day, in single or divided doses. For a 70 kg human, this would amount to about 0.05 to about 7 g/day, preferably about 0.2 to about 2.5 g/day. In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effect, provided that such larger doses are first divided into several small doses for administration throughout the day.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00066">The active compound may be applied as a sole therapy or may involve one or more other anti-tumour substances, for example those selected from, for example, mitotic inhibitors, for example vinblastine; alkylating agents, for example cis-platin, carboplatin and cyclophosphamide; anti-metabolites, for example 5-fluorouracil, cytosine arabinoside and hydroxyurea, or, for example, one of the preferred anti-metabolites disclosed in European Patent Application No. 239362 such as N-(5-[N-(3,4-dihydro-2-methyl-4-oxoquinazolin-6-ylmethyl)-N-methylamino]-2-thenoyl)-L-glutamic acid; growth factor inhibitors; cell cycle inhibitors; intercalating antibiotics, for example adriamycin and bleomycin; enzymes, for example interferon; and anti-hormones, for example anti-estrogens such as Nolvadex™ (tamoxifen) or, for example anti-androgens such as Casodex™ (4′-cyano-3-(4-fluorophenylsulphonyl)-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-3′-(trifluoromethyl)propionanilide). Such conjoint treatment may be achieved by way of the simultaneous, sequential or separate dosing of the individual components of the treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00067">The pharmaceutical composition may, for example, be in a form suitable for oral administration as a tablet, capsule, pill, powder, sustained release formulations, solution, suspension, for parenteral injection as a sterile solution, suspension or emulsion, for topical administration as an ointment or cream or for rectal administration as a suppository. The pharmaceutical composition may be in unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of precise dosages. The pharmaceutical composition will include a conventional pharmaceutical carrier or excipient and a compound according to the invention as an active ingredient. In addition, it may include other medicinal or pharmaceutical agents, carriers, adjuvants, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00068">Exemplary parenteral administration forms include solutions or suspensions of active compounds in sterile aqueous solutions, for example, aqueous propylene glycol or dextrose solutions. Such dosage forms can be suitably buffered, if desired.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00069">Suitable pharmaceutical carriers include inert diluents or fillers, water and various organic solvents. The pharmaceutical compositions may, if desired, contain additional ingredients such as flavorings, binders, excipients and the like. Thus for oral administration, tablets containing various excipients, such as citric acid may be employed together with various disintegrants such as starch, alginic acid and certain complex silicates and with binding agents such as sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often useful for tableting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed in soft and hard filled gelatin capsules. Preferred materials, therefore, include lactose or milk sugar and high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions or elixirs are desired for oral administration the active compound therein may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matters or dyes and, if desired, emulsifying agents or suspending agents, together with diluents such as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin, or combinations thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00070">Methods of preparing various pharmaceutical compositions with a specific amount of active compound are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art. For examples, see <i>Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences</i>, Mack Publishing Company, Easter, Pa., 15th Edition (1975).</div>
