<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">The present application is a national phase application under 35 U.S.C. Section 371 filed from International Patent Application PCT/SE01/00372, filed 20 Feb., 2001 which claims priority to United Kingdom patent application Serial. No. 0004152.5, filed 23 Feb., 2000. The contents of these applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</div>
<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates to novel phenylheteroalkyl amine derivatives, processes for their preparation, compositions containing them and their use in therapy.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Nitric oxide is produced in mammalian cells from L-arginine by the action of specific nitric oxide synthases (NOSs). These enzymes fall into two distinct classes—constitutive NOS (cNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS). At the present time, two constitutive NOSs and one inducible NOS have been identified. Of the constitutive NOSs, an endothelial enzyme (ecNOS) is involved with smooth muscle relaxation and the regulation of blood pressure and blood flow, whereas the neuronal enzyme (ncNOS) serves as a neurotransmitter and appears to be involved in the regulation of various biological functions such as cerebral ischaemia. Inducible NOS has been particularly implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. Regulation of these enzymes should therefore offer considerable potential in the treatment of a wide variety of disease states (J. E. Macdonald, <i>Ann. Rep. Med. Chem., </i>1996, 31, 221-230).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Considerable effort has been expended in efforts to identify compounds that act as specific inhibitors of one or more isoforms of the enzyme nitric oxide synthase. The use of such compounds in therapy has also been widely claimed.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">In process (a), the reactants (II) and (III) are coupled together in a suitable inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran using, for example, Mitsunobu conditions. Thus, for example, the reactants are treated with a phosphine derivative and an azo derivative at a suitable temperature, generally between 0° C. and the boiling point of the solvent. Suitable phosphine derivatives include triphenylphosphine and tributylphosphine. Suitable azo derivatives include diethyl azodicarboxylate, diisopropyl azodicarboxylate and 1,1′-(azodicarbonyl)dipiperidine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">In process (b), the reaction is performed by treating a nucleophile of formula (V) with an electrophile of formula (IV) in an inert solvent. Suitable leaving groups L<sup>1 </sup>include halides, particularly fluoride. The reaction is generally performed in the presence of a non-nucleophilic base such as sodium hydride. Suitable organic solvents are those such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, tetrahydrofuran and dimethylsulfoxide. The reaction is generally conducted at a temperature between 0° C. and the boiling point of the solvent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">Alternatively, in process (b), the reaction will take place using an appropriate palladium source such as palladium (II) acetate in the presence of a suitable phosphine ligand such as BINAP.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">In process (c), the amination reaction is performed by reacting a compound of formula (VI) with an amine (VII) in an inert solvent. Suitable leaving groups L<sup>2 </sup>include sulfonate, trifluorosulfonate, tosylate and halides selected from the group chloride, bromide or iodide. The nucleophile can be a primary or secondary amine in the presence of a base. This base can be either an excess of the amine nucleophile or can be an additive to the reaction mixture. Potential basic additives are metal carbonate, especially alkali metal carbonates, metal oxides and hydroxides, and tertiary amine bases. Suitable organic solvents are those such as acetonitrile, dioxane, N,N-dimethylformamide, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylsulfoxide, sulfolane and C1 to 4 alcohols.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">In process (d), the reaction is performed by treating a nucleophile of formula (II) with an electrophile of formula (VIII) in an inert solvent. Suitable leaving groups L<sup>3 </sup>include halides, particularly chloride or bromide. The reaction is generally performed in the presence of a non-nucleophilic base such as sodium hydride. Suitable organic solvents are those such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, tetrahydrofuran and dimethylsulfoxide. The reaction is generally conducted at a temperature between 0° C. and the boiling point of the solvent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">In process (e), G preferably represents an azido (N<sub>3</sub>) group. The required reduction may then be achieved by treating a compound of formula (IX) with a suitable reducing agent such as Sn(II) or triphenylphosphine. Preferably the reducing agent is triphenylphosphine and the reduction is carried out in a suitable inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">It will be apparent to a person skilled in the art that in the above processes it may be desirable or necessary to protect an amine, hydroxyl or other potentially reactive group. Suitable protecting groups and details of processes for adding and removing such groups may be found by reference to the standard text “Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis”, 2nd Edition (1991) by Greene and Wuts. In one preferred embodiment, amine groups are protected as carbamate derivatives, for example, as t-butyloxycarbamates. Thus, compounds of formula (I) in which R<sup>1 </sup>is H are conveniently prepared by removal of a carbamate protecting group from a corresponding compound of formula (I) wherein R<sup>1 </sup>is a carbamate group, especially a t-butyloxycarbamate group. Removal of the carbamate group is conveniently effected using hydrogen chloride in dioxan.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">The present invention includes compounds of formula (I) in the form of salts, in particular acid addition salts. Suitable salts include those formed with both organic and inorganic acids. Such acid addition salts will normally be pharmaceutically acceptable although salts of non-pharmaceutically acceptable acids may be of utility in the preparation and purification of the compound in question. Thus, preferred salts include those formed from hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric, phosphoric, citric, tartaric, lactic, pyruvic, acetic, succinic, fumaric, maleic, methanesulphonic and benzenesulphonic acids.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">Salts of compounds of formula (I) may be formed by reacting the free base, or a salt, enantiomer or racemate thereof, with one or more equivalents of the appropriate acid. The reaction may be carried out in a solvent or medium in which the salt is insoluble or in a solvent in which the salt is soluble, for example, water, dioxane, ethanol, tetrahydrofuran or diethyl ether, or a mixture of solvents, which may be removed in vacuo or by freeze drying. The reaction may also be a metathetical process or it may be carried out on an ion exchange resin.</div>
