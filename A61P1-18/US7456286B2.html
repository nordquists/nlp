<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This invention relates to a series of 5-6 fused ring bicyclic heteroaromatic derivatives, to compositions containing them, to processes for their preparation and to their use in medicine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">Immune and inflammatory responses involve a variety of cell types with control and co-ordination of the various interactions occurring via both cell-cell contacts (e.g. integrin interactions with their receptors) and by way of intercellular signalling molecules. A large number of different signalling molecules are involved including cytokines, lymphocytes, chemokines and growth factors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Cells respond to such intercellular signalling molecules by means of intracellular signalling mechanisms that include protein kinases, phosphatases and phospholipases. There are five classes of protein kinase of which the major ones are the tyrosine kinases and the serine/threonine kinases [Hunter, T., <i>Methods in Enzymology </i>(<i>Protein Kinase Classification</i>), p. 3, Hunter, T. and Sefton, B. M. eds., vol. 200, Academic Press, San Diego, 1991].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">One sub-class of serine/threonine kinases is the mitogen activating protein (MAP) kinases of which there are at least three families which differ in the sequence and size of the activation loop [Adams, J. L. et al., <i>Progress in Medicinal Chemistry, pp. </i>1-60, King, F. D. and Oxford, A. W. eds., vol. 38, Elsevier Science, 2001]: the extracellular regulated kinases (ERKs); the c-Jun NH<sub>2 </sub>terminal kinases or stress activated kinases (JNKs or SAP kinases); and the p38 kinases, which have a threonine-glycine-tyrosine (TGY) activation motif. Both the JNKs and p38 MAP kinases are primarily activated by stress stimuli including, but not limited to, proinflammatory cytokines, e.g. tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1), ultraviolet light, endotoxin and chemical or osmotic shock.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Four isoforms of p38 have been described (p38α/β/γ/δ). The human p38α enzyme was initially identified as a target of cytokine-suppressive anti-inflammatory drugs (CSAIDs) and the two isoenzymes found were initially termed CSAID binding protein-1 and -2 (CSBP-1 and CSBP-2 respectively) [Lee, J. C. et al., <i>Nature </i>(<i>London</i>), 1994, 372, 739-46]. CSBP-2 is now widely referred to as p38α and differs from CSBP-1 in an internal sequence of 25 amino acids as a result of differential splicing of two exons that are conserved in both mouse and human [McDonnell, P. C. et al., <i>Genomics, </i>1995, 29, 301-2]. CSBP-1 and p38α are expressed ubiquitously and there is no difference between the two isoforms with respect to tissue distribution, activation profile, substrate preference or CSAID binding. A second isoform is p380 which has 70% identity with p38α. A second form of p380 termed p38β2 is also known and of the two this is believed to be the major form p38α and p38β2 are expressed in many different tissues. However, in monocytes and macrophages p38α is the predominant kinase activity [Lee, J. C., ibid; Jing, Y. et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem., </i>1996, 271, 10531-34; Hale, K. K. et al., <i>J. Immun., </i>1999, 162, 4246-52]. p38γ and p38δ (also termed SAP kinase-3 and SAP kinase-4 respectively) have ˜63% and ˜61% homology to p38α respectively. p38γ is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle whilst p38δ is found in testes, pancreas, prostate, small intestine and in certain endocrine tissues.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">All p38 homologues and splice variants contain a 12 amino acid activation loop that includes a Thr-Gly-Tyr motif. Dual phosphorylation of both Thr-180 and Tyr-182 in the TGY motif by a dual specificity upstream kinase is essential for the activation of p38 and results in a &gt;1000-fold increase in specific activity of these enzymes [Doza, Y. N. et al., <i>FEBS Lett., </i>1995, 364, 7095-8012]. This dual phosphorylation is effected by MKK6 and, under certain conditions, the related enzyme MKK3 [Enslen, H. et al., <i>J. Biol. Chem., </i>1998, 273, 1741-48]. MKK3 and MKK6 belong to a family of enzymes termed MAPKK (mitogen activating protein kinase kinase) which are in turn activated by MAPKKK (mitogen activating kinase kinase kinase) otherwise known as MAP3K.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">Several MAP3Ks have been identified that are activated by a wide variety of stimuli including environmental stress, inflammatory cytokines and other factors. MEKK4/MTK1 (MAP or ERK kinase kinase/MAP three kinase-1), ASK1 (apoptosis stimulated kinase) and TAK1 (TGF-β-activated kinase) are some of the enzymes identified as upstream activators of MAPKKs. MEKK4/MTK1 is thought to be activated by several GADD-45-like genes that are induced in response to environmental stimuli and which eventually lead to p38 activation [Takekawa, M. and Saito, H., <i>Cell, </i>1998, 95, 521-30]. TAK1 has been shown to activate MKK6 in response to transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). NF-stimulated activation of p38 is believed to be mediated by the recruitment of TRAF2 (TNF receptor associated factor) and the Fas adaptor protein, Daxx, which results in the activation of ASK1 and subsequently p38.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">Several substrates of p38 have been identified including other kinases [e.g. MAPK activated protein kinase 2/3/5 (MAPKAP 2/3/5), p38 regulated/activated protein kinase (PRAK), MAP kinase-interacting kinase 1/2 (MNK1/2), mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1/RLPK) and ribosomal S6 kinase-B (RSK-B)], transcription factors [e.g. activating transcription factor 2/6 (ATF2/6), monocyte-enhancer factor-2A/C (MEF2A/C), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), Elk1 and Sap-1a1] and other substrates [e.g. cPLA2, p47phox].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">MAPKAP K2 is activated by p38 in response to environmental stress. Mice engineered to lack MAPKAP K2 do not produce TNF in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Production of several other cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, IFN-g and IL-10 is also partially inhibited [Kotlyarov, A. et al., <i>Nature Cell Biol., </i>1999, 1, 94-7]. Further, MAPKAP K2 from embryonic stem cells from p38α null mice was not activated in response to stress and these cells did not produce IL-6 in response to IL-1 [Allen, M. et al., <i>J. Exp. Med., </i>2000, 191, 859-69]. These results indicate that MAPKAP K2 is not only essential for TNF and IL-1 production but also for signalling induced by cytokines. In addition, MAPKAP K2/3 phosphorylate and thus regulate heat shock proteins HSP 25 and HSP 27 which are involved in cytoskeletal reorganization.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">Several small molecule inhibitors of p38 have been reported which inhibit IL-1 and TNF synthesis in human monocytes at concentrations in the low μM range [Lee, J. C. et al., <i>Int. J. Immunopharm., </i>1988, 10, 835] and exhibit activity in animal models which are refractory to cyclooxygenase inhibitors [Lee, J. C. et al., <i>Annals N.Y. Acad. Sci., </i>1993, 696, 149]. In addition, these small molecule inhibitors are known to decrease the synthesis of a wide variety of pro-inflammatory proteins including IL-6, IL-8, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). TNF-induced phosphorylation and activation of cytosolic PLA2, TNF-induced expression of VCAM-1 on endothelial cells and IL-1 stimulated synthesis of collagenase and stromelysin are also inhibited by such small molecule inhibitors of p38 [Cohen, P., <i>Trends Cell Biol., </i>1997, 7, 353-61].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">A variety of cells including monocytes and macrophages produce TNF and IL-1. Excessive or unregulated TNF production is implicated in a number of disease states including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, pyresis, rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, osteoarthritis, gouty arthritis and other arthritic conditions, toxic shock syndrome, endotoxic shock, sepsis, septic shock, gram negative sepsis, bone resorption diseases, reperfusion injury, graft vs. host reaction, allograft rejection, adult respiratory distress syndrome, chronic pulmonary inflammatory disease, silicosis, pulmonary sarcoidosis, cerebral malaria, scar tissue formation, keloid formation, fever and myalgias due to infection, such as influenza, cachexia secondary to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), cachexia secondary to infection or malignancy, AIDS or AIDS related complex.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">Excessive or unregulated IL-1 production has been implicated in rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, traumatic arthritis, rubella arthritis, acute synovitis, psoriatic arthritis, cachexia, Reiter's syndrome, endotoxemia, toxic shock syndrome, tuberculosis, atherosclerosis, muscle degeneration, and other acute or chronic inflammatory diseases such as the inflammatory reaction induced by endotoxin or inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, IL-1 has been linked to diabetes and pancreatic β cells [Dinarello, C. A., <i>J. Clinical Immunology, </i>1985, 5, 287-97].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">IL-8 is a chemotactic factor produced by various cell types including endothelial cells, mononuclear cells, fibroblasts and keratinocytes. IL-1, TNF and LPS all induce the production of IL-8 by endothelial cells. In vitro IL-8 has been shown to have a number of functions including being a chemoattractant for neutrophils, T-lymphocytes and basophils. IL-8 has also been shown to increase the surface expression of Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) on neutrophils without de novo protein synthesis, which may contribute to increased adhesion of neutrophils to vascular endothelial cells. Many diseases are characterised by massive neutrophil infiltration. Histamine release from basophils (in both atopic and normal individuals) is induced by IL-8 as is lysozomal enzyme release and respiratory burst from neutrophils.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">The central role of IL-1 and TNF together with other leukocyte-derived cytokines as important and critical inflammatory mediators is well documented. The inhibition of these cytokines has been shown or would be expected to be of benefit in controlling, alleviating or reducing many of these disease states.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">The central position that p38 occupies within the cascade of signalling molecules mediating extracellular to intracellular signalling, and its influence over not only IL-1, TNF and IL-8 production but also the synthesis and/or action of other pro-inflammatory proteins (e.g. IL-6, GM-CSF, COX-2, collagenase and stromelysin), make it an attractive target for inhibition by small molecule inhibitors with the expectation that such inhibition would be a highly effective mechanism for regulating the excessive and destructive activation of the immune system. Such an expectation is supported by the potent and diverse anti-inflammatory activities described for p38 kinase inhibitors [Adams, ibid; Badger et al., <i>J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., </i>1996, 279, 1453-61; Griswold et al., <i>Pharmacol. Commun., </i>1996, 7, 323-29].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">Certain N,N′-dibenzylated 2-purinones have been described (Andresen et al., <i>Tetrahedron, </i>52, 12979-12992).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">The present invention provides a class of compounds which are potent and selective inhibitors of p38 kinase, especially p38α, p38β and p38β2, and splice variants thereof. The compounds in accordance with the present invention are thus of use in medicine, for example in the prophylaxis and treatment of immune or inflammatory disorders.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">In addition, the compounds according to the present invention may be used as pharmacological standards for use in the development of new biological tests and in the search for new pharmacological agents. Thus, the compounds according to this invention may be useful as radioligands in assays for detecting compounds capable of binding to the human p38 enzyme.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0126">Viral diseases which may be prevented or treated include but are not limited to acute hepatitis infection (including hepatitis A, hepatitis B and hepatitis C), HIV infection and CMV retinitis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0127">Infectious diseases which may be prevented or treated include but are not limited to septic shock, sepsis and Shigellosis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0128">In addition, p38 inhibitors of this invention exhibit inhibition of expression of inducible pro-inflammatory proteins such as prostaglandin endoperoxidase synthetase-2, otherwise known as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and are therefore of use in therapy. Pro-inflammatory mediators of the cyclooxygenase pathway derived from arachidonic acid are produced by inducible COX-2 enzyme. Regulation of COX-2 would regulate these pro-inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins, which affect a wide variety of cells and are important and critical inflammatory mediators of a wide variety of disease states and conditions. In particular, these inflammatory mediators have been implicated in pain, such as in the sensitization of pain receptors, or edema. Accordingly, additional p38-mediated conditions which may be prevented or treated include edema, analgesia, fever and pain such as neuromuscular pain, headache, dental pain, arthritis pain and pain caused by cancer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0129">More particularly, as a result of their p38 inhibitory activity, compounds of the invention have utility in the prevention and treatment of diseases associated with cytokine production including but not limited to those diseases associated with TNF, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8 production.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0130">Thus, TNF-mediated diseases or conditions include for example rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, osteoarthritis, gouty arthritis and other arthritic conditions, sepsis, septic shock syndrome, adult respiratory distress syndrome, cerebral malaria, chronic pulmonary inflammatory disease, silicosis, pulmonary sarcoidosis, bone resportion disease, reperfusion injury, graft vs host reaction, allograft rejections, fever and myalgias due to infection, cachexia secondary to infection, AIDS, ARC or malignancy, keloid formation, scar tissue formation, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, pyresis, and viral infections such as HIV, CMV, influenza and herpes; veterinary viral infections such as lentivirus infections, including but not limited to equine infectious anemia virus, caprine arthritis virus, visna virus or maedi virus; and retrovirus infections, including feline immunodeficiency virus, bovine immunodeficiency virus and canine immunodeficiency virus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0131">Compounds of the invention may also be used in the treatment of viral infections, where such viruses elicit TNF production in vivo or are sensitive to upregulation by TNF. Such viruses include those that produce TNF as a result of infection and those that are sensitive to inhibition, for instance as a result of decreased replication, directly or indirectly by the TNF-inhibiting compounds of the invention. Such viruses include, but are not limited to, HIV-1, HIV-2 and HIV-3, Cytomegalovirus (CMV), influenza, adenovirus and the herpes group of viruses such as Herpes zoster and Herpes simplex.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0132">IL-1 mediated diseases or conditions include for example rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, traumatic arthritis, rubella arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, stroke, endotoxemia and/or toxic shock syndrome, inflammatory reaction induced by endotoxin, diabetes, pancreatic β-cell disease, Alzheimer's disease, tuberculosis, atherosclerosis, muscle degeneration and cachexia.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0133">IL-8 mediated diseases and conditions include for example those characterized by massive neutrophil infiltration such as psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, cardiac, brain and renal reperfusion injury, adult respiratory distress syndrome, thrombosis and glomerulonephritis. The increased IL-8 production associated with each of these diseases is responsible for the chemotaxis of neutrophils into inflammatory sites. This is due to the unique property of IL-8 (in comparison to TNF, IL-1 and IL-6) of promoting neutrophil chemotaxis and activation. Therefore, inhibition of IL-8 production would lead to a direct reduction in neutrophil infiltration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0134">It is also known that both IL-6 and IL-8 are produced during rhinovirus (HRV) infections and contribute to the pathogenesis of the common cold and exacerbation of asthma associated with HRV infection [Turner et al., <i>Clin. Infec. Dis., </i>1997, 26, 840; Grunberg et al., <i>Am. J. Crit. Care Med., </i>1997, 155, 1362; Zhu et al., <i>J. Clin. Invest., </i>1996, 97, 421]. It has also been demonstrated in vitro that infection of pulmonary epithelial cells (which represent the primary site of infection by HRV) with HRV results in production of IL-6 and IL-8 [Sabauste et al., <i>J. Clin. Invest., </i>1995, 96, 549]. Therefore, p38 inhibitors of the invention may be used for the treatment or prophylaxis of the common cold or respiratory viral infection caused by human rhinovirus infection (HRV), other enteroviruses, coronavirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus or adenovirus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0135">For the prophylaxis or treatment of a p38 or pro-inflammatory cytokine mediated disease the compounds according to the invention may be administered to a human or mammal as pharmaceutical compositions, and according to a further aspect of the invention we provide a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a compound of formula (1) together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients or diluents.</div>

The tablets may be coated by methods well known in the art. Liquid preparations for oral administration may take the form of, for example, solutions, syrups or suspensions, or they may be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents, emulsifying agents, non-aqueous vehicles or preservatives. The preparations may also contain buffer salts, flavouring agents, colouring agents or sweetening agents, as appropriate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0138">Preparations for oral administration may be suitably formulated to give controlled release of the active compound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0139">For buccal administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0140">The compounds of formula (1) may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g. by bolus injection or infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g. in glass ampoules or multi-dose containers, e.g. glass vials. The compositions for injection may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilising, preserving and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0141">In addition to the formulations described above, the compounds of formula (1) may also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long-acting formulations may be administered by implantation or by intramuscular injection.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0143">The compositions may, if desired, be presented in a pack or dispenser device which may contain one or more unit dosage forms containing the active ingredient. The pack or dispensing device may be accompanied by instructions for administration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0144">For topical administration the compounds according to the present invention may be conveniently formulated in a suitable ointment containing the active component suspended or dissolved in one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Particular carriers include, for example, mineral oil, liquid petroleum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene, polyoxypropylene, emulsifying wax and water.

Alternatively, for ophthalmic administration compounds may be formulated in an ointment such as petrolatum.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0146">For rectal administration the compounds according to the present invention may be conveniently formulated as suppositories. These can be prepared by mixing the active component with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at room temperature but liquid at rectal temperature and so will melt in the rectum to release the active component. Such materials include, for example, cocoa butter, beeswax and polyethylene glycols.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0147">The quantity of a compound of the invention required for the prophylaxis or treatment of a particular condition will vary depending on the compound chosen and the condition of the patient to be treated. In general, however, daily dosages may range from around 10 ng/kg to 1000 mg/kg, typically from 100 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg, e.g. around 0.01 mg/kg to 40 mg/kg body weight for oral or buccal administration, from around 10 ng/kg to 50 mg/kg body weight for parenteral administration, and from around 0.05 mg to around 1000 mg, e.g. from around 0.5 mg to around 1000 mg, for nasal administration or administration by inhalation or insufflation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0148">The compounds of the invention may be prepared by a number of processes as generally described below and more specifically in the Examples hereinafter. In the following process description, the symbols Ar, Cy<sup>1</sup>, Alk<sup>1</sup>, n, L<sup>1</sup>, L, R<sup>a</sup>, A, X and Y when used in the formulae depicted are to be understood to represent those groups described above in relation to formula (1) unless otherwise indicated. In the reactions described below, it may be necessary to protect reactive functional groups, for example hydroxy, amino, thio or carboxy groups, where these are desired in the final product, to avoid their unwanted participation in the reactions. Conventional protecting groups may be used in accordance with standard practice [see, for example, Greene, T. W. and Wuts, P. G. M., <i>Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis</i>, John Wiley and Sons, 3<sup>rd </sup>edition, 1999]. In some instances, deprotection may be the final step in the synthesis of a compound of formula (1) and the processes according to the invention described hereinafter are to be understood to extend to such removal of protecting groups.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0149">Thus, according to a further aspect of the invention, a compound of formula (1) in which Cy<sup>1 </sup>is as previously defined, but is other than an aromatic or heteroaromatic group when n is zero and L<sup>1 </sup>is a covalent bond, may be prepared by alkylation of a compound of formula (2):</div>

Alternatively the N-oxide may be treated with trifluoroacetic anhydride in N,N-dimethylformamide from 0° C. to ambient temperature to yield the desired intermediate [see, for example, Konno et al., <i>Heterocycles, </i>1986, 24, 2169].

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0156">Intermediates of formula (3) in which D is a protecting group can be advantageously used in the above reactions to generate a variety of compounds of the invention. Thus, for example, an intermediate of formula (3) in which D is a phenylsulphonyl group may be oxidised, converted to the corresponding pyridinone or pyrimidinone of formula (2), and then alkylated or arylated according to the reactions described above. At this point the phenylsulphonyl group can be removed, for example by treatment with a base such as sodium hydroxide in an alcohol such as methanol at ambient temperature. The resulting deprotected intermediate can then be reacted, in another process according to the invention, with a compound ArLZ (where Z is a leaving group as defined above) in the presence of a base and suitable solvent, as described above for the alkylation of intermediates of formula (2), to yield a desired compound of formula (1).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0157">Where in the general processes described above intermediates of formula (3), other intermediates such as alkylating agents of formula Cy<sup>1</sup>L<sup>1</sup>(Alk<sup>1</sup>)<sub>n</sub>Z, and any other intermediates required in the synthesis of compounds of the invention, are not available commercially or known in the literature, they may be readily obtained from simpler known compounds by one or more standard synthetic methods employing substitution, oxidation, reduction or cleavage reactions. Particular substitution approaches include conventional alkylation, arylation, heteroarylation, acylation, thioacylation, halogenation, sulphonylation, nitration, formylation and coupling procedures. It will be appreciated that these methods may also be used to obtain or modify other intermediates and in particular compounds of formula (1) where appropriate functional groups exist in these compounds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0158">Thus, for example, intermediates of formula (3) where D is a protecting group such as an arylsulphonyl group may be obtained from the corresponding 1H-compounds by reaction with a compound ArSO<sub>2</sub>Hal (where Hal is a halogen atom such as a chlorine atom) in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride in a solvent such as dimethylsulphoxide at ambient temperature. Similarly, compounds of the invention and intermediates thereto generally may be obtained by sulphonylation of a compound containing an —OH group by reaction with one of the above alkylating agents but in which Z is replaced by a —S(O)Hal or —SO<sub>2</sub>Hal group in the presence of a base, for example an inorganic base such as sodium hydride, in a solvent such as an amide, e.g. a substituted amide such as N,N-dimethylformamide, at, for example, ambient temperature.</div>

Thus, for example, a formyl group may be introduced by using N,N-dimethylformamide as the electrophile, a thiomethyl group may be introduced by using dimethyldisulphide as the electrophile, an alcohol group may be introduced by using an aldehyde as the electrophile, and an acid may be introduced by using carbon dioxide as the electrophile.

Acid- or base-catalysed hydrolysis may be achieved, for example, by treatment with an organic or inorganic acid, e.g. trifluoroacetic acid, in an organic solvent, e.g. dichloromethane, or a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid in a solvent such as 1,4-dioxane, or an alkali metal hydroxide, e.g. lithium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide, in an aqueous alcohol, e.g. aqueous methanol or aqueous ethanol.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0174">In another example, compounds containing a —NHCSR<sup>7 </sup>or —CSNHR<sup>7 </sup>group may be prepared by treating a corresponding compound containing a —NHCOR<sup>7 </sup>or —CONHR<sup>7 </sup>group with a thiation reagent, such as Lawesson's Reagent or P<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub>, in an anhydrous solvent, for example a cyclic ether such as tetrahydrofuran, at an elevated temperature such as the reflux temperature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0175">In a further example, amine (—NH<sub>2</sub>) groups may be alkylated using a reductive alkylation process employing an aldehyde and a reducing agent. Suitable reducing agents include borohydrides, for example sodium triacetoxyborohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride. The reduction may be carried out in a solvent such as a halogenated hydrocarbon, e.g. dichloromethane, a ketone such as acetone, or an alcohol, e.g. ethanol, where necessary in the presence of an acid such as acetic acid at around ambient temperature. Alternatively, the amine and aldehyde may be initially reacted in a solvent such as an aromatic hydrocarbon, e.g. toluene, and then subjected to hydrogenation in the presence of a metal catalyst, for example palladium on a support such as carbon, in a solvent such as an alcohol, e.g. ethanol.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0176">Amine (—NH<sub>2</sub>) groups in the compounds of the invention or intermediates thereto may generally be transformed into halogen atoms, e.g. bromo, by treatment with a nitrite reagent, e.g. tert-butyl nitrite, in the presence of a copper(II) halide, e.g. copper(II) bromide, typically in a solvent such as acetonitrile.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0183">Where it is desired to obtain a particular enantiomer of a compound of formula (1) this may be produced from a corresponding mixture of enantiomers using any suitable conventional procedure for resolving enantiomers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0184">Thus, for example, diastereomeric derivatives, e.g. salts, may be produced by reaction of a mixture of enantiomers of formula (1), e.g. a racemate, and an appropriate chiral compound, e.g. a chiral base. The diastereomers may then be separated by any convenient means, for example by crystallisation, and the desired enantiomer recovered, e.g. by treatment with an acid in the instance where the diastereomer is a salt.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0185">In another resolution process a racemate of formula (1) may be separated using chiral High Performance Liquid Chromatography. Alternatively, if desired, a particular enantiomer may be obtained by using an appropriate chiral intermediate in one of the processes described above. Alternatively, a particular enantiomer may be obtained by performing an enantiomer-specific enzymatic biotransformation, e.g. an ester hydrolysis using an esterase, and then purifying only the enantiomerically pure hydrolysed acid from the unreacted ester antipode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0186">Chromatography, recrystallisation and other conventional separation procedures may also be used with intermediates or final products where it is desired to obtain a particular geometric isomer of the invention.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0299">The inhibition of p38-catalysed phosphorylation of biotinylated MBP is measured using a DELFIA-based format. The assay was performed in a buffer comprising 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>and 3 mM DTT. For a typical IC<sub>50 </sub>determination, biotinylated MBP (2.5 μM) was incubated at room temperature in a streptavidin-coated microtitre plate together with activated gst-p38 (10 nM) and ATP (1 μM in the presence of a range of inhibitor concentrations (final concentration of DMSO is 2 percent). After fifteen minutes the reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA (75 mM). The microtitre plate was then washed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS), prior to the addition of 100 μl of anti-phospho MBP antibody (mouse) together with europium-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody. After one hour at room temperature the plate was again washed in TBS followed by the addition of Enhancement solution (PerkinElmer Wallac). Fluorescence measurements were performed after a further fifteen minutes at room temperature. IC<sub>50 </sub>values are determined from the plot of log<sub>10</sub>[inhibitor concentration] (x-axis) versus percentage inhibition of the fluorescence generated by a control sample in the absence of inhibitor (y-axis).</div>
