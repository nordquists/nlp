<heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">This application claims the benefit of priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/900,592 filed Feb. 9, 2007, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<heading>FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The present invention relates to a method of treating resistant or refractory cancers. In particular, the invention relates to a method of treating cancers resistant or refractory to camptothecin or CPT-11 using polyethylene glycol conjugates of 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Over the years, there have been reports that many common cancers have shown resistance or refractory phenomenon to curative therapies. Some cancers do not respond or respond initially but shortly thereafter, they become resistant to the therapies. Other cancers fail to respond to therapies which include subsequent rounds of treatment after earlier successful rounds of treatment. In other cases, cancers recur several years after completing effective treatment. If the resistance or refractory phenomenon to chemotherapy, radiation therapy or other cancer therapies could be prevented or overcome, it would be a great advance in medicine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Various anti-cancer agents have been developed in efforts to treat cancers. Many of those potential anti-cancer agents have unfortunately shown drug resistance through a variety of mechanisms. Some tumors do not respond to certain types of anti-cancer agents after initial short therapeutic responses are shown. In some cases, tumor shrinkage reverses and tumors start to grow again in spite of the cancer initially responding to anti-cancer agents.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">One potent anti-cancer agent is camptothecin. Camptothecin and related analogs are known as DNA topoisomerase I inhibitors. Irinotecan (CPT-11, Camptosar®) is a currently marketed DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor with some anticancer activity. Although not currently marketed, an active metabolite of CPT-11, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin, is thought to also have some anticancer activity. Like other anticancer agents, drug resistance has been observed with the use of camptothecin and camptothecin derivatives. For example, resistance to 9-amino or 9-nitro substituted camptothecins has been reported in common cancers. See U.S. Pat. No. 6,194,579.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">Various proposals have been made to overcome drug resistance or refractory phenomenon associated with anti-cancer agents. One early attempt to overcome the barrier associated with camptothecin or camptothecin analogs was directed to developing less toxic CPT derivatives. Other attempts include uses of potential drug resistance blockers such as an epidermal growth factor receptor antagonist and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase inhibitors. See US Patent Publication Nos. 2002/0012663 and 2006/0135468.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">In spite of the attempts and advances, there continues to be a need to provide a method of treating a resistant or refractory cancer. The present invention addresses this need.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">In order to overcome the above problems and improve the therapy for treatment of cancers, there is provided a method of treating a resistant or refractory cancer in a mammal.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">For purposes of the present invention, refractory or resistant cancers are defined as cancers that do not respond to previous anticancer therapy or treatment. In one preferred aspect, the cancers are refractory or resistant to CPT-11 treatment. The cancers can be resistant or refractory at the beginning of treatment, or they may become resistant or refractory during treatment. Refractory cancers include tumors that do not respond at the onset of treatment or respond initially for a short period but fail to respond to treatment. Refractory cancers also include tumors that respond to treatment with anticancer therapy but fail to respond to subsequent rounds of therapies. For purposes of this invention, refractory cancers also encompass tumors that appear to be inhibited by treatment with anticancer therapy but recur up to five years, sometimes up to ten years or longer after treatment is discontinued. The anticancer therapy can employ chemotherapeutic agents alone, radiation alone or combinations thereof. For ease of description and not limitation, it will be understood that the refractory cancers are interchangeable with resistant cancers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">For purposes of the present invention, successful treatment of a resistant or refractory cancer shall be understood to mean that resistant or refractory symptoms or conditions are prevented, minimized or attenuated during and/or after anticancer treatment, when compared to that observed in the absence of the treatment described herein. The minimized, attenuated or prevented refractory conditions can be confirmed by clinical markers contemplated by the artisan in the field. In one example, successful treatment of refractory or resistant cancer shall be deemed to occur when at least 5% or preferably 10%, more preferably 20% or higher (i.e., 30, 40, 50% or more) inhibition or decrease in tumor growth and/or recurrence including other clinical markers contemplated by the artisan in the field is realized when compared to that observed in the absence of the treatment described herein. Clinical markers which show changes in the severity and magnitude of the refractory cancers can be determined by clinicians. In some aspects, the resistant or refractory cancers can be one or more of the following: solid tumors, lymphomas, small cell lung cancer, acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, ovarian cancer, gastric cancers, etc. The methods are useful for, among other things, treating neoplastic disease, reducing tumor burden, preventing metastasis of neoplasms and preventing recurrences of tumor/neoplastic growths in mammals. In certain aspect, the resistant or refractory cancers are solid tumors or metastatic cancers. In one particular aspect, the resistant or refractory cancer is colorectal cancer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">The present invention provides methods of treating resistant or refractory cancers to chemotherapy. In one preferred aspect, the present invention provides methods of treating cancers which are resistant or refractory to camptothecin (CPT) or camptothecin analog therapy. Alternatively, the methods described herein can be effective to treat cancers resistant or refractory to CPT or CPT analog conjugated to polymers such as polyethylene glycol. In more preferred aspect, the present invention provides methods of treating cancers which are resistant or refractory to camptothecin or CPT-11 therapy.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0090">Without being bound by any theory, it is believed that the unexpected efficacy of the methods described herein in treatment of CPT-11 refractory tumors can be attributed, at least in part, to the favorable pharmacokinetic and biodistribution properties of the polymeric compounds described herein. The unexpected efficacy of the compounds described herein can also be based in part on a novel mechanism of action for the drug in vivo. It has been reported that topotecan, another TOP1 inhibitor, inhibits hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α, leading to marked decrease of angiogenesis and significant tumor growth inhibition. Consistent with this observation, it is believed that the inventive treatment induces a decrease in HIF-1α in cells, which then accumulate the compounds described herein due to an EPR effect in CPT-11 refractory (or sensitive) tumors. However, it is believed that CPT-11 fails to induce a decrease in HIF-1α in CPT-11 refractory tumors, leading to even more angiogenesis. In this aspect, treatment of highly vascular tumors can benefit from accumulation of the inventive compounds described herein due to enhanced EPR effects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0091">It has also been reported that CPT-11 resistant tumors may have lower levels of TOP1, since low levels of TOP1 have been linked to CPT-11 resistance in tissue culture. The polymeric ester derivatives of 7-ethyl-10-hyroxycamptothecin according to the therapy described herein can also provide higher exposure of 7-ethyl-10-hyroxycamptothecin to cells in vivo than CPT-11. Drug concentrations can be sufficient to kill cells even with low levels of TOP1. Alternatively, variable levels of carboxylesterase can be another contributing factor to CPT-11 resistance, and this enzyme is not required for release of 7-ethyl-10-hyroxycamptothecin from the polymeric ester derivatives of 7-ethyl-10-hyroxycamptothecin conjugates described herein.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0207">(v) is 0 or 1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0208">In some aspects of the present invention, the compounds include from 1 to about 10 units of the bifunctional linker. In some preferred aspects of the present invention, the compounds include one unit of the bifunctional linker and thus m is 1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0209">Additional linkers are found in Table 1 of Greenwald et al. (<i>Bioorganic </i>&amp; <i>Medicinal Chemistry, </i>1998, 6:551-562), the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0009">C. Synthesis of Prodrugs</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0210">Generally, the polymeric 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin prodrugs described herein are prepared by reacting one or more equivalents of an activated multi-arm polymer with, for example, one or more equivalents per active site of amino acid-(20)-7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin compound under conditions which are sufficient to effectively cause the amino group to undergo a reaction with the carboxylic acid of the polymer and form a linkage. Details of the synthesis are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/704,607 entitled “Multi-arm Polymeric Conjugates of 7-Ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin For Treatment of Breast, Colorectal, Pancreatic, Ovarian and Lung Cancers”, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. HPLC analysis of compounds made in accordance with the methods of synthesis showed that on average, four 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin molecules are conjugated to one four-arm PEG molecule (4% by weight).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0010">D. Compositions/Formulations</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0211">Pharmaceutical compositions containing the polymer conjugates of the present invention may be manufactured by processes well known in the art, e.g., using a variety of well-known mixing, dissolving, granulating, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping or lyophilizing processes. The compositions may be formulated in conjunction with one or more physiologically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries which facilitate processing of the active compounds into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically. Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen. Parenteral routes are preferred in many aspects of the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0212">For injection, including, without limitation, intravenous, intramusclular and subcutaneous injection, the compounds of the invention may be formulated in aqueous solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as physiological saline buffer or polar solvents including, without limitation, a pyrrolidone or dimethylsulfoxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0213">The compounds are preferably formulated for parenteral administration, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers. Useful compositions include, without limitation, suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain adjuncts such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of a water soluble form, such as, without limitation, a salt of the active compound. Additionally, suspensions of the active compounds may be prepared in a lipophilic vehicle. Suitable lipophilic vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, synthetic fatty acid esters such as ethyl oleate and triglycerides, or materials such as liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances that increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers and/or agents that increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile, pyrogen-free water, before use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0214">For oral administration, the compounds can be formulated by combining the active compounds with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well-known in the art. Such carriers enable the compounds of the invention to be formulated as tablets, pills, lozenges, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, pastes, slurries, solutions, suspensions, concentrated solutions and suspensions for diluting in the drinking water of a patient, premixes for dilution in the feed of a patient, and the like, for oral ingestion by a patient. Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be made using a solid excipient, optionally grinding the resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding other suitable auxiliaries if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Useful excipients are, in particular, fillers such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or sorbitol, cellulose preparations such as, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch and potato starch and other materials such as gelatin, gum tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose, sodium carboxy-methylcellulose, and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). If desired, disintegrating agents may be added, such as cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid. A salt such as sodium alginate may also be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0215">For administration by inhalation, the compounds of the present invention can conveniently be delivered in the form of an aerosol spray using a pressurized pack or a nebulizer and a suitable propellant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0216">The compounds may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, using, e.g., conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0217">In addition to the formulations described previously, the compounds may also be formulated as depot preparations. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example, subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. The compounds of this invention may be formulated for this route of administration with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for instance, in an emulsion with a pharmacologically acceptable oil), with ion exchange resins, or as a sparingly soluble derivative such as, without limitation, a sparingly soluble salt.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0218">Additionally, the compounds may be delivered using a sustained-release system, such as semi-permeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the therapeutic agent. Various sustained-release materials have been established and are well known by those skilled in the art. Sustained-release capsules may, depending on their chemical nature, release the compounds for a few weeks up to over 100 days. Depending on the chemical nature and the biological stability of the particular compound, additional stabilization strategies may be employed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0219">Other delivery systems such as liposomes and emulsions can also be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0011">E. Dosages</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0220">A therapeutically effective amount refers to an amount of compound effective to prevent, alleviate or ameliorate the resistance or refractory phenomenon to anti-cancer agents such as camptothecin or related analog, for example, CPT-11. Determination of a therapeutically effective amount is well within the capability of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the disclosure herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0221">For any compound used in the methods of the invention, the therapeutically effective amount can be estimated initially from in vitro assays. Then, the dosage can be formulated for use in animal models so as to achieve a circulating concentration range that includes the effective dosage. Such information can then be used to more accurately determine dosages useful in patients.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0222">The amount of the composition, e.g., used as a prodrug, that is administered will depend upon the parent molecule included therein. Generally, the amount of prodrug used in the treatment methods is that amount which effectively achieves the desired therapeutic result in mammals. Naturally, the dosages of the various prodrug compounds can vary somewhat depending upon the parent compound, rate of in vivo hydrolysis, molecular weight of the polymer, etc. In addition, the dosage, of course, can vary depending upon the dosage form and route of administration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0223">In general, however, the polymeric ester derivatives of 7-ethyl-10-hyroxycamptothecin described herein can be administered in amounts ranging from about 0.1 to about 30 mg/kg/dose and preferably about 0.2 to about 10 mg/kg/dose, yet preferably from about 0.6 to about 6 mg/kg/dose for systemic delivery.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0224">The range set forth above is illustrative and those skilled in the art will determine the optimal dosing of the prodrug selected based on clinical experience and the treatment indication. Moreover, the exact formulation, route of administration and dosage can be selected by the individual physician in view of the patient's condition. Additionally, toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the compounds described herein can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals using methods well-known in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0225">In one embodiment, the treatment of the present invention includes administering the compounds described herein in an amount of from about 0.3 to about 6 mg/kg/dose to a mammal having resistant or refractory cancers to such as CPT and CPT-11 therapies.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0226">Alternatively and preferably, the amounts of the compounds administered can be based on body surface of human or other mammals. Thus, the treatment of the present invention includes administering the compounds described herein in an amount of from about 0.1 to about 45 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>body surface/dose. Preferably, the amounts of the compounds described herein range from about 0.2 to about 25 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>body surface/dose. Some preferred doses include one of the following: 1.25, 2.0 2.5, 3.3, 5, 10, and 16.5 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/dose. Preferably, the amounts administered can range from about 1.25 to about 16.5 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>body surface/dose. Alternatively, they can be from about 2.5 to about 13 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>body surface/dose or from about 2 to about 5 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>body surface/dose.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0227">The treatment protocol can be based on a single dose administered once every three weeks or divided into multiple doses which are given as part of a multi-week treatment protocol. Thus, the treatment regimens can include one dose every three weeks for each treatment cycle and, alternatively one dose weekly for three weeks followed by one week off for each cycle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0228">The precise dose will depend on the stage and severity of the condition, and the individual characteristics of the patient being treated, as will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art. It is also contemplated that the treatment continues until satisfactory results are observed, which can be as soon as after 1 cycle although from about 3 to about 6 cycles or more cycles may be required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0229">In some preferred embodiments, the treatment protocol includes administering the amount ranging from about 1.25 to about 16.5 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>body surface/dose every three weeks repeating for about 3 cycles or more. The amount administered per each cycle can range more preferably from about 2.5 to about 16.5 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>body surface/dose. Alternatively, the compounds described herein can be administered weekly for three weeks, followed by one week without treatment and repeating for about 3 cycles or more until the desired results are observed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0230">In one particular embodiment, the polymeric ester derivatives of 7-ethyl-10-hyroxycamptothecin can be administered one dose such as 10 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>every three weeks in treatment of colon cancer. The dosage of treatment cycle can be designed as an escalating dose regimen when two or more treatment cycles are applied. The polymeric drug is preferably administered via IV infusion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0231">In all aspects of the invention where polymeric conjugates are administered, the dosage amount mentioned is based on the amount of 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin rather than the amount of polymeric conjugate administered. It is contemplated that the treatment will be given for one or more cycles until the desired clinical result is obtained. The exact amount, frequency and period of administration of the compound of the present invention will vary, of course, depending upon the sex, age and medical condition of the patient as well as the severity of the disease as determined by the attending clinician.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0232">Still further aspects include combining the therapy described herein with other anticancer therapies for synergistic or additive benefit. In one particular embodiment, the compounds described herein can be administered in combination with Erbitux® (cetuximab). 400 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>Erbitux® plus the compounds described herein can be administered as an initial dose followed by 250 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>weekly until disease progresses. Details of Erbitux® dosage information are described in the package insert, the contents of which are incorporated herein.</div>

<heading>Therapeutic Efficacy of Four-arm PEG-Gly-(7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin) in Human Colorectal Tumor Xenografted Mice Refractory to CPT-11</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0234">Therapeutic efficacy of four-arm PET-Gly-(7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin) against a refractory human HT-29 colorectal tumor grown in nude mice was determined. Human HT-29 colorectal tumors were established in nude mice by subcutaneous injection of 1×10<sup>6 </sup>cells/mouse into a right auxiliary flank. When tumors reached an average volume of 100 mm<sup>3</sup>, mice were treated with CPT-11 (40 mg/kg/dose; q2d×4). Mice were monitored for tumor growth. On day 15, mice with tumors that did not respond to CPT-11 therapy (tumor volume ≧3× initial tumor volume at the start of CPT-11 therapy) were considered CPT-11 refractory. These mice were selected, randomized and divided into two groups. One group was treated with MTD of CPT-11 (40 mg/kg/dose; q2d×5) and the other group was treated with MTD of four-arm <sup>40K</sup>PEG-Gly-(7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin) (compound 9) (10 mg/kg/dose q2d×5) starting day 16. The drugs were administered intravenously via the tail vein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0235">The results are set forth in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Tumors continued to grow in the CPT-11 refractory mice further treated with CPT-11. On day 42, tumor volume increased by 255% compared to day 15. In the mice treated with four-arm. <sup>40K</sup>PEG-Gly-(7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin) (compound 9), tumor volume decreased by 25% compared to day 15 on day 42. 29% and 100% of animals treated with CPT-11 were sacrificed by day 42 and 54 respectively due to excessive tumor burden (&gt;1,650 mm<sup>3</sup>). In the group treated with four-arm <sup>40K</sup>PEG-Gly-(7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin), only 1 of 7 animals was sacrificed on day 63. 58% of the mice treated with four-arm <sup>40K</sup>PEG-Gly-(7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin) had tumors &lt;1,650 mm<sup>3 </sup>by day 72. The results show that four-arm <sup>40K</sup>PEG-Gly-(7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin) has therapeutic activity in the treatment of CPT-11 refractory cancer. The data in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> represent mean±standard deviation (n=7).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0236">Without being bound by any theory, the therapy using the compounds described herein unexpectedly avoids resistance associated with CPT-11 therapy. The therapy described herein provides ways to treat cancers more effectively by avoiding and reducing potential drug resistance. Patients and clinicians can benefit from unexpected lack of resistance to the compounds described herein as compared to CPT-11 based therapy in treatment of cancer.</div>

<heading>Therapeutic Efficacy of Four-arm PEG-Gly-(7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin) in Human Colorectal Tumor Xenografted Mice Refractory to CPT-11 in the Second Round Treatment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0237">Human HT-29 colorectal tumors were established in nude mice by subcutaneous injection of 1×10<sup>6 </sup>cells/mouse into a right auxiliary flank. When tumors reached an average volume of 100 mm<sup>3</sup>, mice were treated with CPT-11 (40 mg/kg/dose; q2d×4). Mice were monitored for tumor growth. On day 15, mice that responded to CPT-11 therapy (mice that had tumor volumes &lt;3× initial tumor volume at the start of CPT-11 therapy, i.e., mice considered CPT-sensitive) were selected, randomized and divided into two groups. One group was further treated with MTD of CPT-11 (40 mg/kg/dose; q2d×5) and the other group was treated with MTD of four-arm <sup>40K</sup>PEG-Gly-(7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin) (10 mg/kg/dose q2d×5) starting day 16. The drugs were administered intravenously via the tail vein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0238">The results are set forth in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. On day 54, in mice treated with CPT-11, tumor volume increased by 1298% compared to day 1. Mice treated with four-arm <sup>40K</sup>PEG-Gly-(7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin) had tumor volume moderately increased by 193%. Additionally, as of day 61, 60% animals were sacrificed in CPT-11 treated group due to excessive tumor burden. No deaths have been recorded in four-arm <sup>40K</sup>PEG-Gly-(7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin) (compound 9) treated group on day 61. The results show that four-arm <sup>40K</sup>PEG-Gly-(7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin) outperformed therapeutic activity of CPT-11 and is significantly effective for second round and subsequent round therapies in the treatment of CPT-11 refractory cancer.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0239">CPT-refractory cell line (CEM/C2) and the corresponding non-refractory parent cell line (CEM) were treated with PEG-Gly-(7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin), 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin, and CPT-11. The CEM/C2 and CEM were obtained from NCI. The CEM cell lines are acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines. The in vitro cytotoxicity of each drug was determined using a MTS assay. Briefly, cells were placed in 96-well plates (8×10<sup>4 </sup>per well) and then treated with serial dilutions of four-arm <sup>40K</sup>PEG-Gly-(7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin) (compound 9), CPT or free 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin for 2 days at 37° C. At the end of the incubation, MTS dye was added and incubated for 2 to 3 hours at 37° C. and formation of a colored product (formazan) was measured at 490 nm. The % viability at each drug concentration was calculated as [OD test samples−background]/[OD controls (no treatment)−background]. Sigmoidal dose response curves were generated by plotting Log (Drug) as a function of % viability (survival) and IC<sub>50 </sub>values were calculated using the GraphPad Prism software.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0240">The results are set forth in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>. The cytotoxicity (μM of each compound that results in an IC<sub>50</sub>) shows the in vitro anti-tumor potency of each compound. This study was used to determine the therapeutic effect of four-arm PEG-Gly-(7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin) in CPT-refractory cancer. The four-arm PEG-Gly-(7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin) was about 10 fold more potent than CPT-11 in the acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line refractory to CPT as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In addition, all four-arm PEG-Gly-(7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin), CPT-11 and 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin showed similar potency in the parent cell line (CEM) as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The results show that four-arm PEG-Gly-(7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin) has potency for treating cancers resistant to topoisomerase I inhibitors such as CPT.</div>
