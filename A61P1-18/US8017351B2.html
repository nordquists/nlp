<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">In a specific embodiment, the enzyme(s) are low-allergenic variants, designed to invoke a reduced immunological response when exposed to animals, including man. The term immunological response is to be understood as any reaction by the immune system of an animal exposed to the enzyme(s). One type of immunological response is an allergic response leading to increased levels of IgE in the exposed animal. Low-allergenic variants may be prepared using techniques known in the art. For example the enzyme(s) may be conjugated with polymer moieties shielding portions or epitopes of the enzyme(s) involved in an immunological response. Conjugation with polymers may involve in vitro chemical coupling of polymer to the enzyme(s), e.g. as described in WO 96/17929, WO 98/30682, WO 98/35026, and/or WO 99/00489. Conjugation may in addition or alternatively thereto involve in vivo coupling of polymers to the enzyme(s). Such conjugation may be achieved by genetic engineering of the nucleotide sequence encoding the enzyme(s), inserting consensus sequences encoding additional glycosylation sites in the enzyme(s) and expressing the enzyme(s) in a host capable of glycosylating the enzyme(s), see e.g. WO 00/26354. Another way of providing low-allergenic variants is genetic engineering of the nucleotide sequence encoding the enzyme(s) so as to cause the enzymes to self-oligomerize, effecting that enzyme monomers may shield the epitopes of other enzyme monomers and thereby lowering the antigenicity of the oligomers. Such products and their preparation is described e.g. in WO 96/16177. Epitopes involved in an immunological response may be identified by various methods such as the phage display method described in WO 00/26230 and WO 01/83559, or the random approach described in EP 561907. Once an epitope has been identified, its amino acid sequence may be altered to produce altered immunological properties of the enzyme(s) by known gene manipulation techniques such as site directed mutagenesis (see e.g. WO 00/26230, WO 00/26354 and/or WO 00/22103) and/or conjugation of a polymer may be done in sufficient proximity to the epitope for the polymer to shield the epitope.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0078">Accordingly, the percentage of identity of Sequence 1 to Sequence 2 is 6/12=0.5, corresponding to 50%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0079">In a particular embodiment, the percentage of identity of an amino acid sequence of a polypeptide with, or to, amino acids 1-481 of SEQ ID NO: 1 is determined by i) aligning the two amino acid sequences using the Needle program, with the BLOSUM62 substitution matrix, a gap opening penalty of 10, and a gap extension penalty of 0.5; ii) counting the number of exact matches in the alignment; iii) dividing the number of exact matches by the length of the shortest of the two amino acid sequences, and iv) converting the result of the division of iii) into percentage. The percentage of identity to, or with, other sequences of the invention such as amino acids 1-481 of SEQ ID NO: 2, or 1-483 of SEQ ID NO: 3, is calculated in an analogous way.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0080">In the alternative, the degree of identity between two amino acid sequences may be determined by the program âalignâ which is a Needleman-Wunsch alignment (i.e. a global alignment).

The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is described in Needleman, S. B. and Wunsch, C. D., (1970), Journal of Molecular Biology, 48: 443-453, and the align program by Myers and W. Miller in âOptimal Alignments in Linear Spaceâ CABIOS (computer applications in the biosciences) (1988) 4:11-17. âAlignâ is part of the FASTA package version v20u6 (see W. R. Pearson and D.

The common length of the two aligned sequences is also determined, viz. the total number of amino acids in the alignment (the overlap), including trailing and leading gaps created by the alignment, if any (âN-overlapâ). The degree of identity is calculated as the ratio between âN-perfect-matchâ and âN-overlapâ (for conversion to percentage identity, multiply by 100).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0120">Preferred pharmaceutical compositions of the lipase of the invention are described in WO 2005/092370, in particular formulations comprising the preferred excipients mentioned therein. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition comprises a macrogolglyceride mixture of mono-, di- and tri-acylglycerides and polyethylene glycol (PEG) mono- and di-esters of aliphatic C6-C22 carboxylic acids, and also possibly small proportions of glycerol and free polyethylene glycol.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0121">The polyethylene glycol (PEG) contained in the macrogolglyceride mixtures is preferably PEG which has on average 6 to at most 40 ethylene oxide units per molecule or a molecular weight of between 200 and 2000.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0122">One further aspect of the invention provides for the pharmaceutical composition of the enzyme(s) of the invention to comprise a system consisting of surfactant, co-surfactant and lipophilic phase, the system having an HLB value (Hydrophilic-Lipophilic Balance) greater than or equal to 10 and a melting point greater than or equal to 30Â° C. In a preferred embodiment, the system has an HLB value of 10 to 16, preferably of 12 to 15, and has a melting point of between 30 and 600Â° C., preferably between 40 and 500Â° C.

The HLB value of such a system is preferably regulated by the chain length of the PEG. The melting point of such a system is regulated by the chain length of the fatty acids, the chain length of the PEG and the degree of saturation of the fatty-acid chains, and hence the starting oil for the preparation of the macrogolglyceride mixture.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0011">Methods of Treatment</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0129">The amylase of the invention, optionally in combination with a lipase, and/or a protease (the enzyme(s) of the invention), is useful in the therapeutic, and/or prophylactic, treatment of various diseases or disorders in animals. The term âanimalâ includes all animals, and in particular human beings. Examples of animals are non-ruminants, and ruminants, such as sheep, goat, and cattle, e.g. beef cattle, and cow. In a particular embodiment, the animal is a non-ruminant animal. Non-ruminant animals include mono-gastric animals, e.g. pig (including, but not limited to, piglets, growing pigs, and sows); poultry such as turkey, duck and chicken (including but not limited to broiler chicks, layers); young calves; pets such as cat, and dog; and fish (including but not limited to salmon, trout, tilapia, catfish and carps); and crustaceans (including but not limited to shrimps and prawns). In a particular embodiment the animal is a mammal, more in particular a human being.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0130">For example, the enzyme(s) are useful in the treatment of digestive disorders like maldigestion or dyspepsia that are often caused by a deficient production and/or secretion into the gastrointestinal tract of digestive enzymes normally secreted from, i.a., the stomach, and the pancreas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0131">Further, the enzyme(s) are particularly useful in the treatment of PEI. PEI can be verified using, i.a., the BorgstrÃ¶m test (JOP. J Pancreas (Online) 2002; 3(5):116-125), and it may be caused by diseases and conditions such as pancreatic cancer, pancreatic and/or gastric surgery, e.g. total or partial resection of the pancreas, gastrectomy, post gastrointestinal bypass surgery (e.g. Billroth II gastroenterostomy); chronic pancreatitis; Shwachman Diamond Syndrome; ductal obstruction of the pancreas or common bile duct (e.g. from neoplasm); and/or cystic fibrosis (an inherited disease in which a thick mucus blocks the ducts of the pancreas). The enzyme(s) may also be useful in the treatment of acute pancreatitis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0132">The effect of the enzyme(s) on digestive disorders can be measured as generally described in EP 0600868, in which Example 2 describes an in vitro digestibility test for measuring lipase stability test under gastric conditions, and Example 3 an in vitro digestibility test for lipase activity in the presence of bile salts. Corresponding tests can be set up for the protease and amylase. Also WO 02/060474 discloses suitable tests, for example (1) an in vitro test for measuring lipid digestion in a swine test feed, and (2) an in vivo trial with pancreas insufficient swine in which the digestibility of fat, protein and starch is measured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0133">In a particular embodiment, the effect of the amylase of the invention is measured using the in vivo screening test for amylase efficacy of Example 2.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0134">As another example, the enzyme(s) are useful in the treatment of Diabetes mellitus type I, and/or type II, in particular for adjuvant treatment in a diabetes therapy of digestive disorders usually accompanying this disease, with a view to diminishing late complications.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0135">The effect on Diabetes mellitus of the enzyme(s) may be determined by one or more of the methods described in WO 00/54799, for example by controlling the level of glycosylated haemoglobin, the blood glucose level, hypoglycaemic attacks, the status of fat-soluble vitamins like vitamins A, D and E, the required daily dosage of insulin, the body-weight index, and hyper glycaemic periods.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0139">The amylolytic activity of pancreatin was analyzed according to the method published in the European Pharmacopoeia 5.1 against the pancreatin standard supplied by the FIP. For determination of the amylolytic activity of the amylases for use according to the invention, the assay for amylolytic activity of microbial amylases described by the FIP was modified. In principle, starch is hydrolysed by amylase at pH 5.8 and at constant temperature (37.0+/â0.1Â° C.) in the presence of sodium chloride and calcium chloride. The reducing groups resulting from the hydrolysis react with iodine in alkaline solution and the excess of iodine are titrated with thiosulphate. One unit of amylase is defined as the amount of enzyme, which, under the defined conditions and substrate, hydrolyzes 1 micromol of glycosidic bond per minute.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0140">Substrate solution: The substrate is soluble starch (e.g. Merck, No. 101252). The water content of each batch of soluble starch is determined upon opening of the container. To a quantity of soluble starch equivalent to 10.0 g of the dry substrate, add 50 mL of pure (filtration/ion-exchange) water and mix. Add this suspension, whilst stirring continuously, to 800 mL of boiling pure water. Rinse the container several times with successive quantities, each of 10 mL, of pure water and add the washing water to the hot starch solution. Heat to boiling under continuous stirring.

<heading>In vivo Screening Test for Amylase Efficacy</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0168">The purified <i>Bacillus </i>amylases of amino acids 1-486 of SEQ ID NO: 1, amino acids 1-481 of SEQ ID NO: 2 and amino acids 1-483 of SEQ ID NO: 3 were tested in female GÃ¶ttingen minipigs (Ellegaard), together with a purified fungal amylase derived from <i>Aspergillus oryzae</i>, being below 50% identical to any one of SEQ ID NOs: 1-3. Pancreatic Exocrine Insufficiency (PEI) was induced in the minipigs by ligation of the pancreatic duct, and they were also fitted with an ileo-caecal re-entrant cannula, all under halothane anaesthesia and at a weight of about 25 kg, as described in Tabeling et al., J. 1999, Studies on nutrient digestibilities (pre-caecal and total) in pancreatic duct-ligated pigs and the effects of enzyme substitution, J. Anim. Physiol. A. Anim. Nutr. 82: 251-263 (hereinafter referred to as âTabeling 1999â); and in Gregory et al., J. 1999. Growth and digestion in pancreatic duct ligated pigs, Effect of enzyme supplementation in âBiology of the Pancreas in Growing Animalsâ (SG Pierzynowski &amp; R. Zabielski eds), Elsevier Science BV, Amsterdam, pp 381-393 (hereinafter referred to as âGregory et al 1999â). A period of at least 4 weeks was allowed for recovery from surgery, before studies were commenced. Prior to study begin, the PEI status of each pig was confirmed via the stool chymotrypsin test (commercially available from Immundiagnostik AG, Wiesenstrasse 4, D-64625 Bensheim, Germany, with catalogue No. K 6990).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0169">During the studies, the pigs were housed in modified metabolism cages on a 12:12 h light-dark cycle and allowed free access to water and fed two meals/day. The test meal, containing 15.4% protein, 69% starch, and 2.1% fat, had the following composition in g/100 g dry matter: Poultry meat meal 7.1; fishmeal 2.45; casein 4.1; wheat flour 20.65; shelled rice 9.8; potato starch 7.7; maize starch 39.8; cellulose powder 3.0; vitamins 5.3 (as per the nutritional requirements). The pigs were fed 250 g of this test meal mixed with 1 litre water, 0.625 g Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>and into which differing amounts of amylases (0, 7500, 18750, 90000 FIP U amylase/meal, see Example 1) were mixed immediately before feeding.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0170">Ileal chyme, collected for a total of 6 h after first appearance of the meal marker in the ileum (green chyme) was frozen at â20Â° C. immediately after collection, to avoid any bacterial fermentation of the samples. At least one day washout was allowed between separate determinations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0171">The frozen samples were freeze-dried, milled and analysed for dry matter (DM) and starch. DM was estimated by weight after freeze-drying followed by 8 h incubation at 103Â° C.; starch was analysed polarimetrically after acid hydrolysis and sugar was estimated gravimetrically. Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>was oxidized to chromate and chromium content was calculated via extinction at 365 nm (spectrophotometer), as described by Petry and Rapp in Zeitung fÃ¼r Tierphysiologie (1970), vol. 27, p. 181-189.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0172">Digestibility: Calculation of apparent pre-caecal starch digestibility was made according to the formula, in which Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>and starch were expressed as g/100 g dry matter:</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0176">From the results in Table 1 it is apparent that the amylases of the invention perform much better than the known <i>Aspergillus oryzae </i>amylase and better than known pancreatin preparations. The amylases of the invention caused a strong and dose dependent improvement on starch digestibility, already showing a highly efficient improvement at the lowest dosage tested.</div>

<heading>Amylase pH Profiles, with and without Bile Salts</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0177">For use in the treatment of PEI and related diseases it is preferable for pancreatic replacement enzymes to have a high activity around pH 6-7 (typical conditions of the upper small intestines). This experiment serves to determine the pH profiles of four alpha-amylases, three bacterial amylases of the invention and a prior art fungal <i>Aspergillus oryzae </i>amylase, with and without added bile salts.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0181">The amylase activity was detected by reducing sugar assay. Briefly, 50 Î¼l enzyme (diluted in enzyme buffer so as to fall within the linear range of the assay) was mixed with 100 Î¼l substrate buffer in PCR-MTP (Thermo-FastÂ® 96, ABgene, cat. no. AB-0600). The MTP's were incubated at 37Â° C. for 15 min, following which 75 Î¼l stop solution (100 mM p-hydroxybenzoic acid hydrazide, 180 mM K-Na-tartrate, 2% NaOH) was added, and the plates were incubated at 95Â° C. for 10 min.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0191">These results show that although bile salts seem to slightly reduce the amylase activity, the activity in the presence of 5 mM bile salts is still satisfactory. The results also show that bile salts do not lead to a shift of the pH optimum.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0192">The results furthermore show that each of the <i>Bacillus </i>amylases of the invention all have more than 50% relative activity at pH 7, which is not the case for the comparative fungal amylase.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0193">Finally, Tables 4 and 5 demonstrate that, at least under these conditions, the amylase having amino acids 1-486 of SEQ ID NO: 1 has a significantly higher activity per mg enzyme than all the other amylases tested.</div>

<heading>Amylase Degradation Profile</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0194">The degradation profile (DP1-10 qualitative fingerprint) of five alpha-amylases was determined by degradation of waxy maize starch followed by analysis on HPLC.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0032">Materials and Methods</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0195">The enzymes were purified Bacillus amylases of amino acids 1-486 of SEQ ID NO: 1 (âSEQ 1â), amino acids 1-481 of SEQ ID NO: 2 (âSEQ 2â) and amino acids 1-483 of SEQ ID NO: 3 (âSEQ 3â), and, for comparison, a purified fungal amylase derived from <i>Aspergillus oryzae </i>(â<i>A. oryzae</i>â), the amylase of the commercial Fungamylâ¢ amylase product, which is available from Novozymes A/S, Krogshoejvej 36, DK-2880 Bagsvaerd, Denmark. Pancreatin was from Solvay Pharmaceuticals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0196">As substrate a slurry of 50 mg/mL waxy maize starch (e.g. Waxy corn 04201 from Cerestar, Batch: WM5671) was made in 50 mM Na-acetate buffer pH 6.0, 40 ppm Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0197">Purified enzymes were dosed at a concentration of 0.0073 mg enzyme protein per g of dry substance of the reaction mixture. The amount of amylase enzyme protein was calculated on the basis of the A<sub>280 </sub>values and the amino acid sequences (amino acid compositions) using the principles outlined in S. C. Gill &amp; P. H. von Hippel, Analytical Biochemistry 182, 319-326, (1989). After dosing the enzyme, the reaction was incubated at 60Â° C. Aliquots were withdrawn after 24 hours and diluted 1:1 in demineralized water and two drops of 1 M HCl was added. The enzymes were inactivated by boiling for 15 min. The samples were filtered through a 0.2 Î¼m filter prior to application on the HPLC fitted with two Aminex HPX 42A (Biorad) columns connected in series and using water as eluent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0198">100 mg of pancreatin was dissolved in 10 mL 50 mM Na-acetate buffer pH 5.5. 20 ul of this solution was added to 1 mL substrate slurry (50 mg/mL waxy corn starch in 50 mM Na-acetate pH 5.5) and incubated at 37Â° C. for 24 hours, and then inactivated and filtered as described above prior to application on the HPLC.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0199">In a separate experiment (not shown), the âSEQ 1â amylase was also tested at 37Â° C. which gave rise to the same degradation profile as at 60Â° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0033">Results</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0200">The resulting chromatograms after 24 hours of incubation are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> together with indications as to which compound is represented by which peak in the chromatogram. For the sake of clarity, these indications have been inserted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> only, but they apply mutatis mutandis to each of the other figures as well. The designation DP stands for Degree of Polymerization. Thus, DP1 designates the monomer, DP2 the dimer, DP3 the trimer, DP4 the tetramer, DP5 the pentamer, DP6 the hexamer, and so forth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0201">It appears from the figures, that the fungal alpha-amylase (â<i>A. oryzae</i>â) generates DP2, DP3 and DP4 as the main degradation products, whereas it leaves a large fraction non-hydrolysed (large peak at retention time 10 minutes). DP1 was not detected as a degradation product.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0202">The bacterial alpha-amylases on the other hand (âSEQ 1â, âSEQ 2â, âSEQ 3â) in general produce DP1, DP2, DP3 and either of DP5 or DP6 as main products, leaving only a small part of non-hydrolysed substrate. Generally, a low amount of DP4 appears to be produced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0203">As far as Pancreatin is concerned, it appears to behave like a mixture of the fungal and bacterial amylases described above, i.e. generating small DP products (DP1, DP2 and DP3), almost nothing of DP4, DP5 and DP6, and only leaving a small non-hydrolysed substrate peak.</div>

<heading>Pharmaceutical Amylase Compositions</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0036">(A) High-strength Pellets</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0204">A liquid concentrate was prepared as described in DK 2005 00931 (a germ-filtered ultrafiltrate) of the amylase having amino acids 1-486 of SEQ ID NO: 1. The liquid concentrate was spray-dried. The measured amylase protein content of the spray-dried amylase powder was 37%. 1125 g of the spray-dried amylase powder was dry pre-mixed together with microcrystalline cellulose (450 g) and polyethylene glycol 4000 (Macrogolâ¢ 4000; 675 g) in a commercially available mixer. Isopropyl alcohol 100% (460 g) was added and the resulting wet mass was continued to be thoroughly mixed at room temperature. The homogenized mass was then extruded in a commercially available extruder which was fitted with a piercing die having a hole diameter of 0.8 mm to form cylindrical pellets. The bead temperature was not exceeding 50Â° C. while extruding. The extrudate produced was rounded to spherical pellets with a commercially available spheronizer by adding the necessary amount of isopropyl alcohol 100% (75.5 g). The pellets were dried at a supply temperature of approximately 40Â° C. in a commercially available vacuum dryer (from Voetsch). The product temperature did not exceed 45Â° C. The dried pellets were then separated by using a mechanical sieving machine with 0.7 and 1.4 mm screens. The sieve fractions of â§0.7 mm and â¦1.4 mm were collected and can be filled in portions of 200 mg pellets each in capsules of size 2. The amylase concentration of the resulting dry pellets was approximately 18.5% (w/w).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0037">(B) Lower-strength Pellets</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0205">Similar to the example provided above (A), pellets with a lower content of amylase were produced using 562.5 g of the same spray-dried amylase powder, microcrystalline cellulose (1125 g), polyethylene glycol 4000 (562.5 g), isopropyl alcohol for moistening (700 g) and isopropyl alcohol for rounding (41.6 g). The amylase concentration of the resulting dry pellets was approximately 9.3% (w/w).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0206">The resulting pellets from examples (A) and (B) were tested for amylolytic activity by applying a modified FIP method for microbial amylases. In principle, starch is hydrolysed by amylase at pH 5.8 and at a constant temperature (37.0+/â0.1Â° C.) in the presence of sodium chloride and calcium chloride. The reducing groups resulting from the hydrolysis react with iodine in alkaline solution and the excess of iodine was titrated with thiosulphate. One unit of amylase is defined as the amount of enzyme, which, under the defined conditions and substrate, hydrolyzes 1 micromol of glycosidic bond per minute. The amylolytic activity in the pellets was found to be approximately 96% relative to the amylolytic activity in the starting powdery amylase material for each of the examples (A) and (B).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0207">The resulting pellets from examples (A) and (B) were then tested for disintegration according to Pharm. Eur. 2.9.1. (Section âDisintegration of tablets and capsulesâ) (test solution: waterâ500 mL, 37Â° C.). The disintegration of the pellets from example (A) was completed within 15 min. The disintegration of the pellets from example (B) was completed within 9 min.</div>

<heading>Pharmaceutical Compositions of Amylase and Protease</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0208">High-strength pellets containing amylase and protease were prepared as follows:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0209">A germ-filtered liquid concentrate of the protease of amino acids 1-274 of SEQ ID NO: 5 was prepared as described in Example 1 of DK patent application no. 2005 00930 and spray-dried. Spray-dried amylase in powder form (398.5 g) prepared as described in Example 5 was dry pre-mixed together with the spray-dried protease powder (746.5 g, having a measured protease protein content of 58.5%), microcrystalline cellulose (458 g) and polyethylene glycol 4000 (Macrogolâ¢ 4000; 687 g) in a commercially available mixer. Isopropyl alcohol 100% (460 g) was added and the resulting wet mass was continued to be thoroughly mixed at room temperature. The homogenized mass was then extruded in a commercially available extruder which was fitted with a piercing die having a hole diameter of 0.8 mm to form cylindrical pellets. The bead temperature was not exceeding 50Â° C. while extruding. The extrudate produced was rounded to spherical pellets with a commercially available spheronizer by adding the necessary amount of isopropyl alcohol 100% (58 g). The pellets were dried using a supply temperature of approximately 40Â° C. in a commercially available vacuum dryer (from Voetsch). The product temperature did not exceed 45Â° C. The dried pellets were then separated by using a mechanical sieving machine with 0.7 and 1.4 mm screens. The sieve fractions of â§0.7 mm and â¦1.4 mm were collected and can be filled in portions of 200 mg each in capsules of size 2.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0210">The resulting pellets from were tested for proteolytic and amylolytic activities according to the methods as outlined above. No loss in proteolytic or amylolytic activity was found in the pellets in each case relative to the starting powdery protease or amylase material, respectively.</div>
