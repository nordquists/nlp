The reaction mixture was diluted with chloroform, washed successively with 5% aqueous potassium hydrogensulfate solution and saturated brine, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (5 mL), and added to a mixture of hydroxylammonium chloride (0.54 g), sodium hydrogencarbonate (0.78 g) and dimethyl sulfoxide (10 mL), which had been stirred at 40° C. for 30 min in advance. The reaction mixture was stirred at 90° C. for 16 hr, diluted with chloroform, washed successively with water and saturated brine, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography and dissolved in methylene chloride (30 mL). N,N′-Carbonyldiimidazole (0.15 g) and then 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (0.13 mL) were added, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 hr. The reaction mixture was diluted with chloroform, washed successively with saturated aqueous potassium hydrogensulfate solution and saturated brine, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. To the obtained residue were added 20% sulfuric acid (2 mL) and ethanol (10 ml). The mixture was stirred at 100° C. for 1 hr, and extracted with chloroform and water. The chloroform layer was washed with saturated brine, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography to give the title compound as colorless crystals (0.33 g, 53%).</div>

The reaction mixture was diluted with chloroform, washed successively with 5% aqueous potassium hydrogensulfate solution and saturated brine, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue obtained by silica gel column chromatography was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (10 mL), and the mixture was added to a mixture of hydroxylammonium chloride (4.3 g), sodium hydrogencarbonate (5.1 g) and dimethyl sulfoxide (30 mL), which had been stirred at 40° C. for 30 min in advance. The reaction mixture was stirred at 90° C. for 16 hr, diluted with chloroform, washed successively with water and saturated brine, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography, dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (30 mL), N,N′-carbonyldiimidazole (1.2 g) and then 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (1.1 mL) were added, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 hr. The reaction mixture was diluted with chloroform, washed successively with saturated aqueous potassium hydrogensulfate solution and saturated brine, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-1666">Namely, to a cuvette having a 0.4 cm gap were added 8×10<sup>6 </sup>cells and 10 μg of plasmid pVgRXR2-hPPARγ obtained in Reference Example 4 and 10 μg of reporter plasmid pGL3-4ERPP-TKneo obtained in Reference Example 3, which was subjected to electroporation at the voltage of 0.25 kV under the capacitance of 960 μF. Subsequently, the cell was transferred into a F12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and cultured for 24 hours, and then the cell was scraped again and centrifuged, and then suspended in Ham's F12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 500 μg/ml of Geneticin [manufactured by INVITROGEN, USA] and 250 μg/ml of Zeocin [manufactured by INVITROGEN, USA]. The obtained suspension was diluted to the density of 10<sup>4 </sup>cells/ml and inoculated in a 96-well plate [manufactured by Corning Costar Corporation, USA], which was cultured in a CO<sub>2 </sub>gas incubator at 37° C., whereby obtaining a Geneticin- and Zeocin-resistant transformant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-1667">Subsequently, after the transformant strain thus obtained was cultured in a 24-well plate [manufactured by Corning Costar Corporation, USA], a strain in which the expression of luciferase was induced, i.e., PPARγ:RXRα:4ERPP/CHO-K1 cell was selected by the addition of 10 μM pioglitazone hydrochloride.</div>
