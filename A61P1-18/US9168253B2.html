<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to pharmaceutical field and, in particular, to certain quinazoline compounds, a composition containing said compounds and the use thereof. These quinazoline compounds can effectively inhibit the overexpression and/or overactivity of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).</div>
<heading id="h-0002">TECHNICAL BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) can activate tyrosine kinase activity and thereby may trigger reactions that lead to cellular proliferation. Over-expression and/or over-activity of EGFR may result in uncontrolled cell division which may be a predisposition for cancer. Compounds that can inhibit the over-expression and/or over-activity of EGFR are therefore potential candidates for treating cancer.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0016">As used in the present specification, the following words, phrases and symbols are generally intended to have the meanings as set forth below, except to the extent that the context in which they are used indicates otherwise. The following abbreviations and terms have the indicated meanings throughout:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0017">Compounds described herein include, but are not limited to, their optical isomers, racemates, and other mixtures thereof. In those situations, the single enantiomers or diastereomers, i.e., optically active forms, can be obtained by asymmetric synthesis or by resolution of the racemates or mixtures of diastereomers. Resolution of the racemates or mixtures of diastereomers can be accomplished, for example, by conventional methods such as crystallization in the presence of a resolving agent, or chromatography, using, for example a chiral high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) column.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0018">Where compounds described herein exist in various tautomeric forms, the term “compound” is intended to include all tautomeric forms of the compound. Such compounds also include crystal forms including polymorphs and clathrates. Similarly, the term “salt” is intended to include all isomers, racemates, other mixtures, Z- and E-forms, tautomeric forms and crystal forms of the salt of the compound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0019">“Pharmaceutically acceptable salts” include, but are not limited to salts with inorganic acids, such as hydrochlorate, phosphate, diphosphate, hydrobromate, sulfate, sulfinate, nitrate, and like salts; as well as salts with an organic acid, such as malate, maleate, fumarate, tartrate, succinate, citrate, acetate, lactate, methanesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, 2-hydroxyethylsulfonate, benzoate, salicylate, stearate, and alkanoate such as acetate, HOOC—(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>—COOH where n is 0-4, and like salts. Similarly, pharmaceutically acceptable cations include, but are not limited to sodium, potassium, calcium, aluminum, lithium, and ammonium.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0020">In addition, if a compound described herein is obtained as an acid addition salt, the free base can be obtained by basifying a solution of the acid salt. Conversely, if the product is a free base, an addition salt, particularly a pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt, may be produced by dissolving the free base in a suitable organic solvent and treating the solution with an acid, in accordance with conventional procedures for preparing acid addition salts from base compounds. Those skilled in the art will recognize various synthetic methodologies that may be used to prepare non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0021">A “solvate,” such as a “hydrate,” is formed by the interaction of a solvent and a compound. The term “compound” is intended to include solvates, including hydrates, of compounds. Similarly, “salts” includes solvates, such as hydrates, of salts. Suitable solvates are pharmaceutically acceptable solvates, such as hydrates, including monohydrates and hemi-hydrates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0022">A “chelate” is formed by the coordination of a compound to a metal ion at two (or more) points. The term “compound” is intended to include chelates of compounds. Similarly, “salts” includes chelates of salts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0023">A “non-covalent complex” is formed by the interaction of a compound and another molecule wherein a covalent bond is not formed between the compound and the molecule. For example, complexation can occur through van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic interactions (also called ionic bonding). Such non-covalent complexes are included in the term “compound’.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0024">The term “active agent” is used to indicate a chemical substance which has biological activity. In some embodiments, an “active agent” is a chemical substance having pharmaceutical utility.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0025">“Treating” or “treatment” or “alleviation” refers to administering at least one compound and/or at least one pharmaceutically acceptable salt described herein to a subject that has a disease or disorder, or has a symptom of a disease or disorder, or has a predisposition toward the disease or disorder, with the purpose to alleviate, relieve, alter, remedy, ameliorate, improve, or affect the disease or disorder, the symptoms of the disease or disorder, or the predisposition toward the disease or disorder. The disease or disorder can be, for example, cancer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0026">The term “inhibition” indicates a decrease in the baseline activity of a biological activity or process. “Inhibition of overexpression and/or overactivity of epidermal growth factor receptor,” refers to a decrease in the expression and/or activity of EGFR as a direct or indirect response to the presence of at least one compound and/or at least one pharmaceutically acceptable salt described herein, relative to the activity of EGFR in the absence of the at least one compound and/or the at least one pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The decrease in activity may be due to the direct interaction of the at least one compound and/or at least one pharmaceutically acceptable salt described herein with EGFR, or due to the interaction of the at least one compound and/or at least one pharmaceutically acceptable salt described herein, with one or more other factors that in turn affect EGFR activity. For example, the presence of at least one compound and/or at least one pharmaceutically acceptable salt described herein, may decrease EGFR activity by directly binding to the EGFR, by causing (directly or indirectly) another factor to decrease EGFR activity, or by (directly or indirectly) decreasing the amount of EGFR present in the cell or organism.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0027">The term “effective amount” refers to an amount of at least one compound and/or at least one pharmaceutically acceptable salt described herein effective to “treat” a disease or disorder in a subject. In the case of cancer, the effective amount may cause any of the changes observable or measurable in a subject as described in the definition of “treating,” “treatment” and “alleviation” above. For example, the effective amount can reduce the number of cancer or tumor cells; reduce the tumor size; inhibit or stop tumor cell infiltration into peripheral organs including, for example, the spread of tumor into soft tissue and bone; inhibit and stop tumor metastasis; inhibit and stop tumor growth; relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer, reduce morbidity and mortality; improve quality of life; or a combination of such effects. An effective amount may be an amount sufficient to decrease the symptoms of a disease responsive to inhibition of overexpression and/or overactivity of epidermal growth factor receptor. For cancer therapy, efficacy in vivo can, for example, be measured by assessing the duration of survival, time to disease progression (TTP), the response rates (RR), duration of response, and/or quality of life. Effective amounts may vary, as recognized by those skilled in the art, depending on route of administration, excipient usage, and co-usage with other agents.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0028">The term “effective amount” may also refer to an amount of at least one compound and/or at least one pharmaceutically acceptable salt described herein effective to inhibit overexpression and/or overactivity of epidermal growth factor receptor.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0125">1. Materials and Methods:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0126">Human tumor cell lines: Fadu (human head and neck, pharynx carcinoma, HTB-43), HCC827 (human non small cell lung cancer, NSCLC; CRL-2868), A431 (human epidermoid carcinoma, CRL-2592) cell lines were purchased from ATCC; Fadu, HCC827 and A431 cells were grown in EMEM, RPMI 1640 and DMEM medium plus 10% FBS respectively. These cells were incubated in a humidifier incubator at 37° C. and under 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0127">Animals: Athymic mice (6-8 weeks) were purchased from Shanghai SLAC laboratory animal CO. LTD. The animals were housed in the SPF environment, 4 animals/cage under standard conditions (12:12 h light/dark, 40-50% relative humidity at 20-25° C.) and were given free access to Co<sup>60 </sup>radiated-sterile diet and sterile water.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0128">Agents: Test compounds were formulated in sterile 0.5% CMC-Na at different concentrations (0.05˜1.0 mg/mL), and then stored at 4° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0129">Subcutaneous implantation of tumor cells and anti-tumor efficacy study: The tumor cells were incubated at 37° C. in a 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator until they reached approximately 80% confluence. Cells were detached by 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA, centrifuged at 800 rpm, and the cells were suspended in serum free medium. The concentration was adjusted for nude mice implantation. The nude mice were quarantined for several days before implantation, and 3×10<sup>6 </sup>FaDu or A431 cells in 0.1 mL medium, or 5×10<sup>6 </sup>HCC827 cells in the 0.2 mL medium were subcutaneously injected to the right lateral flank of nude mice.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0130">One to three weeks after inoculation, when average tumor volume reached 100-300 mm<sup>3</sup>, the animals were randomized and divided into vehicle and compound treated groups. The mice were orally administrated with either the vehicle, 0.5% CMC-Na, or the test compounds at different dose levels once a day. The dosing volume was 10 mL/kg body weight (dosing regimen was shown in Table 1 and Table 2). Tumor volume was measured 2-3 times per week by caliper for length and width, and was calculated using the formula: Tumor volume (TV, mm<sup>3</sup>)=width<sup>2</sup>×length/2. Animal body weight and behavior were observed during the experiment. Tumor growth inhibition was calculated as follows: TGI (%)=100−(T−T<sub>0</sub>)/(C−C<sub>0</sub>)×100%, where T represents mean tumor volume of a treated group on a specific day during the experiment, T<sub>0 </sub>represents mean tumor volume of the same treated group on the first day of treatment, C represents mean tumor volume of a control group on the specific day during the experiment, and C<sub>0 </sub>represents mean tumor volume of the same control group on the first day of treatment.</div>

3. Recording System
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0147">Whole-cell recordings were performed using a EPC10 USB(HEKA). The cells were voltage clamped at a holding potential of −80 mV. The hERG current was activated by depolarizing at +20 mV for 2 sec, after which the current was taken back to −50 mV for 2 sec to remove the inactivation and observe the deactivating tail current. The first step at −50 mV was used as a baseline for measuring the tail current peak amplitude.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0026" num="0000">4. Compound Handing and Dilutions</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0148">Compounds were prepared as a 10 mM DMSO stock in a glass vial. The stock solution was mixed vigorously for 10 minute at room temperature. For testing, the compound was diluted in a glass vial using solution; the dilution was prepared no longer than 30 minutes before use. Equal amounts of DMSO (0.1%) were present at final dilution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0027" num="0000">5. Electrophysiology Procedures</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0149">After achieving whole-cell configuration, the cells were monitored for 90 sec to assess stability and washed with external solution for 66 sec. The voltage protocol described above was then applied to the cells every 20 sec throughout the whole procedure. Only stable cells with recording parameters above threshold were allowed to enter the drug addition procedure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0150">External solution containing 0.1% DMSO (vehicle) was applied to the cells to establish the baseline. After allowing the current to stabilize for 3 minutes, compound was applied. Compound solution was added in 4 steps and the cells were kept in the test solution until the compound's effect reached a steady state or for a maximum of 6 min. Subsequently, the positive control (100 nM Cisapride) was added. Washout with external solution was performed until the recovery of the current reached a steady state.</div>
