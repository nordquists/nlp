<div class="abstract" id="p-0001" num="0000">The present invention relates to the novel use (anti-inflammatory activity) of Ramalin isolated from the Antarctic lichen <i>Ramalina terebrata</i>, and more specifically to a pharmaceutical composition containing Ramalin as an active ingredient. Ramalin of the invention is a compound derived from natural material, has no toxicity or side effects, and inhibits the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the transcription stage to significantly inhibit the production of nitric oxide (NO) that is a key mediator of inflammatory responses. In addition, it inhibits the activation of the inflammatory mediator NF-κB, inhibits p38 MAPK, ERK1/2 and JNK signaling pathways, and inhibits the expression of the LPS receptor TLR4, suggesting that Ramalin has an excellent anti-inflammatory effect. Thus, the composition containing Ramalin can be effectively used to fundamentally treat or prevent inflammatory diseases or immune diseases and to relieve or alleviate the symptoms of the diseases.</div>

<heading id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the novel use of Ramalin for treatment of inflammatory disease or immune disease. More specifically, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for preventing and treating inflammatory disease or immune disease, which contains Ramalin having anti-inflammatory activity or a salt thereof, and a method of preventing or treating inflammatory disease or immune disease using the composition.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Inflammatory responses are defensive responses which are caused by various factors such as infection with pathogens or injury of tissue in the body and perform initial protective action to limit damage to infected or injured areas. In most cases, such inflammatory responses lead to the removal of pathogenic factors and the induction of adaptive immunity by the components of innate immunity (Hawiger J., Innate Immunity and Inflammation: A Transcriptional Paradigm. Immunologic Research. 23, pp. 99-109, 2001). Rubors, tumors, calors, dolors and the like, known to be accompanied by inflammation, are the results of continuous inflammatory responses, such as an increase in local blood flow and a decrease in local blood flow rate, which result from vasodilation caused by the action of inflammatory mediators and cytokines in the area of inflammation, an increase in the release of plasma components from blood vessels, which results from an increase in the permeability of blood vessels, an increase in the release of immune cells from blood vessels, which results from the adhesion of blood vessel endothelial cells to circulating immune cells, and an increase in migration to an infected area by chemotaxis (Gallo R L, Murakami M, Takaaki O, Zaiou M., Biology and clinical relevance of naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides. J. Allergy. Clin. Immunol. 110, pp. 823-831. 2002; Graeme B. Ryan, M B, and Guido M., Acute Inflammation. American Journal of Pathology. 86(1), pp. 185-274, 1977). In addition, inflammation-related vasodilation and an increase in the permeability of blood vessels are also attributable to histamines which are produced in some cells in response to tissue injury, and low-molecular-weight peptide kinins which are present in an inactivated state in blood and activated by tissue injury (Yamaki K, Thorlacius H, Xie X, Lindbom L, Hedqvist P, Raud J., Characteristics of histamineinduced leukocyte rolling in the undisturbed microcirculation of the rat mesentry. British J. Pharmacol. 123, pp. 390-399, 1998; Brocklehurst W E, Role of Kinins and Prostaglandins in Inflammation. Proc. Roy. Soc. Med. 64, pp. 4-6, 1971).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Generally, an acute inflammatory response occurs rapidly, is maintained for a short time and is accompanied by a systemic response known as the acute-phase response. Meanwhile, chronic inflammation can result continuous immune activation in connection with some diseases such as infection or autoimmune diseases, and the accumulation and activation of macrophages is the hallmark of chronic inflammation (Huang A L, Vita J A, Effects of Systemic Inflammation on Endothelium-Dependent Vasodilation. <i>Trends, Cardiovasc. Med. </i>16, p. 1520, 2006). However, continuous chronic inflammatory responses can cause serious damage to host cells or tissue.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Inflammatory responses at the site of infection are initiated by the response of macrophages to pathogens. It is known that reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species (e.g., NO), which are produced by macrophages activated by pathogens, inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes, and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8, are involved in inflammatory responses (Renauld J C, New insights into the role of cytokines in asthma. <i>J. Clin. Pathol. </i>54, pp. 577-589, 2001; Blake G J, Ridker P M, Tumour necrosis factor-α, inflammatory biomarkers, and atherogenesis. <i>Eur. Heart J. </i>23, pp. 345347, 2002). The activation of NF-κB that is a transcriptional factor of genes related to the production of inflammatory mediators is very important in the inflammation-related action of macrophages. It was reported that inflammation-related genes, including inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS2), cyclooxygenase (COX-2), TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8 and the like, are transcribed by NF-κB in macrophages.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Nitric oxide (NO) is produced from L-arginine by nitric oxide synthase (hereinafter referred to as NOS) in the macrophages of the human body (Kerwin, J. F. et al., <i>J. Med. Chem., </i>38:4343, 1995). The NOS of the human body has three NOS isomers, including endothelial constitutive NOS (hereinafter referred to as ecNOS), neuronal constitutive NOS (hereinafter referred to as ncNOS) and inducible NOS (hereinafter referred to as iNOS). Among them, ecNOS and ncNOS are expressed in endothelial cells and neuronal cells, respectively, and dependent on calcium and calmodulin, whereas iNOS is highly expressed in various cells only when the cells are activated by lipopolysaccharide (hereinafter referred to as LPS) present in the cell membrane of pathogenic bacteria, cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-α, and immune stimulants such as radiation, and iNOS is not dependent on calcium and calmodulin. NO functions as a defense against tumor cells and pathogenic bacteria at high concentration, and a low concentration of NO produced in blood vessel endothelial cells functions to regulate blood pressure, and NO produced in neuronal cells performs various physiological responses related to neurotransmitter function, learning, memory and the like. Constitutive NOS (cNOS) plays an important role in maintaining the homeostasis of the human body, and NO produced by ecNOS acts in the blood vessel system to inhibit vasodilation and platelet adhesion or aggregation, and NO produced by ncNOS acts in the nerve system to increase long-term memory or acts as a neurotransmitter to cause melancholia and is involved in the mobility of the digestive tract or the erection of the penis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">On the other hand, NO produced by iNOS expression induced by specific cytokines or LPS is involved in inflammatory expression or host defense mechanisms. The transcriptional factor NF-κB is activated in macrophages by the stimulation of endotoxin to induce iNOS expression, thereby increasing the production of NO (Butler, A. R., <i>Chemistry </i>&amp; <i>Industry, </i>16:828, 1995). It is known that when the expression of iNOS is induced by external stimulation of LPS, inflammation inducers radiation or the like, a large amount of NO is produced continuously for 4-6 hours to cause inflammatory responses in the human body. In the case of rats, large amounts of iNOS mRNA and protein are expressed in macrophages by external stimulation, and NO synthesized by the expression performs antimicrobial action and antitumor action. However, it is known that when NO is produced in excessively large amounts, it causes inflammatory responses, such as arthritis and septicemia, tissue graft rejection, immune diseases such as autoimmune diseases and diabetes, and the death of neuronal cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, iNOS activity inhibitors have high potential as agents for treating such diseases, and from this viewpoint, compounds that inhibit NO production caused by iNOS can be used as agents for treating various inflammatory diseases in the human body. Studies on materials that inhibit the production of NO have been conducted mainly on the development of materials that specifically inhibit the enzymatic activity of iNOS. Specifically, studies have been conducted on the development of derivatives of the precursor L-arginine, derivatives of L-citrulline, derivatives of amino guanidine, derivatives of isothiourea, etc., (Babu, B. R. B. and Griffith O. W., <i>Current Opinion in Chemical Biology, </i>2:491, 1998).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">However, the regulation of expression of iNOS in the transcription stage in inflammatory responses is very important in determining the production of NO, and thus there is a need for the development of drugs related to the regulation of NF-κB activity by phosphorylation of IkB which is an inhibitor of the transcriptional factor NF-κB in macrophages, or drugs related to Akt, ERK, c-jun- and p38-MAPK signaling pathways which are related to the regulation of NF-κB activity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Lichens are similar to non-flowering plants and are the symbiotic association of fungi (mycobionts) with algae and/or cyanobacteria (photobionts). The fungi in lichens form thalli or lichen substrates containing typical secondary metabolites (Ahmadjin V., <i>The lichen symbiosis</i>, Wiley, New York, pp. 1-6, 1993). It is difficult to obtain sufficient amounts of natural lichen samples, and technology of cultivating large amounts of lichens is not known. For this reason, studies on lichens were relatively insufficient compared to studies on higher plants. As the tissue culture method, mass-production method and biological analysis method for lichens have been improved, studies thereon have been actively conducted (Behera, B. C. et al., <i>Lebensm. Wiss. Technol., </i>39:805, 2006). Compounds having various biological activities (including cytotoxicity, antifungal, antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities), including fatty acids, depsides, depsidones, dibenzofurans, diterpenes, anthraquinones, naphtoquinones, usninic acid, pulvinic acids, xanthones and epidithiopiperazinediones, were isolated from lichens (Muller, K., Appl. <i>Microbiol. Biotechnol., </i>56:9-16, 2001).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011"> <i>Ramalina terebrata </i>is a lichen that grows naturally in the Antarctic King George Island and can be easily collected from the King George Island. During studies on the Antarctic lichen <i>Ramalina terebrata</i>, the present inventors previously isolated the novel compound Ramalin having excellent antioxidant activity (Korean Patent Application No. 2008-111021). However, there has been no report that Ramalin has anti-inflammatory activity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, the present inventors have examined the cellular immunity inhibitory activity of Ramalin by conducting comparative experiments in vitro and in vivo in order to determine the effect of Ramalin on the LPS-induced production of NO in mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells, and as a result, have found that Ramalin has the effect of inhibiting inflammatory responses. More specifically, the present inventors have found that Ramalin of the present invention inhibited the mRNA expression of iNOS to significantly inhibit the production of NO, inhibited the activation of NF-κB, inhibited p38 MAPK, ERK1/2 and JNK signaling pathways, inhibited the expression of the LPS receptor TLR4, and showed excellent anti-inflammatory and immune regulatory effects in in vivo experiments, thereby completing the present invention.</div>

<heading id="h-0010">Example 1</heading>
<heading id="h-0011">Isolation of Ramalin</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">672 g of a freeze-dried and ground <i>Ramalina terebrata </i>sample was extracted three times with a mixture of methanol and water (5 L, 80:20 v/v) and freeze-dried, thereby obtaining 83 g of a crude extract. The crude extract was dissolved in 1 L of distilled water, and then extracted with 1 L of n-hexane and chloroform (CHCl<sub>3</sub>) to obtain 12.7 g of a n-hexane extract, 9.1 g of a chloroform extract (CHCl<sub>3</sub>) and 61.0 g of a water-soluble extract. The water-soluble extract showed highly activity (IC<sub>50</sub>=9 μg/ml) against DPPH free radicals. A portion (5 g) of the water-soluble extract was then subjected to automated mild pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC) using a stepwise gradient solvent system of 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% methanol in water. The fraction dissolved in 0% methanol-water mixture showed high activity (IC<sub>50</sub>=8 μg/ml) against DPPH free radicals, and a portion (100 mg) of this extract was subjected to semi-preparative reverse phase HPLC using a C<sub>18</sub>ODS column (250 cm×10 cm). The used gradient solvent system was 0% methanol in water (containing 0.1% formic acid) over 10 min, 20% methanol over 20 min, and 100% methanol over 30 min. The flow rate was 2 ml/min.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">Compounds were detected by UV absorption at 280 nm. The fifth fraction (45 mg; t<sub>R</sub>=18.88 min) was found to exhibit the highest activity (IC<sub>50</sub>=1 μg/ml) against DPPH free radicals and was therefore subjected to further purification by using repeated semi-preparative HPLC using a C<sub>18</sub>ODS column (250 cm×10 cm). The gradient solvent system was 10-30% acetonitrile in water (0.1% formic acid) over 50 min with a flow rate of 2 ml/min. As a result, 30 mg of Ramalin was obtained at 8.26 min and showed an activity of IC<sub>50</sub>=0.99 μg/mL against DPPH free radicals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">ESIMS (electrospray ionization mass spectrometry) data were obtained using a Mariner ESI-MS instrument (Perseptive Biosystem, USA). NMR spectra (1D and 2D) were recorded in acetone-d<sub>6 </sub>in addition to D<sub>2</sub>O using a JEOL JNM ECP-400 spectrometer (400 MHz for <sup>1</sup>H and 100 MHz for <sup>13</sup>C), and chemical shifts were referenced relative to the remaining acetone-d<sub>6 </sub>(d<sub>H</sub>/d<sub>C</sub>=2.22/21.0). HMQC and HMBC experiments were optimized for <sup>1</sup>J<sub>CH</sub>=140 Hz and <sup>n</sup>J<sub>CH</sub>=8 Hz. As a result, compound was found to have a structure of the following formula 1.</div>

<heading id="h-0013">Effect of Ramalin Treatment on the Production of Nitric Oxide in Macrophages Treated with LPS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">In order to examine the effect of pre-treatment with Ramalin on the LPS-induced production of NO, verification was performed using the mouse macrophage line RAQ 264.7 (ATCC, Rockville, Md., US). The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (GIBCO, Grand Island, N.Y., US) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μl/ml streptomycin and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS: Carlsband, US). The cell culture was performed under the conditions of 37° C., 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>and wet air, and the medium was replaced twice a week.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">The macrophages were cultured in a 96-well tissue culture dish at a concentration of 1×10<sup>5 </sup>cells/well, and treated with Ramalin for 2 hours in order to examine cytotoxicity. The cell viability was analyzed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay which measures the mitochondrial activity of viable cells. The reduction of MTT to formazan was quantified by measuring the optical density at 550 nm using a Molecular Device microplate reader (Sunnyvale, Calif., US).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">As a result, treatment with 0.1, 1 and 10 μg/ml of Ramalin had no cytotoxicity, and thus showed no change in cell viability. However, cytotoxicity appeared at a Ramalin concentration of 100 μg/ml (data not shown).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">In order to determine the accumulation of nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub> <sup>−</sup>), a test group pretreated with Ramalin and an untreated control group were prepared. Medium was pretreated with 0.1, 1 and 10 μg/ml of Ramalin 2 hours before treatment with 1 μg/ml of LPS. The amount of nitrogen dioxide accumulated in the medium was determined by transferring 100 μl of the supernatant from each well into an empty well dish, adding 100 μl of Griess solution (a 1:1 mixture of 0.1% naphthylethylene diamine dihydrochloride in distilled water and 1% sulfanilamide in 5% H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) thereto, and then measuring the absorbance at 550 nm using a Molecular Device microplate reader (Sunnyvale, Calif., US). The concentration of nitrogen dioxide can be calculated from a standard curve for nitrite (NaNO<sub>2</sub>). The level of nitrogen dioxide may be indicative of the amount of nitric oxide (NO).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">As a result, as can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> showing the concentration of nitrite, pre-treatment with 10 μg/ml of Ramalin resulted in a significant decrease in the production of nitric oxide.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">Statistical analysis was performed by measuring the mean±S.E.M. statistical difference between the groups using by one-way ANOVA with Fisher's PLSD.

<heading id="h-0015">Effect of Ramalin Treatment on the Production of iNOS in Macrophages Treated with LPS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">In order to examine the effect of pretreatment with Ramalin on the LPS-induced production of iNOS, the production of mRNA was analyzed by RT-PCR, and the production of protein was analyzed by Western blot. This is because a decrease in the production of NO is attributable to the inhibition of production of iNOS. For RT-PCR, cells were treated with LPS and Ramalin as described in Example 2, and then the total RNA of the cultured cells was collected using Trizol (Invitrogen, US). Then, the total RNA was amplified by Superscript one step RT-PCR using a PLATINUM Taq kit (Invitrogen, US). The PCR product was loaded onto 1.2% agarose gel which was then stained with EtBr. As a control, GAPDH was used. The PCR amplification was performed using the following primer sequences: for iNOS-F, 5′-AGA CTG GAT TTG GCT GGT CCC TCC-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 1); for iNOS-R, 5′-AGA ACT GAG GGT ACA TGC TGG AGC-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 2); for GAPDH-F, 5′-CCA TGG AGA AGG CTG GGG-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 3); for GAPDH-R, 5′-CAA AGT TGT CAT GGA TGA CC-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 4).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">As a result, as can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the expression of iNOS mRNA in the groups treated with various concentrations of Ramalin was lower than that in the group treated with the control. However, the inhibition of the expression of iNOS mRNA was concentration-dependent, and this inhibitory effect was significant compared to that of the control GADPH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">For Western blot analysis, cells were treated with LPS and Ramalin as described in Example 2, washed twice with PBS (phosphate buffered saline), and then lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP40, 100 μg/ml phenylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Then, the cell lysate was kept on ice for 30 minutes and centrifuged at 15000 g at 40° C. for 20 minutes, and the supernatant was collected. The density of protein was analyzed using a Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad Lab, Hercules, Calif.) and BSA (Sigma). The total lysate (20 μg) was resolved on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and it was transferred to an immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham, Arlington Heights, Ill.) and labeled with an antibody. The blot was analyzed using an enhanced chemoluminescence (ECL) kit (Amersham). All the antibody blot experiments were performed using anti-beta actin antibody as a protein loading control.</div>

<heading id="h-0017">Effect of Ramalin Pretreatment on TLR4 Macrophages Treated with LPS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">TLR4 (toll-like receptor 4) signaling is known to play a pivotal role in the induction of inflammatory responses, and LPS is a ligand that is recognized by TLR4. Thus, in order to analyze the effect of Ramalin pretreatment on the expression of TLR4, the level of surface expression of TLR4, the mRNA level of TLR4 and the level of TLR4 protein were measured. The analysis of TLR4 was performed in the following manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">Macrophage Raw264.7 cells were subcultured, and then seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 1-4×10<sup>4 </sup>cells/well and cultured. After 12 hours of culture, the cells were treated with 0.1, 1 and 10 μg/mL of Ramalin and incubated for 2 hours. The supernatant was removed from the cultured cells, which were then washed with d-PBS and treated with LPS (1 μg/mL). After 8 hours, the expression level of TLR4 on the cell surface was measured by an ELISA assay. After the supernatant has been removed, the cells were washed twice with d-PBS and incubated in 200 mL of blocking buffer (1% FBS in d-PBS) at room temperature for 30 minutes to induce non-specific binding. The cells were washed three times with washing buffer) (0.05% Tween 20 in d-PBS), and 100 μL of a 1:500 dilution of primary antibody TLR4 in blocking buffer was added thereto and allowed to stand for 2 hours at room temperature. Then, the cells were washed five times with washing buffer, and 100 μL of a 1:1000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rat secondary antibody in blocking buffer was added thereto and allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 hour, after which the cells were washed seven times with washing buffer. 100 μL of a peroxidase substrate was added thereto and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes in the absence of light. The absorbance at 650 nm was measured using a microplate reader.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">The level of TLR4 mRNA and the level of TLR4 protein were measured as described in Example 3.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">As a result, as can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the LPS-induced surface expression of TLR4 in the test groups treated with Ramalin significantly decreased. In addition, the levels of both TLR4 mRNA and protein decreased (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>).</div>
<heading id="h-0018">Example 5</heading>
<heading id="h-0019">Effect of Ramalin Pretreatment on NF-κB in Macrophages Treated with LPS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">NF-κB is a transcriptional factor that is most important in the expression of iNOS. Thus, in order to examine the effect of Ramalin pretreatment on NF-κB, the expression level of luciferase was analyzed. One method for analyzing the expression of NF-κB is a luciferase assay. The luciferase assay is a test method for determining the activation of a promoter. In the luciferase assay, the promoter region of a specific gene is ligated into a vector containing luciferase, and when the promoter is activated, light is emitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">Specifically, in order to introduce the promoter region of NF-κB, a suspension of cells (1×10<sup>6 </sup>cells/mL) in a medium containing 10% FBS, penicillin (100 IU/mL) and streptomycin (100 mg/mL) was incubated in a 60 mm Petri dish, and the cells were stabilized for 24 hours. Then, the cells were treated with a transfection mixture containing the promoter region to be introduced and were incubated for 24 hours. Then, the cells were incubated under varying conditions. The supernatant was removed from the incubated cells which were then washed with d-PBS. 200 μl/well of 1× lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mM DTT, 2 mM 1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N,N′ tetracetic acid, 10% glycerol, 1% triton X-100, 1.25 mg/mL lysozyme, 2.5 mg/mL BSA) was added to the cells which were lysed by stirring at room temperature. The luciferase activity of the cell lysate was measured using a Bright-Glo luciferase assay system according to the manufacturer's instruction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">Meanwhile, the p65 subunit of NF-κB is known to play an important role in the initiation of transcription of inflammatory genes. Thus, the expression level of p65 subunit protein was analyzed by Western blot in order to examine the effect of Ramalin. In addition, it is known that IκBα is an NF-κB inhibitor that usually binds to NF-κB to inhibit the activity of NF-κB, and LPS or IFN-gamma promotes the separation of IκBα so that NF-κB is activated. Thus, the level of IκBα protein was analyzed for 60 minutes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">The activity of luciferase was measured by transfection and reporter gene assays. Specifically, RAW 264.7 cells (5×10<sup>5 </sup>cells/ml) were plated in a 6-well dish and transfected with pGL3-NF-κB and a pCMV-beta-gal plasmid using LipofectAMINE Plus (Sigma). For transfection, a mixture of 0.5 μg pGL3-NF-κB and 0.2 μg pCMV-beta-gal in LipofectAMINE Plus solution was added to the cells, and after 4 hours, the cells were pretreated with Ramalin for 4 hours, and after 2 hours, the cells were treated with LPS. Then, the cells were lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (24 mM Tris-HCl (7.8 PH), 2 mM dithiotreitol, 2 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol and 1% Triton X-100), and then the luciferase activity of 10 μl of the cell lysate was analyzed. The test for each of luciferase and beta-galactosidase was performed three times by three different persons, and then luciferase activity was normalized with beta-galactosidase activity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">As a result, as can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, luciferase activity increased by 1.5 times due to LPS treatment, but when Ramalin treatment was performed, there was no increase in luciferase activity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">The levels of p65 and IκBα proteins were measured by Western blot analysis as described in Example 3. As a result, as can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the production of p65 NF-κB in the macrophages pretreated with Ramalin was significantly lower than that in the macrophages not pretreated with Ramalin. In addition, as can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, in the case in which the macrophages were pretreated with Ramalin, IκBα was maintained in a state bound to NF-κB so that the amount thereof was shown to be smaller than that in the case in which the macrophages were not pretreated with Ramalin. The above results suggest that Ramalin inhibits the intermediate stage of the inflammatory response induced by LPS or IFN-gamma, thereby inhibiting the activation of NF-κB.</div>
<heading id="h-0020">Example 6</heading>
<heading id="h-0021">Effect of Ramalin Pretreatment on p38 MAPK, ERK1/2 and JNK in Macrophages Treated with LPS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">p38 MAPK, ERK1/2 and JNK kinase pathways are known as signaling stages that regulate the intermediate stage of inflammatory responses. Thus, the expression levels of p38 MAPK, ERK1/2 and JNK were analyzed in order to examine the effect of Ramalin pretreatment. This Example was performed in the same manner as Example 3, and the analysis of the levels of the proteins was performed by Western blot analysis in the same manner as Example 3.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">As a result, as can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the levels of p38, ERK and JNK proteins did not change regardless of Ramalin pretreatment, but the levels of p-p38, p-ERK and p-JNK, which are phosphorylated forms, decreased in a manner dependent on the concentration of Ramalin used to pre-treat the cells. This suggests that Ramalin inhibits the phosphorylation of each of the proteins, thereby inhibiting inflammatory responses.</div>

<heading id="h-0023">Effect of Ramalin Pretreatment on the Volume of Edema in Rats Treated with LPS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">In Examples 2 to 6 above, the effects of Ramalin pretreatment were analyzed in vitro.

Then, the thickness of the foot of each rat was measured for 6 hours, and the rate of increase in the volume of edema was determined. The results of the measurement are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. At each point of time, three measurements were obtained and averaged.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">As can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the rat administered with 100 mg/kg of Ramalin showed a high anti-inflammatory effect and a significant difference in edema volume from the control group administered with the vehicle. This suggests that pretreatment with Ramalin significantly inhibit inflammatory responses.</div>
