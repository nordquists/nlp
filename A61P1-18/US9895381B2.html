<heading id="h-0003">FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">This application relates to methods of treating or preventing diseases, such as pancreatitis and cancers in which there is activation of juxtaposed stellate cells, by administration of one or more vitamin D receptor (VDR) agonists.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Cancer-associated fibroblast-like cells (CAFs) in the tumor stroma have been shown to exert a profound influence on the initiation and progression of carcinoma, the most common form of human cancer (Bhowmick et al., 2004; Kalluri and Zeisberg, 2006; Pietras and Ostman, 2010; Rasanen and Vaheri, 2010; Shimoda et al., 2010). Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) in particular is defined by a prominent stromal compartment, and numerous features ascribed to CAFs promote pancreatic cancer progression and hinder therapeutic efficacy (Mahadevan and Von Hoff, 2007). CAFs enhance PDA growth in allograft models in part via paracrine activation of pro-survival pathways in tumor cells, and inhibition of tumor-stromal interactions limits tumor progression (Hwang et al., 2008; Ijichi et al., 2011; Vonlaufen et al., 2008). Further, the dense extracellular matrix (ECM) associated with PDA obstructs intratumoral vasculature, preventing chemotherapeutic delivery (Olive et al., 2009), leading to new ideas to overcome this stromal “roadblock” (Jacobetz et al., 2012; Provenzano et al., 2012). Beyond drug delivery, recent evidence implicates the tumor stroma in innate drug resistance in numerous tumor types (Straussman et al., 2012; Wilson et al., 2012), and treatment paradigms targeting both neoplastic cells and stromal components are emerging for PDA (Heinemann et al., 2012). While these findings suggest that CAFs in the PDA microenvironment represent a potential therapeutic target, the tumor-supporting features of pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), the predominant fibroblastic cell type in the tumor microenvironment of the pancreas, remain poorly understood.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">PSCs are nestin-positive and resident lipid-storing cells of the pancreas, with an important role in normal ECM turnover (Apte et al., 1998; Phillips et al., 2003). In health, PSCs are in a quiescent state, characterized by abundant cytoplasmic lipid droplets rich in vitamin A, and low levels of ECM component production (Apte et al., 2012). During pancreatic injury, PSCs are activated by cytokines, growth factors, oxidative or metabolic stress and transdifferentiate to a myofibroblast-like cell (Masamune and Shimosegawa, 2009). Activated PSCs lose their cytoplasmic lipid droplets, express the fibroblast activation marker α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA), acquire proliferative capacity, and synthesize abundant ECM proteins. Activated PSCs also acquire an expansive secretome which is starkly subdued in the quiescent state (Wehr et al., 2011). Persistent PSC activation under conditions of chronic injury results in pathological matrix secretion leading to fibrosis, creating a physical barrier to therapy. Further, a reciprocal supportive role for activated PSCs and pancreatic cancer cells has become increasingly appreciated: pancreatic cancer cells produce mitogenic and fibrogenic factors which promote PSC activation, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor β (TGFβ), and sonic hedgehog (SHH) (Apte and Wilson, 2012; Bailey et al., 2008). Reciprocally, activated PSCs produce PDGF, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and other factors which may promote cancer cell proliferation, survival, and migration (Apte and Wilson, 2012; Feig et al., 2012). Tumor-promoting features are largely restricted to the activated PSC state; the activation process may be reversible as suggested by recent work in hepatic stellate cells (Kisseleva et al., 2012). However, the cellular factors and molecular pathways controlling this process remain elusive.</div>
<heading id="h-0005">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">The inventors proposed that pharmacologic means could be used to revert activated cancer-associated PSCs (CAPSCs) to quiescence to hinder tumor-stroma crosstalk and tumor growth, resulting in enhanced clinical efficacy of cancer cell-directed chemotherapy. RNA-Seq analysis of mouse and human PSCs was performed to determine the PSC activation signature, and to identify therapeutic targets. This analysis revealed high levels of vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression in PSCs in all examined stages of activation. The data provided herein shows that VDR acts as a master genomic regulator of the PSC activation state. In a murine pancreatitis model, VDR ligand reduces fibrosis and inflammation and conversely, Vdr−/− mice spontaneously develop pancreatic fibrosis. Furthermore, VDR ligand simultaneously undermines multiple tumor-supporting signaling pathways in PDA, enhancing the efficacy of a co-administered chemotoxic agent despite negligible effects of VDR ligand as a single-agent. Together these results highlight a widely applicable strategy to influence stroma-associated pathologies including inflammation, fibrosis and cancer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Based on these observations, methods of reducing the biological activity of C-X-C motif ligand 12 (CXCL12) are provided. For example, such methods can include contacting stellate cells (such as those expressing CXCL12) with a therapeutically effective amount of one or more vitamin D receptor (VDR) agonists, thereby reducing the production and secretion of CXCL12. In one example, the VDR agonist is a synthetic agonist, such as one that does not have significant hypercalcemia effects (such as paricalcitol or calcipotriol). In some examples, the VDR agonist reduces one or more of CXCL12 nucleic acid expression, CXCL12 protein expression, CXCL12 secretion (e.g., by stellate cells), CXCL12 binding to tumor cells, and CXCL12 preventing T-cell binding to tumor cells. Such methods can be performed in vitro or in vivo.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">In one example, reducing CXCL12 activity is used to treat a tumor in a subject. For example, a subject can be administered a therapy that includes both a therapeutically effective amount of one or more VDR agonists and a therapeutically effective amount of one or more chemotherapeutic or biological agents. The therapeutic agents need not be administered at the same time. For example, the agents can be administered sequentially. In one example, the VDR agonist is administered prior to administering the therapeutically effective amount of the chemotherapeutic or biological agents.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, the disclosure provides methods for treating a cancer, such as a cancer of the pancreas, liver, kidney, lung, bile duct, or prostate. Such methods can include administering to a mammalian subject having the cancer a therapeutically effective amount of one or more VDR agonists and administering to the mammalian subject a therapeutically effective amount of a chemotherapy or biotherapy for the cancer (e.g., fluorouracil, gemcitabine, erlotinib, protein-bound paclitaxel, or combinations thereof, for a pancreatic ducal adenocarcinoma).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">In one example, reducing CXCL12 production and secretion is used to treat or prevent pancreatitis. For example, a subject having, or at risk to develop pancreatitis, can be administered a therapy that includes both a therapeutically effective amount of one or more VDR agonists. In one example, the subject is one who takes/receives or has previously taken a glucagon-like peptide (GLP) agonist, such as a GLP-1 agonist. Thus, in some examples the subject to be treated has diabetes, such as type 2 diabetes. Examples of GLP agonists include but are not limited to: exenatide, taspoglutide, insulin glargine, pioglitazone, albiglutide, lixisenatide, saxagliptin, liraglutide, linagliptin, alogliptin, sitagliptin and metformin/sitagliptin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">Thus, the disclosure provides methods for treating or preventing pancreatitis, such as pancreatitis that results from GLP-1 agonist therapy. Such methods can include administering to a mammalian subject having or at risk to develop pancreatitis a therapeutically effective amount of one or more VDR agonists. In one example, the subject is one who takes/receives or has previously taken/received a GLP agonist, such as a GLP-1 agonist. Thus, in some examples the subject to be treated has diabetes, such as type 2 diabetes.</div>

Model depicting a role for VDR in signal-dependent stromal remodeling, limiting pancreatic tumor-stroma crosstalk. PSCs progressively acquire tumor-supporting functions during activation, a process that is driven by pancreatic injury and tumor progression via secreted factors from the epithelial compartment (and possibly from immune/inflammatory cells). VDR activation drives reversion of PSCs to a more quiescent, less tumor-supportive state. As such, co-treatment of pancreatic tumors with gemcitabine to target the tumor cells and VDR ligand to deactivate PSCs leads to an overall decrease in the reciprocal tumor-stroma crosstalk that presents a major barrier to the delivery and efficacy of gemcitabine alone.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0009" num="0000">Terms</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">In order to facilitate review of the various embodiments of the disclosure, the following explanations of specific terms are provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">Administration: Includes oral, rectal, vaginal, transdermal, and parenteral administration. Generally, parenteral formulations are those that are administered through any possible mode except ingestion. This term also refers to injections, whether administered intravenously, intrathecally, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, intra-articularly, intratumorally, or subcutaneously, and various surface applications including intranasal, inhalational, intradermal, and topical application, for instance. Thus, a VDR agonist, as well as chemotherapies and biotherapies, can be administered by any method known in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">Contact: To bring one agent into close proximity to another agent, thereby permitting the agents to interact. For example, a composition containing a VDR agonist can be applied to a cell (for example in tissue culture), or administered to a subject, thereby permitting the VDR agonist to interact with cells (such as stellate cells or cancer cells) in vitro or in vivo.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">C-X-C motif ligand 12 (CXCL12): OMIM 600835. Also known a stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1). A stromal cell-derived alpha chemokine member of the intercrine family. The encoded protein functions as the ligand for the G-protein coupled receptor, chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4, and plays a role in many diverse cellular functions, including embryogenesis, immune surveillance, inflammation response, tissue homeostasis, and tumor growth and metastasis. CXCL12 sequences are publically available, for example from GenBank® sequence database (e.g., accession numbers NP_001171605.1, AAV49999.1, AAT76437.1, CR450283.1, NM_001009580.1, and AY802782.1). One of ordinary skill in the art can identify additional CXCL12 nucleic acid and protein sequences, including CXCL12 variants (such as variants that have CXCL12 activity and retain at least 98%, at least 95%, at least 90%, at least 85%, or at least 80% sequence identity to a native CXCL12 sequence, such as those provided above).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">Isolated: An “isolated” biological component (such as a nucleic acid molecule, peptide, or cell) has been purified away from other biological components in a mixed sample (such as a cell extract). For example, an “isolated” peptide or nucleic acid molecule is a peptide or nucleic acid molecule that has been separated from the other components of a cell in which the peptide or nucleic acid molecule was present (such as an expression host cell for a recombinant peptide or nucleic acid molecule).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">Pancreatic cancer: A malignant tumor within the pancreas. The prognosis is generally poor. About 95% of pancreatic cancers are adenocarcinomas. The remaining 5% are tumors of the exocrine pancreas (for example, serous cystadenomas), acinar cell cancers, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (such as insulinomas). An “insulinoma” is a cancer of the beta cells that retains the ability to secrete insulin. Patients with insulinomas usually develop neuroglycopenic symptoms. These include recurrent headache, lethargy, diplopia, and blurred vision, particularly with exercise or fasting. Severe hypoglycemia may result in seizures, coma and permanent neurological damage. Symptoms resulting from the catecholaminergic response to hypoglycemia (for example, tremulousness, palpitations, tachycardia, sweating, hunger, anxiety, nausea). A pancreatic adenocarciona occurs in the glandular tissue. Symptoms include abdominal pain, loss of appetite, weight loss, jaundice and painless extension of the gallbladder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">Classical treatment for pancreatic cancer, including adenocarcinomas and insulinomas includes surgical resection (such as the Whipple procedure) and chemotherapy with agent such as one or more of fluorouracil, gemcitabine, erlotinib, and protein-bound paclitaxel (Abraxane®), such as a combination of gemcitabine/Abraxane®.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">Pancreatitis: An inflammation of the pancreas. In some examples is caused by a GLP-1 agonist, such as those used to treat or manage type II diabetes. In one example, a subject having pancreatitis caused by a GLP-1 agonist is treated using the disclosed methods. In another example, a subject being treated with (or previously treated with) a GLP-1 agonist is treated using the disclosed methods in order to prevent development of pancreatitis in the future.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers: The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers useful in this disclosure are conventional. <i>Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences</i>, by E. W. Martin, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 15th Edition (1975), describes compositions and formulations suitable for pharmaceutical delivery of the compositions herein disclosed. For example a VDR agonist, chemotherapeutic, or biologic, can be administered in the presence of on or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">In general, the nature of the carrier will depend on the particular mode of administration being employed. For instance, parenteral formulations usually include injectable fluids that include pharmaceutically and physiologically acceptable fluids such as water, physiological saline, balanced salt solutions, aqueous dextrose, glycerol or the like as a vehicle. For solid compositions (for instance, powder, pill, tablet, or capsule forms), conventional non-toxic solid carriers can include, for example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, or magnesium stearate. In addition to biologically-neutral carriers, pharmaceutical compositions to be administered can contain minor amounts of non-toxic auxiliary substances, such as wetting or emulsifying agents, preservatives, and pH buffering agents and the like, for example sodium acetate or sorbitan monolaurate. Embodiments of other pharmaceutical compositions can be prepared with conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants, and counter-ions, as would be known to those of skill in the art. The compositions in some embodiments are in the form of a unit dose in solid, semi-solid, and liquid dosage forms, such as tablets, pills, capsules, lozenges, powders, liquid solutions, or suspensions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">Subject: Living multi-cellular vertebrate organisms, a category that includes both human and non-human mammals. The methods and compositions disclosed herein have equal applications in medical and veterinary settings. Therefore, the general term “subject” is understood to include all animals, including, but not limited to, humans or veterinary subjects, such as other primates (including monkeys), dogs, cats, horses, and cows. In one example, the subject is one who has or can develop diabetes, such as type 2 diabetes. In one example, the subject is one who has or can develop a pancreatic disorder, such as pancreatitis (such as that due to taking a GLP-1 agonist) or pancreatic cancer (such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma). In one example a subject is one who has a cancer, such as a cancer of the lung (e.g., NSCLC), kidney (e.g., renal cell carcinoma), prostate, liver (e.g., hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, angiosarcoma, or hemangiosarcoma), or pancreas (e.g., PDA).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">Therapeutically effective amount: An amount of a therapeutic agent (such as a VDR agonist, chemotherapeutic, or biologic), alone or in combination with other agents sufficient to prevent advancement of a disease, to cause regression of the disease, or which is capable of relieving symptoms caused by the disease. In one example a therapeutically effective amount of a vitamin D receptor agonist is used to prevent or treat a symptom associated with pancreatitis induced by GLP-1 agonists, for example vomiting, internal bleeding, increased blood pressure, pain, and inflammation or swelling of the pancreas. In one example a therapeutically effective amount of a VDR agonist in combination with a therapeutically effective amount of a chemotherapeutic or biologic is use to prevent or treat a symptom associated with cancer, such as cancer of the liver, kidney, pancreas, prostate, bile duct or lung, for example reducing the size or volume of a tumor, reducing metastasis of a tumor, reducing a number of tumor cells in a tumor, reducing the rate of growth of a tumor, and increasing an amount of chemotherapeutic or biologic in the tumor. In one example, a therapeutically effective amount is an amount of a composition provided herein that includes a vitamin D receptor agonist sufficient to reduce symptoms of pancreatitis or a cancer of the liver, kidney, pancreas, prostate, bile duct or lung, for example by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 50%, at least 70%, or at least 90% (as compared to no administration of the VDR agonist.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">Treating or preventing a disease: Treatment refers to a therapeutic intervention that ameliorates a sign or symptom of a disease or pathological condition (for instance, pancreatitis induced by a GLP-1 agonist, or cancer of the liver, kidney, pancreas, prostate, bile duct or lung) after it has begun to develop. Prevention refers to inhibiting the full development of a disease, for example in a person who is known to have a predisposition to a disease such as a person who has been or is at risk for developing pancreatitis, such as a subject receiving one or more GLP-1 agonists.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">Vitamin D: A group of fat-soluble secosteroid prohormones and hormones, the two major forms of which are vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), which are converted to 1α,25 dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3 </sub>(1α,25-(OH)<sub>2</sub>-D<sub>3</sub>), also known as calcitriol, the physiologically active form of vitamin D.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">Vitamin D agonist or analog: Any compound, synthetic or natural, that binds to and activates the vitamin D receptor, such as a VDR ligand (e.g., calcitriol), VDR agonist precursor, vitamin D analogs, vitamin D precursors. Specific, non-limiting examples of natural and synthetic vitamin D agonists and analogs include 1α,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>, LG190090, LG9190119, LG190155, LG190176, and LG190178 (see, for instance, Boehm et al., (1999) <i>Chemistry </i>&amp; <i>Biology, </i>6:265-275); LY2108491, and LY2109866 (Ma et al., (2006) <i>J Clin. Invest., </i>116:892-904); 2β-(3-Hydroxypropoxy)1α,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3 </sub>(ED-71) (Tsurukami et al., (1994) <i>Calcif. Tiss. Int. </i>54:142-149); EB1089 (Pepper et al., (2003) <i>Blood, </i>101:2454-2460); OCT(22-oxa-calcitrol) (Makibayashi et al., (2001) <i>Am. J. Path., </i>158:1733-1741); (1αOH-2,19-nor-25hydroxyvitaminD<sub>3</sub>) and (1,3-Deoxy-2-CHCH<sub>2</sub>OH-19-nor-25-hydroxyvitaminD3) (Posner et al., (2005) <i>Bioorganic </i>&amp; <i>Medicinal Chemistry, </i>13:2959-2966) and any of the vitamin D analogs disclosed in Rey et al., (1999) <i>J. Organic Chem., </i>64:3196-3206; and bile acid derivatives such as lithochoic acid (LCA) and ursodoxycholic acid (UDCA) (see, for instance, Nehring et al., (2007) <i>PNAS, </i>104:10006-10009; Makishima et al., (2002) <i>Science, </i>296:1313-1316; Copaci et al., (2005) <i>Rom. J. Gastroenterol., </i>14:259-266). Each of these references is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">Vitamin D precursor: Any compound capable of being converted to an agonist of the vitamin D receptor by an enzyme. In certain, non-limiting examples, that enzyme is CYP27B1. Specific, non-limiting examples of vitamin D precursors include vitamin D<sub>3 </sub>(cholecalciferol), 25-hydroxy-vitamin D<sub>3 </sub>(25-OH-D<sub>3</sub>) (calcidiol), as well as vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and its precursors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">Vitamin D receptor (VDR): A member of the steroid hormone family of nuclear receptors. VDR possesses the common nuclear receptor structure, for example, is comprised of an N-terminal activation domain, a DNA-binding region (DBD) with two zinc finger domains, a hinge region and a ligand-binding domain (LBD). VDR activated gene transcription requires initial nuclear translocation via importin-α, heterodimerization with RXR, and binding to response elements present in target genes. VDR is known to regulate genes associated with the maintenance of calcium and phosphate homeostasis in the intestine and kidney. The signal initiated by VDR/RXR heterodimers is modulated by the association of co-activating or co-repressing proteins and also depends on other signaling partners in the nuclear compartment. The VDR/RXR heterodimer is non-permissive, in that the presence or absence of RXR ligands is not known to affect VDR responses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">Until recently the only known physiological ligand for VDR was 1α,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D3 (calcitriol). However, specific bile acids such as LCA and some derivatives (LCA-acetate, LCA-formate, 3-keto LCA) also can activate VDR.</div>
<heading id="h-0010">Methods of Treating or Preventing a Disorder Due to CXCL-12 Activity</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">A. Overview</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">The poor clinical outcome in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) has been attributed to intrinsic resistance to chemotherapy and a growth-permissive tumor microenvironment. Conversion of quiescent to activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) is thought to be a key switch in driving the severe stromal reaction that characterizes PDA. It is shown herein that the vitamin D receptor (VDR) is expressed in activated human pancreatic tumor stroma as well as in in vivo models of pancreatitis, a known risk factor for PDA. Notably, treatment with the VDR ligand calcipotriol markedly reduced inflammation and fibrosis during pancreatitis and a more pronounced form of the disease developed in VDR knockout mice. It is shown that VDR acts as a master transcriptional regulator of PSCs to reprise the quiescent state such that ligand-induced stromal remodeling increased intratumoral gemcitabine levels 5-fold and reduced tumor volume in vivo. Thus, stromal VDR activation abates chemotherapeutic drug resistance. This disclosure describes a molecular strategy through which transcriptional reprogramming of tumor stroma rescues/fosters chemotherapeutic response and advocates a reevaluation of vitamin D as an adjunct therapy for PDA.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">The emerging role for tumor stroma as the ‘fuel supply-line’ for cancer offers an important advance from focusing on the cancer cell itself. Indeed, the approach of targeting VDR disclosed herein to transcriptionally reprogram the stroma, simultaneously affecting multiple pathways including inflammatory cytokines, growth factors and angiogenesis, increased the efficacy of gemcitabine treatment in PDA. Furthermore, VDR ligand reduces fibrosis and inflammation in both acute and chronic murine pancreatitis. This is significant as pancreatitis lacks any mechanistic based therapy and is a known risk factor for pancreatic cancer. Recently, ‘cistromic antagonism’ has been demonstrated, in which VDR activation inhibits the fibrogenic program in activated stellate cells by blocking TGFβ/SMAD signaling (Ding et al., 2013). Together with the data presented herein, these results demonstrate that a wound repair response that engages the TGFβ/SMAD pathway is activated in pancreatic stellate cells by paracrine signaling from cancer cells, inflammation, or other cellular stressors, that is restricted by VDR signaling at the level of the genome. The balance between these opposing pathways may be tipped unfavorably by chronic tissue damage or by vitamin D deficiency, which may explain in part the inverse correlation between plasma vitamin D levels or vitamin D intake and pancreatic cancer risk (Skinner et al., 2006; Wolpin et al., 2012) and the link between vitamin D deficiency and chronic pancreatitis (Mann et al., 2003).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">Transcriptional remodeling of pancreatic tumor stroma via VDR activation broadly impairs the capacity of PSCs to support tumor growth. Key features of tumor-stroma interaction negatively regulated by VDR include the extracellular matrix (Jacobetz et al., 2013; Provenzano et al., 2012), the Shh pathway (Olive et al., 2009), cytokines/chemokines such as IL6 and others (Fukuda et al., 2011; Ijichi et al., 2011; Lesina et al., 2011), and growth factors such as CTGF (Aikawa et al., 2006). This gains significance in light of recent work demonstrating that inhibition of stroma-derived survival factor CTGF potentiates the antitumor response to gemcitabine (Neesse et al., 2013). Differences exist between stromal ablation and stromal remodeling therapeutic strategies. The notion that cellular and structural components of a “normal” microenvironment exert tumor-suppressive forces and signals has been discussed previously (Bissell and Hines, 2011), though this remains to be demonstrated in the pancreas. As VDR ligand pushes activated PSCs toward a more quiescent, “normal” phenotype, it is conceivable that remodeled PSCs exert such homeostatic control to negatively regulate tumor growth or promote differentiation, a benefit that would not be harnessed by ablation of stroma altogether.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">PDA stroma also limits chemotherapeutic efficacy by blocking drug delivery, a result of severe hypovascularity attributable in part to dense extracellular matrix. VDR ligand significantly reduced the fibrotic component of the tumor and increased intratumoral vasculature. It is shown herein that activated PSCs express antiangiogenic factors such as thrombospondin-1, predicted to contribute to the hypovascularity which characterizes PDA. The antiangiogenic subset of PSC activation signature genes was suppressed by VDR ligand in vitro and, importantly, combination therapy induced improvement of tumor vascularity and drug delivery in vivo. Matrix degradation strategies which increase intratumoral blood flow and gemcitabine delivery have been shown to improve survival in PDA (Jacobetz et al., 2012; Provenzano et al., 2012). However, the significance of VDR-mediated stromal remodeling and improved vascularity with respect to long-term tumor growth and metastatic potential are currently under investigation. Indeed, the recent failure of clinical trials exploring the therapeutic potential of Shh pathway inhibition in combination with gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer bring to light potential limitations of stromal depletion therapy in the context of current treatment strategies. Conceptually, opening the tumor stroma and increasing functional vasculature suggests the dual effect of creating a window for therapeutic delivery, and heightening the potential for dissemination through the bloodstream. Despite these caveats, the data provided herein indicates that stromal agents will show improved clinical outcome when paired with potent targeted therapies which rapidly kill cancer cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">Consideration of VDR activation as a mechanism for signal-dependent transcriptional remodeling of stroma in pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer is important as these diseases have very limited therapeutic options. The marked reductions in fibrosis and inflammation induced by VDR activation in both acute and chronic pancreatitis models, combined with the increased therapeutic efficacy of calcipotriol+Gemcitibine treatment in PDA models, identify this pathway for the development of sorely needed therapeutic alternatives. Though cancer cell-intrinsic resistance to current chemotherapies remains a major obstacle, the VDR-mediated stromal remodeling paradigm presented here may be favorable when combined with novel therapies directly targeting the neoplasia itself. Simultaneous targeting of tumor and non-tumor components is a simple and potentially widely applicable strategy to overcome chemoresistance in pancreas and other stroma-associated cancers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">Based on the data provided herein, methods for reducing the biological activity of C-X-C motif ligand 12 (CXCL12) are provided. In some examples, such methods include contacting stellate cells (such as those expressing and secreting CXCL12) with a therapeutically effective amount of one or more VDR agonists, thereby reducing the biological activity of CXCL12 (such as its production and/or secretion). Such methods can be performed in vitro (for example by contacting cells in culture expressing the CXCL12 with one or more VDR agonists) or in vivo (for example by administering to a subject one or more VDR agonists). In some examples, the subject treated is a mammalian subject, such as a human subject.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">The biological activity can include one or more of CXCL12 nucleic acid expression (such as mRNA or cDNA expression), CXCL12 protein expression, CXCL12 secretion by a cell (such as a stellate cell), CXCL12 protein stability, CXCL12 binding to tumor cells, CXCR4 signaling in tumor cells, and CXCL12 preventing T-cell binding to tumor cells. VDR agonist that reduces the biological activity of a CXCL12 protein need not completely inhibit CXCL12 protein activity. In some examples, such compounds reduce CXCL12 protein activity by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 90%, or at least 95%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">Thus, in one example, a VDR agonist that reduces the biological activity of CXCL12 can reduce CXCL12 nucleic acid expression (such as mRNA or cDNA expression by a stellate cell) by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 90%, or at least 95%, as compared to an absence of the VDR agonist. In one example, a VDR agonist that reduces the biological activity of CXCL12 can reduce CXCL12 protein expression (such as protein expression by a stellate cell) by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 90%, or at least 95%, as compared to an absence of the VDR agonist. In one example, a VDR agonist that reduces the biological activity of CXCL12 can reduce secretion of CXCL12 by a cell (such as by a stellate cell) by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 90%, or at least 95%, as compared to an absence of the VDR agonist. In one example, a VDR agonist that reduces the biological activity of CXCL12 can reduce the stability of CXCL12 protein by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 90%, or at least 95%, as compared to an absence of the VDR agonist. In one example, a VDR agonist that reduces the biological activity of a CXCL12 protein can reduce the binding of CXCL12 to a tumor cell (such as a cancer cell of the liver, pancreas, lung, prostate, bile duct, or kidney) by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 90%, or at least 95%, as compared to an absence of the VDR agonist. In one example, a VDR agonist that reduces the biological activity of CXCL12 can reduce CXCR4 signaling in a tumor cell (such as in a cancer cell of the liver, pancreas, lung, prostate, bile duct, or kidney) by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 90%, or at least 95%, as compared to an absence of the VDR agonist. In one example, a VDR agonist that reduces the biological activity of a CXCL12 protein can reduce the ability of CXCL12 “hide” or “mask” a tumor cell (such as a cancer cell of the liver, pancreas, lung, prostate, bile duct, or kidney) from a T-cell by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 90%, or at least 95%, as compared to an absence of the VDR agonist. Thus, in some examples, a VDR agonist that reduces the biological activity of a CXCL12 protein can increase the ability of a T cell to bind to or recognize a tumor cell by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 100%, at least 200%, at least 300%, at least 400%, at least 500%, or at least 1000%, as compared to an absence of the VDR agonist.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">Methods of treating a tumor, such as a cancer that has associated stellate cells, in a subject are provided. Such methods can include administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of one or more VDR agonists and a therapeutically effective amount of one or more chemotherapeutic or biological agents (such as a monoclonal antibody). The one or more chemotherapeutic or biological agents used can be determined with routine skill based on the tumor that the subject has. For example, if the tumor is a pancreatic cancer (e.g., pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, PDA), the one or more chemotherapeutic agents can include one or more of fluorouracil, gemcitabine, erlotinib, and protein-bound paclitaxel (e.g., Nab-paclitaxel, Abraxane®); if the tumor is non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) the one or more chemotherapeutic agents can include one or more of methotrexate, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, cisplatin, azacitidine, and entinostat; if the tumor is a kidney cancer (e.g., renal cell carcinoma) the one or more chemotherapeutic or biological agents can include one or more of everolimus, aldesleukin, evacizumab, axitinib, bevacizumab, sorafenib tosylate, pazopanib hydrochloride, sunitinib malate, and temsirolimus; if the tumor is a prostate cancer the one or more chemotherapeutic or biological agents can include one or more of abiraterone acetate, bicalutamide, cabazitaxel, degarelix, denosumab, eocetaxel, enzalutamide, goserelin acetate, leuprolide acetate, prednisone, radium 223 dichloride, sipuleucel-T, and docetaxel; and if the tumor is a liver cancer (e.g., hepatocellular carcinoma) and the one or more chemotherapeutic agents comprise one or more of sorafenib, doxorubicin, gemcitabine, cisplatin, interferon, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (such as PIAF: cisplatin, interferon, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil).

In a specific example, the one or more VDR agonists is calcipotriol or paricalcitol and the chemotherapy comprises (a) gemcitabine (e.g., 1000 mg gemcitabine /m2 over 30 minutes once weekly for up to 7 weeks followed by a week of rest, then once weekly for three weeks of every four weeks), (b) gemcitabine and erlotinib, or (c) gemcitabine and protein-bound paclitaxel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">Also provided herein are methods of using a therapeutically effective amount of one or more vitamin D receptor (VDR) agonists (including calcitriol or calcipotriol or a precursor or analog thereof, as well as other VDR ligands, vitamin D precursors, vitamin D analogs, 1α,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>-D<sub>3</sub>, VDR ligands, and precursors of VDR agonists) for the treatment of pancreatitis, for instance pancreatitis induced by glucagon-like peptide (GLP) agonists, such as GLP-1 agonists. The pancreatitis can be acute or chronic. Thus, described herein are methods of treating pancreatitis induced by GLP-1 agonists in a subject, such as a subject receiving one or more GLP-1 agonists for treatment of diabetes, such as type 2 diabetes. In some examples the method includes selecting a subject having type 2 diabetes that is currently or has previously been treated with a GLP-1 agonist. In some cases such subject will have or be at risk for developing pancreatitis. In a specific example, the present disclosure provides a method of treatment, which includes providing a human patient with features or symptoms of pancreatitis due to GLP-1 agonist administration a therapeutic composition including a VDR agonist, and administering the therapeutic composition to the patient under conditions such that said features or symptoms (such as vomiting, internal bleeding, increased blood pressure, pain or swelling) are reduced. In some examples, the subject is at risk for developing pancreatitis due to GLP-1 agonist administration, and the therapeutic composition is administered prophylactically. In one embodiment, the prophylactic administration of the VDR agonist delays the onset of the symptoms of GLP-1 agonist induced pancreatitis. For example, prophylactic administration of a VDR agonist prevents the onset of one or more symptoms or features of GLP-1 agonist induced pancreatitis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">GLP-1 agonists (also referred to in the literature as GLP-1 mimetics and incretin mimetics) are a class of drugs that lower blood glucose concentrations, and are thus used to treat or manage type 2 diabetes. As compared to older insulin secretagogues, such as sulfonylureas or meglitinides, GLP-1 agonists have a lower risk of causing hypoglycemia. However, such compounds can also have adverse effects, including pancreatitis. Exemplary GLP-1 agonists include but are not limited to exenatide, taspoglutide, insulin glargine, pioglitazone, albiglutide, lixisenatide, saxagliptin, liraglutide, linagliptin, alogliptin, sitagliptin and metformin/sitagliptin. Byetta® (exenatide, Merck) is usually administered subcutaneously twice daily; taspoglutide (Roche) is usually administered subcutaneously weekly, insulin glargine (Lantus®, Sanofi-Aventis); is usually administered subcutaneously daily, pioglitazone (Actos®, Takeda); is usually administered orally daily (e.g., 15 mg, 30 mg, or 45 mg), albiglutide (Tanzeum®, GlaxoSmithKline) is usually administered subcutaneously once weekly; lixisenatide (Lyxumia® Sanofi-Aventis) is usually administered daily by injection (e.g., 10 μg per day for 14 days, then 20 μg/day); Bydureon® (exenatide, Bristol-Myers Squibb) is usually administered weekly by injection; Onglyza® (saxagliptin, AstraZeneca) is usually administered orally daily (e.g., 2.5 mg or 5 mg); Victoza® (liraglutide, Novo Nordisk); is usually administered subcutaneously daily (e.g., 0.6, 1.2, or 1.8 mg); Tradjenta® (linagliptin, Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim) is usually administered orally daily (e.g., 5 mg); Nesina® (alogliptin, Takeda) is usually administered orally daily (e.g., 25 mg); Januvia® (sitagliptin) and the related Janumet® (a mixture of metformin and sitagliptin, Merck) are usually administered orally daily (e.g., 25, 50 or 100 mg for Januvia® and 50 or 100 mg sitagliptin and 1000 or 2000 mg metformin hydrochloride for Janumet® or Janumet XR®). In some examples, GLP-1 agonists (such as those listed above) are administered subcutaneously or orally on a daily, twice daily, biweekly or once weekly basis.</div>

In certain embodiments, the treatment is a VDR agonist precursor such as 25-hydroxy-vitamin D<sub>3 </sub>(25-OH-D<sub>3</sub>) (calcidiol); vitamin D<sub>3 </sub>(cholecalciferol); vitamin D<sub>2 </sub>(ergocalciferol), or combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, the treatment is an agonist ligand of VDR, such as 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3 </sub>(calcitriol).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">In some examples, 1α,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3 </sub>or a vitamin D precursor or analog is used as a VDR agonist. It is not necessary to use the most biologically active form of vitamin D to achieve a beneficial therapeutic effect. The naturally occurring ligand of the vitamin D receptor is calcitriol. In one embodiment, precursors of calcitriol (such as calcidiol) are administered to a subject, and are then converted within the target cell population to calcitriol. This approach has the advantage that the local intestinal as well as the systemic effects of calcitriol on calcium homeostasis can be significantly avoided, even when large doses of the precursor are administered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">In one embodiment, a VDR ligand or other VDR agonist or agonist precursor that is resistant to deactivation by CYP24A1 is used to achieve more effective and longer lasting VDR activation in target cell populations. In specific examples, the VDR ligand is one that can be activated by CYP27B1 while being resistant to deactivation by CYP24A1. This permits VDR activation in target cell populations in the pancreas, while minimizing undesirable systemic effects on calcium homeostasis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">In one embodiment, VDR ligands or other VDR agonists that can bind to and activate the VDR are used to prevent or attenuate the processes of injury in the pancreas due to GLP-1 administration. In some embodiments, ligands of VDR are used alone, whereas in other embodiments they are used in combination with other compositions routinely used to treat pancreatitis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">The effects of VDR agonists on pancreatitis or cancer are monitored, in some embodiments, by blood, serum, plasma amylase, or lipase, as well as tests of organ function (e.g., pancreatic exocrine and endocrine function). In other embodiments, pancreatitis or cancer is monitored by imaging techniques, including but not limited to radiological, nuclear medicine, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">In certain examples, the administration includes oral or parenteral (e.g., oral, intraperitoneal, or intravenous) administration of the VDR agonist. In particular examples, the VDR agonist is a vitamin D precursor is administered at a dose of at least 1 international units (IU), such as at least 5 IU, at least 10 IU, at least 10 IU, at least 100 IU, at least 1000 IU, at least 5000 IU, at least 10,000 IU, at least 50,000 IU, at least 100,000 IU, or at least 500,000 IU, for example from 5 IU about 50,000 IU, 5 IU to 10,000 IU, 10 to 1000 IU, or 50,000 IU to 500,000 IU. Generally, an IU is unit of measurement for the amount of a substance, such as a vitamin D precursor, based on specific biological activity or effect as defined by an international body and accepted internationally. In some examples, for vitamin D 1 IU is the biological equivalent of 0.025 μg cholecalciferol/ergocalciferol.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">In certain examples, the subject is a mammalian subject, such as a human or other primate or a horse, dog, or cat. For example, the subject can be one with type 2 diabetes, such as subject receiving a GLP-1 agonist for the treatment or management of their diabetes, or a subject who has previously been treated with a GLP-1 agonist. In one example, the subject is one with a tumor, such as a cancer of the kidney, liver, pancreas, prostate, bile duct, or lung. Such subjects, such as a mammal, in some examples is administered one or more VDR agonists over a period of at least 1 day, at least 7 days, at least 14 days, at least 30 days, at least 60 days, at least 6 months, at least 1 year, at least 2 years or at least 5 years.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">In another example, the subject (such as a human or laboratory mammal, such as a rat, mouse or non-human primate) can be administered a VDR agonist at concentrations and over a period of time sufficient to increase expression of VDR.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">Provided herein are methods of decreasing CXCL12 activity, such as CXCL12 production and/or secretion in/by a stellate cell, which can be used to treat a tumor or cancer that has associated stellate cells. Examples of cancers that can be treated with the methods provided herein include cancer of the kidney, liver, pancreas, prostate, bile duct, and lung. In some embodiments, the method can be used to treat pancreatic cancer. In one example, the cancer is pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Such methods can include administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of one or more VDR agonists (such as calcipotriol or paricalcitol) and a therapeutically effective amount of one or more chemotherapeutic or biological agents (such as a monoclonal antibody). The disclosed methods can be combined with surgical resection for the treatment of the cancer, such as surgery following treatment of the tumor with the disclosed methods or surgery prior to treatment with the disclosed methods.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">The one or more chemotherapeutic or biological agents used can be determined with routine skill based on the tumor that the subject has. For example, if the tumor is a pancreatic cancer (e.g., pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, PDA), the one or more chemotherapeutic agents can include one or more of fluorouracil, gemcitabine, erlotinib, and protein-bound paclitaxel (e.g., Nab-paclitaxel, Abraxane®); if the tumor is a lung cancer (e.g., NSCLC) the one or more chemotherapeutic agents can include one or more of methotrexate, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, cisplatin, azacitidine, and entinostat; if the tumor is a kidney cancer (e.g., renal cell carcinoma) the one or more chemotherapeutic or biological agents can include one or more of everolimus, aldesleukin, evacizumab, axitinib, bevacizumab, sorafenib tosylate, pazopanib hydrochloride, sunitinib malate, and temsirolimus; if the tumor is a prostate cancer the one or more chemotherapeutic or biological agents can include one or more of abiraterone acetate, bicalutamide, cabazitaxel, degarelix, denosumab, eocetaxel, enzalutamide, goserelin acetate, leuprolide acetate, prednisone, radium 223 dichloride, sipuleucel-T, and docetaxel; if the tumor is a cancer of the bile duct (cholangiocarcinoma), the one or more chemotherapeutic or biological agents can include one or more of 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, gemcitabine, gemcitabine plus cisplatin, irinotecan, capecitabine, and erlotinib (such as 5-fluorouracil+leucovorin or gemcitabine+cisplatin); and if the tumor is a liver cancer (e.g., hepatocellular carcinoma) and the one or more chemotherapeutic agents comprise one or more of sorafenib, doxorubicin, gemcitabine, cisplatin, interferon, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (such as PIAF: cisplatin, interferon, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil). In a specific example, the tumor is a PDA and the one or more chemotherapeutic agents comprise (a) gemcitabine, (b) gemcitabine and erlotinib, or (c) gemcitabine and protein-bound paclitaxel. Thus, the disclosure provides a method of treating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma by a method that includes (1) administering to a mammalian subject having a PDA a therapeutically effective amount of one or more VDR agonists, and (2) administering a therapeutically effective amount of a chemotherapy selected from the group consisting of fluorouracil, gemcitabine, erlotinib, protein-bound paclitaxel, or combinations thereof, thereby treating the pancreatic ducal adenocarcinoma in the subject.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">In one embodiment, the combination of a therapeutically effective amount of both one or more VDR agonists and one or more chemotherapeutic or biological agents (such as a monoclonal antibody), synergistically enhances the effects of the one or more chemotherapeutic or biological agents. Without wishing to be bound to a particular theory, it is proposed that the use of the VDR agonist reduces the stellate cell production of CXCL12 thereby reducing the “masking” of tumor cells from T cells by CXCL12. In addition, the VDR agonist reduces the stellate cell production of pro-survival factors such as CTGF or PDGF, negative regulators of angiogenesis and extracellular matrix components making the tumor more accessible to chemotherapeutic or biological agents, thus making the tumor more vulnerable to such agents.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">Thus, in some examples, the combination of a therapeutically effective amount of both one or more VDR agonists and one or more chemotherapeutic or biological agents inhibits further growth of, reduces the volume or size of, reduces metastasis of, reduces a sign or a symptom of, reduces a number of tumor cells of, or reduces the rate of growth of, a cancer of the kidney (e.g., RCC), liver (e.g., HCC), pancreas (e.g., PDA), prostate, bile duct, and lung (e.g., NSCLC). In some examples, administration of both a therapeutically effective amount of one or more VDR agonists and one or more chemotherapeutic or biological agents reduces growth or the rate of growth of such cancers by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 90%, or at least 95% as compared to an absence of the VDR agonist. In one example, administration of both a therapeutically effective amount of one or more VDR agonists and one or more chemotherapeutic or biological agents reduces the volume of such cancers by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 90%, or at least 95%, as compared to an absence of the VDR agonist. In one example, administration of both a therapeutically effective amount of one or more VDR agonists and one or more chemotherapeutic or biological agents reduces the size of such cancers by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 90%, or at least 95%, as compared to an absence of the VDR agonist. In one example, administration of both a therapeutically effective amount of one or more VDR agonists and one or more chemotherapeutic or biological agents reduces the metastasis of such cancers by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 90%, or at least 95%, as compared to an absence of the VDR agonist. In one example, administration of both a therapeutically effective amount of one or more VDR agonists and one or more chemotherapeutic or biological agents reduces a sign or a symptom of such cancers by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 90%, or at least 95%, as compared to an absence of the VDR agonist. In one example, administration of both a therapeutically effective amount of one or more VDR agonists and one or more chemotherapeutic or biological agents reduces the number of such cancer cells by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 90%, or at least 95%, as compared to an absence of the VDR agonist.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">In one example, administration of both a therapeutically effective amount of one or more VDR agonists and one or more chemotherapeutic or biological agents can reduce the ability of CXCL12 “hide” or “mask” a tumor cell (such as a cancer cell of the liver, pancreas, lung, prostate, bile duct, or kidney) from a T-cell by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 90%, or at least 95%, as compared to an absence of the VDR agonist. Thus, in some examples, administration of both a therapeutically effective amount of one or more VDR agonists and one or more chemotherapeutic or biological agents can increase the ability of a T cell to bind to or recognize a tumor cell by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 100%, at least 200%, at least 300%, at least 400%, at least 500%, or at least 1000%, as compared to an absence of the VDR agonist.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">In some examples, the combination of a therapeutically effective amount of both one or more VDR agonists and one or more chemotherapeutic or biological agents increases an amount of chemotherapeutic or biologic in a cancer of the kidney (e.g., RCC), liver (e.g., HCC), pancreas (e.g., PDA), prostate, bile duct, and lung (e.g., NSCLC) by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 100%, at least 200%, at least 300%, at least 400%, at least 500%, or at least 1000%, as compared to an absence of the VDR agonist.</div>

Exemplary methods for measuring or monitoring tumors include but are not limited to, diagnostic imaging (such as CT scan, x-rays, ultrasound, and the like), microscopic imaging (such as light microscopy, immunofluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and the like), biopsies of the tumor, as well as blood diagnostics (e.g., measuring AFP as a marker of HCC, CA 19-9 as a biomarker of PDA, PSA as a biomarker of prostate cancer, and the like). Other exemplary diagnostic methods are provided in the examples below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">Any mode of administration of the VDR agonist and the chemotherapeutic/biologic can be used. In some examples, different modes of administration are used for the VDR agonist and for the chemotherapeutic/biologic. In one example, the VDR agonist is administered orally, intraperitoneally or intravenously and the chemotherapeutic or biologic is administered intravenously. In one example, site-specific administration of the VDR agonist and the chemotherapeutic/biologic can be used, for instance by applying the compound to an area where the tumor is or from which a tumor has been removed, or a region suspected of being prone to tumor development. In some embodiments, sustained intra-tumoral administration (or near-tumoral) is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">C. Methods of Treating or Preventing GLP Agonist-Induced Pancreatitis</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">Provided herein are methods reducing inflammatory and fibrotic responses induced in chronic and acute pancreatitis by decreasing the production of inflammatory cytokines and fibrotic proteins from activated stellate cells, which can be used to treat or prevent pancreatitis. In addition, treatment of activated stellate cells will also reduce the production and/or secretion of CXCL12. For example, a therapeutically effective amount of one or more VDR agonists (such as calcitriol or calcipotriol or other non-naturally occurring VDR agonist) can be used to treat pancreatitis, for instance pancreatitis induced by GLP agonists, such as GLP-1 agonists. Such a subject can be one receiving one or more GLP-1 agonists for treatment of diabetes, such as type 2 diabetes. In a specific example, the treatment includes administering to a human patient with features or symptoms of pancreatitis due to GLP-1 agonist a therapeutic composition including a VDR agonist under conditions such that said features or symptoms (such as pain in the epigastric region or right upper quadrant that radiates to the back, mild jaundice, vomiting, internal bleeding, increased blood pressure, pain or swelling) are reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">In some examples, the disclosed methods are prophylactic. Thus, the subject treated can be one who is at risk for developing pancreatitis due to GLP agonist administration (e.g., GLP-1 agonist), and the therapeutic composition is administered prophylactically. In one embodiment, the prophylactic administration of the VDR agonist delays the onset of the symptoms of GLP-1 agonist induced pancreatitis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">A VDR agonist that reduces the activation of stellate cells and thereby the production of inflammatory cytokines as well as CXCL12 need not completely inhibit and/or reverse stellate cell activation to treat or prevent the pancreatitis. In some examples, such compounds reduce stellate cell activation by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 90%, or at least 95%. Thus in one example, a VDR agonist that reduces stellate cell activation can reduce vomiting by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 90%, or at least 95%, in a subject with or at risk for pancreatitis, as compared to an absence of the VDR agonist. In one example, a VDR agonist that reduces stellate cell activation can reduce internal bleeding by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 90%, or at least 95%, in a subject with or at risk for pancreatitis, as compared to an absence of the VDR agonist. In one example, a VDR agonist that reduces stellate cell activation can reduce blood pressure by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 90%, or at least 95%, in a subject with or at risk for pancreatitis, as compared to an absence of the VDR agonist. In one example, a VDR agonist that reduces stellate cell activation can reduce swelling or inflammation of the pancreas by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 90%, or at least 95%, in a subject with or at risk for pancreatitis, as compared to an absence of the VDR agonist. In one example, a VDR agonist that reduces stellate cell activation can reduce fibrosis of the pancreas by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 90%, or at least 95%, in a subject with or at risk for pancreatitis, as compared to an absence of the VDR agonist.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">Methods of measuring such symptoms and features of pancreatitis are known and are provided herein, and such assays can be used to determine if the VDR agonist reduces such symptoms or features. Exemplary methods include but are not limited to, diagnostic imaging (e.g., radiological, nuclear medicine, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance, such as a CT scan or x-ray) and tests of the blood, serum, plasma amylase, or lipase, as well as tests of pancreatic exocrine and endocrine function (e.g., white blood cell count, glucose levels). For example, the evidence can be improved pancreatic function, lessening of pain, retention of pancreatic function, or a structural change in the pancreas of the subject. Thus, for example, the physician can measure one or more indicators of GLP-1 agonist induced pancreatitis in the subject immediately prior to, or on commencement of the treatment, and again during and after treatment. In certain embodiments, treatment is continued until evidence of relief, cure, or prevention of GLP-1 agonist induced pancreatitis has been achieved. In other embodiments, treatment is continued after evidence of relief, cure, or prevention of GLP-1 agonist induced pancreatitis s has been obtained. Such treatment, in some examples, lasts for the duration of treatment of GLP-1 agonist induced pancreatitis in the subject, or for the lifetime of the subject.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">Tests measuring endocrine and/or exocrine pancreatic function can be used for monitoring GLP-1 agonist induced pancreatitis. In some embodiments, pancreatic insufficiency is diagnosed by the presence of the clinical triad of pancreatic calcification, diabetes and steatorrhea. Tests of exocrine pancreatic function include, but are not limited to CCK/secretin stimulation tests, Lundh meal tests, ERCP and pancreatic aspiration, measurement of stool fats and nitrogen or stool trypsin and chymotrypsin, and the bentiromide test and pancreolauryl test, as well as measurements of trypsinogen, lipase, or pancreatic amylase in the blood.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">Other methods of diagnosing and measuring the severity of GLP-1 agonist induced pancreatitis are known to those skilled in the art, and it is contemplated that any one of these methods can be used to assess the efficacy of treatment of GLP-1 agonist induced pancreatitis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">D. Vitamin D Receptor (VDR)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">VDR possesses the common nuclear receptor structure, for instance is comprised of an N-terminal activation domain, a DNA-binding region (DBD) with two zinc finger domains, a hinge region and a ligand-binding domain (LBD). VDR activated gene transcription requires initial nuclear translocation via importin-α, heterodimerization with RXR, (Yasmin et al., 2005. <i>J Biol Chem., </i>280(48):40152-60), and binding to response elements present in target genes. VDR regulates genes associated with the maintenance of calcium and phosphate homeostasis in the intestine and kidney. The signal initiated by VDR/RXR heterodimers is modulated by the association of co-activating or co-repressing proteins and also depends on other signaling partners in the nuclear compartment (Ebert et al., 2006. <i>Mol Cell Endocrinol., </i>248(1-2):149-59). The VDR/RXR heterodimer is non-permissive, in that the presence or absence of RXR ligands does not affect VDR responses (Shulman et al., 2004. <i>Cell, </i>116(3):417-29). Until recently, the only known physiological ligand for VDR was calcitriol. However, specific bile acids such as LCA and some derivatives (LCA-acetate, LCA-formate, 3-keto LCA) may activate VDR. These bile acid VDR agonists have been shown to induce SULT2A1 expression, a sulfo-conjugating phase II enzyme in intestinal mucosa, which may provide a key defense response of the intestine against the toxic and carcinogenic effects of bile acids (Chatterjee et al., 2005. <i>Methods Enzymol., </i>400:165-91).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">E. Exemplary VDR Agonists</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">As described above, administration of VDR agonists can be used to treat cancers having active stellate cells and to treat or prevent GLP-1 induced pancreatitis. Exemplary VDR agonists include those molecules that can activate the VDR. Methods of determining if an agent is a VDR agonist are routine. For example, induction of CYP24A1 expression can be measured in VDR-expressing cells contacted with the agent, wherein an increase in CYP24A1 expression (such as a 10- to 20-fold increase in expression) indicates that the agent is a VDR agonist. Other methods include transfected reporter gene constructs and FRET assays. In some example, binding of an agonist to a purified LBD is detected by measuring induced recruitment for coactivator peptides (e.g., LXXLL). For example VDR agonists can increase CYP24A1 expression in a VDR-expressing cell by at least 20%, at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 90% at least 100%, at least 200% or oven at least 1000% or more as compared to the absence of the agonist.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">VDR agonists include molecules that can bind to and activate the VDR, such as 1α,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>-D3 and precursors and analogs thereof, VDR ligands, and VDR agonist precursors. The disclosure is not limited to particular vitamin D agonists. A variety of biologically active vitamin D agonists are contemplated. Exemplary agents are known in the art. The VDR agonist in one example is a non-naturally occurring VDR agonist.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">In some examples the VDR agonist is used for treatment in combination with other therapeutic agents, such as one or more nuclear receptor ligands, including but not limited to ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-γ, NR1C3), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-α, NR1C1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-delta (PPAR-δ, NR1C2), farnesoid x receptor (FXR, NR1H4), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), curcumin, anti-oxidants including, but not limited to vitamin E, retinoids such as Vitamin A, and therapies that deliver proteases to the liver to degrade pathological ECM.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">F. Incorporation of Vitamin D receptor agonists into Pharmaceuticals</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">The disclosed methods of treating cancer or treating/preventing pancreatitis include administering one or more VDR agonists, such as 1α,25(OH)<sub>2 </sub>D<sub>3</sub>, calcipotriol, paricalcitol, vitamin D precursors (for instance, 25-hydroxy-D<sub>3 </sub>(25-OH-D<sub>3</sub>) (calcidiol); vitamin D<sub>3 </sub>(cholecalciferol); or vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol)), vitamin D analogs, and VDR agonist precursors to the subject in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and in an amount effective to inhibit (for example to relieve, cure, ameliorate, or prevent) the development, progression, or manifestation of pancreatitis in the subject. The present disclosure also contemplates the administration of a therapeutic composition comprising more than one VDR agonist, as well as VDR agonists in combination with other therapies (such as chemotherapy and/or biologic therapy to treat cancer as provided herein).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">The vehicle in which the VDR agonist is delivered can include pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of the compounds, using methods well known to those with skill in the art. Any of the common carriers, such as sterile saline or glucose solution, can be utilized. The vehicle also can contain conventional pharmaceutical adjunct materials such as, for example, pharmaceutically acceptable salts to adjust the osmotic pressure, lipid carriers such as cyclodextrins, proteins such as serum albumin, hydrophilic agents such as methyl cellulose, detergents, buffers, preservatives and the like. A more complete explanation of parenteral pharmaceutical carriers can be found in Remington: <i>The Science and Practice of Pharmacy </i>(19th Edition, 1995) in chapter 95.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">Embodiments of other pharmaceutical compositions can be prepared with conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants, and counter-ions, as would be known to those of skill in the art. The compositions in some embodiments are in the form of a unit dose in solid, semi-solid, and liquid dosage forms, such as tablets, pills, capsules, lozenges, powders, liquid solutions, or suspensions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">In some embodiments, sustained release of the pharmaceutical preparation that includes an effective amount of a VDR agonist is beneficial. Slow-release formulations are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. By way of example, sustained-release tablets can be formulated so that the active ingredient is embedded in a matrix of insoluble substance so that the dissolving drug emerges gradually through the holes in the matrix. In some formulations, the matrix physically swells to form a gel, so that the drug has first to dissolve in matrix, then exit through the outer surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">In one example, a preferred dose of the VDR agonist for the present methods is the maximum that a patient can tolerate and not develop serious hypercalcemia. In one embodiment, the therapeutic administration of the VDR agonist compounds only causes mild hypercalcemia. In another example, the VDR agonists do not cause symptoms of hypercalcemia.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">Therapeutically effective doses of vitamin D2 and D3 range, in some embodiments, from about 50 IU to about 50,000 IU. In some embodiments, for instance, vitamin D2 and/or D3 is administered in an oral dose of, for example, less than about 75 IU, about 100 IU, about 250 IU, about 500 IU, about 750 IU, about 1,000 IU, about 1,500 IU, about 2,000 IU, about 2,500 IU, about 5,000 IU, about 7,500 IU, about 10,000 IU, about 15,000 IU, about 20,000 IU, about 25,000 IU, about 40,000 IU, or about 50,000 IU, or more. In other embodiments, calcitriol is administered in a dose of from 0.001 to 10 micrograms. For instance, calcitrol is administered, in some embodiments, in a dose of about 0.01 μg, about 0.05 μg, about 0.1 μg, about 0.25 μg, about 0.5 μg, about 1 μg, about 5 μg, or about 10 μg. In one embodiment, the VDR agonist is calcipotriol administered at a dose of at least 1 μg/kg, at least 10 μg/kg, at least 25 μg/kg, at least 50 μg/kg, at least 60 μg/kg, or at least 100 μg/kg, such as 1 to 1000 μg/kg, 1 to 100 μg/kg, 1 to 75 μg/kg, 10 to 80 μg/kg, 30 to 75 μg/kg, or 50 to 70 μg/kg, such as 10 μg/kg, 20 μg/kg, 30 μg/kg, 40 μg/kg, 50 μg/kg, 60 μg/kg, 70 μg/kg, 80 μg/kg, 90 μg/kg, 100 μg/kg, 110 μg/kg or 120 μg/kg. In some examples, such doses of calcipotriol are administered by intraperitoneal or intravenous injection. In one embodiment, the VDR agonist is paricalcitol administered at a dose of at least 0.1 μg, at least 1 μg, at least 5 μg at least 10 μg, at least 20 μg, at least 50 μg, or at least 100 μg, such as 1 to 20 μg, 5 to 15 μg or 8 to 12 μg, such as 1 μg, 2 μg, 3 μg, 4 μg, 5 μg, 6 μg, 7 μg, 8 μg, 9 μg, 10 μg, 11 μg, 12 μg, 13 μg, 14 μg, 15 μg, 16 μg, 17 μg, 18 μg, 19 μg, or 20 μg. In some examples, such doses of calcipotriol are administered by intravenous injection 3 times weekly. In some embodiments, larger doses of VDR agonists are administered via a delivery route that targets the organ of interest, for instance the pancreas, liver, kidney, lung or prostate. Such targeting methods are described more fully below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">In certain embodiments, the VDR agonist is administered orally, for instance, in single or divided doses. For oral administration, the compositions are, for example, provided in the form of a tablet containing 1.0 to 1000 mg of the active ingredient, such as at least 75 IU, at least 100 IU, at least 250 IU, at least 500 IU, at least 750 IU, at least 800 IU, at least 1,000 IU, at least 1,500 IU, at least 2,000 IU, at least 2,500 IU, at least 5,000 IU, at least 7,500 IU, at least 10,000 IU, at least 15,000 IU, at least 20,000 IU, at least 25,000 IU, at least 40,000 IU, or 5 at least 0,000 IU per day, for example 50 IU to 2000 IU per day, 100 IU to 1000 IU per day, such as 800 IU per day, or more of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the subject being treated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">An effective parenteral dose could be expected to be lower, for example in the range of about 0.001 μg to about 10 μg, depending on the compound. Because the dosage and dosage regimen must be individually considered in the case of each subject according to sound professional judgment taking into account for example the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and severity of the condition of the host undergoing therapy, in some instances lower doses will be desirable, while in others larger doses will be required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">In another embodiment, if the VDR agonist is not a 1α-hydroxy compound, a daily dose between 1.0 and 100 μg per day per 160 pound patient is administered, such as between 5.0 and 50 μg per day per 160 pound patient. In a different embodiment, if the biologically active vitamin D compound is a 1α-hydroxy compound, a daily dose of between 0.1 and 20 μg per day per 160 pound patient is administered, while a preferred dose is between 0.5 and 10μ per day per 160 pound patient. In a particular example, the dose is between 3-10 μg per day.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">In one example, the VDR agonists is cholecalciferol or calcidiol. In some examples, a higher dose than usual is administered, but with less frequency, for example, 50,000 to 500,000 units weekly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">The present disclosure also includes combinations of vitamin D receptor agonists with one or more other agents useful in the treatment of GLP-1 agonist induced pancreatitis. For example, in some embodiments, a VDR agonist is administered in combination with effective doses of other medicinal and pharmaceutical agents. In some embodiments, one or more known anti-pancreatitis drugs are included with the vitamin D receptor agonist.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">The present disclosure also includes combinations of VDR agonists with one or more other agents useful in the treatment of cancer, such as a chemotherapeutic and/or biologic. For example, in some embodiments, a VDR agonist is administered in combination with effective doses of other medicinal and pharmaceutical chemotherapeutic and/or biologic agents (such as simultaneously, concurrently or one before the other). In some embodiments, one or more chemotherapeutic and/or biologic agent are included with the VDR agonist.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">G. Exemplary Chemotherapies and Biologic Therapies</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">The disclosed methods of treating a cancer that has active stellate cells (such as those with CXCL12 activity) can use VDR agonists in combination with other therapeutic agents, such as chemotherapies and biotherapies. Chemotherapies and biotherapies can include anti-neoplastic chemotherapeutic agents, antibiotics, alkylating agents and antioxidants, kinase inhibitors, and other agents such as antibodies. Methods and therapeutic dosages of such agents are known to those skilled in the art, and can be determined by a skilled clinician. Other therapeutic agents, for example anti-tumor agents, that may or may not fall under one or more of the classifications below, also are suitable for administration in combination with the described VDR agonists. Selection and therapeutic dosages of such agents are known to those skilled in the art, and can be determined by a skilled clinician. For example, the chemotherapy and/or biologic used in the treatment in combination with one or more VDR agonists can be selected based on the cancer to be treated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">In one example, a chemotherapy or biotherapy increases killing of cancer cells (or reduces their viability). Such killing need not result in 100% reduction of cancer cells; for example a cancer chemotherapy that results in reduction in the number of viable cancer cells by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 90%, or at least 95% (for example as compared to no treatment with the cancer chemotherapy or bio-therapy) can be used in the methods provided herein. For example, the cancer chemotherapy or bio-therapy can reduce the growth of cancer cells by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 90%, or at least 95% (for example as compared to no chemotherapy or bio-therapy).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">Particular examples of chemotherapeutic agents that can be used include alkylating agents, such as nitrogen mustards (for example, chlorambucil, chlormethine, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, and melphalan), nitrosoureas (for example, carmustine, fotemustine, lomustine, and streptozocin), platinum compounds (for example, carboplatin, cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and BBR3464), busulfan, dacarbazine, mechlorethamine, procarbazine, temozolomide, thiotepa, and uramustine; folic acid (for example, methotrexate, pemetrexed, and raltitrexed), purine (for example, cladribine, clofarabine, fludarabine, mercaptopurine, and tioguanine), pyrimidine (for example, capecitabine), cytarabine, fluorouracil, and gemcitabine; plant alkaloids, such as podophyllum (for example, etoposide, and teniposide); microtubule binding agents (such as paclitaxel, docetaxel, vinblastine, vindesine, vinorelbine (navelbine) vincristine, the epothilones, colchicine, dolastatin 15, nocodazole, podophyllotoxin, rhizoxin, and derivatives and analogs thereof), DNA intercalators or cross-linkers (such as cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin, mitomycins, such as mitomycin C, bleomycin, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, and derivatives and analogs thereof), DNA synthesis inhibitors (such as methotrexate, 5-fluoro-5′-deoxyuridine, 5-fluorouracil and analogs thereof); anthracycline family members (for example, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin, mitoxantrone, and valrubicin); antimetabolites, such as cytotoxic/antitumor antibiotics, bleomycin, rifampicin, hydroxyurea, and mitomycin; topoisomerase inhibitors, such as topotecan and irinotecan; photosensitizers, such as aminolevulinic acid, methyl aminolevulinate, porfimer sodium, and verteporfin, enzymes, enzyme inhibitors (such as camptothecin, etoposide, formestane, trichostatin and derivatives and analogs thereof), kinase inhibitors (such as imatinib, gefitinib, and erolitinib), gene regulators (such as raloxifene, 5-azacytidine, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, tamoxifen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, mifepristone and derivatives and analogs thereof); and other agents, such as alitretinoin, altretamine, amsacrine, anagrelide, arsenic trioxide, asparaginase, axitinib, bexarotene, bevacizumab, bortezomib, celecoxib, denileukin diftitox, estramustine, hydroxycarbamide, lapatinib, pazopanib, pentostatin, masoprocol, mitotane, pegaspargase, tamoxifen, sorafenib, sunitinib, vemurafinib, vandetanib, and tretinoin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">In one example, a bio-therapy includes or consists of an antibody, such as a humanized antibody. Such antibodies can be polyclonal, monoclonal, or chimeric antibodies. As noted above, methods of making antibodies specific for a particular target is routine. In some example, the therapeutic antibody is conjugated to a toxin. Exemplary biotherapies include alemtuzumab, bevacizumab, cetuximab, gemtuzumab, rituximab, panitumumab, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">Other examples of bio-therapy include inhibitory nucleic acid molecules, such as an antisense oligonucleotide, a siRNA, a microRNA (miRNA), a shRNA or a ribozyme. Any type of antisense compound that specifically targets and regulates expression of a target nucleic acid is contemplated for use. An antisense compound is one which specifically hybridizes with and modulates expression of a target nucleic acid molecule. These compounds can be introduced as single-stranded, double-stranded, circular, branched or hairpin compounds and can contain structural elements such as internal or terminal bulges or loops. Double-stranded antisense compounds can be two strands hybridized to form double-stranded compounds or a single strand with sufficient self complementarity to allow for hybridization and formation of a fully or partially double-stranded compound. In some examples, an antisense oligonucleotide is a single stranded antisense compound, such that when the antisense oligonucleotide hybridizes to a target mRNA, the duplex is recognized by RNaseH, resulting in cleavage of the mRNA. In other examples, a miRNA is a single-stranded RNA molecule of about 21-23 nucleotides that is at least partially complementary to an mRNA molecule that regulates gene expression through an RNAi pathway. In further examples, a shRNA is an RNA oligonucleotide that forms a tight hairpin, which is cleaved into siRNA. siRNA molecules are generally about 20-25 nucleotides in length and may have a two nucleotide overhang on the 3′ ends, or may be blunt ended. Generally, one strand of a siRNA is at least partially complementary to a target nucleic acid. Antisense compounds specifically targeting a gene can be prepared by designing compounds that are complementary to a target nucleotide sequence, such as a mRNA sequence. Antisense compounds need not be 100% complementary to the target nucleic acid molecule to specifically hybridize and regulate expression of the target. For example, the antisense compound, or antisense strand of the compound if a double-stranded compound, can be at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 99% or 100% complementary to a target nucleic acid sequence. Methods of screening antisense compounds for specificity are well known (see, for example, U.S. Publication No. 2003-0228689). In addition, methods of designing, preparing and using inhibitory nucleic acid molecules are within the abilities of one of skill in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">H. Routes of Administration</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">It is not intended that the present disclosure be limited to a particular mode of administering the VDR agonists, chemotherapies and biotherapies. A variety of modes of administration are contemplated, including intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intradermally, intraperitoneally, intrapleurally, intrathecally, orally, rectally, transdermally, by inhalation, and topically. In certain embodiments, the therapeutic compositions are administered via suppository, or in tablet or capsule formulations for oral delivery. In one embodiment, administration of the therapeutic compositions occurs at night. In another embodiment, multiple doses (e.g., 3 or 4) are provided in a 24 hour period. In a further embodiment, the administration of the therapeutic composition is by pulse intravenous therapy. In one example, the therapeutic compositions are administered via a transdermal patch (skin patch).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">For instance a VDR agonist, chemotherapy and/or biotherapy is administered, in one embodiment, intravenously in any conventional medium for intravenous injection, such as an aqueous saline medium, or in blood plasma medium. In other embodiments, administration is oral, for instance as a liquid or a pill. In other embodiments, administration is rectal, for example via a suppository containing the VDR agonist, chemotherapy and/or biotherapy. In still other embodiments, administration is by direct infusion into an artery of the lung, kidney, pancreas, prostate, or liver with a pharmaceutical composition that contains a VDR agonist, chemotherapy and/or biotherapy. In yet other embodiments, a target delivery technology is used to deliver the composition to the target tissue, for instance the lung, kidney, pancreas, prostate, or liver. In one specific, non-limiting example, the VDR agonist, chemotherapy and/or biotherapy is designed to be taken up by the target tissue, or is linked to a target-specific carrier molecule that facilitates uptake by the target cells. For instance, for stellate cells, the VDR agonist can be conjugated to a receptor for low- and/or high-density lipoproteins (LDL and/or HDL receptors).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">The present disclosure also provides a transdermal patch that includes a therapeutic composition comprising a VDR agonist, chemotherapy and/or biotherapy. In one embodiment, the transdermal patch includes a therapeutically effective amount of a VDR agonist, chemotherapy and/or biotherapy. In another embodiment, the transdermal patch further includes a single polymer or multiple polymers. In one example, the transdermal patch further includes a polyurethane acrylic copolymer. In one embodiment, the transdermal patch further includes silicone or polyisobutylene or both. In one embodiment, the transdermal patch is worn by a subject at risk for developing GLP-1 agonist induced pancreatitis. In another embodiment, the transdermal patch is worn by a subject with symptoms of GLP-1 agonist induced pancreatitis. In another embodiment, the transdermal patch delivers a VDR agonist to a subject in a continuous manner under conditions such that symptoms of GLP-1 agonist induced pancreatitis are reduced. In one embodiment, the transdermal patch is worn by a subject having a cancer of the lung, kidney, pancreas, prostate, or liver.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">Pharmaceutical compositions of VDR agonist, chemotherapy and/or biotherapy according to the present disclosure can be administered at about the same dose throughout a treatment period, in an escalating dose regimen, or in a loading-dose regime (for instance, in which the loading dose is about two to five times the maintenance dose). In some embodiments, the dose is varied during the course of a treatment based on the condition of the subject being treated, the severity of the disease or condition, the apparent response to the therapy, and/or other factors as judged by one of ordinary skill in the art. In some embodiments long-term treatment with the drug is contemplated, for instance in order to prevent or reduce the re-occurrence of GLP-1 agonist induced pancreatitis in a subject.</div>

In this study, enrollment was restricted to mice with tumors of a mean diameter between 6 and 9 mm, as determined by high resolution ultrasound imaging. Suitable mice were assigned to a treatment group: gemcitabine; calcipotriol; or gemcitabine and calcipotriol combination. Gemcitabine was administered as a saline solution at 100 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection, once every three days; when appropriate, a final dose was given two hours prior to euthanasia. Calcipotriol was administered as a saline solution daily at 60 μg/kg by intraperitoneal injection.

<heading id="h-0047">Identification of Cancer-Associated Gene Signatures in PSCs</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0163">To characterize cancer-associated changes in PSCs, massively parallel sequencing (RNA-Seq) of the PSC transcriptome was performed at various stages of activation. The progressive activation of primary PSCs in culture (Omary et al., 2007) was capitalized, and the transcriptome of pre-activated (3-day culture) and activated (7-day culture) PSCs isolated from healthy mouse pancreas were analyzed (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2C</figref>). This analysis revealed that, during activation, PSCs decrease expression of genes implicated in lipid storage and lipid metabolism, consistent with loss of the lipid droplet phenotype associated with quiescence. Activation also resulted in increased expression of a cadre of genes previously associated with tumor-supporting potential including cytokines, growth factors, ECM components, and signaling molecules such as Wnts. Concurrent induction of inflammatory genes was of particular interest, as cytokine induction by the stroma has been shown to promote pancreatic cancer initiation and progression in a paracrine manner (Fukuda et al., 2011; Lesina et al., 2011).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0164">In addition to the PSC “activation signature” resulting from transdifferentiation in culture, the PSC “cancer signature” was analyzed to further define the cancer-associated PSC phenotype. Human PSCs isolated from patients with PDA (CAPSCs) or from patients undergoing resection for benign conditions were also subjected to transcriptome analysis (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). These human PSCs were cultured (and thus culture-activated) for 15 days to achieve adequate yield and purity. This comparison of activated non-cancer associated PSCs to cancer-associated PSCs reveals changes to the activated phenotype resulting from exposure to the tumor microenvironment. Both the activation and cancer signatures include gene classes from a previously identified stromal signature which predicts poor survival and chemoresistance in PDA (Garrido-Laguna et al., 2011). In addition, lipid storage genes such as fatty acid binding proteins were downregulated in both signatures, and were accompanied by increased expression of genes implicated in the cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake pathway, consistent with an increased proliferative capacity. Given a tenuous blood supply and the severely avascular nature of PDA, particularly within stromal regions, the reciprocal induction of negative angiogenic regulators and suppression of angiogenic inducers is auspicious (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>). In particular the induction of thrombospondin-1 (Thbs1), a well-described and potent endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis and a marker of solid tumors (Lawler, 2002), was observed. Both gene signatures include ECM components, cell adhesion molecules, inflammatory mediators, paracrine growth and survival factors, genes implicated in lipid/cholesterol metabolism and modulators of signal transduction.</div>
<heading id="h-0048">Example 3</heading>
<heading id="h-0049">VDR Regulates the PSC Activation Network</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0165">These analyses also revealed that PSCs unexpectedly express high levels of the vitamin D receptor (VDR), previously thought not to be expressed in the exocrine pancreas (Zeitz et al., 2003) (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1D, 1E, 2D and 2E</figref>). VDR expression was maintained in the cancer-associated PSCs (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>). This druggable receptor was examined in light of previous work implicating VDR as a critical regulator of the fibrogenic gene network in closely related hepatic stellate cells (Ding et al., 2013) and due to the established anti-inflammatory (Cantorna et al., 1996, 1998; Cantorna et al., 2000; Ma et al., 2006; Nagpal et al., 2005; Deeb et al., 2007) actions of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3 </sub>and its analogues. Also germane to this study is the strong inverse correlation between plasma vitamin D levels and pancreatic cancer risk (Wolpin et al., 2012), a relationship that remains unexplained. Further, vitamin D deficiency has been linked to chronic pancreatitis (Mann et al., 2003).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0167" num="0166">Calcipotriol (Cal), a potent and nonhypercalcemic vitamin D analog was used to control VDR induction (Naveh-Many and Silver, 1993). While not present in any post-surgical CAPSCs, surprisingly, Cal treatment induced lipid droplet formation in 19/27 primary patient samples (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 4A</figref>), and decreased expression of αSMA (ACTA2) in 24/27 patient samples (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>), consistent with reversion to quiescence.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0167">To assess the genome-wide effects of VDR activation in PSCs, transcriptome analysis of pre-activated and activated PSCs grown in the presence or absence of VDR ligand was performed. While Cal treatment affected gene expression in pre-activated PSCs (significantly increased and decreased expression of 307 and 431 genes, respectively), VDR activation had a more widespread transcriptional response in activated PSCs (664 and 1616 genes with significantly increased and decreased expression, respectively). A Cal-dependent inhibition of the activation and cancer signatures in PSCs was observed (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, Table 3), including suppression of negative regulators of angiogenesis such as Thbs1 and induction of positive regulators of angiogenesis like Mmp9 (Bergers et al., 2000) (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0170" num="0169">Similar effects of Cal treatment were observed on selected candidate genes in human CAPSCs (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>). Furthermore, these effects were dependent on VDR, as siRNA-mediated knockdown of the receptor abrogated Cal-induced expression changes (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref>). To explain, in part, the broad impact of VDR on the PSC activation program, genomic crosstalk between VDR and the TGFβ/SMAD pathway was assessed (Schneider et al., 2001; Yanagisawa et al., 1999), which was previously demonstrated in hepatic stellate cells (Ding et al., 2013). Consistent with an inhibitory effect on TGFβ/SMAD signaling, Cal increased VDR binding while decreasing SMAD3 binding in the promoter regions of fibrogenic genes (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B and 4C</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0171" num="0170">To determine whether VDR activation decreased PSC activation in vivo, we induced experimental chronic pancreatitis in wild type mice using the cholecystokinin analog cerulein (Willemer et al., 1992), and co-administered Cal throughout disease progression. Compared to mice receiving cerulein alone, Cal-treated animals displayed attenuated inflammation and fibrosis, consistent with decreased PSC activation (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>). Expression of activation and cancer signature genes was decreased in isolated PSCs from mice treated with Cal compared to controls (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>). Reductions were observed on activation signature genes which are of functional significance in the tumor microenvironment, including ECM components, inflammatory cytokines and growth factors. In addition, Acta2 expression, which is associated with cell motility, trended downwards. Further, reduced induction of phospho-Stat3 was observed in Cal-treated mice (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>), consistent with decreased inflammatory signaling from the stroma. Notably, Stat3 activation has been established as a mechanistic link between inflammatory damage and initiation of PDA (Fukuda et al., 2011; Lesina et al., 2011).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0172" num="0171">Cal treatment during acute pancreatitis in wild type mice similarly impaired activation-associated changes in PSC gene expression (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>), and reduced leukocyte infiltration and fibrosis (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3D and 3E</figref>). Given the impressive inhibition of PSC activation upon Cal treatment, PSC states were determined in mice lacking a functional VDR. Strikingly, pancreata from Vdr<sup>−/−</sup> mice displayed spontaneous periacinar and periductal fibrosis (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>), further supporting a role for VDR in opposing PSC activation. Consistent with this notion, activation-associated changes in PSC gene expression were augmented in cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis in Vdr<sup>−/−</sup> mice (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6F</figref>) and were accompanied by increased fibrosis (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6G</figref>). Furthermore, Cal treatment of culture-activated PSCs from Vdr<sup>−/−</sup> mice demonstrated the VDR dependence of the observed gene expression changes (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6H</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0173" num="0172">Together, these results indicate that VDR acts as a master genomic regulator of the PSC activation program, and that VDR induction by ligand restores and promotes the quiescent PSC state both in vitro and in vivo.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0174" num="0173">The impact of VDR activation in PSCs on crosstalk to tumor cells was determined. While CAPSCs consistently expressed VDR and responded to ligand, pancreatic cancer cell lines displayed varying VDR expression, and typically low VDR activity (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>). This was also observed in human PDA samples (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0175" num="0174">To specifically assess the contribution of stromal VDR activation on the epithelial compartment, the effects of CAPSC-derived secreted factors on the MiaPaCa-2 cell line, which has extremely low VDR expression and no significant response to VDR ligand, were examined (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>). Primary CAPSCs were grown to confluency, and cultured in the presence or absence of Cal for the final 48 hours of culture. CAPSC conditioned media (CM) was then collected from these cultures, and transferred to MiaPaCa-2 cells for 48 hours. Volcano plot analysis of gene expression in MiaPaCa-2 cells incubated in CAPSC CM revealed broad changes (center panel), which were largely abrogated (right panel) when CM from Cal-treated CAPSCs was used (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>). CAPSC CM induced gene expression changes in epithelial cells implicated in proliferation (Table 4), survival, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and chemoresistance.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0177" num="0176">These changes were broadly inhibited by stromal, but not epithelial, VDR activation (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>), though direct anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of VDR activation in pancreatic cancer cells have been reported in other experimental systems (Persons et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2010). This sensitivity to stromal but not epithelial VDR activation was replicated in pancreatic cancer cell lines with variable VDR expression (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8C-8G</figref>). Stromal VDR activation significantly reduced CSF2 expression, which has recently been implicated in pancreatic tumor progression and evasion of antitumor immunity (Bayne et al., 2012; Pylayeva-Gupta et al., 2012). Gene expression changes were accompanied by decreased induction of phospho-STAT3 (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8H</figref>) and decreased resistance to chemotherapy in vitro (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8I</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0178" num="0177">These results demonstrate that VDR activation in PSCs negatively regulates the tumor-supporting PSC secretome.</div>

<heading id="h-0053">VDR Ligand Plus Gemcitabine Shows Efficacy Against PDA In Vivo</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0179" num="0178">The above results indicate that apparent failure of single agent ‘Vitamin D therapy’ in treating human PDA may reflect that treatment of the stroma alone may be insufficient to achieve a therapeutic benefit. In addition, agents directly targeting the tumor may have limited impact due to intrinsic chemoresistance associated with tumor hypovascularity. A principal goal for PSC targeted therapy is to exploit the inhibition of tumor-stroma crosstalk to enhance efficacy of a cytotoxic (or immunologic) agent, which in the case of gemcitabine, though standard of care, offers minimal (1.5 month) benefit to PDA patients (Burris et al., 1997).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0180" num="0179">To demonstrate the potential of vitamin D combination therapy, Cal treatment in an orthotopic allograft model utilizing immune-competent hosts was examined (Collisson et al., 2012). The tumor cells for transplantation were derived from mice which conditionally express endogenous mutant Kras, lack p53 in the pancreas (Bardeesy et al., 2006), and express low levels of Vdr (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>). Two other mouse PDA-derived cell lines demonstrated low VDR expression and activity as well (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>). This indicates that any observed therapeutic effect would likely result from host-derived stromal VDR activation, though some contribution from the epithelial compartment is not excluded. Though the stromal reaction in transplant models of PDA is subdued compared to the spontaneous KPC (LSL-Kras<sup>G12D/+</sup>;LSL-Trp53<sup>R172H/+</sup>;Pdx-1-Cre) model (Hingorani et al., 2005; Olive et al., 2009), measureable PSC activation of Col1α1, Col1α2, and Acta2 was observed in allograft recipients, accompanied by fibrosis (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9C and 9D</figref>). Cal treatment decreased stromal activation and fibrosis in transplanted mice (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9E</figref>). Though transplant models are responsive to gemcitabine, mice treated with gemcitabine were compared to those treated with a combination of gemcitabine and Cal Importantly, in combination therapy recipients, a clear improvement in gemcitabine responsiveness was observed with respect to inhibition of proliferation and expression of stromal and epithelial genes from the observed signatures for PSC activation (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9F and 9G</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0181" num="0180">The efficacy of gemcitabine plus Cal combination therapy was examined in the KPC model, which recapitulates human PDA in poor uptake of and response to gemcitabine (Olive et al., 2009). Combination therapy significantly reduced tumor volume with transient or sustained tumor regression observed in ˜70% of mice (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 11A</figref>). In agreement with the induction of stromal remodeling, reduced tumor-associated fibrosis was observed in mice which received combination therapy compared to controls (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>). Further, combination-treated mice demonstrated significantly altered expression of genes from the stromal and epithelial gene signatures associated with PSC activation (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0182" num="0181">The decreased expression of PSC activation genes and induction of quiescence marker Fabp4 indicates that the tumor-associated PSCs are shifting from an activated toward a quiescent state. The observed differential sensitivity of individual genes to the drug treatment regimens may be the result of specific perturbations to stromal-tumor paracrine signaling in vivo.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0183" num="0182">Combination therapy also increased intratumoral concentration and efficacy of gemcitabine (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10D and 11B</figref>), with ˜500% increase in the median concentration of dFdCTP, an active metabolite of gemcitabine, in mice that received combination therapy compared to gemcitabine alone. No drug-induced changes were seen in the expression levels of the gemcitabine degrading enzyme cytidine deaminase (Cda) or the rate-limiting deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>), though allosteric effects are possible. Increased dFdCTP was accompanied by increased positivity for apoptotic marker CC3, indicating improved chemotherapeutic efficacy (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10E</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0184" num="0183">Furthermore, intratumoral vasculature was significantly increased by combination therapy, evidenced by increased CD31 positivity and apparent vessel patency (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12B and 12C</figref>). Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor sections showed that the collapsed vascular network that characterizes PDA was markedly revitalized after combination therapy, indicating that intratumoral gemcitabine concentration was increased by means of improved drug delivery. While the combination of Cal with gemcitabine markedly improved therapeutic efficacy, Cal showed no measurable beneficial effects as a single agent in the KPC model (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>).</div>

<heading id="h-0055">Randomized Phase II/Pharmacodynamic/Genomic Study of Neoadjuvant Paricalcitol to Target the Microenvironment in Resectable Pancreatic Cancer</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0185" num="0184">This example describes methods used to demonstrate the synergistic effects of combining a VDR agonist with a chemotherapeutic, to treat a cancer traditionally resistant to chemotherapy or immunotherapy. Although specific VDR agonists and chemotherapeutics for pancreatic cancer are disclosed, one skilled in the art will appreciate that other VDR agonists can be combined with other chemotherapies or biologic therapies (e.g., using known dosages and modes of administration for each) for a particular cancer, such as a cancer of the lung, kidney, prostate, bile duct, or liver.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0186" num="0185">The effect of targeting the VDR transcriptional pathway in the tumors of patients treated with one cycle of gemcitabine/abraxane with or without paricalcitol prior to surgery for resectable pancreatic cancer can be determined through an assessment of cellular and imaging markers. The methods were also performed to determine the effect of gemcitabine/abraxane with or without paricalcitol on tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the primary tumor in resectable pancreatic cancer; identify effects of paricalcitol on the VDR-regulated pancreatic stellate cell gene expression program; determine the safety of this neoadjuvant approach; and analyze circulating markers of endothelial cell function and oxidative stress in paricalcitol-treated patients.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0187" num="0186">Abraxane (nab-paclitaxel) is a cremophor-free formulation of nanoparticle paclitaxel stabilized with human serum albumin (130 nm particles). The drug achieves enhanced tumor penetration through gp60 albumin receptor-mediated endothelial transcytosis, which enables transit across the vessel endothelium, and makes the active paclitaxel available to the tumor. An additional pharmacodynamic consideration is that the albumin scaffold also binds a tumor-related protein SPARC, which may further enhance localization of this molecule in the tumor tissue. Preliminary data suggest that SPARC-expressing tumors may have better responses to abraxane. In the phase II trial of gemcitabine/abraxane, among 58 evaluable patients there were 23 partial responses (40%) and equivalent number of patients with stable disease (SD) of 4 months or longer, and a median survival of 10.3 months (Von Hoff et al., <i>J Clin Oncol. </i>2011; 29:4548-54). Toxicity was generally well-tolerated, though greater than expected with gemcitabine alone. Dose delays were mainly due to blood/bone marrow treatment-related AEs (mostly neutrophils). There were no nab-paclitaxel dose interruptions due to treatment-related AEs, and 2 instances of dose interruptions for gemcitabine (dermatology/skin: injection site reaction). Also, 2 patients had a total of 3 treatment-related AEs involving blood/bone marrow (neutrophils and platelets) resulting in dose reductions and 2 treatment-related AE resulted in dose discontinuation (gastrointestinal: diarrhea and infection: systemic). There were 3 treatment-emergent AEs resulting in death (lung infection, systemic infection, and gastrointestinal obstruction), but only systemic infection was considered treatment-related. Patients treated with nab-paclitaxel in combination with gemcitabine had levels of myelosuppression consistent with those expected following treatment with taxanes (Von Hoff et al., <i>J Clin Oncol. </i>2011; 29:4548-54).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0188" num="0187">The neoadjuvant setting provides a framework to combine clinical results and advanced tissue biomarkers to address key questions for targeted cancer therapy. Despite the advances afforded by targeted therapies in selected solid tumors, in pancreatic as in other epithelial cancers progress been modest in the past ten years. One advance has been in the application of systemic therapy and radiation therapy in advance of, instead of after surgery. The advantages of this neoadjuvant approach are many, and include: earlier systemic therapy of what is usually systemic (i.e., not local) disease; better tolerability of chemotherapy and of chemoradiation than in the post-operative setting, allowing more patients to receive the full doses and duration of therapy; smaller radiation fields when the tissue planes have not been disrupted by surgery; shrinkage of the primary tumor to facilitate surgical resection; and, no loss of patients who would benefit from surgery, i.e., no progression during this phase to render a potentially operable patient inoperable. Neoadjuvant therapy is now widely used in locoregionally advanced cancers of lung, breast, gastrointestinal, head and neck, urological, and gynecological origin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0189" num="0188">In this trial, an analysis of the effects of VDR activation in stellate cells in the initial therapy of pancreatic cancer will be performed. The paricalcitol (25 μg) dose was selected based on its broad use over a decade in the management of calcium and vitamin D homeostasis in patients undergoing renal dialysis. Paricalcitol is chemically designated as 19-nor-1α,3β,25-trihydroxy-9,10-secoergosta5(Z),7(E),22(E)-triene, and is a non-metabolized vitamin D analogue that has little hypercalcemic activity. As such, it is a good exemplary compound to effect the desired transcriptional change in the stellate cells. The recommended starting dose of paricalcitol is 0.04 μg/kg (or about 3 μg per dose), but total weekly doses of 15 to 30 μg are reported in the literature without safety concerns (Izquierdo et al., <i>BMC nephrology </i>13:159, 2012; Ketteler et al., <i>Nephrol Dial Transplant. </i>27(8):3270-8, 2012; Tonbul et al. <i>Ren Fail. </i>34(3):297-303,12012), and a trial in combination with taxol in breast cancer patients gave up to 7 μg per day for 12 weeks (Lawrence et al., <i>Cancer Biol Ther </i>14: 476-80, 2013). Accordingly a three times weekly IV schedule (given concerns regarding oral absorption in pancreatic cancer patients) at a flat dose of 10 μg is provided. A detailed population pharmacokinetic analysis including over 600 patients showed mean plasma clearance of 1.75 l/h, and stable phosphorus and calcium levels in the first 30 days of treatment (Noertersheuser et al., <i>J Clin Pharmacol. </i>52(8):1162-73, 2012). This analysis lends support to the dose and schedule chosen here, and to the schedule of weekly electrolyte monitoring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0190" num="0189">In this study, pre-treatment chemotherapy (1 cycle, 4 weeks) alone or in combination with intravenous paricalcitol three times weekly, continuing the Vitamin D preparation up to the day before surgery, will be analyzed. The approach will be assessed in the completion of the therapy: success will be defined by over 90% of the patients getting to surgery. The primary endpoint of interest will be in the effects on tumor: compared with previous tumors examined is there evidence of a difference in fibrosis (qualitative, by immunohistochemistry), or in the appearance or proportion of the tumor cells, or infiltrating lymphocytes? Stellate cells will be microdissected for gene expression profiling, with a view to detecting a VDR-regulated signature in the paricalcitol-treated tumors. Stellate cells will be cultured from tumor fragments, and analyzed genomically and functionally. An immunological and inflammatory assessment at intervals can be performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0191" num="0190">Patients have previously, untreated apparently, resectable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas at registration. It is recognized that a few patients thought to have a cancer, and for whom surgery is indicated, may turn out not to have an adenocarcinoma (these patients will be replaced for the total accrual goal, but where possible samples of primary tumor will be obtained for the endpoints of the study), or may have previously unrecognized criteria for unresectability (these patients will continue to be treated with gemcitabine/abraxane/paricalcitol in the absence of progression, and their outcomes recorded). Patients are age 18 years or older and have an ECOG performance status of 0-2.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0194" num="0193">In some examples, Abraxane® is given first. Gemcitabine (2′-Deoxy-2′,2′-difluorocytidine monohydrochloride) administration may be either over 30 minutes (as in label) or at a rate of 10 mg/m2/minute as recommended elsewhere (Tempero et al., <i>J Clin Oncol. </i>21(18):3402-8, 2003). Dose modifications may therefore lead to changes in the infusion time if the latter approach is used. This cycle will be repeated every 4 weeks for two cycles (that is 8 weeks preoperative therapy in total). Surgery will occur (schedules permitting) within 4 weeks of the last dose of chemotherapy. Post-operative adjuvant chemotherapy will be at the discretion of the treating physician. Patients will receive an appropriate anti-emetic regimen usually including dexamethasone 10-20 mg IV and a 5-HT3 agent of choice, (i.e., ondansetron or granisetron) prior to administration of chemotherapy to decrease the incidence and severity of chemotherapy-associated nausea and vomiting. Drugs such as lorazepam may also be used if clinically indicated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0195" num="0194">Patients will begin treatment with intravenous paricalcitol at 10 μg three times weekly. There will be no dose escalation, but toxicity can be monitored weekly to detect calcium or phosphorous elevation which would require a 50% dose decrease (for Calcium&gt;11.5, hold therapy until return to normal).</div>

A DLT will be considered as any non-hematologic AE of Grade 3 or higher that is judged by the investigators to be probably treatment-related with the exception of nausea and vomiting which have not been treated with optimal anti-emetic therapy. The following hematologic toxicities will be considered a DLT if any occurs in the first cycle:</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0225" num="0225">Nab-Paclitaxel treatment can be withheld in patients who experience ≧Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy. Gemcitabine administration can continue during this period at the discretion of the investigator. Nab-Paclitaxel treatment may be resumed at the next lower dose level in subsequent cycles after the peripheral neuropathy improves to ≦Grade 1. Patients experiencing peripheral neuropathy may require an extended delay in scheduled nab-Paclitaxel dosing, but can remain on gemcitabine/HCQ, and have ‘nab-paclitaxel reintroduced at a subsequent cycle should the neuropathy improve as above. Patients receiving a reduced dose of nab-Paclitaxel who experience ≧Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy at that dose level requiring a dose delay ≧21 days without resolving to ≦Grade 1 should have ‘nab-paclitaxel discontinued.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0226" num="0226">As observed in other clinical trials, ≧Grade 3 neuropathy related to nab-Paclitaxel is usually seen in later phases of the treatment (cycle 6 and beyond). If ≧Grade 3 neuropathy occurs in early treatment cycles, other factors predisposing the patient to neuropathy might be present (e.g., diabetes, alcohol consumption, concomitant medications). To maintain dose intensity during the first 6 treatment cycles, careful consideration should be exercised when these predisposing factors are present.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0227" num="0227">Patients who develop Grade 2 or 3 cutaneous toxicity should have their dose reduced to the next lower dose level of both drugs. If the patient continues to experience these reactions, treatment should be discontinued. Patients who develop Grade 4 cutaneous toxicity should have treatment discontinued.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0228" num="0228">If Grade 3 mucositis or diarrhea occurs, study drug should be withheld until resolution to ≦Grade 1, then reinstituted at the next lower dose level of both drugs.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0229" num="0229">The use of growth factors to support neutrophil counts is permissible after cycle 1 if neutropenia would otherwise require a dose reduction to less than 100 mg/m2 of abraxane. GCSF may also be considered for therapeutic administration in the event of febrile neutropenia as noted above, according to institutional practice.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0230" num="0230">Thus, in some examples, paricalcitol is administered at 5 or 10 μg IV three times weekly for two-three weeks before surgery. One cycle of gemcitabine/abraxane can be given before surgery, and a 1-2 week interval or longer can be used to permit count recovery. Paricalcitol can be given for 28 days approximately prior to planned surgery, and can be continued up to the day before surgery, since there is no relevant toxicity of this micronutrient. Last dose can be 24 h before surgery (if surgery is delayed, and additional days of therapy may be given to reach the day before surgery). Post-operatively, beginning approximately 4-8 weeks after surgery, patients can be treated with gemcitabine/abraxane.paricalcitol for 3-5 cycles in total.</div>

Notably, the patient's serum CA 19-9 levels, commonly used as a marker for pancreatic tumors, reduced from 120 U/mL to 40 U/mL (normal non cancer patents levels range is 0-37 U/mL). Surgical re-sectioning revealed that the tumor was lighter than normal. Subsequent histological analysis revealed granulomas with few cancer cells. The presence of granulomas, collections of immune cells known as macrophages, indicate that in addition to increasing the efficacy of gemcitabine/abraxane cytotoxicity, this therapeutic approach also achieved a immune response, often blocked in pancreatic cancer. These results describe a novel and effective therapeutic route to treat pancreatic cancer.</div>
