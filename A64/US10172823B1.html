<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to platinum(II) complexes of heterocyclic thiones with anti-cancer activity and to methods of treating cancer using these complexes.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">Description of Related Art</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The “background” description provided herein is for the purpose of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently named inventor(s), to the extent it is described in this background section, as well as aspects of the description which may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the time of filing, are neither expressly or impliedly admitted as prior art against the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Platinum anticancer compounds in clinical use such as, cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin generally exist as neutral molecules and contain two fairly labile cis ligands, e.g., the two chloro groups in cisplatin. The labile ligands are replaced by water through aquation reactions and the resulting cations form bifunctional adducts with DNA. See T. C. Johnstone, et al., Chem. Rev. 16 (2016) 3436-3486; N. J Wheate, et al., Dalton Trans. 39 (2010) 8113-8127; J. J. Wilson, et al., Chem. Rev. 14 (2014) 4470-4495; Y. Jung, et al., Chem. Rev. 107 (2007) 1387-1407; D. Wong, et al., Nature Rev. Drug Disc. 4 (2005) 307-320; L. Kelland. Nat Rev Cancer. 7 (2004) 573-584; S. Dasari, et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2014, 364-378; S. V. Zutphen, et al., Coord. Chem. Rev. 249 (2005) 2845-2853; S. Ahmad, Chemistry &amp; Biodiversity 7 (2010) 543-566; T. W. Hambley, J. Chem. Soc., Dalton Trans. 2711 (2001); E. R Jamieson, et al., Chemical Reviews. 99 (1999) 2467-2498; and S. Ahmad, et al., Tran Metal Chem. 31 (2006) 1003-1016, each incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. The platinum(II) complexes having two labile groups in a trans conformation, for example trans-[Pt(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>] (transplatin) or monofunctional platinum(II) complexes, such as [PtCl(dien)]Cl (dien=diethylenetriamine) or [Pt(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Cl]Cl were ineffective. See E. R Jamieson et al., Chemical Reviews. 99 (1999) 2467-2498; S. Ahmad, et al., Tran Metal Chem. 31 (2006) 1003-1016; and K. S Lovejoy, et al, Dalton Trans (2009) 10651-10659, each incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. But later studies have shown that the replacement of one (or both) amine ligand(s) of transplatin by aliphatic amines or heterocyclic ligands such as planar pyridine or non-planar piperazine greatly enhances the cytotoxicity of such species with respect to their corresponding cis isomers and also to cisplatin particularly, in cisplatin-resistant tumor cell lines. See J. Kasparkova, et al., J. Inorg. Biochem. 153 (2015) 206-210; J. M. Perez, et al., Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 35 (2000) 109-120; Natile, G., et al., Coord Chem Rev 216-217 (2001) 383-410; Y. Najajreh, et al., J. Med. Chem 45(2002) 5189-5195; S. M. Aris, et al., Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. (2009) 1293-1302; C. Bartel, et al., J. Biol. Inorg Chem. 17 (2012) 465-74; and A. G Quiroga. J. Inorg. Biochem 114 (2012) 106-112, each incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Like cis-platinum-amine complexes, DNA is also considered as the potential cellular target for the antitumor derivatives of transplatin. However, the nature of Pt-DNA adducts is different for the two types of complexes. Cisplatin and its analogues mainly form 1,2-intrastrand cross-links, while transplatin is not able to form 1,2-intrastrand cross-links, because of the steric hindrance of the two amine groups in trans position. Instead it mainly forms 1,3-interstrand cross-links. See, A. Eastman, et al., Biochemistry 26 (1987) 3303-3307, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Transplatin may form 1,3-intrastrand cross-links between two G residues, or between a G and a C residue, separated by at least one base. The enhancement of activities in trans complexes was connected mainly with their enhanced accumulation in tumor cells and efficiency to form in DNA a markedly higher amount of more distorting cross-links than transplatin, which forms in DNA preferentially less distorting and persisting monofunctional adducts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Several structural studies of thione derivatives of transplatin have been reported, which describe a square-planar geometry around the metal center and the thione coordination in terminal S-bonded modes. See Arpalahti, et al., Inorg. Chim. Acta 153 (1988) 51-55; A. N. Westra, et al., Acta Crystallogr. C60 (2004) m395-m398; J. Fang, et al., Inorg Chim Acta 411 (2014) 5-10; Seerat-ur-Rehman, et al., Inorg Chem Commun, 36 (2013) 68-71; and S. Ahmad, et al., Monatsch. Chem. (2016), each incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. However, the antitumor properties of these complexes were not reported, although many other transplatin analogues are known to exhibit anticancer activities.</div>

<heading id="h-0007">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">One aspect of the invention is directed to platinum(II) complexes of heterocyclic thiones (L) based on transplatin having the general formula, trans-[Pt(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(Thione)<sub>2</sub>].2NO<sub>3</sub>. Another aspect of the invention is the use of these complexes as cytotoxic agents, especially against cancer cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">The inventors have successfully synthesized and then characterized these complexes using elemental analysis, IR, and NMR (<sup>1</sup>H &amp; <sup>13</sup>C) spectroscopy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">The crystal structures of two of them, trans-[Pt(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(Imt)<sub>2</sub>].2NO<sub>3 </sub>(Complex 1) and trans-[Pt(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(Me<sub>2</sub>Imt)<sub>2</sub>].2NO<sub>3 </sub>(Complex 3) were determined by x-ray crystallography. The structures of Complexes 1 and 3 consist of trans-[Pt(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>L<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+ </sup>complex ions and nitrate counter ions. The platinum atom in both the complex ions adopts a distorted square planar geometry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">The spectroscopic data indicated the coordination of thione ligands to platinum(II).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">The in vitro cytotoxicity of these compounds as well as of cisplatin and carboplatin was investigated using MTT assay against three human cancer cell lines, which were A549 (human lung carcinoma), MCF-7 (human breast carcinoma) and HTC15 (human colon cancer). The in vitro cytotoxicity's in several cases were comparable or even higher than cisplatin and carboplatin. Crystal structures of two of the complexes, trans-[Pt(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(Imt)<sub>2</sub>].2NO<sub>3 </sub>(Complex 1) and trans-[Pt(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(Me<sub>2</sub>Imt)<sub>2</sub>].2NO<sub>3 </sub>(Complex 3) were also determined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">The present disclosure will be better understood with reference to the following definitions:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">As used herein, “compound” and “complex” are used interchangeably, and are intended to refer to a chemical entity, whether in the solid, liquid or gaseous phase, and whether in a crude mixture or purified and isolated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">“Platinum(II) heterocyclic thione complex” according to the invention comprises the chemical formula trans-[Pt(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(Thione)<sub>2</sub>]·[counterions]. Preferred counter ions for this complex are two nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub>) groups.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">The term “active ingredient”, as used herein, refers to an ingredient in the composition that is biologically active, for example, the platinum(II) thione complex disclosed herein, a salt thereof, a prodrug thereof, or a solvate thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">Cytotaxic Activity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">In one embodiment, the IC<sub>50 </sub>of the platinum(II) thione complexes is in a range of 0.01-200 μM, 0.1-100 μM, 1-100 μM, 10-90 μM, 20-80 μM, 30-80 μM, 40-80 μM, 50-80 μM, or 50-75 μM. These ranges include all intermediate subranges and values.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">As used herein, the term “IC<sub>50</sub>” refers to a concentration of a platinum(II) thione complex, the salt thereof, the prodrug thereof, or the solvate thereof, which causes the death of 50% of cancer or proliferating cells in 72 hours (3 days) such as the A549, MCF-7, or HTC15 cancer cell lines described herein. The IC<sub>50 </sub>can be determined by standard cell viability assays, such as, without limitation, ATP test, Calcein AM assay, clonogenic assay, ethidium homodimer assay, Evans blue assay, Fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis/propidium iodide staining assay, flow cytometry assay, formazan-based assays (MTT, XTT), green fluorescent protein assay, lactate dehydrogenase assay, methyl violet assay, propidium iodide assay, Resazurin assay, Trypan Blue assay and TUNEL assay. Preferably, a MTT assay and/or a Trypan Blue assay is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">Biormarkers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">Alternatively to use of IC<sub>50 </sub>values, efficacy of treatment with a platinum(II) thione complex of the invention may be determined by measuring or detecting a change in one or cancer biomarkers, for example, comparing quantity of biomarkers in a blood or tissue sample before and after a treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">A treatment may significantly decrease the concentration of a particular biomarker, for example, by 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, or 100%, compared to a control or pre-treatment value. As used herein, the term “biomarker” refers to a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes or pharmacological responses to a therapeutic intervention. Biomarkers include ER/PR, HER-2/neu for breast cancer, EGFR, KRAS, UGTIA1 for colorectal cancer, EML4/ALK, EGFR, and KRAS for lung cancer as well as other biomarkers described and incorporated by reference to https://_en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_biomarkers (last accessed Aug. 11, 2017). Cancer biomarkers are useful in determining the aggressiveness of an identified cancer as well as its likelihood of responding to the treatment. Examples of such prognostic biomarkers include, without limitation, CA125, β2-microglobulin, and EBV DNA. A change or mutation in a biomarker may be detected with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, DNA microarray, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), heteroduplex analysis, and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). The procedures to detect the mutation are well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The concentration of the biomarker may be measured with an assay, for example an antibody-based method (e.g., an ELISA). As used herein, the term “antibody-based method” refers to any method with the use of an antibody including, but not limited to, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blotting, immunoprecipitation (IP), enzyme linked immunospot (ELISPOT), immunostaining, immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry, affinity chromatography, and the like. Preferably, an ELISA is used. The term “ELISA” refers to a method of detecting the presence and concentration of a biomarker in a sample. There are several variants of ELISA, including, but not limited to, sandwich ELISA, competitive ELISA, indirect ELISA, ELISA reverse, and the like. The ELISA assay may be a singleplex assay or a multiplex assay, which refers to a type of assay that simultaneously measures multiple analytes in a single run/cycle of the assay. Preferably, a sandwich ELISA is used. The protocol for measuring the concentration of the biomarker and/or detecting the mutation in the biomarker is known to those of ordinary skill, for example by performing the steps outlined in the commercially available assay kit sold by Sigma-Aldrich, Thermo Fisher Scientific, R &amp; D Systems, ZeptoMetrix Inc., Cayman Inc., Abcam, Trevigen, Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Biovision, and Enzo Life Sciences. The term “sample” includes any biological sample taken from the subject including a cell, tissue sample, or body fluid. For example, a sample may include a skin sample, a cheek cell sample, saliva, or blood cells. A sample can include, without limitation, a single cell, multiple cells, fragments of cells, an aliquot of a body fluid, whole blood, platelets, serum, plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, endothelial cells, tissue biopsies, synovial fluid, and lymphatic fluid. In some embodiments, the sample is taken from a tumor. In some embodiments, the concentration of the biomarker is measured before and after the administration. When the concentration of the biomarker is maintained, the method may further comprise increasing the effective amount of at least one of the platinum(II) thione complex of the invention, the salt thereof, the solvate thereof, the prodrug thereof, and the combination thereof by at least 5%, at least 10%, or at least 30%, up to 50%, up to 60%, or up to 80% of an initial effective amount that is in a range of 1-100 mg/kg based on the weight of the subject. The increased effective amount may be in a range of 1.05-180 mg/kg, preferably 15-140 mg/kg, more preferably 25-90 mg/kg. The subject may be administered with the increased dosage for a longer period (e.g. 1 week more, 2 weeks more, or 2 months more) than the duration with the initial effective amount. In some embodiments, the mutation in the biomarker is detected before administrating the composition to identify subjects predisposed to the disease. For example, women with a BRCA1 germline mutation are at a higher risk of contracting ovarian cancer. In some embodiments, the biomarkers are measured/detected after each administration. For example, the measurement may be 1-5 minutes, 1-30 minutes, 30-60 minutes, 1-2 hours, 2-12 hours, 12-24 hours, 1-2 days, 1-15 weeks, 15-20 weeks, 20-30 weeks, 30-40 weeks, 40-50 weeks, 1 year, 2 years, or any period of time in between after the administration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">The term “counter-anion” refers to an anion, preferably a pharmaceutically acceptable anion, that is associated with a positively charged platinum(II) complex. Non-limiting examples of pharmaceutically counter-anions include nitrate, halides such as fluoride, chloride, bromide, iodide; nitrate; sulfate; phosphate; amide; methanesulfonate; ethanesulfonate; p-toluenesulfonate, salicylate, malate, maleate, succinate, tartrate; citrate; acetate; perchlorate; trifluoromethanesulfonate (triflate); acetylacetonate; hexafluorophosphate; and hexafluoroacetylacetonate. Use of NO<sub>3 </sub>as a counterion makes the Pt(II) complex soluble in water, which is not possible for cisplatin or transplatin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">“Thiones” also known as thioketones or thiocarbonyls are organosulfur compounds related to conventional ketones. The thiones in the complexes of the invention are heterocyclic thiones. Preferred heterocyclic thiones include those having structures (a)-(g), (h) and (i):</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">Compositions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">In most embodiments, the platinum(II) thione complex of the invention, the salt thereof, the solvate thereof, the prodrug thereof, or the combination thereof is formulated in a pharmaceutically acceptable composition. As used herein, a “composition” refers to a mixture of the active ingredient with other chemical components, such as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and excipients. One purpose of a composition is to facilitate administration of the platinum(II) thione complex of the invention, the salt thereof, the solvate thereof, the prodrug thereof, or a combination thereof to a subject. Depending on the intended mode of administration (oral, parenteral, or topical), the composition can be in the form of solid, semi-solid or liquid dosage forms, such as tablets, suppositories, pills, capsules, powders, liquids, or suspensions, preferably in unit dosage form suitable for single administration of a precise dosage. The phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” as used herein refers to compounds, counterions, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Therefore, the composition refers to the combination of an active ingredient with a carrier, inert or active, making the composition especially suitable for diagnostic or therapeutic use in vivo, ex vivo, or in vitro.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">As used herein, a “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” refers to a carrier or diluent that does not cause significant irritation to an organism, does not abrogate the biological activity and properties of the administered active ingredient, and/or does not interact in a deleterious manner with the other components of the composition in which it is contained. The term “carrier” encompasses any excipient, binder, diluent, filler, salt, buffer, solubilizer, lipid, stabilizer, or other material well known in the art for use in pharmaceutical formulations. The choice of a carrier for use in a composition will depend upon the intended route of administration for the composition. The preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and formulations containing these materials is described in, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 21st Edition, ed. University of the Sciences in Philadelphia, Lippincott, Williams &amp; Wilkins, Philadelphia Pa., 2005, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Examples of physiologically acceptable carriers include buffers such as phosphate buffers, citrate buffer, and buffers with other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid; low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; salt-forming counterions such as sodium; and/or nonionic surfactants such as TWEEN® (ICI, Inc.; Bridgewater, N.J.), polyethylene glycol (PEG), and PLURONICS® (BASF; Florham Park, N.J.). An “excipient” refers to an inert substance added to a composition to further facilitate administration of a compound. Examples, without limitation, of excipients include calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars and types of starch, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, vegetable oils, and polyethylene glycols.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">In other embodiments, the composition has various release rates (e.g. controlled release or immediate release). Immediate release refers to the release of an active ingredient substantially immediately upon administration. In another embodiment, immediate release occurs when there is dissolution of an active ingredient within 1-20 minutes after administration. Dissolution can be of all or less than all (e.g. about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 91%, about 92%, about 93%, about 94%, about 95%, about 96%, about 97%, about 98%, about 99%, about 99.5%, 99.9%, or 99.99%) of the active ingredient. In another embodiment, immediate release results in complete or less than complete dissolution within about 1 hour following administration. Dissolution can be in a subject's stomach and/or intestine. In one embodiment, immediate release results in dissolution of an active ingredient within 1-20 minutes after entering the stomach. For example, dissolution of 100% of an active ingredient can occur in the prescribed time. In another embodiment, immediate release results in complete or less than complete dissolution within about 1 hour following rectal administration. In some embodiments, immediate release is through inhalation, such that dissolution occurs in a subject's lungs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">Controlled-release, or sustained-release, refers to the release of an active ingredient from a composition or dosage form in which the active ingredient is released over an extended period of time. In one embodiment, controlled-release results in dissolution of an active ingredient within 20-180 minutes after entering the stomach. In another embodiment, controlled-release occurs when there is dissolution of an active ingredient within 20-180 minutes after being swallowed. In another embodiment, controlled-release occurs when there is dissolution of an active ingredient within 20-180 minutes after entering the intestine. In another embodiment, controlled-release results in substantially complete dissolution after at least 1 hour following administration. In another embodiment, controlled-release results in substantially complete dissolution after at least 1 hour following oral administration. In another embodiment, controlled-release results in substantially complete dissolution after at least 1 hour following rectal administration. In one embodiment, the composition is not a controlled-release composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">Solid dosage forms for oral administration can include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active ingredient is ordinarily combined with one or more adjuvants appropriate to the indicated route of administration. If administered per os, the active ingredient can be admixed with lactose, sucrose, starch powder, cellulose esters of alkanoic acids, cellulose alkyl esters, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, magnesium oxide, sodium and calcium salts of phosphoric and sulfuric acids, gelatin, acacia gum, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and/or polyvinyl alcohol, and then tableted or encapsulated for convenient administration. Such capsules or tablets can contain a controlled-release formulation as can be provided in a dispersion of active compound in hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets, and pills, the dosage forms can also comprise buffering ingredients such as sodium citrate, magnesium or calcium carbonate or bicarbonate. Tablets and pills can additionally be prepared with enteric coatings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">Liquid dosage forms for oral administration can include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and elixirs containing inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as water. Such compositions can also comprise adjuvants, such as wetting ingredients, emulsifying and suspending ingredients, and sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming ingredients.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">For therapeutic purposes, formulations for parenteral administration can be in the form of aqueous or non-aqueous isotonic sterile injection solutions or suspensions. The term “parenteral”, as used herein, includes intravenous, intravesical, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intralesional, intracranial, intrapulmonal, intracardial, intrasternal, and sublingual injections, or infusion techniques. These solutions and suspensions can be prepared from sterile powders or granules having one or more of the carriers or diluents mentioned for use in the formulations for oral administration. The active ingredient can be dissolved in water, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, ethanol, corn oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, benzyl alcohol, sodium chloride, and/or various buffers. Other adjuvants and modes of administration are well and widely known in the pharmaceutical art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions can be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting ingredients and suspending ingredients. The sterile injectable preparation can also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that can be employed are water, Ringer's solution, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids, such as oleic acid, find use in the preparation of injectables. Dimethyl acetamide, surfactants including ionic and non-ionic detergents, polyethylene glycols can be used. Mixtures of solvents and wetting ingredients such as those discussed above are also useful.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">Suppositories for rectal administration can be prepared by mixing the active ingredient with a suitable non-irritating excipient, such as cocoa butter, synthetic mono-, di-, or triglycerides, fatty acids, and polyethylene glycols that are solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum and release the drug.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">Topical administration can also involve the use of transdermal administration such as transdermal patches or iontophoresis devices. Formulation of drugs is discussed in, for example, Hoover, John E., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1975. Another example of includes Liberman, H. A. and Lachman, L., Eds., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Marcel Decker, New York, N.Y., 1980, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">Selected IR frequencies of free thiones and their platinum(H) compounds are given in synthesis section. The characteristic vibrational bands in the IR spectra of thione complexes, are usually observed in three frequency regions; ν(C═S) vibration around 1200 and 600 cm<sup>−1</sup>, the N—H stretching near 3200 cm<sup>−1 </sup>and M-sulfur stretching band below 400 cm<sup>−1</sup>. The presence of ν(N—H) and ν(C═S) bands in all complexes proves that the thione ligands are coordinated to the metal atom. The spectra of free ligands display a band around 600 cm<sup>−1 </sup>as well as 1200 cm<sup>−1 </sup>that belong to ν(C═S) stretching. See S. Ahmad, et al., Can. J. Chem. 80 (2002) 1279-1284; A. A. Isab, et al., Polyhedron. 21 (2002) 1267-1271; and B. P. Kennedy et al., Can. J. Chem. 50 (1972) 3488-3507, each incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. These bands shifted toward lower wave number upon complexation, while the N—H stretching vibrations shifted to higher frequency indicating the coordination of thiones through sulfur atom. In order to investigate the metal-sulfur stretching frequencies of the synthesized complexes, the spectra were recorded in far-infrared region below 400 cm<sup>−1</sup>. This band lies in the range of about 300 cm<sup>−1 </sup>for the transition-metal complexes according to the literature. See D. M. Adam et al., J. Chem. Soc. (1967) 884-889, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In all complexes, we observed a sharp peak around 280 cm<sup>−1 </sup>that was assigned to platinum-sulfur bond. A sharp band around 825 cm<sup>−1 </sup>for all trans-[Pt(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(L)<sub>2</sub>].2NO<sub>3 </sub>complexes and its absence in the free ligand spectra is attributed to the presence of non-coordinated nitrate ion.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">In <sup>13</sup>C NMR, the C═S resonance of thiones in the complexes is shifted upfield by about 5.5-13.6 ppm as compared to that in free ligands in accordance with the data observed for other complexes of d<sup>10 </sup>metals with thiones. The upfield shift is attributed to the lowering of C═S bond order upon coordination and a shift of N→C electron density, producing a partial double bond character in the C—N bond. As the shift difference of the C═S resonance may be related to the strength of metal-sulfur bond, Table 6 shows that the Me<sub>2</sub>Imt complex would be the most stable among these complexes. A small deshielding effect is observed in other carbon atoms, which is due to an increase in x character of the C—N bond.</div>

<heading id="h-0020">In Vitro Cytotoxic Activity Against AS549, MCF7 and HTC15 Human Cancer Cell Lines</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">The trans-[Pt(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(thione)<sub>2</sub>].2NO<sub>3 </sub>complexes were evaluated for in vitro cytotoxic activity against A549 (human lung cancer), MCF-7 (human breast cancer) and HTC15 (human colon cancer) cell lines. The cells were seeded at 4×10<sup>3 </sup>cells/well in 100 μL DMEM containing 10% FBS in 96-wells tissue culture plate and incubated for 72 h at 37° C., 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>in air and 90% relative humidity in CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator. After incubation, 100 μL of each sample solution (50, 25, 12.5 and 6.25 μM), prepared in DMEM, were added to cells and the cultures were incubated for 24 h. The medium of wells was discarded and 100 μL DMEM containing MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium Bromide) (5 mg/mL) was added to the wells and incubated in CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator at 37° C. in dark for 4 h. After incubation, purple colored formazan (artificial chromogenic dye, product of the reduction of water insoluble tetrazolium salts e.g., MMT by dehydrogenases and reductases) in the cells is produced and appeared as dark crystals in the bottom of the wells. The resultant crystals were solublized by adding 100 μL of DMSO in each well. The solution was thoroughly mixed to dissolve the formazan crystals, producing a purple solution. The absorbance of the 96-wells plate was taken at 570 nm with Labsystems Multiskan EX-Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EX-ELISA) reader against a reagent blank. The IC<sub>50 </sub>values were calculated from three independent experiments by generating an equation of logarithmic trend line of percentage cell viability against concentration of compounds in Microsoft excel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">The exposure of the cells to an increase in concentration of the complexes resulted in a dose dependent cytotoxic effect. This cytotoxic effect was obtained by the stipulated increase in the concentration of the complexes, cisplatin and carboplatin against the fixed number of human cancer cells. The survival of the cells (A549, MCF7 and HCTIS5) as a function of concentration of compounds Complex 1-Complex 9 is explained in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-7</figref>. The IC<sub>50 </sub>values shown in Table 7 were obtained from the curves of the concentration of the complexes and percentage viability of the cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">The IC<sub>50 </sub>values of the complexes for A549 cell line range between 40 to 75 μM. Complexes 2 and 5 have in vitro cytotoxicity better than cisplatin with IC<sub>50 </sub>values 40 and 41 μM respectively, and almost two-fold better than that of carboplatin. Complexes 1, 6, 8 and 9 have in vitro cytotoxicity slightly lower than cisplatin but still higher than carboplatin. Complexes 3 and 7 have the same cytotoxicity as carboplatin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">The IC<sub>50 </sub>values of the complexes for the MCF7 cell line range are between 45 and 92 μM as shown by Table 4. Only the Complexes 5 and 8 were found to have cytotoxicity against the MCF7 cell line between cisplatin and carboplatin. While the others displayed poor antiproliferative potency as indicated by their higher IC<sub>50 </sub>values.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">Against HCTIS5 cell line, the Complexes 2, 5, 8 and 9 have activity comparable to cisplatin with IC<sub>50 </sub>values 40, 36, 43, and 41 μM respectively. The Complex 1 and Complex 7 have almost the same cytotoxicity as carboplatin, while Complexes 3, 4 and 6 are less potent even than carboplatin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">These results are consistent with a significant selective cytotoxicity of the complexes against particular cancer cell lines and its tendency to undergo ligand exchange with biomolecules like proteins and DNA.</div>
