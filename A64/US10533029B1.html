All references cited herein are incorporated by reference.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">The wide spread use of platinum(II) complexes including cisplatin [cis-(Pt(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>)], carboplatin, and oxaliplatin in cancer chemotherapy [Johnstone et al. Chem. Rev. (2016) 116, 3436-3486; Wheate et al. Dalton Trans, 2010; 39: 8113-8127; Dasari et al. Eur. J. Pharmacol. (2014) 364-378; Wilson et al. Chem. Rev. (2014) 114, 4470-4495; Kalayda, G. V. Cancer Chemotherapy and Pharmacology, 2016, 77, 1103-1124; Reedijk, J. Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2009, 1303-1312; Kelland, L (2007) Nat Rev Cancer 7:573; and Ahmad et al Transition Metal Chemistry (2006), 31, 1003-1016] has stimulated considerable interest in the synthesis of many new platinum(II) complexes [Montana et al. Curr. Med Chem. 2009; 16, 2235-60; Gay et al. J. Inorg. Biochem. 142 (2015) 15-27; Intini et al. Inorg. Chem. 56 (2107) 1483-1497; Wang et al. Inorg. Chem., 2016, 55, pp 4519-4528; Cui et al.

Research on Chemical Intermediates, 41, 8725 (2015); Yin et al. J. Inorg. Biochem., 105, 1095 (2011); Lakomska, I. Inorg. Chim. Acta, 362 (2009) 669-681; Hoffmann et al. J. Wietrzyk. J. Coord. Chem., 68, 3193-3208 (2015); and Lyu et al. J. Coord. Chem., 69, 1653-1662 (2016)]. The platinum complexes in clinical use are usually characterized by cis-geometry and at least one ligand that is a good leaving group [Johnston et al. Chem. Rev. (2016) 116, 3436-3486; Wheate et al. Dalton Trans, 2010; 39: 8113-8127; Dasari et al. Eur. J. Pharmacol. (2014) 364-378; Wilson et al. Chem. Rev. (2014) 114, 4470-4495; Kalayda, G. V. Cancer Chemotherapy and Pharmacology, 2016, 77, 1103-1124; Reedijk, J. Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2009, 1303-1312; Kelland, L (2007) Nat Rev Cancer 7:573; Ahmad et al. Transition Metal Chemistry (2006), 31, 1003-1016; Montana et al. Curr Med Chem. 2009; 16, 2235-60; and Gay et al. J. Inorg. Biochem. 142 (2015) 15-27]. Several nonfunctional trans-complexes were investigated as anticancer agents and were shown to exhibit remarkable activity particularly against cisplatin-resistant cells [Gao et al. Inorg. Chem. Commun. 9 (2006) 722-726: Zhu et al. Cancer Res; 72, 2012, 790-800; Lovejoy et al. Mol Cancer Ther., 10 (2011) 1709-1719; Wilson et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 109 (2012) 11987-92; Kasparkova et al. J. Inorg. Biochem. 153 (2015) 206-210; Tamasi et al. J. Inorg. Biochem., 104, 799 (2010); Bartel et al. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 17 (2012) 465-74; Quiroga, A. G. J. Inorg. Biochem. 114 (2012) 106-112; Aris et al. Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2009 (2009) 1293-1302; Najajreh et al. J. Med. Chem. 45 (2002) 5189-5195; Ramos-Lima et al. J. Med. Chem. 2006, 49, 2640-2651; Kalinowska-Lis et al. Coord. Chem. Rev. 252 (2008) 1328-1345; Natile et al. Coord. Chem. Rev. 216-217 (2001) 383-410; and Najajreh et al. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem., 10, 722 (2005)]. Among the monofunctional compounds, pyriplatin (cis-[Pt(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(pyridine) Cl]Cl) [Zhu et al. (2012) and Lovejoy et al. (2011)] and phenanthriplatin (cis-[Pt(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(pherianthridine)Cl]NO<sub>3</sub>) [Park et al. (2012)] represent the lead compounds of this type. Although transplatin, trans-[Pt(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>], does not show anticancer activity, its derivatives are active against cisplatin-resistant cells. The cytotoxic activities of the trans-complexes are greater than those of the corresponding cis-isomers and cisplatin [Najajreh et al. (2002), Ramos-Lima et al. (2006), Kalinowska-Lis et al. (2008), and Natile et al. (2001)]. The mechanism of cytotoxicity of trans-complexes is thought to proceed by the formation of interstrand crosslinks between N7 of guanine of one strand and guanine or cytosine of the opposite strand of a double stranded DNA [Kelland, L (2007) Nat Rev Cancer 7:573; Ahmad et al Transition Metal Chemistry (2006), 31, 1003-1016; Kasparkova et al. Biochemistry, 42, 6321 (2003); and Jamieson et al. Chem. Rev. 99 (1999) 2467-2498]. High rate of interstrand crosslinking caused by the trans-complexes has been suggested to be associated with conformational changes in a double stranded DNA, induced by the heterocyclic ligand in a monofunctional adduct, which facilitate for nation of an interstrand crosslink. High interstrand crosslinking for transplatin analogues in comparison with transplatin may be an important factor responsible for their activity in tumor cells [Kelland, L (2007) and Kasparkova et al. (2003)].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, platinum(II) complexes of various thione and selenone ligands have been synthesized and evaluated for in vitro cytotoxic activity against several human cancer cell lines [Mustafa et al. J. Coord. Chem, 2015, 68, 3511-3524; Mustafa et al. Inorg. Chem. Comm. 2014, 44, 159-163; Altoum et al. J. Coord. Chem. 70 (2017a) 1020-103; and Altoum et al. Polyhedron, 128, 2-8 (2017b)]. Among thione complexes, [Pt(EtImt)<sub>4</sub>]Cl<sub>2 </sub>(IC<sub>50</sub>=11 μM Vs 21 μM of cisplatin) and [Pt(Diaz)<sub>4</sub>]Cl<sub>2 </sub>(IC<sub>2</sub>=19.1 μM Vs 22.4 μM of cisplatin) showed higher in vitro cytotoxicity against MCF7 cells [Mustafa (2015) and (2014)]. Among selenone complexes, bis(selenone) derivatives [Altoum et al. (2017a)] were found to be more effective than the tetrakis(selenones) [Altoum et al. (2017b)]. Crystal structures of platinum selenone complexes show a distorted square-planar geometry around the platinum center and the coordination of thiones or selenones in terminal S/Se-bonded modes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of the forgoing, one object of the present disclosure is to provide a new class of platinum(II) complexes having cytotoxic properties against cancer and/or tumors with reduced side effects and methods of their use as anticancer agents.</div>

<heading id="h-0007">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0042">Embodiments of the present disclosure will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some, but not all embodiments of the disclosure are shown.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0043">As used herein, the terms “compound” and “complex” are used interchangeably, and are intended to refer to a chemical entity, whether in a solid, liquid or gaseous phase, and whether in a crude mixture or purified and isolated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0044">Unless otherwise specified, “a” or “art” means “one or more”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0045">As used herein, the term “solvate” refers to a physical association of a compound of this disclosure with one or more solvent molecules, whether organic or inorganic. This physical association includes hydrogen bonding. In certain instances, the solvate will be capable of isolation, for example when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated in the crystal lattice of the crystalline solid. The solvent molecules in the solvate may be present in a regular arrangement and/or a non-ordered arrangement. The solvate may comprise either a stoichiometric or nonstoichiometric amount of the solvent molecules. Solvate encompasses both solution phase and isolable solvates. Exemplary solvents include, but are not limited to, water, methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, isobutanol, tert-butanol, ethyl acetate and other lower alkanols, glycerin, acetone, dichloromethane (DCM), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethyl acetamide (DMA), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), isopropyl ether, acetonitrile, toluene, N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), tetrahydrofuran (THF), tetrahydropyran, other cyclic mono-, di- and tri-ethers, polyalkylene glycols (e.g. polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol, propylene glycol), and mixtures thereof in suitable proportions. Exemplary solvates include, but are not limited to, hydrates, ethanolates, methanolates, isopropanolates and mixtures thereof. Methods of solution are generally known to those skilled in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0046">As used herein, the term “tautomer” refers to constitutional isomers of organic compounds that readily convert by tautomerization or tautomerism. The interconversion commonly results in the formal migration of a hydrogen atom or proton, accompanied by a switch of a single bond and adjacent double bond. Tautomerism is a special case of structural isomerism, and because of the rapid interconversion, tautomers are generally considered to be the same chemical compound. In solutions in which tautomerization is possible, a chemical equilibrium of the tautomers will be reached. The exact ratio of the tautomers depends on several factors including, but not limited to, temperature, solvent and pH. Exemplary common tautomeric pairs include, but are not limited to, ketone and enol, enamine and imine, ketene and ynol, nitroso and oxime, amide and imidic acid, lactam and lactim (an amide and imidic tautomerism in heterocyclic rings), enamine and enamine and anomers of reducing sugars.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0047">As used herein, the term “stereoisomer” refers to isomeric molecules that have the same molecular formula and sequence of bonded atoms (i.e. constitution), but differ in the three-dimensional orientations of their atoms in space. This contrasts with structural isomers, which share the same molecular formula, but the bond connection of their order differs. By definition, molecules that are stereoisomers of each other represent the same structural isomer. Enantiomers are two stereoisomers that are related to each other by reflection, they, are non-superimposable mirror images. Every stereogenic center in one has the opposite configuration in the other. Two compounds that are enantiomers of each other have the same physical properties, except for the direction in which they rotate polarized light and how they interact with different optical isomers of other compounds. Diastereomers are stereoisomers not related through a reflection operation, they are not mirror images of each other. These include meso compounds, cis- and trans- (E- and Z-) isomers, and non-enantiomeric optical isomers. Diastereomers seldom have the same physical properties. In terms of the present disclosure, stereoisomers may refer to enantiomers, diastereomers, or both.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0048">Conformers, rotamers, or conformational isomerism refers to a form of isomerism that describes the phenomenon of molecules with the same structural formula but with different shapes due to rotations around one or more bonds. Different conformations can have different energies, can usually interconvert, and are very rarely isolatable. There are some molecules that can be isolated in several conformations. Atropisomers are stereoisomer resulting from hindered rotation about single bonds where the steric strain barrier to rotation is high enough to allow for the isolation of the conformers. In terms of the present disclosure, stereoisomers may refer to conformers, atropisomers, or both.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0049">In terms of the present disclosure, stereoisomers of the double bonds, ring systems, stereogenic centers, metal complexes such as platinum, and the like can all be present in the compounds, and all such stable isomers are contemplated in the present disclosure. Cis- and trans- (or E- and Z-) stereoisomers of the compounds of the present disclosure wherein rotation around the double bond is restricted, keeping the substituents fixed relative to each other, are described. They may be isolated as a mixture of isomers or as separated isomeric forms. S- and R- (or L- and D-) stereoisomers of the compounds of the present disclosure are described and may be isolated as a mixture of isomers or as separated isomeric forms. Also, platinum (II) complexes are known to be square or distorted square planer with the platinum (II) ion at the center. Thus, PtL<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> <sup>+2 </sup>X<sup>−2 </sup>of the instant invention may be either cis- or trans-complex. All processes or methods used to prepare compounds of the present disclosure and intermediates made therein are considered to be part of the present disclosure. When stereoisomeric products are prepared, they may be separated by conventional methods, for example, by chromatography, fractional crystallization, or use of a chiral agent.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0137">Solutions of Pt(II) complexes of selenone 1-7 and cisplatin at concentrations of 1.0 μM, 5.0 μM, 10.0 μM, 25.0 μM, and 50.0 μM were prepared in Dulbecco modified eagle medium (DMEM). The human cervical cancer cell line HeLa and human breast cancer cell line MDA-231 were seeded and maintained in quadruplicate in a 96-well tissue culture plate at 5×10<sup>4 </sup>cells per well in 200 μL of the same medium. The cancer cells were incubated for 24 hours before treatment. All compounds were dissolved in 50% DMSO. Therefore DMSO was used as a negative control. The final DMSO concentration, in each well, was less than 0.1%. The cancer cells were treated with platinum complexes of compounds 1-7 and cisplatin, and the resulting cultures were incubated for 72 h. The medium of wells was discarded and 100 μL DMEM containing (5 mg/mL) MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) was added to each well and the cultures incubated in a CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator at 37° C. in the dark for 4 hrs. After incubation, a purple colored formazan (artificial chromogenic dye, a product of the reduction of water insoluble tetrazolium salts e.g., MTT by dehydrogenases and reductases) in the cells is produced and appeared as dark crystals in the bottom of the wells. The medium of culture was discarded from each well carefully to avoid disruption of the monolayer. Isopropanol (100 μL) was added in each well. The solution was thoroughly mixed in the wells to dissolve the formazan crystals which results in a purple solution. The absorbance of the 96-well plate was measured at 570 nm with Mithras 2LB943 multimode microplate reader against reagent blank.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0150" num="0152">In proton NMR, the N—H hydrogen chemical shift of the complex is less intense and shifted downfield by 0.8 to 1.2 ppm from that of the free selenone compound. The shift was attributed to the shift of the electron density from nitrogen to carbon producing an increase in double bond character of the C—N bond. This downfield shift is characteristic of the selenones ligated to Pt(II) ion through the selenium atoms and not via a nitrogen atoms [Ahmad et al. Polyhedron, 21, 2099-2105 (2002); Ahmad et al. Inorg, Chem. Commun 5 (2002) 355; Ahmad et al. J. Coord. Chem., 2003, Vol. 56, No. 6, pp. 539-544; Isab et al. Polyhedron, 25, 2629-2636 (2006)].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0153">The <sup>13</sup>C {<sup>1</sup>H} NMR chemical shifts for free selenones and their corresponding platinum complexes are summarized in Table 4. For all compounds, the selenocarbonyl (C═Se) resonance of selenone complexes shifted up field by 2.7 to 14 ppm relative to their positions in uncoordinated selenones, which is consistent with the previously reported observations [Ahmad et al. Polyhedron, 21, 2099-2105 (2002); Ahmed et al. Inorg. Chem. Commun. 5 (2002) 355; Ahmad et al. J. Coord. Chem., 2003, Vol. 56, No. 6, pp. 539-544; Isab et al. Polyhedron, 25, 2629-2636 (2006)]. The up field shift assigned for the C-2 resonance is due to decreasing C═Se bond order upon coordination concomitant with increasing the bond order of the carbon-nitrogen bond leading to increase in the double bond character in the C—N bond. The up field shifts imply that the coordination of selenones to Pt(II) ion occurs via selenium atom [Sadaf et al. Mol. Struc. 1085 (2015) 155-161; Ahmad et al. Polyhedron., 21, 2099-2105 (2002); Ahmad et al. Inorg. Chem. Commun. 5 (2002) 355; Ahmad et al. J. Coord. Chem., 2003, Vol. 56, No. 6, pp. 539-54)]. The increased electron density of the C—N bond upon coordination to platinum results in minor increases in deshielding effects on C-4 and C-5, as observed by downfield shifts in these resonances.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0152" num="0154">The X-ray structure of compound 5 is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The geometrical parameters are given in Table 2. The structure of 5 consists of a cationic complex, [Pt(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(PrImSe)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> and two nitrate counter anions. In the complex ion, the platinum atom is bound to two N atoms of ammonia and two selenium atoms of N-ethylimidazolidine-2-selenone in a trans-configuration. The geometry of platinum complex is planar with the cis angles around platinum of 91.080(11) and 88.920(11), while the trans angles are 180°. The PtL<sub>4 </sub>coordination unit is planar due to an inversion center at the Pt atom. The Pt—N and Pt—Se bond distances of 2.0440(3) and 2.4365(4) {acute over (Å)}, respectively, are in agreement with the average values reported for other Pt complexes [Altoum et al. Polyhedron, 128, 2-8 (2017); Rani et al. Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. (2017) In press; Seerat-ur-Rehman et al. blocs. Chem. Commun. 36 (2013) 68-71; and Ahmad et al. Monatsh. Chem., 148 (2017) 669-674, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The SeCN<sub>2 </sub>moieties of the selenone molecule are planar. The N—C(Se) bond length is smaller than that of the N—C(C) bond distance because of the marked increase of the double bond character of the N—C(Se) bond. In 5, the groups (N1-H1 and N3-H3 of selenone and ammonia ligands respectively) are engaged in hydrogen bonding with oxygen atoms of nitrate ions as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The details of hydrogen-bond geometry (Å, °) in 5 are given in Table 5.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0020" num="0000">In Vitro Cytotoxicity:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0154" num="0156">In vitro cytotoxicity of the platinum complexes of compounds 1-7 and cisplatin it DMSO were evaluated by the MTT assay against two human cancer cells namely, human cervical cancer HeLa cells and human breast cancer MDA-231 cells. The results of cytotoxicity are expressed, in terms of IC<sub>50 </sub>and listed m Table 7. The survival of the cells as a function of concentration of the platinum complexes of compounds 1-7 are graphically presented in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>. Compared to cisplatin, complexes of compounds 1, 4 and 6 display enhanced cytotoxicity in cell cultures of both Hela and MDA-321. Also, platinum complex of compound 2 is more cytotoxic than cisplatin with HeLa cells, whereas the complex of compound 3 exhibits comparable cytotoxicity. For MCF7 cell line, the complexes of compounds 5 and 8 have greater cytotoxicity than cisplatin, and the complexes of compound 2 and 3 are less active. Recently, the anticancer properties of some other platinum(II) complexes of heterocyclic selenones have been reported [Altoum et al J. Coord. Chem. 70 (2017) 1020-1031; and. Altoum et al. Polyhedron, 128, 2-8 (2017), 42]. They were found to possess high IC<sub>50 </sub>values and thus, poor cytotoxicity as compared to cisplatin. The more effective antitumor properties of the current series may be ascribed to the presence of amine groups, to the ionic nature and to the different types of cancer cells</div>
