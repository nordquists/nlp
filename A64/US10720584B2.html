<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0001">The present invention relates to a charge-transporting varnish and an organic electroluminescent (EL) device.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0002">Organic EL devices have charge-transporting thin films formed from organic compounds which function as light emitting layers and charge-injecting layers. Particularly, a hole injection layer is responsible for transferring charges between an anode and a hole-transporting layer or a light emitting layer, and thus plays an important role in organic EL devices to work at a low voltage and achieve a high luminance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0003">The hole injection layer is produced by either dry processes (typified by vapor deposition) or wet processes (typified by spin coating). Comparing these processes, wet processes are superior to the dry process in ability to efficiently produce a flat thin film with a large area. Thus, there is an increasing demand for the hole injection layer that can be produced by wet processes in view of the fact that organic EL displays are evolving into one with a larger screen area than before.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0004">With the above in mind, the present inventors have been engaged in the development of various charge-transporting materials which are applicable to a variety of wet processes and which give rise to outstanding thin films for hole injection layers of organic EL devices. The present inventors also have developed new compounds highly dissolvable in organic solvents and new charge transporting varnishes. (See Patent Documents 1 to 4.)</div>

<heading id="h-0006">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0009">It is an object of the invention to provide a charge-transporting varnish and an organic EL device which has a thin film formed from the varnish. The varnish gives rise to a thin film with outstanding characteristic properties for use as hole injection layers of organic EL devices. This object is the same as that described in the above-mentioned Patent Documents.</div>
<heading id="h-0007">Means for Solving the Problems</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0010">As the result of extensive investigations to achieve the above object, the present inventors found that a thin film highly capable of charge transportation can be obtained from a specific charge-transporting varnish and the thin film can be applied to the hole injection layer of an organic EL device with outstanding electric characteristics. The charge-transporting varnish includes a charge-transporting substance which is a specific oligoaniline derivative containing fluorine atoms, a charge-transporting substance free of fluorine atoms, an organic solvent, and an optional dopant. The above findings led to the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0011">Thus, the present invention provides a charge-transporting varnish and an organic EL device which are described below.</div>

[Fluorine-Free Charge-Transporting Substance]
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0115">The charge-transporting varnish of the invention contains a fluorine-free charge-transporting substance. Examples of the fluorine-free charge-transporting substance include aniline derivatives, thiophen derivatives, and pyrrol derivatives, which are oligomers capable of transporting charges. The charge-transporting oligomer usually have a molecular weight ranging from 200 to 5,000; however, it should have a molecular weight at least 300, preferably at least 400, and more preferably at least 500, so that it can be made into a varnish that gives rise to a thin film highly capable of transporting charges. In addition, the molecular weight should be up to 4,000, preferably up to 3,000, and more preferably up to 2,000, so that it can be made into a uniform varnish that gives rise to an extremely flat thin film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0116">Preferable among the above charge-transporting oligomers are aniline derivatives from the standpoint of balance between the solubility in organic solvents and the charge-transporting performance of the resulting thin film. Examples of the aniline derivative include oligoaniline derivative disclosed in JP-A 2002-151272, oligoaniline compound disclosed in WO 2004/105446, oligoaniline compound disclosed in WO 2008/032617, oligoaniline compound disclosed in WO 2008/032616, and aryldiamine compound disclosed in WO 2013/042623.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0117">A preferable example of the aniline derivative is represented by the formula (5) below.</div>

A typical method includes dissolving the oligoaniline derivative of the present invention in a solvent with a high dissolving power and then incorporating the resulting solution with a high-viscosity organic solvent.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0185" num="0186">The baking time varies depending on the baking temperature and thus cannot be strictly specified, although the baking time generally ranges from about 1 minute to about 1 hour.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0186" num="0187">In addition, baking may be accomplished at different temperatures at least two stages so as to form the thin film in a more uniform manner or to cause the reaction to take place on the surface of the substrate.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0224" num="0241">The process for synthesis started with charging a flask with tetraaniline (3.0 g), 2,3,4,5-tetrafluorobonzoyl chloride (1.91 g), and N,N-dimethylacetamide (60 g).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0225" num="0242">After stirring, the flask was charged with 30 mL of aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (5 mol/L). Stirring was continued further for 30 minutes. The reaction liquid was mixed with ethyl acetate and aqueous solution saturated with sodium chloride, and the mixture was allowed to separate. This step was repeated three times so that the mixture became neutral (pH 7). The organic layer thus obtained was dried with sodium sulfate and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrated solution was given THF (15 mL). The resulting solution was added dropwise to isopropyl alcohol (210 mL). The resulting slurry was stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature.</div>

This step was followed by pre-baking for 1 minute at 80° C. in the atmospheric air and subsequent baking for 15 minutes at 230° C. Thus there was obtained the ITO substrate coated with a thin film (hole injection layer), 40 nm thick.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0256" num="0276">Further, the coated ITO substrate underwent vacuum deposition with α-NPD and aluminum (at 2.0×10<sup>−5 </sup>Pa). Thus there was obtained the desired hole-only device. The vacuum deposition was carried out at a deposition rate of 0.2 nm/second, so that the thin film of α-NPD and aluminum has a thickness of 20 nm and 100 nm, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0257" num="0277">The resulting HOD was sealed with sealing substrates in the same way as mentioned above before evaluation so as to save it from deterioration by oxygen and moisture in the air.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0259" num="0279">Example 3-1 was repeated to prepare the HOD except that the varnish obtained in Example 1-1 was replaced by an aqueous solution of polyethylenedioxythiophene-polystyrenesulfonic acid (AI4083, from H.C.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0260" num="0280">The samples of the SLDs and HODs prepared in the above Examples and Comparative Examples were examined for current density at a drive voltage of 3 V. The results are indicated in Table 4. Table 4 also indicates the relative intensity of the current density of HOD to the current density of SLD. This relative intensity suggests that holes are being efficiently supplied to the hole transport layer in proportion to its value.</div>
