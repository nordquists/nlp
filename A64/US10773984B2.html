<div class="abstract">Media beds containing worms living in an oxygenated aqueous environment are provided for the remediation of water containing excreted and other oxidizable organic or chemical waste. The media beds may include cultivated plant life in addition to the cultivated worm population for the uptake of nitrates, as well as other nutrients rendered soluble through digestion of the worms to remediate water to levels sufficient to be safely returned to the environment; alternatively the water may be remediated to higher nitrate levels in the absence of plants so that the water can be used in subsequent fertilization operations outside the waste treatment system. The system further includes cultivated microbial populations that may be present in the media beds and/or in separate bioreactors within the system.</div>

No. 15/843,798, filed Dec. 15, 2017, which claims the benefit of, and priority to, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/434,848 filed Dec. 15, 2016. The entire contents of the foregoing applications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is generally directed to methods and systems for treating waste streams and more particularly to methods and systems for treating waste streams employing a media bed.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Aquaculture is currently the fastest growing sector in food production around the world. Waste discharge is a key hurdle to the growth of the aquaculture industry and the adaptation of new production facilities. The development of an apparatus that allows for the safe, internal processing of solid waste within a recirculating aquaculture system allows for the controlled production of various aquatic species without concern of accidental release of specimens or harmful waste products, opening the door for aquaculture development across the globe.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Waste water from aquaculture generally contains high levels of suspended solid wastes and ammonia. Solid wastes degrade into ammonia under anoxic conditions, and they can use up much of the dissolved oxygen in the water when degrading under aerobic conditions. Both high levels of ammonia, regardless of dissolved oxygen level of the water, and low levels of dissolved oxygen are harmful to the aquatic species and plants being cultivated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Prior systems for solid waste management require solid waste, and associated water, to be separated with solids collected and removed from the system, resulting in an increased loss of water, loss of nutrients in the solid waste, as well as a discharge of ammonia waste into local environments, which can be harmful to local biota. One current system employs a multi-valve, 4-tank system and uses a vertical bead filter commonly found on swimming pools. This system, however, requires significant training and is energy intensive. Additionally, these systems are not truly zero-discharge, as the system requires that excess solid waste build-up be removed from the system periodically.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, Dr. James Rakocy, one of the leading experts in aquaponic system design, in 2012, in the book <i>Aquaculture Production Systems</i>, by Tidwell, pp 344-386, delivered a paper titled, <i>Aquaponic</i>-<i>Integrating Fish and Plant Culture</i>. In this paper, Dr. Rakocy noted the difficulties of using media beds in commercial aquaponic systems, specifically pointing out that these beds are prone to clogging, the formation of anaerobic zones, and potentially producing methane and hydrogen sulfide, which are highly toxic to fish.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Furthermore, Leonard and Lennard, in their paper, <i>A comparison of three different hydroponic subsystems: gravel bed, floating and nutrient film techniques, in an aquaponic test system, in Aquaculture International</i>, Vol 14, Issue 6, pp. 539-550, note the problems with utilizing media beds in an aquaponic system, citing the need to clean system media, and flush excess accumulated solid waste from the beds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, there exists a need to provide an aquaponics system that removes harmful ammonia, maintains high levels of dissolved oxygen internally, and prevents accumulating solid waste from the beds, without discharging solid waste from the system.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">The process of using worms in composting is sometimes referred to as vermicomposting. Systems, apparatuses and methods described herein employ the use of worms for the treatment of waste. However, the systems, apparatuses and methods described herein differ significantly from vermicomposting in several aspects and provide substantial advantageous over vermicomposting methods. First, vermicomposting is limited to the use of relatively thin layers of worms, typically limited to a depth of less than 5 inches. Second, vermicomposting is conducted on relatively dry compost material with a minimal moisture content. This is because the worms typically die in worm beds that are too thick or too moist. Systems, apparatuses and methods described herein comprise novel media beds comprising a high density of viable worms, often greater than 5 inches in depth, where the earthworms are submerged in water and/or aqueous waste. The systems, apparatuses and methods described herein unexpectedly allow for high-density worm populations to maintain high levels of viability and high levels of activity while completely submerged in water, while also providing high-volume waste treatment that is orders of magnitude faster and more efficient than methods employing vermicomposting.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">The inventors have determined that a media bed described herein can unexpectedly permit earthworms to survive, eat, and reproduce, all in an aquatic environment, thus expanding the utility of the earthworms to effectively remediate large volumes of biological wastes in a media bed without any dewatering of the waste. Annelid oligochaete earthworms and their associated gut microbes have the ability to reduce the particle size of waste and eliminate human pathogen contamination of waste. The worms can also chelate plant nutrients in the waste stream to make them more bioavailable to plants. In some embodiments, a system, apparatus or method described herein also uses heterotrophic microbes (including bacteria and archaea) to oxidize carbonaceous wastes that are reduced in size and increased in surface area by worms. In some embodiments, a system, apparatus or method described herein also uses chemotrophic microbes (including bacteria and archaea) to reduce the chemical oxygen demand and biological toxicity of waste by oxidizing ammonia to nitrites, and nitrites to nitrates. Carbon dioxide from the waste oxidation process ultimately leaves the system as a gas which may also be taken up by the plants, or incorporated into microbial biomass. In some embodiments, treated waste is converted into plant nutrients which can be directly concentrated into a plant fertilizer solution for use elsewhere. In some embodiments, nutrients from treated waste can be taken up by plants in a media bed bioreactor or other apparatus or system, non-limiting examples of which include floating beds, aeroponic towers, hydroponic systems, and soil growth beds operably coupled (e.g., fluidly connected) to a media bed bioreactor. Plant biomass (e.g., seeds, fruits, portions of plants or whole plants) is sometimes removed from a system for use elsewhere. Processed aqueous waste obtained from a system, apparatus or method described herein can be recirculated in a system, such as for use in aquaculture, or can be discharged from a system into the environment (e.g., after certain legal standards for nutrient and human pathogen removal are met).</div>

In some embodiments, an optimal worm density is determined so that worms can traverse the pore space of the media beds without clogging the media bed and impeding the flow of water and oxygen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, worms (e.g., a plurality of worms) in a media bed or biomass are substantially or completely submerged in water. In some embodiments, worms of a media bed or biomass are substantially or completely submerged within the aqueous content of a media bed or biomass. In some embodiments, worms of a media bed are substantially or completely under the surface of a biomass, and/or are under the surface of the aqueous content of a media bed or biomass.

In some embodiments, a media bed, biomass or bioreactor comprises heterotrophic microbes (including bacteria and archaea). Heterotrophic microbes can oxidize carbonaceous wastes made small and of a high surface area to volume ratio by worms. This requires dissolved oxygen, without which other competing microbes inherent in the environment and many waste streams will become dominant in the system and convert biosolids to methane. Chemotrophic microbes (including bacteria and archaea) reduce the chemical oxygen demand and biological toxicity of the waste stream by oxidizing ammonia to nitrites and nitrites to nitrates. They are generally considered to be chemolithotrophs—meaning they live on substrates (like rocks, gravel, etc.) in a sheet like coating. These bacteria use inorganic carbon (such as CO2) as their carbon source to construct organic molecules.</div>

Without being limited to theory, media allows for the free flowing of the aqueous waste stream, water and oxygen. The coarse structure of the media in the media bed can provide a stable structure through which the worms can move, eat, anchor and reproduce. In the absence of a suitable media, the worms can be washed from the media bed. The physical structure of the media can further provide a high surface area for chemotrophic microbes that can oxidize ammonia to nitrite and nitrite to nitrate. The worms, in turn, can eat excess bacteria and biological wastes between and on the media that, in turn, allows for free flow of oxygenated and waste rich water throughout the bed. Additionally the media bed can provide a physical structure for plants and their supporting roots to anchor, if they are employed in the system. Thus, media beds in accordance with exemplary embodiments that include the presence of worms allow the flow of nutrient rich, oxygenated water that can then be intercepted by plant roots for incorporation into plants and removed from the system. In use, the media bed <b>105</b> contains one or more types of biologically inert, non-soil media (omitted from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> for clarity of illustration of the plumbed connections). In some embodiments, the media is suitable for supporting plant life to accomplish nutrient uptake.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">While a media bed <b>105</b>, or contents thereof, is flooded with water and the worms are thus submerged, that actual volume of water in a media bed depends at least partially on the particular media employed and the resulting pore space.

A wide variety of plants may optionally be cultivated in a media bed <b>105</b>. The cultivation of plants results in the uptake of nitrates and other nutrients resulting from the oxidation of animal or plant waste. The plants remove nitrates and other nutrients that would be harmful to the surrounding environment if directly discharged. Alternatively, the media bed may be free of plants such that the effluent in the media bed discharge stream is high in nitrate content and oxidized waste that can then be directed for use in fertilizer applications outside of the media bed, either in other vessels fluidly connected within the waste treatment system (float beds, towers, nutrient film technology (NFT) and float beds, for example) and/or to provide a nutrient rich water for use outside the waste treatment system that can be concentrated for use as fertilizer or for direct use on terrestrial plant crops in more traditional growing settings (e.g., greenhouses, irrigation of fields, etc.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">Plants in media beds can be species that are considered terrestrial (such as lettuce and tomatoes) but the oxygenation of the media beds allows their roots to thrive in an aqueous environment.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">In some embodiments, a waste treatment system or aquaponics system is a true zero-discharge system; bio-solids and oxidizable ammonia are hazardous to sustaining cultivated fish and plant life in the system but are so effectively remediated to levels below those which are toxic to the fish and plant species within the system that no periodic discharge is required to reduce toxin levels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">A fish tank <b>101</b> may be any kind of tank or pool that contains fish or other cultured aquatic life in a life-sustaining liquid, typically fresh-water. The fish tank may further include liquid waste and solid wastes excreted by the fish or other aquatic life. The fluid, including the waste product, flows from the fish tank <b>101</b> to a separating tank <b>102</b>. The separating tank <b>102</b> may be any suitable separation apparatus to separate solid wastes from the liquid. Suitable apparatus for the separating tank includes, but is not limited to, sand filters, bead filters, baffled clarifiers, membrane filters, settling tanks, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the separating tank <b>102</b> is a collection tank or a settling tank, in which solids fall out of the liquid by gravity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">The separated solids or solid wastes may be directly delivered to the media bed <b>105</b>. Similarly, the separated liquid i.e., water containing ammonia and other liquid waste (as well as suspended solid waste) may also be directed to the media bed <b>105</b> without removal of the solid waste from the water, providing it is well mixed and can penetrate the spaces between media in the bioreactor bed. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the separated liquid is directed to one or more bioreactor(s) <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> in which the separated liquid undergoes further treatment to oxidize the waste in each stream, such as converting ammonia to nitrite, and nitrite to nitrate in the liquid stream.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">In one embodiment, a first bioreactor <b>103</b> contains bacteria that converts ammonia to nitrite, while a second bioreactor <b>104</b> receives flow from the first bioreactor <b>103</b> and contains bacteria that convert nitrite to nitrate.

In another embodiment, bacteria in bioreactor <b>103</b> may be dissimilar to bacteria in bioreactor <b>104</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">Although shown as two separate vessels to form two separate bioreactors, it will be appreciated that a single bioreactor may be employed with both classes of bacteria (those converting from ammonia to nitrite and those converting from nitrite to nitrate) both present in the same bioreactor. Likewise, it will further be appreciated that more than two bioreactors may be employed in series. The number of bioreactors may depend in part on the levels of impurity contained in the fluid as well as the size of the bioreactor, which may be provided as any vessel that can contain a suitable volume of liquid to host the bacteria.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">In some embodiments, the bioreactors may include a large volume of net-like elements such as net, wire, grid, guide wire grid, or combinations thereof, providing high surface area to facilitate bacterial growth. Different types of net-like elements may be used for each bioreactor, depending on the kind of bacteria contained in it.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">As illustrated, ammonia in the liquid leaving the separating tank <b>102</b> is converted to nitrite in the bioreactor <b>103</b>, and formed nitrite is converted to nitrate in turn in the bioreactor <b>104</b>. A high conversion of ammonia to nitrate is desired because plants (such as those grown in a media bed) consume only nitrates, while ammonia and nitrite are harmful to most plant life, although some conversion of ammonia to nitrates occurs throughout the entire system, particularly within the column of media within the media bed <b>105</b>. However, it will be appreciated, as discussed previously with respect to the media bed, that in some embodiments, the bioreactor(s) may be omitted entirely, with all of the bacteria necessary to convert ammonia to nitrate present directly in the media bed. Generally, the use of solid/liquid separator <b>102</b>, such as a clarifying, swirl filter, or other equipment, to supply liquid waste to bioreactors <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> for conversion to nitrates and usable nutrients is most advantageous when it is desired to direct nutrient rich water to other growing equipment other than or in addition to media beds; for example, NFT gutters, vertical towers, float beds, dutch buckets, etc. When enough plants are cultivated in the media bed to absorb all nutrients (or the nutrients are discharged for fertilizer), the use of separate bioreactors <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> may be omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">Referring still to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, from the bioreactor(s), the water, now rich in nitrates, flows to the media bed <b>105</b>, in which it is remediated by the presence of the filtration media and worms as already described. In this closed system, exemplary embodiments achieve a balance of removing fish waste that would be harmful to plants by converting it into nitrates, while the plants in the media bed <b>105</b> (and/or in other growing apparatus that might be included and to which the nutrient rich water is directed within the closed-loop system) remove nitrates that would be harmful to the fish and/or the surrounding environment if directly discharged.</div>

In this embodiment, a pump <b>203</b> is in communication with an incoming waste stream which is either a primarily solid waste stream released from the separating tank <b>102</b>, a flow of water containing the liquid leaving the bioreactor <b>104</b>, or a combined flow. Supply of the waste stream to the pump is preferably and advantageously controlled by a single valve <b>202</b>. Similarly, the operation of the pump <b>203</b> may also be controlled by a single switch <b>204</b>. Generally, the valve <b>202</b> is positioned so that the waste stream is flowing from the second bioreactor <b>104</b>, with periodic operation to feed accumulated solid waste from the separating tank <b>102</b> (with which will also flow some incoming liquid from the separating tank).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows another embodiment of a system illustrating that a plurality of media beds <b>105</b> may be used in parallel within a waste treatment system. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the ability of the media bed(s) as described herein to be used in other types of waste treatment, such in terrestrial animal waste reduction. One or more agriculture facilities, such as animal houses <b>410</b>, provide a waste source of animal waste that may be in the form of raw manure and/or waste-laden runoff from cleaning operations within the animal houses <b>410</b>, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">Depending on the source of the animal waste, it may be desirable or necessary for the manure to undergo one or more preliminary treatment steps prior to introduction into the waste treatment cycle. For example, when treating chicken or other animal waste, a drier/pelletizer <b>411</b> may be employed to first sanitize the raw manure source.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">The waste can then be introduced into the recirculated water stream, which may advantageously be accomplished in a mixing tank <b>412</b> to homogenize the waste and recirculation streams into a pumpable fluid. The combined stream is then directed to pump <b>203</b> for introduction into the media bed(s) <b>105</b> in the manner previously described. It will be appreciated that in some embodiments, the pump <b>203</b> may be a blender pump and that the waste and recirculation streams may be combined and homogenized directly in the pump apparatus without the need for a separate mixing tank.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">From the media beds, at least a portion of the remediated water can be directed back to the mixing tank <b>412</b> or pump <b>203</b> as part of the circulation stream. It will be appreciated however, that while the system may be closed, some or all of the remediated water may instead be removed from the cycle via a discharge port <b>414</b> controlled by a valve <b>413</b>. The water may be sufficiently remediated to a level that is safe to discharge into the environment, such as a stream or municipal water supply, or may be remediated to a desired elevate nitrate level for subsequent use in fertilization in applications external the waste treatment system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">The embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows four separate media beds <b>105</b> in parallel. The use of multiple media beds in parallel may be useful for accommodating large volumes of water while also providing for different media and/or the cultivation of different crops in each of the beds <b>105</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">Alternatively, large volumes may be also accommodated using a single, large basin <b>500</b> as the media bed with multiple, parallel inlet and outlet plumbing in order to still efficiently distribute the flow throughout the bed, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> also shows an example of the single basin <b>500</b> having an aesthetic, irregular geometry that is more pond-like. Although media bed containers can generally be situated above or below ground, the basin <b>500</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> can be formed using a pool or pond liner for in-ground settings, helping to give the appearance of a wetland. The basin <b>500</b> may even be cultivated with native wetland plants instead of crops to aid in the aesthetic and to decrease the operational expense of the bed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">Although primarily discussed thus far in the context of freshwater systems, some embodiments also pertain to the processing of biodegradable or oxidizable organic and/or chemical waste streams in applications in which wastewater contains high levels of salinity, such as salt-water aquaculture or the remediation of waste from salt-water sources.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">The microbes in such applications are generally still of the same family Nitrobacteraceae as those in freshwater application, particularly species of <i>Nitrosomonas </i>and <i>Nitrobacter</i>. However, while the freshwater bacteria thrive in levels of salinity ranging from 0-6 ppt, saltwater nitrifying bacteria in these families thrive in salinity levels of 6-44 ppt.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">Dissolved oxygen levels within beds for saltwater applications should be maintained to the same levels as in freshwater applications to facilitate the colonization of microbes for the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite and nitrate. Without maintaining proper oxygen levels, the ammonia becomes nitrogen gas which nitrogen fixing bacteria use to form toxic hydrogen sulfide.</div>

As illustrated, the aggregate flow leaving the aquaculture facility <b>610</b> is passed through the media beds <b>105</b> for remediation. While the remediated water may be re-circulated for additional embodiments, the media beds <b>105</b> described herein have been demonstrated to accomplish sufficient remediation in a single pass such that the remediated water is suitable for discharge <b>414</b> back into the environment. It will be appreciated that not all aquaculture facilities <b>610</b> use raceways and that regardless of whether the aquaculture facility uses raceways, tanks, or some combination thereof, the discharged water may be recirculated back to the aquaculture facility <b>610</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">As with the cultivation of fish-life in the fish tank <b>101</b>, a wide variety of plants may be cultivated in the media bed <b>105</b>. The cultivation of plants results in the uptake of nitrates and other nutrients resulting from the oxidation of the fish waste. Thus, exemplary embodiments achieve a balance of removing fish waste that would be harmful to plants by converting it into nitrates, while the plants remove the nitrates that would be harmful to the fish. The resulting system, by efficiently eliminating both solid and liquid waste at high conversion rates, results in a closed, zero-discharge system that does not require any regular, periodic flushing to remove build-up of excess waste or nutrients.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">Plants may be grown directly in the media bed <b>105</b>. Alternatively, or in addition to plant life cultivated in the media bed, the nutrient rich water containing nitrates and other oxidized waste may also be used with one or more other vessels fluidly connected to the media bed as part of the closed system configured to support plant life. Any suitable vessel or other arrangement that does not interfere with the closed nature of the system may be employed for additional plant cultivation. Exemplary arrangements include, but are not limited to, float beds, towers, nutrient film technology (NFT) and ponds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">According to an exemplary embodiment, the media bed <b>105</b> further includes the presence of worms cultivated in the media bed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">The presence of annelid worms in the media bed <b>105</b> accomplishes several tasks. The worms in the bed continuously break down incoming solid waste delivered from the separating tank <b>102</b>, helping to prevent the accumulation of solid waste in the media. This helps ensure that water easily passes through the media, and reduces the chances for clogging. Additionally, the worms create passages in the media for the movement of air throughout the bed so that all portions of the beds can contain high enough levels of dissolved oxygen to decrease the potential for anaerobic zones in the beds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">The presence of annelid worms in the media bed(s) also has the advantage of chelation of nutrients. Much of the nutrients in incoming solid waste is not chelated and is, therefore, not water soluble. As the annelid worms break down the incoming solid waste and pass it through their digestive tract, the nutrients are chelated, making them water soluble, and therefore more readily available for uptake and use by plants growing in the media bed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">In another embodiment, the media bed <b>105</b> is the subject of active aeration. Active aeration may be performed by any suitable mechanism, including, for example, a regenerative blower, air pump, compressor, other mechanical equipment, or combinations thereof. The aeration allows for controlling the dissolved oxygen in the media bed <b>105</b>. The active aeration helps prevent the beds from developing anaerobic areas that are harmful to fish health and plant growth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">It will be appreciated that in embodiments in which the media bed is sufficiently aerated, aerobic ammonia- and nitrate-converting bacteria may be cultured directly in the media bed, thriving to perform their function of converting liquid waste to nutrients without the need to employ any additional vessels to act as separate bio-reactor(s).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">Active aeration also aids in the safety of worm populations and surprisingly allows them to survive in a water rich environment. Additionally, active aeration decreases the incidences of various plant root infections and diseases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">Exemplary embodiments preferably employ the use of media beds <b>105</b> of the continuous flow type. In comparison to passively aerated, ebb-flow systems, the use of a continuous flow bed decreases the incidence of clogging in the bed, as the stones or other media remain sufficiently wetted to decrease the accumulation of algae and bacteria on the stones. This continuous movement further aids in decreasing the development of anaerobic areas in the beds.</div>

Similarly, the operation of the pump <b>203</b> may also be controlled by a single switch <b>204</b>. Generally, the valve is positioned so that the waste stream <b>107</b> is flowing from the second bioreactor <b>104</b>, with periodic operation to feed accumulated solid waste from the separating tank <b>102</b> (with which will also flow some incoming liquid from the separating tank).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">The pump <b>203</b> delivers the incoming waste stream into the media bed <b>105</b> at the waste inlet <b>107</b> via the supply manifold <b>206</b>. To aid in clean, ongoing operation of the system, cleanout valves <b>208</b> may be located on each supply manifold <b>206</b>. As the pump <b>203</b> delivers the solid waste and associated liquid to the bed, the solid waste is deposited in the media, filtering the associated liquid, while nutrients in the liquid are absorbed by the plant life in the media bed <b>105</b>. The filtered liquid is displaced back into the fish tank <b>101</b> through a drain line (e.g., treated waste outlet conduit <b>207</b>), eliminating the need for discharging waste from the closed system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">The present invention may also comprise a method of treating a solid and liquid waste in an aquaponics system <b>100</b>. In an embodiment, the method includes the step of providing a fish tank <b>101</b> containing a fluid, a separating tank <b>102</b>, and a media bed <b>105</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">The method further includes the step of delivering the fluid in the fish tank <b>101</b> to the separating tank <b>102</b>. The separating tank <b>102</b> separates the fluid into solids and liquids. In one embodiment, the separating tank <b>102</b> delivers the solids to the media bed <b>105</b>, and the liquids to the bioreactors <b>103</b> and <b>104</b>. Bacteria in the bioreactor <b>103</b>, such as <i>Nitrosomonas, Nitrosospira, Nitrosococcus</i>, and <i>Nitrosolobus</i>, convert ammonia in the liquids to nitrite. Bacteria in the bioreactor <b>104</b>, such as <i>Nitrobacter, Nitrospina</i>, and <i>Nitrococcus</i>, convert nitrite into nitrate. In one embodiment, nitrate-rich liquids are delivered to the media bed <b>105</b> although conversion to nitrate may also occur directly in the media bed as previously described. Nitrate-rich liquids and the solids may form a mixed stream before they are delivered to the media bed <b>105</b>. The media bed <b>105</b> filters the solids and nitrate-rich liquids, nitrates absorbed by cultivated plant life, and filtered liquid is then returned back to the fish tank <b>101</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">The media beds, apparatus and systems described herein provide a sustainable living ecosystem never before achieved, where submerged worms, microbes and plants can thrive and biodegrade large quantities of aqueous or oxidizable waste. The media beds, apparatus and systems described herein also provide for many advantages and increased efficiency over prior art methods. For example the media beds, apparatus and systems herein prevent clogging. Traditional biomediation systems systems are particularly susceptible to clogging over time. They require periodic backflushing to maintain flow, periodic excavation to remove carbonaceous wastes by physical removal, or cleaning to remove by oxidizing carbonaceous waste build up. This type of maintenance is costly, often due to labor costs, reduces the time that a system can be active.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">The media beds, apparatus and systems described herein eliminates this labor and down-time cost. In some embodiments, a media bed, apparatus or system described herein can be operated continuously for more than a year without down time, and without requiring removal of solid waste build up or cleaning. During this time the media bed, apparatus or system can maintain amounts of nitrifying bacteria required to remediate all the ammonia wastes generated by and introduced into the system, and maintained the worm population through reproduction. By comparison, vermicomposting (on land) fails to remediate all of the ammonia waste, much of the nitrogen is ejected into the atmosphere as N2 gas and nitrates (plant nutrients) are derived from worm castings alone. Systems, media beds and apparatuses described herein maintain continuous aerobic conditions and ultimately returns almost all of the nitrogen as nitrate, a plant nutrient. This is due to aerobic nitrifying microbes converting ammonia to nitrate. In systems described herein nitrate is produced in the water at approximately 350 ppm, but the concentration can be varied from zero to greater than 1000 ppm based on waste loading to the system. Worm castings alone have very low N concentrations (1.8%) and it would require dissolving 33.3 kg of worm castings in 2000 L water per day to give a nitrate concentration 350 ppm. Therefore a system described herein also provides a major savings in nitrate provision compared to deriving the nitrate from worm castings alone. Our media bed systems, by including nitrifying bacteria that oxidize ammonia and provide a primary nitrate source, and worms that keep the system from clogging, is much more efficient than either alone.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">Traditional biofilters using nitrifying bacteria fixed to the media without worms have ammonia reduction rates that vary strongly with surface area of the media; the smaller the media the higher the surface area and the higher the nitrification rate. However hydraulic flow declines with media size making the filter less efficient at passing water through it. Further, these filters require backflushing as they clog with dead bacteria, and the inevitable carbon rich wastes that comes with them, and must be cleaned or backflushed. Therefore these biofilters are seldom used at a large scale or for waste streams that have not had the biosolids removed in some other fashion. The efficiency of such filters at removing ammonia from waste streams declines by 70% at C:N ratio as low as 1.0-2.0. The media beds described herein do not decline in efficiency of ammonia removal at C:N ratios as high as 25:1 with sufficient dissolved oxygen because the worms consume the organic carbon, supply additional ammonia to the water from their respiration (which enhances activity of nitrifying bacteria), enhance the heterotrophic microbial activity of the whole system by exudates, polysaccharide slime, and enzymes, and reduce the overall system population of heterotrophic bacteria by eating them. The ingesting and consumption of heterotrophic bacteria not only keeps the beds from clogging, it greatly reduces their number. This reduction in number is important as heterotrophic bacteria used in waste treatment can increase their populations five times faster than nitrifying bacteria, greatly limiting their efficacy in nitrification. In one example, a media bed system can biodegrades 10 kilos of dried, solid, pelleted chicken waste producing ammonia levels of 26 ppm of ammonia (6 ppm Nitrate) thereby reducing ammonia levels to 0.0 ppm and nitrates to greater than 1000 ppm in six days.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">Additionally, the media beds, apparatus and systems presented herein prevent formation and subsequent release of methane and reduces the contribution of organic waste and manure digestion to global climate change. Accordingly, the media beds, apparatus and systems present herein allow for the safe and efficient processing of solid and liquid ammonia waste from aquaculture systems. Furthermore, the present invention is easy to operate, and is energy efficient.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">Methods</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">In some embodiments, presented herein is a method of treating waste comprising (a) providing a media bed comprising a biomass, wherein the biomass comprises water and worms, the worms are submerged in the water, and the water comprises an oxygen content of at least 3 ppm; and (b) contacting the biomass with oxidizable waste, thereby forming a mixture. In certain embodiments, a method further comprises (c) removing a portion of the mixture, wherein the portion of the mixture comprises treated waste. In some embodiments, the water further comprises un-ionized ammonia at an amount of 5 ppm or less, or 0.5 ppm or less. In some embodiments, the media bed and/or biomass comprises oxidizable waste. In some embodiments, the media bed comprises media.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">In some embodiments, the contacting of (a) and the removing of (c) comprises continually introducing the oxidizable waste into the media bed while continually removing a portion of the mixture there providing a constant stream or current through the media bed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">In certain embodiments, the method further comprises aerating or oxygenating the media bed, water or biomass to an dissolved oxygen concentration of at least 3 ppm, at least 3.1 ppm, 3.2 at least ppm, at least 3.3 ppm, at least 3.4 ppm, at least 3.5 ppm, at least 3.6 ppm, at least 3.7 ppm, at least 3.8 ppm, at least 3.9 ppm or at least 4.0 ppm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">In some embodiments, the method comprises generating a horizontal flow of the aqueous waste stream (oxidizable waste) through the media bed. Continuous or often repeated horizontal flow through the media bed avoids formation of anoxic pockets where bacteria that generate toxic hydrogen sulfide form. It also avoids formation of filamentous bacteria that will clog the media and disperses wastes evenly throughout the media bed. In certain embodiments, a media bed is not be allowed to dry out or fully drain. In some embodiments, a media bed or biomass is continuously aerated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">In some embodiments, keeping a media bed aerobic by aeration avoids the gasification of nitrogen as N2 gas in anaerobic environments. In some embodiments, a media bed is continuously aerated from beneath by a perforated pipe, hose or air stones. In some embodiments, ambient air is used for aeration. In some embodiments, aeration or oxygenation comprises introducing oxygen gas from tanks, or oxygen produced by gasified liquid oxygen, into a media bed or biomass. In certain embodiments, aeration is applied at a rate to maintain dissolved oxygen at a concentration of at least ≥3.0 ppm. While some fish, earthworms and many microbes can tolerate dissolved oxygen below this level, 3.0 ppm is often a lower threshold for microbial conversion of ammonia to nitrite. If dissolved oxygen goes below 3 ppm, ammonia often builds rapidly and becomes toxic to living organisms in the system. If dissolved oxygen drops below 0.5 ppm the earthworms will leave the system if at all possible. Further, dissolved oxygen ≥3.0 ppm aerates plant roots and thus allows for cultivation of plants, both aquatic and terrestrial, directly in the media beds.</div>

<heading id="h-0008">Example 1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an embodiment of a media bed <b>105</b> prior to the introduction of media, water, and other bed contents. Waste enters the media bed <b>105</b> via the waste inlet <b>107</b> which in the illustrated embodiment distributes the waste on either side of the bed via waste inlet manifolds <b>206</b>, which may be a continuation of the waste inlet conduit having holes along the length of the bed for the waste to escape into the bed. The waste manifolds <b>206</b> also optionally include valves <b>208</b> positioned to be accessible above the media and which may aid in servicing any clogs that might occur within the manifolds <b>206</b>. In some embodiments employing a continuous flow arrangement, an additional water inlet <b>26</b> may optionally be provided to maintain a constant volume of water flow by introducing water free of solid wastes (for example, overflow from a fish tank in the context of an aquaponics system). The use of an additional water inlet <b>26</b> may be particularly advantageous for embodiments in which solid wastes are periodically introduced to the media bed <b>105</b> under pressure via the manifolds <b>206</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">While the embodiment in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the waste input <b>107</b> and waste manifold <b>206</b> constructed of rigid PVC, these components, as well as other plumbing components within the invention can be constructed of a variety of materials, including but not limited to polypropylene, polyethylene, reinforced rubber hose, metal piping, etc. In one embodiment, the interior plumbing components are constructed of reinforced flexible rubber hose. This may help reduce the possibility of damage due to freezing water, shifting of the media bed <b>105</b> or its contents, plant root growth, or other potential problems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0136">Remediated water leaves the media bed via the treated waste outlet <b>106</b>. The remediated water is collected by a perforated drain pipe (e.g., treated waste outlet conduit <b>207</b>). An overflow drain <b>28</b> may also be connected to the treated waste outlet <b>106</b>; the overflow drain <b>28</b> protects the media bed <b>105</b> from overflowing should there be a clog in the outlet conduit <b>207</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">In some embodiments, the waste inlet <b>107</b> is situated at a predetermined height above the outlet. It will be appreciated that the greater the distance between the waste inlet and outlet, the greater the distance that the water passes through the media, which may reduce the number of cycles water needs to be circulated before the desired level of remediation is achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0138">In some embodiments, the media bed <b>105</b> includes microbes (i.e. bacteria and archaea) that convert ammonia to nitrite, as well as those that convert from nitrite to nitrate. The carbon dioxide gas in the waste water and carbon compounds in the solid and liquid waste stream aid this process by providing carbon sources for biomass construction to the bacteria, particularly those involved in the oxidation of ammonia.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139">Active aeration is used in the media bed <b>105</b> such that the water surrounding the worms is oxygenated to 3.0 ppm dissolved oxygen or greater. Thus, because the media bed is flooded with water and the worms may thus spend much or even all of their time in the media bed completely submerged in water, the oxygen content is maintained at such a high level that worms, including ordinarily terrestrial earthworms, can nonetheless still breathe. Because the media bed and the water within it is rich in waste, the worms have a sufficient supply of available food that also sustains life. Although the worms can withstand periodic short term conditions of lower dissolved oxygen, the bacteria that oxidize ammonia to nitrite generally cannot and constant aeration is thus generally desired. The presence of bacteria within the media bed helps control ammonia levels and the ammonia levels in the media bed should be less than 5 ppm un-ionized ammonia, such as less than 1 ppm un-ionized ammonia and in some embodiments the media bed contains about 0.7 ppm or less of un-ionized ammonia.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0140">With the dissolved oxygen, the worms in media beds in accordance with exemplary embodiments are capable of obtaining enough oxygen through their skin to survive, eat, and even reproduce despite the media bed being flooded with liquid water.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0141">Conventional media beds without worms eventually build up bacteria and wastes and cease to function; they are prone to clogging, the formation of anaerobic zones, and potentially producing methane and hydrogen sulfide, which are highly toxic to fish. These bioproducts have been a serious problem limiting use of media beds in aquaponics systems. The presence of annelid oligochaete worms in the media bed <b>105</b> in accordance with exemplary embodiments accomplishes several tasks and overcomes problems in conventional media beds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0143" num="0142">As previously noted, it will be appreciated that because the media bed is sufficiently aerated, aerobic ammonia- and nitrite-converting microbes may be cultured directly in the media bed, thriving to perform their function of converting liquid waste to nutrients without the need to employ any additional vessels to act as separate bioreactor(s) upstream of the media bed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0144" num="0143">In comparison to passively aerated, ebb-flow systems, the use of a continuously flooded media bed decreases the incidence of clogging in the bed, as the stones or other media remain sufficiently wet to decrease the accumulation of filamentous algae and bacteria on the stones. This continuous movement further aids in decreasing the development of anaerobic areas in the beds. These media beds may also be used with periodic wastewater flow, provided that the oxygen and moisture levels are maintained within the media bed sufficient to sustain the bacteria and worms between and during periodic flow.</div>
<heading id="h-0009">Example 2</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0144">In one embodiment, the media bed is constructed as a lined earthen pool (e.g., see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). This embodiment allows for the rapid, economic deployment of beds in a wide range of locations. While the dimensions of this type of bed can vary greatly, in some embodiments the bed is constructed with a width in a range of about 2 feet to about 8 feet wide. In some embodiments, the depth of the bed is in a range of about 1 foot deep to about 8 feet deep. The length of a bed can vary greatly. It should be noted that the above dimensions of width are to establish optimal distances between the waste input lines (<b>206</b>) and the outlet conduit (<b>207</b>). In embodiments where a larger containment basin is desired, such as in the creation of a more natural appearing constructed wetland, multiple sets of waste input lines and collection lines can be utilized in parallel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0145">When a desired location has be selected for the installation of a media bed, the land should be cleared of debris and leveled. The total area of the earth excavated is determined by the desired exterior dimensions of the bed being constructed. This is calculated by adding the wall dimensions of the beds to the desired interior dimensions. The width of the side walls will vary depending on the material utilized. For example, in this embodiment, pressure-treated 2×12 lumber was used to construct the supporting edge of the beds (<b>215</b>). The thickness of these boards was calculated into the overall dimensions of the beds. The desired dimensions should be clearly marked on the ground, and the earth within those dimensions should be excavated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0147" num="0146">The depth of the beds will be determined by the desired internal depth of the bed, plus the depth of any necessary barrier between the liner and the earth below. Depending on the composition of the ground in which the bed is placed, it may be necessary to place a layer of protective foam board (<b>216</b>), or a layer of sand (<b>217</b>) on the bottom of the excavated ground prior to placing the liner (<b>218</b>) in order to protect the liner from sharp stones or other debris. Protective materials such as liner felt (<b>219</b>) can be utilized as well to ensure a safe barrier between the liner and ground below. Once the proper excavation has occurred, it is important to ensure that any stones or other debris be removed from the bottom and side walls of the hole.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0148" num="0147">Depending on the intended use of the media bed, it may be necessary to install a buried sump in front of the media bed. This sump will be used for dosing waste into the bed, and will also aid in recirculation of the wastewater through the bed, and the collection of water from the bed. The sump should be sized appropriately based off the sized of the bed, the intended outcome of the waste, the waste input being process, local ground temperatures, and other factors. It is important that the usable volume of the sump tank be at a lower elevation than the stable water level of the media bed during operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0149" num="0148">For example, in this embodiment, the water level in the bed is 2 inches below ground level (<b>220</b>). Therefore, a 48-inch tank, buried so that the access lid is 4 inches above ground level will require a 44-inch hole be excavated. While this may be a 480-gallon tank by volume (i.e., about 1817 liters), only the bottom 42 inches of tank are below the standing water level of the media bed, giving the tank a usable capacity of only 420 gallons (e.g., about 1590 liters). For ease of use and ongoing maintenance of the system. It is suggested that the sump tank be buried inside of a concrete sleeve. This allows the tank to be easily removed to be serviced or replaced without requiring further excavation in the future.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0150" num="0149">A hole sized appropriately to house the tank and optional concrete sleeve should be excavated at the front end of the media bed hole. A trench should be dug at the elevation of the bottom of the media bed hole connecting the two holes. Depending on the composition of the ground in which the tank will be set, it may be necessary to dig the tank hole deep enough to allow for pavers, sand, or a stone bottom to be added to the hole to ensure that the bottom of the tank sits level and secure. The concrete liner and tank can be safely lowered into the hole. The trench between the tank and the bed should remain open until the final plumbing is complete.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0150">If a foam (<b>216</b>) or sand bottom (<b>217</b>) is utilized in a media bed to protect the liner, it should be installed at this point. In this embodiment, 2-inch structural foam is cut to the inside dimensions of the bottom of the hole. The pieces of foam are taped together to keep them from shifting as the liner is installed. If foam will be used to protect the side walls of the liner, it will be installed after the structural top edge.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0152" num="0151">A structural top edge can be added to the bed at this point. The structural top edge helps to maintain an elevated, defined line between the ground outside the beds, and the media inside the bed. This top edge can be constructed from a wide variety of materials as either an affixed wall or lumber, metal, or foam, or even a berm of earth, stone, or masonry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0153" num="0152">If a lumber structural top edge (<b>215</b>) is used on the bed, 1×1 stakes (<b>221</b>) should be hammered into the ground into the bottom of the hole around the perimeter of the bed. The stakes should be long enough that they are sufficiently supported in the ground, and the top of the stake sits at least 6 inches above will act as supports on which to mount the 2×12 top edges of the bed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0154" num="0153">Using a transit, or other level, mark each stake 6 inches below the common ground level (<b>220</b>) outside the bed. A transit should be used to ensure that regardless of fluctuations in the ground level outside the bed, that the marks on the stakes are at the same elevation. This is key to ensuring that the top of the bed is straight and level.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0155" num="0154">The 2×12 lumber (<b>215</b>) should be affixed to the stakes (<b>221</b>) so that the bottom of the board rests on the 6-inch marks. This will center the board approximately at ground level, leaving a 6-inch lip extended above ground level.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0156" num="0155">If foam board or other material is to be used to provide a protective barrier between the liner and the sides of the trench, it should be installed at the point. Material can easily be affixed to the upright stakes in a similar fashion to the top lumber. If a protective liner blanket is to be installed, it can be careful laid into the trench, folded in the corners, and wrapped up and over the top edge boards. Note that it should not be secured into place or cut to final fit at this point as it may shift or settle when the bed is filled with water of media. The blanket and liner should both be free to move and settle during the filling process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0157" num="0156">When the top edge is installed, and any protective measures have been put into place, the liner (<b>218</b>) can be carefully laid into the bottom of the trench. The corners of the liner should be folded to allow it to settle into the corners of the trench. It is not critical that the liner be fitted perfectly into place or secured to the top edge at this point. In the bottom of the front-end wall of the trench, cut a hole in the liner sized to receive a bulkhead of the necessary size for the amount of water flow through the bed. In this embodiment, a 3-inch hole is cut to receive a 2-inch ABS bulkhead (<b>223</b>). A 6×6-inch square of 1-inch pressure treated lumber (<b>224</b>) is used as a large washer against which to pin the liner (<b>218</b>) to the bulkhead fitting. If a protective blanket (<b>219</b>) is used on the bed, the bulkhead will pass through the protective blanket in the same fashion as the liner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0158" num="0157">When the bulkhead is fitted into place, use it as a guide to determine the elevation of the through hole in the sump tank and concrete sleeve. Drill a hole through the concrete sleeve and sump tank (<b>230</b>) size appropriately for the plumbing used to connect the bulkhead and sump tank. In this embodiment, a 3-inch hole is drilled to accept a 2-inch uniseal fitting (<b>231</b>). The Uniseal is installed from the inside of the tank, and a beveled 2-inch pipe (<b>232</b>) is pushed through the uniseal to the midpoint of the trench between the tank and the front wall of the bed where the bulkhead fitting it located. The pipe should long enough that the pipe sticks out toward the middle of the sump tank. On the end of the pipe inside the sump tank, a tee (<b>233</b>) is connected into place and fitted with a cleanout port (<b>234</b>). A vertical standpipe (<b>235</b>) is added that will be used to set the final running height of the water within the bed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0158">Another section of pipe (<b>232</b>) is fitted into the exterior side of the bulkhead. This pipe should be long enough to reach other sections of pipe coming from the tank, which can be connected with a solid or rubber coupling.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0159">On the side of the bulkhead inside the bed, a small section of pipe (<b>225</b>) should be installed into the bulkhead, leaving enough room to securely affix a tee (<b>226</b>) with the side port facing vertically. A vertical standpipe (<b>227</b>) should be affixed into the tee (<b>226</b>). This standpipe should be long enough to extend approximately 1 inch above the final level of the media in the bed. This standpipe serves as an overflow in the event that the main drainage line becomes clogged or damaged, ensuring that incoming water from the sump tank does not overflow out of the bed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0160">Another small section of pipe (<b>228</b>) is secured into the tee, on which a large adapter (<b>229</b>) is affixed to connect the bulkhead drainage plumbing to the main discharge line. In this embodiment, a 4-inch flexible, perforated drain line (e.g., outlet conduit <b>207</b>) was used, requiring a 2-inch by 4-inch adapter be installed. This drain line is run alone the bottom middle of the bed. At the far end of the bed, the drain line continues up the back wall, extending up past the level of the media in the bed. Once the media is installed in the bed, this drain line will be cut down to the level of the gravel, and a screen will be fitted to ensure nothing falls into the line. This allows for a simple access port into the drain line, useful for future servicing or cleaning.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0161">After the drain line is laid along the bottom of the bed, aeration lines should be added. Any method of aeration that can achieve the necessary dissolved oxygen requirements of the bed can be utilized. In this embodiment, ⅜th inch soaker hose (<b>30</b>) is connected to a PVC supply manifold. The manifold is a 1-inch PVC pipe fitted with two male adapters capable of receiving standard hose fittings. The PVC manifold is placed vertically at the midpoint of the media bed, next to the drain pipe. The top of the manifold should extend above the final gravel level of the bed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0162">The soaker hose is laid in a curved zig-zag patter under the drain pipe the entire length of the bed, each hose covering half of the bed. The soaker hose and drain line can be held into position by adding a layer of media into the bed as the hose is laid out. Prior to fully covering the bottom of the bed with media, pump out accesses can be installed to make draining the bed easier should it become necessary. In this embodiment, one section of 10-inch diameter drain (<b>222</b>) pipe was placed vertically at each end of the bed. These sections of pipe should be long enough that they sit resting just above the bottom of the beds, and extend above the final level of the media. These pipes provide locations to pump water out of the bed should it become necessary to service or winterize the bed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0163">At this point, a few inches of water can be added to the system to help position the liner into the edged of the bed. As water and media are added to the bed, the outside of the liner and bed can be backfilled if necessary. This will ensure that similar pressure is put on the inside and outside of the liner as it fills, decrease the risk of stretching the liner. Water and media can continue to be added until the bed is filled approximately 10 inches from the final media level. This depth can vary due to the specific parameters of the bed being constructed, the waste being processed, and the architecture of the plants being cultivated in the beds. At his point, the wastewater inlet lines (<b>249</b>) will be installed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0164">While the waste input lines can be constructed of a wide range of materials, in this embodiment, 1.5-inch reinforced tubing is utilized to minimize the fittings present, protecting against damage from shifting media and freezing water. The waste inlet tubing (<b>249</b>) is perforated with ¼th inch holes (<b>250</b>) every ten inches along the entire length. The tubing is cut long enough that it can be placed along the entire length of the beds, approximately 6 inches from the side walls, while extended above the level of the media at both ends of the bed. When working with the tubing in the beds, tape off the open ends to ensure that no debris falls into the lines. When the lines have been laid into place, continue adding media until the beds are filled to their necessary depth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0165">After all the media has been added to the beds, it is safe to secure the liner to the top end rail if one is being utilized. The liner can be cut down to a manageable size, ensuring that enough liner remains to fold it tightly over the top edge rail. By carefully folding the corners, the liner can be made to lay cleanly over the rails. After wrapping the liner over the rails, it can be secured using a variety of fasteners including but not limited to screws with washers, staples, or tacks. The liners can be buried slightly around the rails to aid in aesthetics. If a top rail is not being utilized, the liner can be cut to lay flat along the edge of the bed. If a berm-style edge is being used, the berm can be constructed along the edge of the bed, above ground level. The liner should be wrapped over the top of the berm and affixed securely.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0167" num="0166">Once the bed is filled, the air manifold can be cut down and affixed to an air source suitable to maintain a dissolved oxygen level of at least 3 ppm, such as but not limited to a regenerative blower, air pump, oxygen delivery system, or compressor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0167">The ends of the inlet pipes furthest from the sump should be fitted with ball valves (<b>236</b>). These valves should remain closed during normal operation, and are used to purge clogs and provide an access point into the supply manifolds for cleaning and servicing. In this embodiment, 1.5-inch threaded ball valves (<b>236</b>) were connected to 1.5-inch barbed male adapters (<b>237</b>). These barbed fittings were inserted into the tubing and secured with metal hose clamps (<b>238</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0169" num="0168">The supply end of the inlet lines, located near the sump tank, are connected into a single manifold. In this embodiment, 1.5-inch barbed male adapters (<b>239</b>) are inserted into the tubes and secured with metal hose clamps (<b>240</b>). 1.5-inch PVC female adapters (<b>241</b>) convert the tubing to PVC. Two 1.5-inch 90-degree elbows (<b>242</b>), and a 1.5-inch tee (<b>243</b>) are used to create a single manifold with an input port. This manifold is connected to the circulating pump. A ball valve (<b>244</b>) is in place between the pump (<b>245</b>) and the manifold to provide control over the flow of water entering the bed. In this embodiment, a 1.5 hp, self-priming pump is used to lift wastewater from the sump tank, and deliver it through the input tubes. The inlet of the pump is a long 1.5-inch pipe (<b>246</b>) fitted to a 90-degree elbow (<b>247</b>). The bottom of this straw-like structure draws wastewater off the bottom of the tank. The bottom of the inlet pipe sits 1 inch off the floor of the sump tank.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0170" num="0169">In an ideal embodiment, a small port (<b>251</b>) is added to the waste inlet pipe supply manifold. A valve-controlled hose (<b>252</b>) takes a portion of water from the manifold, and returns it to the bottom of the sump tank in a manner that creates a swirling effect in the tank (<b>253</b>). This ensure that solid waste does not become deposited in the bottom of the tank, but it stirred up and removed by the pump.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0171" num="0170">The pump should be connected to a float switch interrupted located toward the bottom of the sump tank. This ensures that should the sump tank run low on water, the pump will not run dry or lose its prime.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0172" num="0171">The overflow pipe toward the front of the media bed should be cut down so that it rests approximately an inch above the level of the media. A pipe screen should be added to the overflow to ensure that no media or other debris falls into it.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0173" num="0172">Pump out accesses can be cut lower to the media for aesthetic purposes. Covers should be added to these accesses to ensure that neither debris nor animals do not fall into them.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0174" num="0173">When the plumbing is finished, fill the bed to the desired standing water level inside of the bed. In this embodiment, that water level is 2 inches below the media. As the bed fills, the vertical standpipe inside of the tank will fill as well. Once the bed is at the desired level, cut the stand pipe inside of the tank 2 inches below the water level inside of the pipe. Affix a rubber coupling (<b>236</b>) to the stand pipe with a hose clamp. The top of the rubber couple should sit 2 inches above the top of the stand pipe. This will return the static water level to this height when the beds are running. The rubber coupling allows the height of the water level in the bed to easily be adjusted to compensate for water flow once the bed is operational.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0175" num="0174">With the bed full, check the coupling connection between the drainage line from the bed and the sump tank to ensure the couple is not leaking. If the bulkhead and couplings appear dry, carefully backfill the trench with sand or clean fill.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0176" num="0175">Once the bed is finalized, the tank should be filled to a few inches below the vertical standpipe. The bed can be cycled using inoculant fluids from another system to rapidly increase the adaptation and proliferation of necessary biota. When the bed is cycling, the main valve connecting the pump to the waste inlet manifold should be adjusted so that water is entering the bed at the rate that it can efficiently flow through the bed. If the bed appears to be flooding, dial the pump back slightly until a stable flow is established.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0177" num="0176">Waste should be slowly introduced to the bed at a rate that maintains the water quality within the effective ranges of the biota. This will allow for a smooth system startup. If plants are to be utilized in the bed, they should be introduced once the water quality parameters have settled into a range safe for their introduction into the bed.</div>

<heading id="h-0011">Media Bed Set Up</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0012" num="0000">Building the Media Bed Bioreactor</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0013" num="0000">1. Assembly</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0014" num="0000">2. Sequential Initiation of biological community</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0178" num="0177">Once the Media Bed has been assembled it should be filled with potable water and the aeration system activated. If chlorine is present (as in many municipal supplies) the water in the system should be circulated for 24 hours to allow outgas sing of the chlorine. After 24 hours (or immediately after filing if no chlorine is present) a microbial inoculant is added to the media bed bioreactor. This inoculant can be taken from the waste stream of a functioning system either in or directly after the media bed bioreactor. Alternatively the inoculant may be composed of selected microbes. Inoculation is followed with an amount of biological waste (e.g., derived from chicken, hog, or fish) or household liquid ammonia to raise ammonia levels to about 15 ppm. This will allow nitrifying microbes to increase in population and begin conversion of ammonia to nitrite. Ammonia levels will begin to drop as the microbes convert ammonia to nitrite. Nitrite levels will rise proportionately then microbes converting nitrite to nitrate will be activated and nitrate levels will begin to rise as ammonia and nitrite levels fall in one to seven days. Once ammonia levels drop to less than 1.0 ppm then earthworms (initial stocking rate of approximately 500 m<sup>3</sup>) should be added directly to the media bed. Plants can also be added to the media bed bioreactor at this time as desired. Waste treatment can begin at this point.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0179" num="0178">Wastes will inherently vary in Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) as well as concentration and digestibility of bio-solids in the aqueous waste stream. The BOD, COD or combination thereof is often greater than about 3 ppm in waste (e.g., aqueous waste, oxidizable waste). Therefore loading rates should be determined empirically with each major variation in waste treated (e.g. switch from one lot of chicken waste to another, one fish species feeding rate to another, one fish species to another, etc.) in order that system critical values are maintained. In some embodiments, loading rates should maintain dissolved oxygen at ≥3.0 ppm in the media bed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0180" num="0179">If the media bed bioreactor system is being used in an aquaculture treatment aquaponics system, fish or other cultured species can be introduced when initial unionized ammonia is consistently maintained at ≤0.05 ppm and dissolved oxygen in the aquaculture portion of the system is sufficient for the crop species deployed. Introducing fish earlier will kill them regardless of dissolved oxygen levels. Nitrate is the least toxic form of nitrogen ions in the system. In general nitrate levels should be maintained below about 800 ppm for aquaculture systems employing a media bed. Loading rates for systems with ammonia present in the waste stream, or likely to form in the waste stream, should not exceed the biomass of the worms and DO should be maintained at greater than or equal to 3.0 ppm. If waste loading exceeds the biomass of the worms, the worm will not be able to keep up and heterotrophic microbes will quickly increase in population. Heterotrophic microbes can increase their population much more rapidly than nitrifying bacteria which will stop oxidation of ammonia to nitrite, allowing ammonia to build to toxic levels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0181" num="0180">Additionally, this system makes no claims to reduce organic chemical pollution (e.g. antibiotics, pharmaceuticals) in the aqueous waste stream. Therefore a waste stream can be monitored for hazardous waste that may include high levels of metals or chemicals that might kill worms, microbes, fish, plants of a biomass. Non-limiting examples of hazardous waste include waste comprising cadmium (Cd) at levels greater than 1843 ppm, Arsenic (As) at levels greater than 100 ppm in 21 days, lead (Pb) at levels greater than 4480 ppm, copper (Cu) at levels greater than 643 ppm, zinc (Zn) at levels greater than 662 ppm, nickel (Ni) at levels greater than 757 ppm and chromium (Cr) at levels greater than 1800 ppm, which can be toxic to some earthworm species after a period of exposure of 14 days or more. These metals are not typically found at such high levels in aqueous waste streams, but may be present in some undiluted hazardous waste discharged from a factory or industrial manufacturing plant. Some hazardous waste comprises high levels of pesticides which vary substantially in their toxicity to worms, plants and microbes. Accordingly, in certain embodiments aqueous waste and/or oxidized waste is not hazardous waste. Some metal ions are necessary plant micronutrients (e.g. copper, boron, calcium) but may be toxic to plants at higher levels. Whereas other heavy metals that are not micronutrients for plants may also be incorporated into plant materials but can be treated separately in the removed plant materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0015" num="0000">3. Continued Operation</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0182" num="0181">Waste streams are inherently variable in BOD, COD, particle size and chemical composition. Therefore the most critical monitoring of the system will need to capture this variability in the empirical functioning of the system. Additionally the rates of biochemical and chemical processes of this system are dependent on temperature and dissolved oxygen concentrations and the health of the organisms employed. Optimal temperature for growth of nitrifying bacteria is often 20-30° C. with a minimum of 4° C. and death occurring at 0° C. Earthworms have an optimal range of about 15-25° C. Therefore, in some embodiments, the temperature of a system is maintained at 20-25° C. to optimize both microbial activity and the activity of the annelid oligochaete worms. The lower limit of the system (4° C.) is often determined by the temperature minimum for microbes that convert nitrite to nitrate. If they are not operating, nitrates will not form, greatly slowing plant growth, and nitrites will accumulate. If fish are present—this accumulation of nitrite will poison them regardless of ammonia or dissolved oxygen levels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0183" num="0182">In some embodiments, dissolved oxygen is maintained at ≥3.0 ppm. While earthworms and fish may tolerate lower dissolved oxygen rates, the common microbes responsible for oxidizing ammonia to nitrite will often cease to function below this level and ammonia will accumulate. Experience indicates proper DO levels are difficult to maintain with atmospheric aeration, especially at temperatures above 32° C. Accordingly, in some embodiments, a media bed comprises a forced aeration system using atmospheric air, or air supplemented with higher levels of oxygen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0184" num="0183">In some embodiments, a media bed will operate normally within a pH range of 6.5 to 9.0, which is compatible for most freshwater organisms. However care must be taken to monitor ammonia levels. If pH falls below 6.5, the activity of microbes that convert ammonia to nitrite will slow, and ammonia can build rapidly. Adjusting pH upward can be accomplished with a number of common chemicals but care must be used to avoid those containing sodium (e.g. sodium bicarbonate or sodium hydroxide) as the sodium rapidly changes the salinity, alkalinity, and electrical conductivity of the water. This is also important for plant growth, if plants are fertilized with the effluent of a media bed, or used in the media bed directly. Maintaining alkalinity of 100-150 ppm CaCO<sub>3 </sub>is also helpful to maintain the microbial nitrification processes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0185" num="0184">In some embodiments, chelated iron is needed to be added to maintain iron levels in the effluent and/or media bed at levels sufficient for plant growth. Iron (Fe) has multiple valence states. The Fe3+ form is the most common form of iron on earth but the Fe2+ is much more useful by plants. Unfortunately the Fe2+ readily converts to Fe3+ and precipitates out of solution at the pH and DO levels utilized in a media bed. Iron chelates such as Fe-EDTA (stable to pH 6.0, and present to pH 9.0) is relatively cheap compared to Fe DPTA (stable to pH 7.0 and present to pH 10.0). Given that plant nutritional needs vary strongly by species it is best to empirically monitor plants for signs of Fe deficiency (interveinal chlorosis) and correct according. In general we have found 150 ml of powdered Fe DPTA/1800 L water/week is sufficient to prevent iron stress in plants grown in a media bed. Addition of potassium (K) may also be needed if plants with exceptionally high demands for K (e.g., bananas) are grown in the media bed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0186" num="0185">Lastly, aqueous waste streams to be treated in a media bed should be monitored for the presence of toxic chemical pollutants (e.g., antibiotics, pharmaceuticals) and other chemical pollutants (e.g., heavy metals) in an aqueous waste stream. Such pollutants should be low enough so that they are not toxic to organisms in the system.</div>
