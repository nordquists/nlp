<heading id="h-0003">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0003">The present invention relates to low molecular weight peptides with procoagulant activity for treatment of patients with a deficiency in FV, FVII, FVIII, FX and/or FXI.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0004">The blood coagulation cascade involves a series of serine protease enzymes (zymogens) and protein cofactors. When required, an inactive zymogen precursor is converted into the active form, which consequently converts the next enzyme in the cascade. It is divided into three distinct segments: the intrinsic (contact activation), extrinsic (tissue factor), and common pathways.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0005">In the intrinsic pathway of the cascade, hemophilia is the most pronounced bleeding disorder, which results in insufficient generation of factor Xa by factor FIX (FIXa)/factor VIIIa (FVIIIa) complex (the intrinsic tenase complex) leading to an insufficient clot formation. Bleeding may then occur spontaneously or following injury.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0006">Hemophilia is an inherited bleeding disorder and two forms of hemophilia, hemophilia A and B, are known. Hemophilia A is the consequence of a deficiency of FVIII and is characterized by hemorrhage into the joints and muscles. FVIII circulates in plasma at a very low concentration and is bound non-covalently to von Willebrand factor (vWF). During hemostasis, FVIII is activated by thrombin, separates from vWF and acts as a cofactor for activated FIXa-mediated FX activation by enhancing the rate of activation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0007">Patients with less than 1% normal FVIII are considered to have severe hemophilia, with 1-5% moderately severe hemophilia, and with more than 5% but less than 40% mild hemophilia.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0008">Nowadays the treatment of choice for the management of hemophilia A is replacement therapy with various plasma derived or recombinant FVIII concentrates. Although specific viral-inactivation steps, including solvent-detergent treatment or liquid-phase heat treatment, are available to inactivate viruses, possible transmission of poorly characterized agents (e.g. prions) in plasma derived concentrates is still an issue discussed in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0009">FVIII is also synthesized as a recombinant protein for therapeutic use in bleeding disorders. Such products have lowered the risk of viral contamination. There are many recombinant products on the market for the treatment of hemophilia A. One of these concentrates is the Advate® FVIII composition, which is produced in CHO-cells and manufactured by Baxter Healthcare Corporation. No human or animal plasma proteins are added in the cell culture process, purification, or final formulation of this product.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0010">Although progress in the production of FVIII to ensure purity, efficacy and viral safety has been made over the past decades, some limitations remain. First of all, severe hemophilia A patients are frequently affected by anti-FVIII inhibitor antibody formation, rendering the therapy ineffective.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0011">Approximately 30% of patients with severe HA develop alloantibody inhibitors that can neutralize FVIII (Hay, <i>Haemophilia </i>2006; 12 Suppl 6:23-9; Peerlinck and Hermans, <i>Haemophilia </i>2006; 12:579-90). These inhibitors are typically immunoglobulin G (IgG), predominantly of the IgG4 subclass, that do not fix complement and do not result in the end-organ damage observed with circulating immune complexes. The inhibitors occur at a young age (about 50% by 10 years), principally in patients with less than 1% FVIII. Furthermore, acquired hemophilia may occur, which is the development of FVIII antibody inhibitors in persons without a history of FVIII deficiency. This condition can be idiopathic (occurring in people &gt;50 years), it can be associated with collagen vascular disease or the peripartum period, or it may represent a drug reaction (e.g., to penicillin). For clinical purposes, the magnitude of the antibody response can be quantified through the performance of a functional inhibitor assay from which the Bethesda unit (BU) inhibitor titer can be obtained. The International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) definition of a high titer response is &gt;5 BUs and its definition of a low titer response is between 0.5 and 5 BUs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0012">Attempts to overwhelm the inhibitors with large doses of human FVIII have been tried. Also porcine FVIII, which has low cross-reactivity with human FVIII antibody, has been administered. More frequently, FVIII-bypassing agents, including activated prothrombin complex concentrates (e.g. FEIBA (Factor Eight Inhibitor Bypassing Agent) and recombinant activated factor FVII (FVIIa) have also been used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0013">Because therapeutic polypeptide drugs such as FVIII are also rapidly degraded by proteolytic enzymes in addition to the drawback of inhibitor development, FVIII needs to be frequently administered intravenously. Taking into account the average half-lives of the various FVIII products in the circulation, this can usually be achieved by giving FVIII two to three times a week. Thus this treatment is rather complicated for an outpatient population, especially in small children.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0014">Thus currently the aim of many manufacturers of FVIII is to develop a next generation product with enhanced pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, while maintaining all other product characteristics. Because improved polypeptide drugs with a longer circulation half-life would decrease the number of necessary administrations, chemical or enzymatic modification of the polypeptide drugs is one of the preferred approaches to achieve this goal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0015">One such example is PEGylation of polypeptide drugs protecting and improving their pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles (Harris and Chess; <i>Nat Rev Drug Discov. </i>2003; 2; 214-21), U.S. Pat. No. 6,037,452 describes a poly(alkylene oxide)-FVIII or FIX conjugate, where the protein is covalently bound to a poly(alkylene oxide) through carbonyl groups of said FVIII.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0016">Even if these methods reduce inhibitor development they still would not abrogate the need for intravenous administration. The most elegant option, making most of the drawbacks of hemophilia treatment discussed above obsolete, would be the development of a low molecular weight compound such as a peptide (peptidomimetic) with the capacity to improve coagulation and which can be administered by a non-intravenous route. Though already discussed for many years (for example Kaufman and Pipe, <i>Haemophilia </i>1998; 4.370-9; Llung, <i>Thromb Haemost, </i>1999; 82:525-30) no such agent is currently available or in clinical development.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0017">The current state of the art for the use of small peptides in blood coagulation is documented for example by the following publications:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0018">D K Liles, D M Monroe and H R Roberts (1997) Blood Vol 90 No 10 Supplement 1, 463a is a poster abstract disclosing a peptide 698-712 from FVIII which can promote FIXa mediated activation of FX on a phospholipid surface. However, in the presence of FVIIIa, the peptide inhibits FIXa mediated activation of FX on a phospholipid surface. To date, there has been no peer-reviewed publication by these authors confirming results disclosed in this poster abstract.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0019">Blostein et al (2000) <i>Biochemistry </i>39:12000-12006 discloses that amphipathic alpha helices can interact with FIXa Gla domains and increases activation of FX in the absence of phospholipid. The peptides appeared to work independently of amino acid sequence by mimicking phospholipids. There is no suggestion to use such peptides in therapy. Under normal conditions, activated platelets provide the lipid surface supporting coagulation. Since platelets are activated by thrombin, which is formed at sites of vascular injury, coagulation processes are restricted to the sites of injuries. It is highly undesirable to provide the body with peptides that are general substitutes for procoagulant lipids as this would cause systemic coagulation and ultimately lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Therefore, the peptides described by Blostein would not be useful in therapy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0020">U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,109,170 and 6,624,289 disclose regions of the FIXa protease domain that interact with FVIIIa. The peptides comprise the FVIIIa binding site of FIXa and inhibit binding of FIXa to FVIIIa. However, they are only useful as anticoagulants for preventing or treating thrombosis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0021">US20010014456A1 discloses binding molecules for human FVIII and FVIII-like proteins. These polypeptides bind FVIII and/or FVIII-like polypeptides and are useful for the detection and purification of human FVIII and/or FVIII-like polypeptides from solutions such as blood or conditioned media.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0022">In U.S. Pat. No. 7,033,590 FIX/FIXa activating antibodies and antibody derivatives are used for increasing the amidolytic activity of FIXa, and for treating blood coagulation disorders such as hemophilia A and hemorrhagic diathesis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0023">In U.S. Pat. No. 7,084,109 FVIIa antagonists are disclosed. These antagonists are peptides that inhibit FVIIa activity and are said to be useful for prevention of arterial thrombosis in combination with thrombolytic therapy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0024">The listing or discussion of a prior-published document in this specification should not necessarily be taken as an acknowledgement that the document is part of the state of the art or is common general knowledge.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0025">There remains a great need in the art for a low molecular weight peptide with procoagulant activity for treatment of patients with hemophilia A (FVIII deficiency). The present invention provides novel low molecular weight peptides with procoagulant activity which can be used for the non-intravenous treatment of hemophilia A. The present prevention also provides these novel peptides for the treatment of a deficiency in FV, FVII, FX and/or FXI.</div>

<heading id="h-0011">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0042">The term “amino acid” within the scope of the present invention is intended to include all naturally occurring L α-amino acids. The one and three letter abbreviations for naturally occurring amino acids are used herein (Lehninger, Biochemistry, 2d ed., Worth Publishers, New York, 1995: 71-92). The term “amino acid” also includes stereoisomers (for example D-amino acids) and modifications of naturally occurring amino acids, non-proteinogenic amino acids, and structures designed to mimic amino acids.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0043">Modified and non-proteinogenic amino acids are described generally in Grant, Synthetic Peptides: A User's Guide, Oxford University Press, 1992.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0044">It is possible to provide, for example, improved stability and solubility, resistance to protease degradation, and activity of the peptide by the introduction of various amino acids that do not naturally occur, or by modification of the amino acid as discussed herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0045">Non-proteinogenic amino acids may include but are not limited to β-alanine (β-Ala), norvaline (Nva), norleucine (Nle), 4-aminobutyric acid (γ-Abu), 2-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib), 6-aminohexanoic acid (ε-Ahx), ornithine (orn), hydroxyproline (Hyp), sarcosine, citrulline, cysteic acid (Coh), and cyclohexylalanine, methioninesulfoxide (Meo), methioninesulfone (Moo), homoserinemethylester (Hsm), propargylglycine (Eag), 5-fluorotryptophan (5Fw), 6-fluorotryptophan (6Fw), 3′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl-alanine (Ear), 3′,4′-difluorophenylalanine (Dff), 4′-fluorophenyl-alanine (Pff), 1-naphthyl-alanine (1Ni), 1-methyltryptophan (1Mw), penicillamine (Pen), homoserine (HSe). Further, such amino acids may include but are not limited to, α-amino isobutyric acid, t-butylglycine, t-butylalanine, phenylglycine (Phg), benzothienylalanine (Bta), L-homo-cysteine (L-Hcys), N-methyl-phenylalanine (NMF), 2-thienylalanine (Thi), 3,3-diphenylalanine (Dew), homophenylalanine (Hfe), s-benzyl-L-cysteine (Ece) or cyclohexylalanine (Cha). These and other non-proteinogenic amino acids may exist as D- or L-isomers. Where no indication of the isomer is given, the L-isomer is intended.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0046">Structures which are designed to mimic amino acids are compounds in which the amino and/or carboxyl group of an amino acid is replaced by another group. Non-limiting examples are the incorporation of thioamides, ureas, thioureas, acylhydrazides, esters, olefines, sulfonamides, phosphoric acid amides, ketones, alcohols, boronic acid amides, benzodiazepines and other aromatic or non-aromatic heterocycles (for a review see M. A. Estiarte, D. H. Rich in Burgers Medicinal Chemistry, 6th edition, volume 1, part 4, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 2002). If these structures are included in a peptide derivative they are usually connected to the rest of the peptide derivative with at least one of the above mentioned functional groups instead of an amide bond.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0047">By “peptide” we include not only molecules in which amino acid residues are joined by peptide (—CO—NH—) linkages but also molecules in which the peptide bond is reversed. A “retro modified” peptide is a peptide that is made up of amino acids in which the amino acid residues are assembled in opposite direction to the native peptide with respect to which it is retro modified. Where the native peptide comprises L-amino acids, the “retro modified” peptide will also comprise L-amino acids. However, where the native peptide comprises D-amino acids, the “retro modified” peptide will comprise D-amino acids. Retro peptides contain NH—CO bonds instead of CO—NH peptide bonds. An “inverse modified” peptide is a peptide in which the amino acid residues are assembled in the same direction as the native peptide with respect to which it is inverso modified, but the chirality of the amino acids is inverted. Thus, where the native peptide comprises L-amino acids, the “inverso modified” peptide will comprise D-amino acids. Where the native peptide comprises D-amino acids, the “inverse modified” peptide will comprise L-amino acids. Inverse peptides still have CO—NH peptide bonds. A “retro-inverso modified” peptide refers to a peptide that is made up of amino acid residues which are assembled in the opposite direction and which have inverted chirality with respect to the native peptide to which it is retro-inverso modified. A retro-inverse analogue has reversed termini and reversed direction of peptide bonds (i.e. NH—CO) while approximately maintaining the topology of the side chains as in the native peptide sequence. Guichard et al (1994) <i>Proc. Natl, Acad. Sci USA </i>91:9765-9769 described that a retro-inverso peptide mimicked the structure and antigenic activity of the natural L-peptide IRGERA, but not of the D- and retro peptides. Such retro-inverso peptidomimetics may be made using methods known in the art, for example such as those described in Meziere et al (1997) <i>J. Immunol. </i>159, 3230-3237, incorporated herein by reference. Partial retro-inverso peptide analogues are polypeptides in which only part of the sequence is reversed and replaced with enantiomeric amino acid residues. Processes for making such analogues are described in Pessi, A., Pined, M., Verdini, A. S. &amp; Viscomi, G. C. (1987) “Totally solid phase synthesis of peptide(s)-containing retro-inverted peptide bond, using crosslinked sarcosinyl copolymer as support”, European Patent 97994-B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0048">Conventionally, L-amino acids are designated using upper case, and D-amino acids are designated in lower case. The peptides and peptide derivatives of the invention are designated in their preferred form, but without limiting them to the preferred form. The peptide of the first aspect of the invention is designated as comprising WDLYFEIVW (SEQ ID NO: 1) or a variant thereof. The peptide of the first aspect of the invention may also be the retro-inverso variant of WDLYFEIVW (SEQ ID NO: 1) or a variant thereof, namely wviefyldw or a variant thereof. The peptide of the second aspect of the invention is designated as comprising cimfwydcye (SEQ ID NO: 432) or a variant thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0049">Conventionally, where the amino acids are joined by peptide bonds, a peptide is represented such that the amino group at the N-terminus appears to the left and the carboxyl group at the C-terminus to the right. Peptides and peptide derivatives according to the present invention are represented in this manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0050">A “peptide derivative” contains a modification of one or more amino acid residues or a linker group or other covalently linked group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0051">Examples of derivatives include N-acyl derivatives of the amino terminal or of another free amino group, esters of the carboxyl terminal or of another free carboxyl or hydroxy group, amides of the carboxyl terminal or of another free carboxyl group produced by reaction with ammonia or with a suitable amine, glycosylated derivatives, hydroxylated derivatives, nucleotidylated derivatives, ADP-ribosylated derivatives, pegylated derivatives, phosphorylated derivatives, derivatives conjugated to lipophilic moieties, and derivatives conjugated to an antibody or other biological ligand. Also included among the chemical derivatives are those obtained by modification of the peptide bond —CO—NH—, for example by reduction to —CH<sub>2</sub>—NH— or alkylation to —CO—N(alkyl)—.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0052">A preferred derivatisation is C-terminal amidation. C-terminal amidation of a peptide removes the negative charge of the C terminus. Peptide derivatives having a C-terminal amide are represented with “NH<sub>2</sub>” at the C-terminus, for example Ac-WDLYFEIVW-NH<sub>2 </sub>(SEQ ID NO: 333). Another preferred derivatisation is N-terminal acetylation. This removes the positive charge at the N-terminus. Blocking of the C- or N-terminus, such as by C-terminal amidation or N-terminal acetylation, may improve proteolytic stability due to reduced susceptibility to exoproteolytic digestion.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0055">Peptides (at least those containing peptide linkages between amino acid residues) may be synthesised by the Fmoc strategy of solid-phase peptide synthesis as described in “Fmoc Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis—A Practical Approach”, edited by W. C. Chan, P. D. White, Oxford University Press, New York 2000 and references therein. Temporary N-amino group protection is afforded by the 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) group. Repetitive cleavage of this highly base-labile protecting group is effected using 20% piperidine in N,N-dimethylformamide. Side-chain functionalities may be protected as their butyl ethers (in the case of serine, threonine and tyrosine), butyl esters (in the case of glutamic acid and aspartic acid), butyloxycarbonyl derivative (in the case of lysine and histidine), trityl derivative (in the case of cysteine, asparagine and glutamine) and 4-methoxy-2,3,6-trimethylbenzenesulphonyl derivative (in the case of arginine). The solid-phase support is based on a polydimethyl-acrylamide polymer constituted from the three monomers dimethylacrylamide (backbone-monomer), bisacryloylethylene diamine (cross linker) and acryloylsarcosine methyl ester (functionalising agent). The peptide-to-resin cleavable linked agent used is the acid-labile 4-hydroxymethyl-phenoxyacetic acid derivative, or in case of C-terminal amides, the Rink-amide linker. All amino acid derivatives are added as their preformed symmetrical anhydride derivatives with the exception of asparagine and glutamine, which are added using a reversed N,N-dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide/1-hydroxybenzotriazole mediated coupling procedure. All coupling and deprotection reactions are monitored using ninhydrin, trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid or isotin test procedures. Upon completion of synthesis, peptides are cleaved from the resin support with concomitant removal of side-chain protecting groups by treatment with 95% trifluoroacetic acid containing a 50% scavenger mix. Scavengers commonly used are ethanedithiol, phenol, anisole and water, the exact choice depending on the constituent amino acids of the peptide being synthesised. Trifluoroacetic acid is removed by evaporation in vacua, with subsequent trituration with diethyl ether affording the crude peptide. Any scavengers present are removed by a simple extraction procedure which on lyophilisation of the aqueous phase affords the crude peptide free of scavengers. Reagents for peptide synthesis are generally available from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (UK) Ltd, Nottingham NG7 2QJ, UK. Purification may be effected by any one, or a combination of, techniques such as size exclusion chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography, differential solubility and (principally) reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Analysis of peptides may be carried out using thin layer chromatography, reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, amino-acid analysis after acid hydrolysis and by fast atom bombardment (FAB) mass spectrometric analysis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0056">SPOT-synthesis, which allows the positional addressable, chemical synthesis of peptides on continuous cellulose membranes may be also used (R Frank <i>Tetrahedron </i>(1992) 48, 9217).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0057">As an alternative to solid phase peptide synthesis techniques, peptides may also be produced by recombinant protein expression or in vitro translation systems (Sambrook et al, “Molecular cloning: A laboratory manual”, 2001, 3<sup>rd </sup>edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.). Of course, it is only peptides which contain naturally occurring amino acid residues joined by naturally-occurring peptide bonds which are encodable by a polynucleotide. Such methods are preferred over solid phase peptide synthesis techniques where the peptide is particularly large, such as larger than 50 amino acids, or larger than 100 amino acids.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0094">Preferably, the peptide or peptide derivative of the second aspect of the invention is a cyclic peptide. The peptide or peptide derivatives of the first aspect may also be cyclic.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0095">The term “cyclic peptide” as used herein—refers to a cyclic derivative of a peptide to which, for example, two or more additional groups suitable for cyclization have been added, often at the carboxyl terminus and at the amino terminus. Suitable groups include amino acid residues. A cyclic peptide may contain either an intramolecular disulfide bond, i.e. —S—S—, an intramolecular amide bond between the two added residues, i.e. —CONH— or —NHCO—, or intramolecular S-alkyl bonds, i.e. —S—(CH<sub>2</sub>)n —-CONH— or —NH—CO(CH<sub>2</sub>)n —S—, wherein n is 1, 2 or more and preferably no more than 6. Cyclization may be also carried out by triazine chemistry as exemplified in Scharn, D. et al. (2001) <i>J. Org, Chem </i>66; 507. Cyclic peptide sequences are denoted with the prefix “cyclo” in front of the peptide sequence and the cyclic part of the sequence is incorporated in parenthesis and additionally separated from the rest of the sequence by hyphens.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0096">A peptide or peptide derivative of the first or second aspect of the invention may be modified by conjugation to polyethylene glycol (PEG). Suitable methods of PEGylation are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,614 (Zalipsky; Enzon, Inc.) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,539,063 (Hakimi et al; Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.), all of which PEGylation methods are incorporated herein by reference. Various molecular weights of PEG may be used, suitably from 5000 to 40000 kD. A preferred molecular weight is 5000 kD. Preferably, the PEG is monodisperse, meaning that there is little variation in molecular weight between PEG molecules. PEGylation may improve the solubility and plasma half-life of a peptide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0097">A third aspect of the invention provides a dual peptide comprising a peptide or peptide derivative of the first or second aspects of the invention conjugated to a further peptide or peptide derivative of the first or second aspects of the invention, wherein the peptide or peptide derivative may be the same as or different from the further peptide or peptide derivative, and wherein the dual peptide has procoagulant activity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0098">The dual peptide may comprise two of the same, or two different, peptides or peptide derivatives of the first or second aspects of the invention covalently linked to one another, either by a flexible linker which can be peptidic, peptidomimetic or non-peptidic, or by a conformationally constrained linker that can comprise conformationally constrained peptidic, peptidomimetic or non-peptidic building blocks e.g. triazine moieties, or by any other possible method known in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0099">Preferably, the peptide or peptide derivative of the first and second aspects of the invention and the dual peptide of the third aspect of the invention has a molecular weight of between 0.5 and 3.5 kD. By “molecular weight” we mean the theoretical mass of a monomer of the peptide or peptide derivative exclusive of any counter ions or adducts. For PEGylated peptides the molecular weight is defined as the mass of the monomeric molecule exclusive of any counter ions or adducts and exclusive of the PEG moiety or moieties. Peptides, peptide derivatives and dual peptides of between 0.5 kD and 3.5 kD are more readily synthesised than larger peptides, have a reduced risk being immunogenic, and are generally easily administered to a patient. Peptides of less than 0.5 kD may be readily synthesised and administered and are less likely to be immunogenic, but may not possess the required procoagulant activity. Nevertheless, peptides, peptide derivatives and dual peptides of less than 0.5 kD and greater than 3.5 kD are encompassed by the invention if they possess the appropriate activity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0100">The peptides and peptide derivatives of the first and second aspects of the invention and the dual peptide of the third aspect of the invention possess procoagulant activity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0101">By “procoagulant activity” we mean the ability to promote thrombin generation and/or fibrin deposition in a suitable test system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0102">It will be appreciated that different assays are available to determine procoagulant activity. Indeed, there are different types of procoagulant activity. Peptides and peptide derivatives may promote coagulation in plasma depleted of FV, FVII, FVIII, FX or FXI. In a preferred embodiment, a peptide or peptide derivative of the invention promotes thrombin generation and/or fibrin deposition in plasma in which FVIII is depleted or absent. This type of activity is referred to as coagulation FVIII activity. Where the plasma is from an individual lacking FVIII, the activity is typically referred to as FVIII equivalent activity. Where the plasma contains inhibitors against FVIII, the activity is typically referred to as FVIII inhibitor bypassing equivalent activity. Other procoagulant activities include FV activity, FVII activity, FX activity and FXI activity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0103">Individual peptides and peptide derivatives may vary in their relative efficacy between different types of assay. Therefore, even if a peptide or peptide derivative appears to have a low efficacy in a particular assay, it may nevertheless possess a suitably high level of procoagulant activity in another assay.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0104">A suitable assay to determine procoagulant activity is the Defined Intrinsic Thrombin Generation Assay described below. In this assay, a compound is considered to have procoagulant activity if, at a concentration of 25, 50 or 100 μM it can stimulate the generation of 5 nM thrombin in 60 minutes, and preferably in 50, 40, 30, 20 or 10 minutes. Preferably, it can stimulate generation of 10 nM thrombin in 60 minutes, and more preferably in 50, 40, 30, 20 or 10 minutes. An alternative assay is the Defined Dual-Pathway Thrombin Generation Assay described below. In this assay, a compound is considered to have procoagulant activity if, at a concentration of 25, 50 or 100 μM it can stimulate the generation of 5 nM thrombin in 70 minutes, and preferably 60, 50, 40, 30 or 20 minutes. Preferably, it can stimulate generation of 10 nM thrombin in 70 minutes, and more preferably 60, 50, 40, 30 or 20 minutes. The above assays are particularly useful for determining coagulation FVIII activity because they are conducted in the presence of FVIII-depleted or inhibited plasma. However, they can be readily adapted to test for other types of procoagulant activity by substituting a suitable depleted or inhibited plasma for FVIII-depleted or inhibited plasma.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0105">Suitably, the procoagulant activity is a thrombin generation time of 25, 50 or 100 μM of compound in a Defined Intrinsic Thrombin Generation Assay equivalent to that of at least 100 mU/mL Factor Eight Inhibitor Bypassing Activity (FEIBA), preferably at least 300 mU/mL FEIBA, more preferably at least 600 mU/mL FEIBA and most preferably at least 1200 mU/mL FEIBA. Thrombin generation time or peak time is the time interval from the addition of the pre-warmed plasma to the other components in the assay described below, to the time of the thrombin peak maximum.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0106">Alternatively, the procoagulant activity is a thrombin peak maximum of 25, 50 or 100 μM of compound in a Defined Dual-Pathway Thrombin Generation Assay (DDPTGA) equivalent to at least 1 mU/mL Factor Eight Inhibitor Bypassing Activity (FEIBA), preferably at least 5 mU/mL FEIBA, most preferably at least 10 mU/mL FEIBA. Thrombin peak maximum, also referred to as Peak IIa is the maximal thrombin concentration generated during the assay. The Defined Dual-Pathway Thrombin Generation Assay can be used to determine coagulation activities other than FVIII activity if suitable factor depleted plasma is substituted for FVIII deficient or inhibited plasma. A peptide, peptide derivative or dual peptide of the invention is considered to have FV, FVII, FX or FXI activity if, at a concentration of 25, 50 or 100 μM, it can stimulate the generation of more thrombin in a DDPTGA using FV, FVII, FX or FXI deficient plasma respectively over 120 minutes than is stimulated in the absence of peptide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0107">Suitably, the procoagulant activity is a thrombin generation time of 25, 50 or 100 μM of compound in a Defined Intrinsic Thrombin Generation Assay peaking within 30 minutes, preferably within 15 minutes and most preferably within 10 minutes. Alternatively, the procoagulant activity is a thrombin generation time of 25, 50 or 100 μM of compound in a Defined Dual-Pathway Thrombin Generation Assay peaking within 50 minutes, preferably within 45 minutes and most preferably within 30 minutes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0108">The effect of a peptide or peptide derivative or dual peptide on thrombin generation may be determined in FVIII immuno inhibited, FVIII immuno depleted, FVIII inhibitor patient or hemophilia A patient plasma or other types of coagulation factor deficient plasmas, for example by continuously monitoring the slow cleavage of the thrombin-specific fluorogenic substrate I-1140 (Bachem) in a black 96-well micro plate (Cliniplate, Thermo Labsystems) as described below. Parameters that can usefully be measured in thrombin generation assays to determine the effect of the peptide or peptide derivative are thrombin concentration at peak time; thrombin generation time at peak thrombin; slope of propagation phase of thrombin generation curve and lag time of thrombin generation (initiation phase).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0109">The intrinsic pathway of thrombin generation may be assayed in a thrombin generation assay by including FXIa and phospholipids. In such an assay, which is similar to an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) test, thrombin generation is solely directed through the intrinsic pathway, and is FVIII dependent. A suitable assay is the Defined Intrinsic Thrombin Generation Assay described below. Alternatively, by employing low concentrations of TF and phospholipids instead of FXIa and phospholipids, thrombin is generated by both the extrinsic (tissue factor) and the intrinsic pathways. This form of the thrombin generation assay is the more physiologic one, as both thrombin generation pathways are involved; it is partially FVIII dependent. A suitable assay is the Defined Dual-Pathway Thrombin Generation Assay.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0110">The Defined Intrinsic Thrombin Generation Assay is performed as follows. FVIII activity of human plasma is inhibited by incubating (2 hours, 37° C.) 40 μl of human normal plasma with 10 μl heat inactivated anti-human FVIII plasma raised in goat (600 BU/ml, 6 hours incubated at 56° C.). A 15 μl mix of FXIa (16.67 nM) (Enzyme Research Laboratories) and phospholipids (Phosphatidylcholine/Phosphatidylserine 60%/40%, 120 μM) (Avanti Polar Lipids), 15 μl mix of 3.33 mM I-1140 and 50 mM CaCl<sub>2 </sub>and 10 μl peptide solution (different concentrations) are added to 10 μl 2× HNa/HSA5 (50 mM Hepes, 350 mM NaCl, pH 7.35, 10 mg/ml HSA). After six minutes incubation at 37° C., thrombin generation is started by the addition of 50 μl pre-warmed (37° C.) FVIII-inhibited plasma. Instead of FVIII-inhibited plasma, FVIII inhibitor patient plasma or several depleted plasmas can be used. The micro-plate is immediately put into a GENios Plus (Tecan) or Safire 2 (Tecan) fluorescence reader and the fluorescence signal (ex 340 nm/em 440 nM) is followed kinetically by reading the plate every 21 seconds. By deviating the original fluorescence data the amount of generated thrombin is calculated from a standard curve constructed using a concentration range of thrombin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0111">For calculation of activity equivalent units experiments are performed with dilutions of Factor Eight Inhibitor Bypassing Agent (FEIBA, Baxter AG), Immunate (human FVIII, purified plasma derived) reference standard (Baxter AG) or Recombinate standard (human FVIII, purified recombinant, Baxter AG). A linear fit of the logarithm of FEIBA (FVIII) concentration plotted against thrombin generation time at peak thrombin results in a standard curve. With this curve FEIBA (FVIII) equivalent activity is calculated for a defined peptide concentration. Where a peptide concentration is given herein, it is to be understood that it is not the concentration of peptide in the final assay volume, but a concentration as corrected for plasma volume. The concentration in the final assay volume is the corrected concentration divided by 2.5. Thus, where a concentration of 100 μM is given, the actual concentration in the final assay volume in 40 μM. Similarly, the FEIBA equivalent activity is also corrected for plasma volume. Thus, if it is stated that at 100 μM a peptide has an activity equivalent to 100 mU/ml FEIBA in the DITGA, the concentration of peptide in the final assay volume is 40 μM and the equivalent concentration of FEIBA in the control assay is 40 mU/ml FEIBA.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0112">The Defined Dual-Pathway Thrombin Generation Assay is performed as described below, using a commercial test kit (Technothrombin TGA, Technoclone GmbH, Vienna, Austria). Briefly, a mix of 40 μl 1.25 mM fluorogenic substrate (Z-GGR-AMC) 18.75 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>), 10 μl TGA reagent B (phospholipid vesicles Phosphatidylcholine Phosphatidylserine 80%/20% (3.20) containing 17.9 pM recombinant human tissue factor; Technoclone GmbH) or 10 μl TGA reagent C high (phospholipid vesicles Phosphatidylcholine/Phosphatidylserine 80%/20% (320) containing 71.6 pM recombinant human tissue factor; Technoclone GmbH) and 10 μl peptide dilution, FEIBA reference standard or FVIIa standard dilutions (Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, Ind. USA) are incubated four minutes at 37° C. Preferably, Reagent C high is used. Thrombin generation is started by the addition of 40 μl of one of several types of human plasma (37° C.). Conversion of the fluorogenic substrate by thrombin is followed by immediately putting the plate into a preheated (37° C.) microplate fluorescence reader (Tecan Safire 2, ex 360 nm em 460 nm) and kinetically reading the plate every 30 seconds. By deviating the original fluorescence data the amount of generated thrombin is calculated from a standard curve constructed using a concentration range of thrombin. Non linear regression analysis of factor VIIa or FEIBA concentrations plotted against the thrombin at peak of the thrombin generation curve or time to peak thrombin results in standard curves. With these curves, factor VIIa or FEIBA equivalent activity can be calculated for a defined peptide concentration. As described in relation to DITGA, where a peptide concentration is given herein in relation to the DDPTGA, it is to be understood that it is not the concentration of peptide in the final assay volume, but a concentration as corrected for plasma volume. The concentration in the final assay volume is the corrected concentration divided by 2.5. FEIBA equivalent activity is also corrected for plasma volume by applying the same correction factor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0113">Another suitable assay to determine procoagulant activity, and particularly FVIII equivalent activity or FVIII inhibitor bypassing activity, is the Defined Fibrin Deposition Assay as described below. Suitably, the procoagulant activity of a sample of 25 μM test compound in the Defined Fibrin Deposition Assay is equivalent to at least 30 mU/mL Factor Eight Inhibitor Bypassing Activity (FEIBA), preferably at least 80 mil/mL FEIBA, most preferably at least 200 mU/mL FEIBA. This assay is particularly useful for determining coagulation FVIII activity because it is conducted in the presence of FVIII-depleted or inhibited plasma.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0114">The Defined Fibrin Deposition Assay is performed as follows. FVIII activity of human citrated plasma (Baxter AG) is first inhibited by incubating (2 hours, 37° C.) 100 μl of human normal plasma with 25 μl heat inactivated anti-human FVIII plasma (300 BU/ml, 6 hours incubated at 56° C.) raised in goat. For each sample to be tested, 125 μl of this FVIII-inhibited human normal plasma is transferred to a pre-warmed cuvette and a 75 μl dilution of a test compound or FEIBA reference standard (Baxter AG) is added. The dilutions of test compound or FEIBA reference standard contain 50 mM imidazole, 100 mM NaCl and 10 mg/ml human serum albumin (Sigma) pH 7.4. As a trigger and for providing procoagulant surfaces 100 μl of a mix of human factor XIa (3.13 nM, Enzyme Research Laboratories) and phospholipid (PL) vesicles (Phosphatidylcholine/Phosphatidylserine 60%/40%, 30 μM; Avanti Polar Lipids) in 50 mM Imidazole, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mg/ml human serum albumin (Sigma) pH 7.4 is included. After incubating for three minutes at 37° C. the coagulation reaction is started by adding 100 μl of 25 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Clot formation is monitored by a coagulometer (KC10A, Amelung, Germany). In brief, each cuvette rotates slowly above the magnetic detection device and contains a small magnetic metallic ball. Whilst the plasma components remain in solution, the ball sits at the bottom of the cuvette. Over time, a clot begins to form, such that the ball starts to rotate with the developing clot in the rotating cuvette. The “clotting time” is recorded and is defined as the time from addition of the CaCl<sub>2</sub>) to the time that the developing clot begins to rotate the metallic ball. A standard curve for FEIBA reference standard dilutions is calculated by linear regression of logarithmic FEIBA concentrations (x-axis) against the clotting time (y-axis). Based on the clotting time of each compound concentration FEIBA equivalent activities are calculated according to this standard curve.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0115">Where a peptide concentration is given herein in relation to the Defined Fibrin Deposition Assay, it is to be understood that it is not the concentration of peptide in the final assay volume, but a concentration as corrected for plasma volume. The concentration in the final assay volume is the corrected concentration divided by 4. Thus, where a concentration of 100 μM is given, the actual concentration in the final assay volume in 25 μM. Similarly, the FEIBA equivalent activity is also corrected for plasma volume. Thus, if it is stated that at 100 μM a peptide has an activity equivalent to 100 mU/ml FEIBA in the Defined Fibrin Deposition Assay, the concentration of peptide in the final assay volume is 25 μM and the equivalent concentration of FEIBA in the control assay is 25 mU/ml FEIBA.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0116">Preferably, the peptides and peptide derivatives of the first and second aspects of the invention and the dual peptide of the third aspect of the invention can at least partially compensate for the absence of biologically active FVIII when administered in an animal model of severe human hemophilia A. For example, they may be active in controlling bleeding in FVIII deficient mice, such as the strains described in detail by Bi et a! (<i>Nat Genet, </i>1995; 10:119-21), in which exon 17 or exon 16 of FVIII is disrupted.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0117">A suitable assay to test the ability of a compound to control bleeding is the tail clip assay. Peptides, peptide derivatives or dual peptides are administered to mice in a suitable vehicle, typically i.v., i.p. or s.c. Different doses of each peptide or peptide derivative may be administered to different groups of mice to determine dose-dependency. Groups of mice, typically 8-16 male and female exon 17 FVIII knockout mice with severe hemorrhagic diathesis, receive a single i.v. (tail vein), i.p. or s.c. bolus injection (10 ml/kg body weight). Two minutes before tail clip, animals are anesthetized by an i.p. application of 100 mg/kg ketamine and 5 mg/kg xylazine. Five minutes after i.v. and 60 minutes after i.p. or s.c. peptide or peptide derivative administration 0.5 cm of the tail tip is ablated. Blood dropping from the wound is collected in tubes containing 5.0 ml 0.04% NH<sub>3 </sub>for defined time periods, such as 0-2 minutes, 2-4 minutes, 4-6 minutes, 6-8, 8-10, 10-12, 12-14, 14-16, 16-20, 20-24, 24-28, 28-32, 32-42, 42-52 and 52-62 minutes. Blood cells in each tube are disrupted and hemoglobin is extracted by a three hour incubation period at room temperature followed by ultrasound treatment. The absorbance at 414 nm and 620 nm of the extracts is determined in micro titre plates. 620 nm is a reference wavelength and the A<sub>620 </sub>reading is subtracted from the A<sub>414 </sub>reading. The amount of blood in the extract corresponding to the subtracted reading is calculated from a standard curve created by known amounts of blood from wild type control mice, such as C57/BI6 mice. Parameters of the bleeding characteristics of the mice to be recorded are total blood loss, bleeding rate, bleeding time, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 24 h and 48 h survival. Cumulative blood loss is calculated by summing up the amounts of blood for each time period. Data for the animals of a group are averaged and plotted against bleeding time. At each time point data sets for treatment and vehicle control groups are analysed by Student's t-test for statistical significance.</div>

Alternatively, peptide, peptide derivative or dual peptide may be incorporated within or bound to a proteinaceous micro or nano-particle for improved bioavailability. Suitable micro- and nano-particles are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,439,686 (Desai et al; Vivorx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., CA) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,498,421 (Grinstaff et al; Vivorx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., CA). Suitably, the proteinaceous nano-particle comprises human serum albumin, particularly human serum albumin or a recombinant form thereof. WO 2007/077561 (Gabbai; Do-Coop Technologies Ltd., Israel) describe another suitable carrier comprising nanostructures and a liquid, referred to therein as Neowater™.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0139">For oral and parenteral administration to patients, including human patients, the daily dosage level of the peptide, peptide derivative or dual peptide of the invention will usually be from 2 to 2000 mg per adult (i.e. from about 0.03 to 30 mg/kg), administered in single or divided doses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0140">Thus, for example, the tablets or capsules of the peptide, peptide derivative or dual peptide of the invention may contain from 2 mg to 2000 mg of active compound for administration singly or two or more at a time, as appropriate. The physician in any event will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for any individual patient and it will vary with the age, weight and response of the particular patient. The above dosages are exemplary of the average case. There can, of course, be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited and such are within the scope of this invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0141">For veterinary use, a peptide, peptide derivative or dual peptide of the invention is administered as a suitably acceptable formulation in accordance with normal veterinary practice and the veterinary surgeon will determine the dosing regimen and route of administration which will be most appropriate for a particular animal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0142">The peptides, peptide derivatives and dual peptides disclosed herein can be used for medical applications and animal husbandry or veterinary applications. Typically, the product is used in humans. The term “patient” is intended to denote a mammalian individual, and is so used throughout the specification and in the claims.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0143">A fifth aspect of the invention provides a peptide or peptide derivative of the first or second aspects or a dual peptide of the third aspect of the invention for treating a patient having a deficiency in FV, FVII, FVIII, FX and/or FXI.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0144">A sixth aspect of the invention provides a use of a peptide or peptide derivative of the first or second aspects or a dual peptide of the third aspect of the invention in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a deficiency in FV, FVII, FVIII, FX and/or FXI in a patient.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0143" num="0145">An seventh aspect of the invention provides a method of treating a patient having a deficiency in FV, EVIL FVIII, FX and/or FXI comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition of the fourth aspect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0144" num="0146">The peptides, peptide derivatives and dual peptides of the present invention can be used for the treatment of a deficiency in FV, EVIL FVIII, FX and/or FXI for both the prophylaxis and for treatment of acute bleeds. Patients with FVIII deficiency (hemophilia A) often develop inhibitor antibodies to FVIII. Inhibitor development (to FIX) is also known in FIX deficiency (hemophilia B). Since FV, FVII, FXI and FX deficiencies are very rare congenital disorders little is known about inhibitor development, although it is feasible that patients having such disorders might develop inhibitors. Treatment of inhibitor patients is a preferred embodiment of the fifth, sixth and seventh aspects. Such inhibitor patients may have either a high titer response of greater than 5BU or a low titer response of between 0.5 and 5 BU. Typically, the inhibitors are directed against FVIII and the patients have hemophilia A.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0147">The magnitude of the antibody response to FVIII can be quantified using a functional inhibitor assay, such as that described in Kasper C K et al (1975) Proceedings: A more uniform measurement of factor VIII inhibitors. Thromb Diath Haemorrh. 34(2):612. FXI inhibitors could be quantified by an aPTT assay as described by Kasper. Inhibitors of EV, FVII and EX could be quantified by a PT based assay following the procedure of Kasper.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0148">A peptide or peptide derivative according to the eighth, ninth or tenth aspects of the invention is not FVIII or a fragment thereof. Typically, it does not consist of or comprise the amino acid sequence of any FVIII protein, whether of human, mammalian or vertebrate origin. Neither does it consist of a fragment of a FVIII protein. Typically, it comprises fewer than 50, fewer than 20, fewer than 10, fewer than 5 contiguous amino acids of a FVIII protein, such as a human FVIII protein. Preferred peptides and peptide derivatives are the peptides and peptide derivatives of the first and second aspects of the invention, or the dual peptides of the third aspect of the invention. Alternative peptides and peptide derivative may be synthesised and tested for procoagulant activity as described in relation to the exemplified peptides and peptide derivatives.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0147" num="0149">Peptides and peptide derivatives of the eighth, ninth or tenth aspects of the invention may be formulated as pharmaceutical compositions, as described above, and may be used in medicine as described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0148" num="0150">The present invention will be further illustrated in the following examples, without any limitation thereto.</div>
<heading id="h-0012">Example 1: Synthesis and Identification of Compounds with Thrombin Generating Activity</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0149" num="0151">Compounds were screened using the “Defined intrinsic thrombin generation assay” in which thrombin generation was quantified in vitro in FVIII-inhibited human plasma in the presence of Factor XIa and phospholipid vesicles. Further compounds were screened in the above assay, and in the “Defined dual-pathway thrombin generation assay” using tissue factor and phospholipids instead of Factor XIa and phospholipids, as described in the specific description.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0150" num="0152">The compounds, which are peptides and peptide derivatives, were synthesised by classical solid phase peptide synthesis or SPOT-Synthesis at 50-100 nmol peptide per spot, which allows positionally addressable, chemical synthesis of peptides on continuous cellulose membranes. Peptides were dissolved in either 10% or 50% DMSO in water.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0153">PEGylation of peptides and peptide derivatives was carried out as follows. PEG5000 NHS-ester was coupled to the N-terminus of the HPLC-purified peptides in solution. If lysine was present in the peptide sequence, this amino acid was protected with the ivDde protecting group in order to avoid PEGylation at the ε-amino group. After coupling of the PEG5000 to the N-terminus, the ivDde protecting group was cleaved off by 3% hydrazine hydrate in dimethyl formamide followed by repurification of the final product by HPLC.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0152" num="0154">Compounds deemed to promote thrombin generation were identified, as indicated in Tables 7 and 8 below.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0161">An in vitro thrombin generation assay based on the cleavage of Z-GGR-AMC to release the fluorophore AMC was developed using normal human plasma, i.e. the Defined Dual-Pathway Thrombin Generation Assay. Tissue factor dependency of peak thrombin generation and thrombin peak time was characterised in a composition containing a fixed concentration of phospholipid (namely 3.2 μM). Phospholipid dependency was characterised in a composition containing a fixed concentration of tissue factor (namely 7.2 μM). Peak time (time to peak thrombin generation) was dependent on the concentration of phospholipid or tissue factor. The final version of this assay is as described in the specific description, in which 10 μl reagent C high containing (32 μM phospholipid and 71.6 μM tissue factor) is used in a total volume of 100 μl.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0162">Further studies were conducted using 3.2 μM phospholipid and 7.2 μM tissue factor in FVIII deficient or inhibited plasma, to characterise the effect on peak thrombin generation and thrombin peak time of various coagulation factor preparations. These studies provided a basis from which to compare the efficacy of the compounds in the assay. Briefly, rFVIII (Recombinate® FVIII from Baxter) was tested at 0, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 mU/ml in FVIII deficient plasma. FEIBA was tested at 0, 8, 16, 31, 63 and 125 mU/ml in FVIII inhibited plasma. FVIIa was tested at 0, 0.1, 0.4, 1.6, 6.3 and 25 nM in FVIII inhibited plasma. Results are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. For recombinant FVIII (Recombinate®) in FVIII deficient plasma and for both FEIBA and FVIIa in FVIII-immuno inhibited plasma a concentration dependent improvement of thrombin generation parameters is observed. Peak thrombin increased and both the lag time and the thrombin peak time decrease.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0163">The compounds were tested in this Defined Dual-Pathway Thrombin Generation Assay (DDPTGA) using reagent C high (Technoclone) for triggering thrombin generation. Results are given in the table below. Even though this assay is less sensitive for FVIII-like activity than the Defined Intrinsic Thrombin Generation Assay (DITGA), several compounds possessed detectable activity.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0165">Thrombin is still generated in this assay even in the absence of added peptide. Thus, where Peak IIa is “BLS” at a particular peptide concentration, there is still a thrombin peak, but it is lower than that achieved by the lowest concentration of standard, which is 5 mU/ml FVIII, 8 mU/ml FEIBA or 0.1 nM FVII. Similarly, when peak time is “BLS”, the time to peak thrombin generation is greater than the peak time achieved by the lowest concentration of standard. A peptide can have a significant effect on peak time but not peak IIa, or vice versa. However, it is preferred that a peptide has an effect on both peak time and peak IIa. B03, B04 and A15 positively affected both aspects of thrombin generation. In the case of some peptides, concentration dependency of an effect on thrombin generation was not seen at high peptide concentration, which might be explained by non-specific interactions.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0017" num="0000">1. Plasma Protein Binding</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0175" num="0177">The extent of compound binding to human plasma (Bioreclamation, Hicksville, N.Y.), mouse plasma (Lampire Laboratory, Pipersville, Pa.) or mouse serum albumin (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.), referred to as matrices, was determined in a 96-well micro-equilibrium dialysis block system (HDT-96; HTDialysis, LLC, Gales Ferry, Conn.). Briefly, each unit of the system comprises a donor chamber and a receiver chamber separated by a semi-permeable membrane. The principle of the experiment is that proteins (and compound bound to the proteins) are retained in the donor chamber and cannot cross the membrane. Free compound can diffuse between both chambers via the membrane and reaches equilibrium during the experiment. In these experiments, the semi-permeable membrane was made of regenerated cellulose and had a molecular weight cut-off of 12-14 kD (cat. no 1101, HTDialysis, LLC).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0176" num="0178">A protease inhibitor cocktail (P2714-1BTL), purchased from Sigma, was included in the assay to inhibit proteolysis of test compounds. It was freshly prepared at 50× stock solution in distilled water. Mouse serum albumin was freshly prepared in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 40 g/L. The PBS was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, Calif.), and it was adjusted to a pH of 7.4 prior to use. Plasmas were used without dilution. The protease inhibitor stock solution was added to each matrix (i.e. mouse serum albumin in PBS) at a final 1× concentration. Stock solutions of each test compound were prepared in DMSO with the control compound, warfarin. Warfarin, which is a high protein-binding compound, was included in each stock solution to ensure the integrity of the membrane during the experiment. An aliquot of the stock solution was added to each matrix to yield a final concentration of 5 μM of the test compound and 10 μM of warfarin. The final concentration of DMSO was 0.72% (v/v). The dilution of the matrices by the addition of the other components was negligible (less than 4%). The membrane strips were hydrated in distilled water for 1 hour; the membrane was soaked in 30% ethanol aqueous solution for 20 minutes, and then the membrane was rinsed twice with distilled water. After the rinse, the membrane was placed in PBS and was ready for use. The assembly of the dialysis block followed the manufacturer's protocol. After the assembly, an aliquot of 150 μl of each matrix test compound was added to a separate donor chamber and 150 μl of PBS was added to the corresponding receiver chamber on the other side of the membrane. The remainder of each matrix/test compound was stored at −80° C. for further analysis. The concentrations of the test compounds and warfarin in these matrices were measured and the values were used in the recovery calculations. The 96-well dialysis block was then placed in an enclosed, heated rocker, which was pre-warmed to 37° C., and allowed to incubate for 6 hours. After the incubation, both sides were sampled. The concentrations of the test compounds, as well as warfarin, were measured by LC/MS/MS analysis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0177" num="0179">The recovery and protein binding values were calculated as follows:
<br/>
% Recovery=[(Conc. in Donor+Conc. in Receiver)/(Measured Conc. in Matrix)]×100%  (1)
<br/>
% Bound=[(Conc. in Donor Conc. in Receiver)/(Conc. in Donor)]×100%  (2)
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0178" num="0180">“% Recovery” is a measure of how much of the compound added to the matrix is recoverable from the donor and receiver chambers. Where recovery is less than 100%, a proportion of the compound may have bound to the membrane or the plastic surfaces of the chambers or it may have degraded. “% Bound” is a measure of how much of the compound has bound to the matrix and is therefore unable to equilibrate between donor and receiver chambers.</div>

2. Plasma Stability
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0182" num="0184">Half-life of compounds in human or mouse plasma, or percentage of compound remaining after an incubation in human or mouse plasma, is determined as follows. In the experimental procedure, test compound concentrations are 5 μM, prepared from test compound stock solutions of 10 mM in DMSO. Propantheline is used as a standard. To prepare tests samples, a 1/20 dilution of the test compound stock solution in DMSO is prepared in 50% acetonitrile/50% H<sub>2</sub>O, and this is then diluted 1/100 in pre-warmed (37° C.) plasma (5 μl compound [1/20 dilution]+495 μl plasma) in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf-tube. The standard compound 2 mM propantheline is diluted 1/4 in DMSO and subsequently 1/100 in pre-warmed plasma (5 μl compound [1/4 dilution]+495 μl plasma) in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf-tube. All of the samples are incubated in a water bath at 37° C. 500 μl acetonitrile is added immediately after compounds, or propantheline standard, have been mixed with plasma (designated as t=0 min). After a chosen duration of incubation (generally at t=60 min) each sample is mixed with a further 500 μl acetonitrile. The samples are mixed on a vortex mixer for 30 s and placed on ice for 10 min and collected for centrifugation. Samples are centrifuged at 20 000 g for 10 min at 4° C. 500 μl supernatant is transferred into a new 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube and an equal volume of acetonitrile is added. The sample is mixed again for 30 s using a vortex mixer. After a second centrifugation step (20 000 g, 10 min, 4° C.) 250 μl of the supernatant is transferred into HPLC glass vials for HPLC-MS analysis. Conditions for performing HPLC are as follows: Injection-volume is set to 20 μl. Temperature is set to 25° C. A linear gradient from 95:5 to 5:95 water:acetonitrile both containing 0:05% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (v/v) is applied at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min for 10 min. The PDA-detector is scanning from 210-400 nm. The ion-trap is equipped with an ESI-source with temperature at 280° C., mass-scanning is done in full scan-mode from 50-2000 amu followed by dynamic exclusion MS<sup>2</sup>-experiment with 1.5 V collision energy (105 as min. count of parent ion). Percent-stability is calculated from area-under-curve (AUC) ratio monitoring the protonated molecular-mass ion of the target compound in the total-ion-current (tic) in full-scan mode at 60 min incubation time (or time of choice) vs. 0 min incubation time.</div>

3. Microsomal Stability
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0185" num="0187">Tests were used to determine the stability of compounds in microsomal preparations of human or animal origin. The microsomal stability is measured either in assays provided by Cerep (France, Catalog ref. 900-8h) or by the protocol described below. Compound solutions of 10 mM/5 mM (test compound, standards verapamil, imipramine, and terfenadine) are prepared in 100% DMSO. They are diluted by distilled H<sub>2</sub>O/MeOhl resulting in a final concentration of 1 μM in the assay, with less then 0.4% DMSO (v/v) in the final mixture. The mastermix for the stability assay is prepared in a 10 ml Falcontube (total volume 4.4 ml): 3414 μl distilled water, 440 μl 500 mM NaPO<sub>4</sub>-buffer pH 7.4, 440 μl NADP (10 mM), 22 μl Glc-6-P (1 M), 17.6 μl Glc-6-P-DH of a 1 U/ml solution, 66 μl liver microsomes (rat or mouse, final concentration in the assay 300 μg/ml). The mastermix is preincubated at 37° C. for 10 minutes in the water bath. 5 μl of 60 μM compound solution is added per well in a 96-well-U-Plate (PP-Nunc) together with 300 μl of reaction mixture (pre-incubated mastermix). All wells must be carefully mixed to ensure a homogenous suspension before the next steps. 75 μl samples (duplicates) at t=0 minutes are taken for each compound. The plate is sealed and returned to the water bath/thermomixer for 30 minutes. The test compounds/standards are extracted by addition of 200 μl methanol, also including an internal standard. The internal standard is “Pep770” (Jerini A G, Berlin, Germany) and is used at a final concentration of 6.25 ng/ml. The samples are centrifuged at 1300 g for 10 min at 4° C. 200 μl of the supernatant is transferred into a 96-well plate with 10 μl DMSO per well. Compound stability is measured by HPLC-MS analysis (triplicates). The same procedure is repeated after 30 min. The ratio of the mean “AUC t=0 min” and “AUC t=30 min” is calculated and the percentage of the amount of remaining compound after 30 min is determined. The signal to noise ratio for all peaks must be 5:1 or better. The ratio AUC<sub>analyte</sub>: AUC<sub>standard </sub>at the different timepoints must be used.

Solubility
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0188" num="0190">Aqueous solubility is measured in PBS at pH 7.4 either in an assay provided by Cerep (France, Catalog ref. 900-11a) or according to the following protocol. The aim of this procedure is to determine the solubility of a drug candidate (analyte) in a buffer, by estimating the saturation concentration of the candidate in the buffer using HPLC. A known concentration of the candidate in an organic solvent is used as a standard. A stock solution of the test compound in DMSO must be prepared as the initial step. Depending on the maximum solubility of the compound, a concentration of 50 mM in DMSO should be reached. DMSO stock-solutions are diluted to a final concentration of 50 μM with DMSO (100% reference-solution) and buffer (test-solution) to provide a minimum volume of 500 μL of each. Both solutions are shaken at 25° C. at 950 rpm in an Eppendorf “thermomixer comfort” for at least 60 min. The suspension is centrifuged at 22 330 g for at least two min and 100 μL of the supernatant is transferred into polypropylene-inserts placed in glass vials and closed by snap-ring caps. Alternatively the solutions can be prepared in microtiter plates with half of the previously described starting solvent volume. For the determination of the solubility all samples are analyzed by HPLC in triplicate. Injection volume is at least 10 μL. The obtained data are analyzed by “Chemstation-software” (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany). The peaks from the analyses of the organic solutions are integrated and the arithmetic mean is reported as “AUC 1” (reference area of known amount injected at the HPLC). The same procedure is applied to the spectra obtained from the analyses of the buffer solution to give “AUC 2” (area of the unknown amount of compound dissolved in buffer). In general the AUC must be greater then 20 area units and signal to noise (height of the peak) must be better than 3. The ratio of the mean “AUC 2” and “AUC 1” is calculated and thus the percentage of the dissolved amount of compound in buffer is obtained and solubility can be reported in μM.</div>

HERG Inhibition
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0191" num="0193">QT prolongation is assessed by HERG inhibition measured by patch-clamp techniques or Rb<sup>+</sup> efflux.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0192" num="0194">The Rb+ efflux method (Cerep, France, Catalog. Ref. 900-361b) is used for initial screening. For the Rb+ efflux assay, the reference compound (Astemizole) was tested concurrently with the test compounds in order to assess the assay suitability. It was tested at 10 μM and the data were compared with historical values determined at Cerep.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0193" num="0195">For rigorous characterization of HERG inhibition the patch clamp assay is applied (Cerep, France, Catalog ref. 900-36). The general potency ranking system is adopted from Roche et al., 2002<i>, Chem Bio Chem </i>3:455-459. To ensure that no change in the sensitivity of the assay has occurred, separate experiments conducted on the same (clone) batch of cells using 10 nM E-4031 (Wako, cat. no. 052-06523) yielded results (56.7±1.8% inhibition, Mean±SEM, n=3) comparable to historically obtained data (58.4±2.0% inhibition, Mean±SEM, n=3) at Cerep. The test compounds (10 mM stock solutions) were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). The solutions at 1 μM contained 0.01% DMSO. Bath solutions containing up to 1% DMSO have no significant effect on the HERG-encoded tail currents.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0194" num="0196">Screening of several compounds by the Rb+ efflux method at 10 μM indicated no inhibition of HERG channel activity. In the more sensitive patch clamp assay compounds A01, A05 and A16 can be classified as low-potency HERG-channel blockers whereas B03 was identified as a high potency HERG-channel blocker.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0212" num="0214">Pharmacokinetic studies were performed to monitor compound concentrations in plasma following i.v., i.p. or s.c. administration. Studies were conducted in C57BI/6 mice weighing approximately 20 g.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0213" num="0215">For each peptide, the same formulations were used for all administration routes and were as follows: A01 was formulated in 5% DMSO, 5% Cremophor EL (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.5% Tween 80; A02 and A09 were each formulated in 5% DMSO, 30% PEG 400 (polyethylene glycol) 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4; A05 was formulated in 5% DMSO, 20 mM glycine pH 9.0; A06 and A07 were each formulated in 5% DMSO, 0.9% NaCl, 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0214" num="0216">Peptide concentrations in the plasma were analysed by HPLC-MS on a Surveyor HPLC combined with mass spectrometer LCQ classic or Advantage (all Thermo Electron, US) equipped with an ESI-source. All HPLC experiments were carried out on a Phenomenex C-18 Luna column (50 mm×2.0 mm, 5 μl injection volume) using a linear gradient: eluent A 0.05% trifluoracetic acid (TFA) in water; eluent B 0.05% TFA in acetonitrile; flow rate 0.3 mL/min in 10 min. UV spectra were recorded by the FDA from 220 to 400 nm. The internal standard is prepared as a 0.1 μg/ml solution in 100% methanol. 50 μl plasma and 50 μl internal standard are mixed. 100 μl methanol is added and mixed thoroughly. After 30 min incubation on ice the vial is centrifuged for 15 min at 4° C. (20820 g). 150 μl of the supernatant are transferred into the HPLC vial</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0215" num="0217">Results following i.v. or i.p. administration are shown in the table below. In brief, peptide clearance from plasma following i.v. administration followed a roughly logarithmic course. Following i.p. administration, Cmax was reached at between 40 and 60 minutes. There then followed a decrease in compound concentration. This profile is typical for i.p. or s.c. administration.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0217" num="0219">Mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate were monitored and electrocardiogram taken in three groups of three male and three female C57BI/6 mice, each weighing about 20 g. The groups were assigned to “control” receiving 10 ml/kg NaCl i.v.; “vehicle” receiving 10 ml/kg i.v.; or “compound” receiving A01 in vehicle at 20 mg/kg i.v. “Vehicle” was DMSO 5%, Cremophor EL (Sigma-Aldrich) 5%, Tween 80 0.05% in water for injection.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0218" num="0220">For each mouse, a catheter filled with saline/heparin was fixed to the aorta carotis. The catheter was linked via a transducer to a blood pressure Plugsys-module (Hugo Sachs Electronik-Harvard Apparatus GmbH, Germany (HSE)). ECG electrodes were implanted s.c. and were linked via a ECG Plugsys-module (HSE) to a PC. Heart rate was calculated from the ECG. After a period of at least ten minutes to stabilize circulation parameters, saline, vehicle or compound was administered as appropriate via a catheter connected to the vena jugularis. Circulation parameters were monitored and recorded for 60 minutes after administration. For each animal, the time course in mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate within the observation period after study drug administration was estimated using the area under the curve (AUC) using the linear trapezoidal rule. The individual AUCs (A01 20 mg/kg i.v.) were compared with those of vehicle (10 mL/kg i.v.) and saline (10 mL/kg i.v.). The null hypothesis (no differences between compound and vehicle or saline) were assessed using the exact Wilcoxon rank sum test. Unadjusted and adjusted two-sided p-values for multiple comparisons were calculated. Adjustment for multiplicity was performed by using the Bonferroni-Holm method. The level of significance was set to 5%. All statistical analyses were performed with R Version 2.4.0. The null hypothesis of no difference was tested against the two-sided alternative. Results are shown in the table below.</div>

In the FIX−/− model, Immunine® FIX at 50-200 U/kg dose dependently improves bleeding parameters and survival. Thus, the FVIII−/− model is an appropriate model to test coagulation FVIII activity of the lead compounds.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0248" num="0250">It is typical for hemophilia A patients to develop alloantibody inhibitors to FVIII following high dose FVIII therapy. In a typical scenario, the presence of such antibodies in serum prepared from the patient's blood plasma is monitored by a clinician. When the titre of the antibody response becomes unacceptably high, such as about 5 BU, the clinician may decide to stop infusing the patient with FVIII, and start administering a peptide of the invention, such as peptide A01.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0249" num="0251">The peptide may be formulated as a microparticle of about 10 μm diameter in an albumin shell, suspended in an aqueous medium, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,439,686. The patient may self administer the formulation by inhalation using a nebulizer. A daily or twice daily dose of 5 or 10 mg may be inhaled. The clinician may test the partial thromboplastin time shortly after commencement of the peptide therapy, to confirm efficacy. Depending on the result, the dose could be varied accordingly. If it is necessary to substantially increase the dose, smaller microparticles could be used, typically of about 5 μm diameter, and they could be administered intravenously.</div>
