<div class="description-paragraph"> Countershaft 27 is mounted for revolution in bearing bosses l9 and 21 and has set ring 28 fastened thereon above bearing 19 disposed to bear thereon and support said countershaft in operative position. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Driving gear wheel 29 is fastened on the upper end of countershaft 27 for engagement with mechanism connected to a prime mover not shown. Gear wheel 30 is fastened on countershaft 2. below bearing 19 to engage with gear wheel 34 which is fastened on hollow eccentric shaft 23 to drive the same. Gear wheel 31 is fastened near the lower end of counter-shaft 27 to engage with gear wheel 32 which is fastened on the upper end of hub shaft 26 to drive the same. Set ring 33 is fastened on the upper end of hub shaft 26, disposed to bear on the upper end of the hub of gear 32, the lower end of which bears on the upper end of bearing boss 20, to support the hub shaft in operative position. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The construction provides that driving countershaft 27 through gear wheel 31 drives upper, head-frame disc and through gear wheel drives eccentric shaft 23. Gear wheels 31 and 32 preferably are of the same diameters, but preferably gear wheel 30 is of larger diameter than gear wheel 34 in order that eccentric shaft 23 may revolve at a higher rate than upper, head-frame disc 25 for reasons to be explained later. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Lower, head-frame disc 35 is mounted for revolution near and on the lower end of eccentric shaft 23 and is fastened to and parallel with upper head-frame disc 25 by frame rods 36, 36, 36, 36, which are fastened to lower head-frame disc 35 and extended through holes in upper head-frame disc 25 smaller than the bodies of the rods to cause shoulders on the same to bear against the lower sideof the upper head-frame disc which is clamped thereagainst by nuts 37 engaged on the protruding threaded ends of the said rods. Upper head-frame disc 25 and lower head-frame Cllfi 35 fastened together by frame rods 36 constitute the head frame of the machine. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The space on eccentric shaft 23 between discs 25 and 35 is occupied by four eccentrics, which, beginning next to upper headframe disc 25, are designated as 38, 39, 40 and 41 respectively. These eccentrics are mounted on the cam shaft and fastened thereto to revolve therewith, and are circular discs mounted eccentrically on the shaft. Preferably, they are all of the same diameter and are associated in two pairs. Pair of eccentrics 38, 39 are of equal eccentricity and oppositely disposed relatively on the line 5-5. Pair of eccentrics 40, 41 are of equal eccentricity, but of greater eccentricity than are eccentrics 38, 39, and are oppositely disposer relatively on the line cc. The head preferably revolves in a forward direction, as indicated by the arrow in Fig. 3, and line 00 is preferably about 20 in advance of line Z')6. As illustrated, line bb is in the horizon. I </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> On each of said eccentrics is mounted an eccentric strap with an arm attached. (in eccentric 38 is strap 42 with arm 43, on eccentric 39 is strap 44 with arm 45, on eccentric 40 is trap 46 with arm 47 and on eccentric 41 isstrap 48 with arm 49 thereon. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> is illustrated, arms 43 and of eccentric s ips 42 and 44 respectively on pair of ec centrics 38, 39 are disposed on o iposite sides of the pair of eccentric their center lines coinciding with line Z) Z) of said pair of eccentrics. But arms 47 and. 49 of eccentric straps 46 and 48 respectively, one pair of eccentrics 40, 41 are on opposite sides of said pair of eccentrics and their coinciding c ter lines are at right angles with strap ar 43, 45, although the center line 0-0 of their pair of eccentrics is shown as 70 backward in tation from said center line of said arms. Tl feature will be more fully explained. </div>

<div class="description-paragraph"> -c Rocker arms 63 and y sinnlar as are rocler l 54. Also rocker arms 54 and 63 are similar except, for reasons of compactness of the head, they are relatively right and left hand. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Gne of rocker arms 54 is chosen for particular segregated illustration in Figs. 69. The main body of the rocker arm 54 has transverse hole 55 therethrough through which the rocker shaft may be extended and fas tened by a clamping screw through bifurcated body ends a54, 654, also the position of the arm on the shaft is preferably localized by a key 652 as shown. Similar keys 650, 651, are shown in shafts 50, 51 and 53 respectively. Near the end of the arm not bifurcated is guide-way notch 57 in one side of the body only and transverse to hole 55. Provision is made to fasten plate 58 on the arm over one end of guideway notch 57, and in the outer edge of this plate midway of the guideway is supporting-screw notch (Z58. Slot 56 is made in the wall of the arm through the bottom of guideway notch 57. Rectangular block is adapted to slide in guideway 57 and has stud bolt 61 on one end thereof with a threaded end 661 thereon and also has wrist pin 62 on the end opposite said stud. A tapped hole (560 is made in one side of block 60. The several parts of the rocker arm are assembled by extending stud 61 through slot 56 and clamping block 60 in slideway 57 by a nut (61 on the threaded end of the stud bearing on the arm body, fastening plate 58 in place after supporting screw 59 is engaged in hole a60 in the block and notch (558 in the edge of the plate is engaged in the neck of the supporting screw. Block 60 may be adjusted in guideway 57 by screw 59 when it may be securely held in place by clamping nut (:61. Thus assembled, rocker shaft 50 is extended through hole 55 of the rocker arm which is localized in rotation on the shaft by a key and longitudinally by clamping screw 654 through bifurcated ends (r54, 654. Before clamping the arm by screw 054 pin 62 is engaged in the hole in the end of eccentric strap arm 49. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In the same manner the other rocker arm 54 is mounted on rocker shaft 52 and the pin 62 thereon is engaged with the hole in the end of eccentric strap arm 47. I </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Also rocker arms 63, 63 are mounted on rocker shaft 51 and 53, respectively, and pins 62 thereon are engaged with eccentric strap arms 43 and 45 respectively. Thus studs 61 may be adjusted in slots 56 to lengthen or shorten the eccentric strap arms considerably and liner adjustments of said arm lengths is made possible by the use of supporting screws 59 to retain the studs in desired positions in the slots while clamping nuts a61 are applied. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> As stated, rocker shafts 50, 52 have roller arms 64, 64 fastened on the lower ends thereof disposed adjacent and beneath lower headframe disc 35, while rocker shafts 51, 53 have roller arms 67, 67 fastened on the lower ends thereof adjacent and beneath lower headframe disc 35. Each of said roller arms is alike and they are differently designated in pairs to correspond with the two pairs of eccentrics 38, 39 and 40, 41. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">On roller arms 67, 67 are mounted for revolution on pins 66 therein rollers 68, 68,, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">and on roller arms 64, 64 are mounted for revolution on pins 66 therein rollers 65, 65. One of similar pins 66 is shown segregated in Fig. 10. These pins consist of body 66 and thin broad head 6566 and said body is extended through a hole near the bifurcated ends of the arms, shown at G67, 667 and a64, 664. With the pins in place in the arms they are retained therein by clamping screws 067 and 064 though holes in said bifurcated ends. The pins are set in the arms disposed to provide space for the rollers on the pins between heads a66 thereof and said arms. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Rollers 68, 68 are similar to rollers 65, except that grooves 668 in rollers 68 are shaped to be adapted for the number one or. first operation rollers while grooves 665 in rollers 65 are shaped to be adapted for the number two or second operation rollers. Rollers 68, 68 have flanges a68 and rollers 65, 65 have flanges 0765. All of the rollers are disposed to cause said roller flanges to be closely adjacent and above flange (L24 of chuck 24. And the grooves of all of the rollers are in the plane of chuck flange 4124 and closely approach said chuck flange when in their rolling or closed positions shown in dotted lines at 68, 68 and 65, 65, while they are separated from said flange a space suflicient to allow the rolled edge of a can bottom or top to intervene when in their open position shown in full lines at 68, 68 and 65, 65. a </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It may be seen that the rocker shafts serve as fulcrums between the eccentric strap arms and the can rollers, thus it requires outward movement of the strap arms to produce centerward movement of the can rollers and vice versa. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Now consider the relative movement between the eccentrics and their straps. The eccentrics are fastened on eccentric shaft 23 and revolve therewith, and the straps are enhead-frame disc 25 is integral with its hub shaft 26. Hub shaft 26 is connected to driving countershaft 27 by equal gears 31, 32 and is revolved at the rate of shaft 27. Eccentric shaft 23 is connected to shaft 27 by gears 34, 30 which are preferably in the ratio of 10 to 11. So that eccentric shaft 23 makes 11 revolutions while hub shaft 26 makes 10 revolutions, and upper and lower head-frame discs 25, 35 make ten revolutions while eccentrics 38, 39, 40' and 41 make eleven revolutions; that is, the eccentrics gain one complete revolution during each ten turns of the discs. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Then we may assume, while studying the related movements of the operative parts of the head, that wrist pins 62 are stationary while the eccentrics make one revolution. Figs. 4 and 5 may be consulted. The eccentrics cause the straps to oscillate on wrist pins 62, thus having no effect on the pins when lines bb and 00 of the eccentrics are at right angles with the strap arms and including arcs of about on each side of said right-angle locations. During the remaining parts of the revolution the eccentrics are effective in moving wrist pins 62 in oscillations on rocker shafts 50, 51, 52 and 53. As illustrated, the can rollers stand in outward position to allow a can to be removed from or placed on the chuck bythe elevator, not shown. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Revolve the eccentrics forward 180 and strap arms 43, will cause number one rollers 68, 68 which perform the first part of the seaming operation to bear on the ed 'e of any can end on chuck 24, but strap arms 47, 49 yet hold number two rollers 65, outward. Continue the revolution forward of the eccentrics for when arms 47, 49 will be fully extended to cause number two rollers 65, 65 which perform the last part of the seaming operation to bear on said can edge on the chuck flange, and the number one rollers will have but recently ceased to bear on the can. Continuing the forward revolution of the eccentrics and the number two rollers will leave their hearing positions directly and rapidly open till by the time another 45 in revolution has been passed. they will be open together with the number one rollers and the can may be removed by said conveyor and another can placed on the chuck by the same. Thus there will be an arc of about 65 to be traversed by the eccentrics during which the positions of the rollers will allow cans to be placed on and removed from the stationary chuck 24. 7 </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> During the period of one revolution of the eccentrics above examined. which, in fact, was taken from eleven revolutions thereof, head discs 25, 35 have made ten complete revolutions and the small arcs which were noted as the periods during which the rollers were hearing on the cans to attain the seaming thereof were in fact each several complete revolutions of the roller arms while the rollers were bearing with great pressure on the I can edge as it lay on the periphery of flange 0624 of the chuck. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It is now clear that by placing action line c'c of pair of eccentrics 40, 41 only 20 in 1 lead of action line b b of pair of eccentrics 38, 39 rath r than 90 in lead thereof, as are strap arms 47, 49 in lead of strap arms 43, 45, a sufficient lead is provided between the seaming operation of the number one and mum her two rollers and, what is very important in a high-speed seamer, a relatively large arc of revolution remains during which cans may be removed from and placed on the chuck. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It is also clear that the operating forces released within the seamer head are largely equally balanced against each other thus providing a self-contained resistant mechanism well suited for rapid and excellent work and long service. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Having thus disclosed my invention, what I claim as new therein and desire to secure by Letters Patent is, </div>
