<div class="description-paragraph">Application July 17, 1933, Serial No. 680,852 </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">1 claim. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> This invention has reference to pumps and the object of the invention is to provide an organization for pumping fuel oil to range oil burners from Y a reservoir situated in the basement or any other part of the building, although and as will appear apparent to those skilled in the art ythe pump can Y jects and advantages will be best understood from- Figure 1 is an elevational view illustrating the y application of the invention. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Figure 2 is a fragmentary sectional view showing the ball valve connection between two sections of the conduit line connecting the reservoir with the pump cylinder, and </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Figure 3 is an enlarged view illustrating certain details of construction to be hereinafter more fully referred to. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Referring to the drawings by reference numerals it will be seen that indicates generally a supporting structure including among other parts vertical posts 11, 12, and 13 respectively. Secured on the post 12 at the desired adjustment through the medium of set screws 14 are collars 15 that have pivoted thereto sections of two-part clamps 16 that embrace and are secured about the upper and lower ends of a pump cylinder 17. Mounted for reciprocation within the pump cylinder 17 is a piston 18 having a rod 19kthat operates through a gland structure 20 provided at the upper vend of the cylinder. At its upper outer end the rod 19 is provided with a laterally directed extremity 21 that is connected through the medium of a pitman rod 22 with a crank pin 23 provided on a fly wheel 24, mounted on a horizontal shaft 25. The shaft 25 is journalled in bearings on the ends of arms 26 integral with a collar 27 suitably mounted on post 11. On the Afree end of the shaft 25 is a handle 2a. and </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">obviously by rotating the handle 28 reciprocatory movement is imparted to the piston 18. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Suitably mounted on the lower end of the pump cylinder 17 is'a frustro-.conical head 29 between 5 "which and the lower end of the cylinder is clamped a screen 30. The head 29 below the screen 30 provides a valve chamber in which operates a. ball check valve 31 that normally engages a seat provided therefor at the inner end of a depending neck integral with the head 29 at its apex., </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">An inlet nipple 32 connects the inlet neck of the head 29 with the upper end ofa conduit pipe section 32. I'he lower end of the pipe section`32 is provided with a nipple 33 that has its free end -15 I threaded into a plug 34 which in turn is threaded into the upper end of a reducer 35. The reducer 35 at its lower end is connected through the medium of an elbow 36 with a pipe section 37 that leads from a suitable outlet provided in thebot- `20 tom` of a storage tank 39 which may be located in the'cellar of aY building and which may contain fuel oil suitable for range oil burners. 'The 'nipple 36 at the end thereof associated with the re- 1 ducer 35vis formed to provide'a seat fora ball check valve and disposed across the upper portion of the reducer 35 is a stop pin 41 which limits the upward movement of the ball 40. This prevents the ball 40 from closing the passage through the plug 34. It will thus be seen that when the pump is in operation the fuel from the tank 39 at each upward stroke of the piston 18 will be drawn from the tank 39 through the pipe sections 37, 32 and associated parts into the bottom of the cylinder while on the down stroke of the piston 18 the oil in the cylinder will be forced therefrom through the medium of means hereinafter more fully referred to into a tank 42. For conducting the lliquid from the pump to the tank 42 there is provided at the bottom of the cylinder 17 and above the screen 30 an outlet 43 that is connected by an elbow 44 with a reducer 45. In the upper end of the reducer 45 there is a plug 46 that is connected by a nipple 47 with one end of piping 48, the other end` of which piping is connected 45 as at 49 with the top of the tank 42 for emptying into said tank 42. The reducer 45 has operating therein a ball check valve 50 adapted to seat on Vthe inner end of the elbow 44, and a cross pin 51 69 adapted to engage the ball 63 to unseat the ball and therebypermit the` contents of theY tank 42, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">are secured on the standard 13 as Ywill be clear from a study of Figure 1. To facilitate transportation of the tank 42 the same is provided with a bail or handle 55. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The bottom of the tank 42 is connected through the medium of a short pipe section 56 with a reservoir 57 that is also supported from the post 13 by suitable means 58. Thereservoir 57 has a removable lid,59 ,w ithwhich is screw ,threadedly engaged the lower end of the pipe section 56. The reservoir 15 inthe bottom thereof is provided with an opening into which is screw threadedone end of a pipe 60 that is connected to the burner or the like for supplying the fuel oil to the burner. In said bottom and about the opening therein, the </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">reservoir 57 is provided With-a recess into'wliiclfiv is snugly fitted a suitable filtering pad 61. 'For controlling the supply of fuel'oilfrom the tank'42 to the reservoir 57 there is suitably provided in Y the bottom ofr the tank 42 a cage 62 in vwhich Operates a ball Va1ve63. r .v </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A64 supported .between opposed Walls vof -the resi Onone end'ofv the arm 65 isa float 66 While the ervoir 57 and having rockable thereon an arm 65. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">other endof the-arm is pivotally connected .with </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">. an ejector stern 67 that is constrained to shift verltically within ,the pipe section 56 'through the rnedium of rasuitable. guide member or bar 68. On its upper. end the stem 67 is provided With a head orafportionthereof topass through the pipe 56 l and into thereservoirr57. Obviously When the liquid 4levelin the reservoir 57 risessumciently to raisemthefioat the arm-65` will be rocked in a clockwise` direction, moving. the stem 67 downwardly and permitting the 4ball 63 to-engagerthe seatf for cutting off thesupply of liquid from the Y:tank 42. `When the liquidrlevel inthe reservoir Y j 57 fallstheiarm 657Will .be rotated inan ,anticlockwise direction thus moving the stem. 67 up- Wardly to engage the head 59 of the stem with the ball 63 for unseating the latter and permitting a flow of fuel from the tank 42 to the reser- Voir. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The operation of the device is thought apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing, but may be briey explained as follows. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Upon upward movement of the piston 18 a suction iscreated inthe line formedby the pipe sections 32, 37, sufficient to drawY fuel from the tank 39, the fuel passing into the head 29. On the downward stroke of the piston 18 pressure on the valves 31, cause these valves to seat and Wthe fuel in the pump will be forced through the pipe connectionbetween the cylinder 17 and the 'tank42 into the tank. The tank 42 of course supplies the fuel to the reservoir 57 and the supply of fuel'from the tank 42 to the reservoir 57 is ofcourse controlled by the liquid level in the reservoir.` From the reservoir 57 the fuel is sup- L plied through the conduit to an oil burner. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> While we' have ydescribed the device as being used forV lifting fuel oil for consumption in range i oil burners, it will be understood thaty the device could also be put tofother uses embodying the lifting of fluid, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Having thus described our invention, what We claim as new, isz'- Y .In a liquid handling apparatus, a frame in cluding a pair of spaced uprights, a vertically arranged cylinder supported by one upright, a piston in the cylinder, a rod connected with thelpiston and passing through the top of the cylinder and having' its upper end bent at right angles toward, the other upright, a horizontally arranged shaft supported froinrthe said other upright, a crank disk connected to the inner end of the shaft, a pitznan for'conneoting the crankI ofthe disk with the bent end of the rod, and-a handle on they outer end of the shaft for rotating` thevsame.
