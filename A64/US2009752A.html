This eccentric and forked arm impart a rocking motion to the yoke 22, and this gives to the loopers their needle avoiding movement. The loopers are oscillated by means of a link 25 which is connected to a bar 25, and the bar 26 is in turn connected to the two looper carriers. .The link 25 is pivoted at 2l to an oscillating member S28 which in turn is connected to a link 29 attached at 35 to the needle lever extension 3i. This oscillating mechanismfor the loopers is of the usual construction. As the needle lever oscillates it not-only reciprocate-s the needle bar but it will also impart through the link 26 oscillations to the two looper carriers. The stud i9 on which the looper carrier l5 is mounted extends through a slot 32 in .the supporting yoke 22. Said stud is provided with an integral collar 33, and a nut 34 on the end ofy the4 stud clamps the stud in its ,set positions on the supporting yoke. The stud 2lA extends through a slot 35. This stud is Vprovided with an integral collar 35 and. with a nute3l for holding ythe stud in set positions on the supporting yoke. VAssiociated with each` looper is a gaging device for aiding in setting of the loopers in predetermined positions for oscillation.` Mounted on the stud I9 between the collar `33 and the supporting yoke is a gaging device 38. This gaging device kis in the form of a disk. It is freely mounted on the stud vso `that it may be turned when the nut 34 is released. The disk, as Vshown in the drawings, is provided with threegaging recesses 39, 4B and 4I. These gaging recesses as shown are segmental in shape, and are` adapted to contact with a gaglng-post 42. This vgaging post, as Ashown in the drawings, is in the lform -of a large-headed screw, which is threaded into the yoke vsupport 22. 'Ihe lscrew has a relatively large cylindrical head. The'recesses are shaped lto t the gaging post 42. These recesses are formedso that they are spaced radially from the center of the stud I9 at different distances. In Fig. 6 of the drawings -the disk is shown in full lines positioned Vso that therecess 3S makes contact with the peripheral surface of the head of the g-aging screw or post 42. When so positioned then the nut 34 is turned down-so as to clamp'the looper in `this set position. By loosening the nut and turning the disk any one of the vrecessesmay bebrought into contact with the gaging post and thus it `Vis that this looper supporting stud Hirnay be rshifted to three different predetermined set positions. Through the aid'of this gaging -disk'the looper can be shifted Ifroinone setting to'afnother yand `always brought back to vthe samewset position. Cooperatingrwith the stud 21! is a similargaging disk 43 which is provided with a recess 44 corresponding to the recess 139 as to Aits distance from vthe center of the supportingstud'l; also areccss '45 corresponding ,to therecess Y4l) and'rarecess d6 corresponding to "theggaging recessfl, These recesses 44, 45- and 4G arefadapted to be brought linto Contact with the same rgag'ing swe'w orjp'ost 42.

This head is adjustably mounted on the bar 26 so that it may be shifted in a direction lengthwise of the bar. To this end the bar is provided with a slot 5I. A clamping bolt 5E passes through the slot, and is threaded into the head which cooperates with the ball stud 43. The outer :face of the bar 25 Visprovided with three vertical grooves or recesses 53, 5 4 and 55.

The bar 2B is slotted as indicated at 6i, and this bolt '6B passes through this slot. This enables the head Atolhe shifted endwise of the bar. A similar setting means may be provided for this head ifdesi'red.J Each head 5B and 59 has a rib and grooveV Yconnection withv the bar which prevents these heads ffromturning on their support b'olts. Means has beenl provided for positively shifting the head 5B. .'This'means includes a link 52 which has an opening therethrough to receive the bolt 5D. The 'other end of the link has an opening therethrough which receives an eccentric end portion 63 of a knurled collar 64. A screw 65 holds this knurled collar in .set position. By loosening the Vscrew `F55 the .knurled collar may be turned, .and .this .through the operation of the eccentric portion 53 will nove the link 62 endwise. The bolt 6B is-of'course rst released so that it can be shifted and then the turning of the'knurled collar will positively shift the bolt and the head 58 with which it .is connected in one direction-or the other andretain it -in its set position. </div>

In .thesetting up of 'the machine there are sometimes inaccuracies vin the dimensions of .the loopers .and-the .shifting means including the knurled .collar A64,.described above,enables a setting of the loopers to be .made so that both looper points will V.be vproperly .positioned for the needles ,of ra .predeterminedgage When it is desired to change thetirning yor' the loopers this is accomplished by turning the link 25.
