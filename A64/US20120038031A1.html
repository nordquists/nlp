<li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Liquids, slurries and pastes and other of materials that contain liquid are deposited into grooves or along other physical work piece paths upon a surface of a work piece, such as a silicon wafer that will be used to form a solar collecting cell. Liquid can be dispensed into grooves in which will be formed thin metallization finger elements, under pressure through a fine dispensing capillary tube, which is mechanically guided and aligned by following topography/surface texture on the work piece surface. The dispensing capillary tube mechanically tracks in the groove. The dispensing capillary may be small enough that it rests at the groove bottom, with the groove sidewalls providing tracking restraint. Or, the dispensing capillary may be larger than the groove and may ride on the top edges of the groove, still achieving mechanical alignment. A tracking feature, such as a protrusion, may be provided at the dispensing end to engage the groove. Non-circular cross-sections and other tracking features, such as elliptical, molded-on protrusions and lobes can enhance tracking in a groove. The dispensing capillary tube is typically flexible. The flexibility accommodates tracking errors in both the plane of the work piece, generally perpendicular to the elongated dimension of the work piece path and perpendicular to that plane, which errors are due to differences between the physical work piece path on the work piece, and the unconstrained path that the dispensing end of the tube would follow, were it allowed to travel along a perfectly flat, frictionless work piece. The errors are due to errors in machining the physical work piece path, errors in directing a relative motion device to follow a mathematical representation of the work piece path, errors in manufacturing the dispensing tube and other apparatus, such that the model of its trajectory is inaccurate, etc. Rather than using a flexible tube, a tube that is supported by a pivot that pivots in both the directions of perpendicular to the plane of the work piece and within the plane of the work piece. The dispensing capillary is typically further held to the groove by the capillary action of the dispensed liquid itself. The dispensing capillary may be forced against the groove, such as by spring or magnetic loading. Alignment guides, such as lead-in features may guide the dispensing capillary into the groove. Restoring features along the length of the work piece path may help restore a wayward dispensing tube back to the groove. A multiplicity of dispensing capillaries may be used, each dispensing in a separate groove for an individual finger. A number of wafers can be treated in a line. Time spent accelerating and decelerating at the beginning and end of travel is reduced. A plurality of wafers may be disposed on faces of a drum with flats and, with the drum rotating continuously. The dispensing capillary tube can be traversed parallel to the drum axis while moving in and out to provide rise and fall as an individual wafer is traversed.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0044]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0045" num="0044">Inventions disclosed herein relate to applying liquids, slurries and pastes and other similar forms of material that bears a liquid, into grooves (or similar structures) upon a surface of a work piece. The inventions are especially relevant to forming thin metallization elements on photovoltaic absorbers, generally referred to as fingers as generally described in the above referenced PCT application, PCT/US2008/002058. This applying liquids, slurries pastes, etc., is referred to generally as treating herein, as well as in the above referenced PCT application. According to inventions disclosed herein, liquid is dispensed and metered in a potentially precisely controlled fashion, under pressure through a fine dispensing capillary tube, which is mechanically guided and aligned by following topography/surface texture on the surface of the work piece. In one embodiment, the work piece is a silicon wafer that has grooves in it for metallization.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0045]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0046" num="0045">The above referenced PCT application discusses treating a work piece, by which it is meant applying a liquid that is typically associated with an active, typically reactive treating step, which the user desires should take place at certain zones of the work piece, such as plating or etching. The work piece is textured such that the liquid can be applied in a portion of a zone comprised of a network of liquid accessible pathways. The application of liquid is guided at least in part by the texture. The liquid remains excluded from flowing into zones that the designer intends the treating step to not take place. The exclusion arises due, at least in part, to the surface texture. An example of such a treating is described in the PCT application for providing electrodes to the PV cell surface. The techniques disclosed herein are predominantly for such treating applications.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0046]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0047" num="0046">Inventions disclosed herein may be used for dispensing materials that are active, typically reactive, for a treating step, and also for materials that could be used for blocking a subsequent active, reactive step. Thus, they are referred to generally as dispensing techniques.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0047]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0048" num="0047">The dispensed material may be a silver ink of the same general composition as those used in the manufacture of silicon solar cells and typically applied by screen printing. A particularly advantageous method is to dispense only a small quantity of such ink so as to result in only a thin layer of metal after firing of the work piece. While this thin seed layer is itself not sufficient to carry the current generated by the solar cell, it may then be built up by plating, for example of silver. The plated metal tends to be confined to the groove and builds up vertically, but does not spread much horizontally. The silver ink used for the seed layer may be more dilute in solids loading than a conventional silver paste as only a seed layer is needed.</div>

Whether clogging is a problem primarily depends on the nature of the material being treated. If the material that contains liquid also has particles—such as a silver particle ink, then a small diameter capillary may present a challenge.

For this reason, as the maximum anticipated error increases, the length of the tube should be increased proportionally. The proportionality between deflection and length for a given maximum angle of tube end with respect to the groove applies to the case of a tube or other structural member along which it rides that is flexed as a cantilever.

The side-walls of the grooves in the work piece can vary over a wide range from very shallow to very steep (perpendicular to the plane of the work piece). The maximum restoring force that can be exerted by the groove on the capillary before the capillary disengages from the groove will be approximately proportional to any downward force of the tube against the work piece as determined by a preload of the tube. The relative shape of the groove and capillary will change the constant of proportionally between a preload force and maximum restoring force. A useful estimate can be made by assuming the walls of the groove are at 45 degrees to the work piece and that there is no friction between the groove and tube. In this case, the maximum restoring force is approximately equal to any preload force. Note that this is only true for a tube with the same stiffness in vertical and horizontal directions.</div>

For example, a suitable dispensing capillary tube may be made of polyimide tubing with an ID of 65 microns and an OD of 90 microns and a cantilevered length of 5 mm, which is adhered to the ID of a piece of stainless steel tube. The steel tube is secured in and supported by a support assembly. This dispensing capillary tube is disposed downward at an angle to the horizontal of typically 30 degrees. The spring pre-load is applied by lowering the dispensing capillary tube until it touches the work piece and then lowering the dispensing capillary tube support assembly another 1 mm, thus flexing the extended dispensing capillary tube. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, (among others), shows schematically a flexed capillary dispensing tube <b>1460</b>.

It is also possible to use dispensing capillaries made of glass such as borosilicate. A polymeric dispensing tube has a high damping, which compares favorably with the damping of glass. Another suitable candidate is a quartz capillary tube, having an ID of 50 microns, and an OD of 80 microns. Metals may also be used, such as stainless steel. If needed, damping could be added to such structures by coating with a thin layer of a polymer. For capillaries of higher modulus materials such as glass or metal, the tube will have to be longer than would a polymeric tube in order to accommodate the same degree of error E. Capillary tubes may also be drawn down so that they have a larger diameter section which gradually reduced to a smaller diameter. Borosilicate glass, for example, can be drawn down in such a manner by methods known in the art. It is advantageous to have the dispensed material flow through a filter immediately before entering the capillary dispensing tube to avoid clogging of the tube. The filter should retain any particles that are larger than only a fraction of the internal diameter of the tube. For example, when using a tube with 100 micron ID, the filter should retain particles that are larger than 10 microns.</div>

Hence, the maximum misalignment of the tube end from the groove will be approximately equal to the preload distance of the tube against the work piece, by which it is meant the difference in the spacing between the work piece and the dispensing end of the tube in a pre-loaded state, as compared to a relaxed, zero preload case.</div>

If the liquid is too non-wetting, the liquid will break up into beads after it is dispensed into the groove. There is, however, a wide range of wetting angles that will result in successful operation. The rheology of the fluid will also play a role in the process. It may be desirable to have a fluid which is shear thinning so that the fluid may be pushed through the dispensing capillary tube, but once it is in the groove, the viscosity will increase and the fluid will stay where it is dispensed. It may also be desirable to have a fluid with a yield stress—a stress below which it does not move at all. This will further guarantee that the fluid stays within the groove. However, some flow within the groove may be desirable so that the liquid flows out to fill the groove including touching the sidewalls of the groove. The motion of the fluid in the groove can also be arrested by evaporation of the liquid vehicle. The wafer may be held at elevated temperature during the dispensing operation in order to further promote this evaporation.

For example, if the work piece is maintained under a blanket of carbon dioxide, a water based material that is dispensed will rapidly drop in pH—an effect that can be used to effect flocculation, gellation or cross-linking. A dilatant or shear-thickening fluid may be advantageous because the fluid column dispensed by the tube would be less likely to pinch off and form droplets.

If this dispensing capillary tube traverses at 10 cm/s, the required flow rate is 0.002 cc/min. The flow may be regulated by the application of pressure to the liquid with the flow controlled by the viscous pressure drop of the liquid in the dispensing capillary tube.

A particularly attractive method is to independently control the temperature of each capillary tube and thereby change the rheology of the liquid and the flow rate. This is particularly effective for paste like materials where the viscosity typically decreases sharply with increases in temperature. Thus, if the flow from a particular tube is found to be low, the temperature of the tube can be increased. The temperature can be changed by the action of a small heater surrounding the tube or by shining light on the tube. A conductive coating deposited on the tube can be coupled to by a radio frequency coil to provide heating. Alternatively a thin conductive film on the tube can be used as a resistive heater. Such conductive films can be deposited directly on polymeric and glass tube materials. An insulating layer must be provided on metal tubes. The flow rate may be determined in situ by thermal means as well, for instance by measuring the time of flight between a localized heat source at one region of the dispensing tube and a subsequent temperature measuring device downstream of the tube, or by measuring the temperature rise in the fluid resulting from a known thermal power input.

The material that is removed would then be absorbed by the masking material. Paper or a nonwoven polymer fabric with sufficient absorbency would work, for example. This approach has the advantage that the tip is cleaned before each pass of the dispensing tube over the work piece. Alternatively, the cleaning strip or pad may be an additional piece of material and not integrated into the masking strip.</div>

It may be dipped explicitly into the liquid bath <b>1386</b>, for instance by vertical motion of the relative motion device <b>241</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) Or, the designer may take advantage of the flexibility of the dispensing tube <b>1360</b>, and may arrange the travel path such that when the capillary dispensing tube is at the liquid reservoir, the tip is submerged in the liquid <b>1386</b>. As the capillary dispensing tube approaches the outer edge <b>1388</b> of the reservoir, the tube deflects, and then when it reaches the liquid <b>1386</b>, it snaps into the liquid and is cleaned by action of the ultrasonic generator <b>1390</b>. The tube continues forward along the dotted line, and encounters the inner edge <b>1392</b> of the reservoir, flexes, and eventually emerges from the liquid and is drawn along toward the work piece. Such ultrasonic cleaning station may be located along one or both edges of the work piece. The immersion time may be short, even less than one second such that the motion is not interrupted.</div>

The amount of fluid dispensed per unit length of groove can be varied with precise control by changing either the speed of the dispensing tip relative to the wafer, or by modulating the dispensing pressure. A means to vary metallization finger cross-section is desirable, because the current carried by the metallization finger is higher closer to the bus wire <b>1444</b> (current collection point <b>1445</b>). To optimize the tradeoff between reduced resistive power losses and cell area shading, due to a wider metallization finger <b>1446</b>, a metallization finger geometry that has greater cross-section nearer to the bus wire offers advantages.
