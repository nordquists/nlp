</li> <heading id="h-0002">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure is directed generally to systems and methods for decreasing compaction within a pyrolyzed zone of a subterranean formation, and more particularly to systems and methods that fluidly seal the pyrolyzed zone with a sealing fluid and subsequently pressurize the pyrolyzed zone to decrease compaction within the pyrolyzed zone.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Certain subterranean formations may include organic compounds, such as shale oil and/or kerogen, that may not flow within the reservoir at a rate that is sufficient for production thereof, that may not define desired material properties, and/or that may not define desired chemical compositions. Thus, these organic compounds may be heated in situ to generate more desired hydrocarbon fluids that may more readily be produced from the subterranean formation. This heating process also may be referred to herein as in situ pyrolysis and/or simply as pyrolysis. The heating decomposes the organic compounds and also may decompose and/or vaporize evaporite minerals that may be present within the subterranean formation. This decomposition and/or subsequent production of the hydrocarbon fluid from the subterranean formation reduces a volume of the materials that comprise (and/or are present in) the subterranean formation. As an illustrative, non-exclusive example, complete pyrolysis of oil shale that includes 35 gallons of shale oil per ton of oil shale and subsequent producing of the shale oil from the subterranean formation may decrease the volume of oil shale by 22%.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">This volume decrease may permit and/or produce settling within the subterranean formation. This settling may decrease a porosity of the subterranean formation, thereby decreasing a production rate of the hydrocarbon fluids from the subterranean formation. Additionally or alternatively, this settling also may propagate to a surface region that is associated with the subterranean formation, thereby producing subsidence of the surface region and/or changes in surface topography.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">Historically, this compaction and/or subsidence have been mitigated by leaving regions of the subterranean formation unpyrolyzed. These unpyrolyzed regions also may be referred to herein as cold pillars and may support the overlying strata and decrease compaction within the pyrolyzed zone. However, these cold pillars decrease overall hydrocarbon recovery from the subterranean formation and/or may not be effective in all subterranean formations. Thus, there exists a need for improved systems and methods for decreasing compaction within a pyrolyzed zone.</div>

Multiple entities listed with “and/or” should be construed in the same manner, i.e., “one or more” of the entities so conjoined. Other entities may optionally be present other than the entities specifically identified by the “and/or” clause, whether related or unrelated to those entities specifically identified. Thus, as a non-limiting example, a reference to “A and/or B,” when used in conjunction with open-ended language such as “comprising” may refer to A only (optionally including entities other than B); to B only (optionally including entities other than A); to both A and B (optionally including other entities).

This definition also allows that entities may optionally be present other than the entities specifically identified within the list of entities to which the phrase “at least one” refers, whether related or unrelated to those entities specifically identified. Thus, as a non-limiting example, “at least one of A and B” (or, equivalently, “at least one of A or B,” or, equivalently “at least one of A and/or B”) may refer, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, with no B present (and optionally including entities other than B); to at least one, optionally including more than one, B, with no A present (and optionally including entities other than A); to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, and at least one, optionally including more than one, B (and optionally including other entities). In other words, the phrases “at least one,” “one or more,” and “and/or” are open-ended expressions that are both conjunctive and disjunctive in operation. For example, each of the expressions “at least one of A, B and C,” “at least one of A, B, or C,” “one or more of A, B, and C,” “one or more of A, B, or C” and “A, B, and/or C” may mean A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, A, B and C together, and optionally any of the above in combination with at least one other entity.</div>
