<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">T cell responses against tumors are often directed against self-MHC molecules presenting peptides derived from over-expressed self-proteins. In general, T cells with high avidity for self-peptide/self-MHC ligands are eliminated by negative selection to prevent autoimmunity. The TCR affinity of remaining T cells specific for self-ligands is normally low, however high-avidity T cells are needed to effectively eradicate tumors. Because negative selection is limited to self-MHC molecules, T cells that recognize allogeneic MHC molecules have not undergone negative selection. Thus, if peptides are presented by allogeneic MHC molecules, it is feasible to obtain high-avidity T cells specific for common tumor-associated ligands derived from over-expressed self-proteins. T cells that recognize allogeneic MHC molecules irrespective of a specific peptide can be distinguished in vitro from allo-restricted peptide-specific T cells at the clonal level and excluded.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Significant tumor regression can occur following adoptive transfer of T cells with anti-tumor specificity. However, patient-derived T cells may have sub-optimal activity. Furthermore, T cells with appropriate specificity and function for effective tumor eradication are often not available for patients with rapidly progressing tumors. Therefore, there is current interest in using pre-characterized TCR genes to create designer lymphocytes for adoptive cell therapies. Expression of TCR-transgenes in activated lymphocytes can imbue recipient lymphocytes with anti-tumor activities comparable to the original T cells (Morris et al. Blood Rev (2006) 20, 61-69; Schumacher et al., Nat. Rev. Immunol. (2002) 2, 512-519). Moreover, some transgenic TCR can displace endogenous TCR sequences, yielding lymphocytes that express monoclonal TCR.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">The first clinical trials using adoptive transfer of TCR-transgenic T cells in melanoma patients achieved clinical disease-free status in 2 of 17 patients with rapidly progressing disease (Morgan et al. Science (2006) 314, 126-129). Higher rates of clinical efficacy were obtained in patients receiving TCR transgenic lymphocytes transduced with a TCR of higher affinity but some undesired responses were noted against normal tissues. These results demonstrated the therapeutic potential of this approach however they also revealed the need to evaluate a variety of TCR sequences that recognize the same ligand but have different affinities in order to identify the most suitable TCR sequences for clinical development that can be used to achieve optimal elimination of tumor cells while showing the lowest undesired activity directed against normal, non-malignant tissues.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">A number of T cell clones with specificity for various tumor-associated antigens have been reported over the years. Most of these TCR are restricted by self-MHC molecules. Further, available TCR are often of low-avidity. Multiple TCR with good capacity to recognize tumor cells via different tumor-associated antigens (TAA) are often lacking.</div>

Visseren et al. (Int. J. Cancer (1997) 72, 1122-1128) describe the affinity and specificity of several tyrosinase-specific TCR and suggest to use these TCR as a specific treatment of melanoma patients. Roszkowski et al. (J. Immunol. (2003) 170, 2582-2589 and Cancer Res. (2005) 65, 1570-1576) are likewise characterising tyrosinase-specific TCR.</div>

It is a further object of the present invention to provide TCR or functional parts thereof, such as CDR3 regions, which show high affinity against the survivin antigen. It is a still further object of the invention to provide pharmaceutical compositions for use in adoptive cell therapy which allow an effective treatment of diseases involving malignant cells expressing survivin.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0019]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0020" num="0019">It is a great advantage to administer mixtures of TCR-transgenic specific T cells to patients to target their tumors via several different MHC-peptide ligands in order to avoid immune selection of tumor cells that lack TAA expression if they are attacked by T cells with only a single specificity.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0020]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0021" num="0020">The inventors generated high-avidity, allo-restricted peptide-specific T cells that provide suitable sources of TCR sequences for selection of TCR that can be developed for clinical application. Furthermore, the inventors have generated a series of T cell clones and demonstrated their high-avidity and tumor-specificity for three distinct melanoma-associated antigens. In addition, one of the antigens for which they have generated a repertoire of TCR sequences, namely survivin, is broadly expressed in a variety of tumors and therefore, these sequences can also be used for treatment of tumors other than melanoma.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0021]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0022" num="0021">The use of repertoires of TCR with different specificities does not only provide a broader basis of an attack of tumor cells, helping to avoid immune selection of TAA loss variants, but will also allow patients to be treated if their tumors naturally fail to express any one of the individual TAA that are targeted by the TCR. Thereby, future adoptive T cell therapies can be realized for more patients by employing these TCR sequences to develop “off the shelf” reagents for transduction of patient-derived lymphocytes.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0022]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0023" num="0022">The combination of TCR used in the present invention, i.e. TCR directed against the survivin, tyrosinase and optionally melan A antigen, is particularly effective in vivo in minimizing immune selection of tumor cells and in defeating malignancies. In other words, also in case of immune selection, there is still a high probability that the tumor to be attacked still expresses at least one of the named TAA and thus can be effectively recognized and defeated. This is in contrast to prior art approaches, where tumor cells are attacked by T cells recognizing only one single TAA specificity, potentially leading to a reduced or even absent success of therapy due to outgrowth of tumor cells lacking expression of the specific TAA.</div>
