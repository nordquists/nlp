<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">Provided herein are methods of treating diseases associated with anemia or ineffective erythropoiesis by using the level and/or activity of a ligand of an activin type II receptor, in particular, Growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11), as an indicator of responsiveness of a patient to the treatment, efficacy of the treatment, or appropriate dosage for the treatment with an activin type II receptor inhibitor. For example, provided herein are methods for determining the level and/or activity of GDF11, selecting patients having elevated level and/or activity of GDF11, and treating patients having elevated level and/or activity of GDF11 with an activin type II receptor inhibitor. Further provided herein are methods comprising determining the level and/or activity of GDF11 in a patient treated with an activin type II receptor inhibitor, and administering the activin type II receptor inhibitor in a dose amount depending on the level and/or activity of GDF11 in the patient. Such activin type II receptor inhibitor can be an inhibitor of ActRIIA and/or ActRIIB signaling (e.g., a humanized fusion-protein consisting of the extracellular domain of activin-receptor type IIA and the human IgG1 Fc domain).</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Anemia is a decrease in number of red blood cells or less than the normal quantity of hemoglobin in the blood. Anemia can also be caused by decreased oxygen-binding ability of the hemoglobin. Anemia is the most common disorder of the blood.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Anemia can be caused by ineffective erythropoiesis. Ineffective erythropoiesis is present if active erythropoiesis takes place but mature red blood cells fail to develop at the proper rate. Progenitor cells undergo apoptosis before the stage of mature red blood cells is reached.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">Thalassemia is a form of ineffective erythropoiesis. In thalassemia, ineffective erythropoiesis is characterized by apoptosis of the maturing nucleated erythroid cells. Specifically beta-thalassemia is a disease characterized by defects in Hemoglobin (or Hgb) synthesis leading to impaired erythrocyte maturation and production. The decrease is primarily thought to be due to abnormally accelerated erythroid differentiation and apoptosis at the late basophilic/polychromatic erythroblast stage of red blood cell differentiation, resulting in an overall decrease in mature red blood cell production. beta-thalassemia is characterized by a hypercellular bone marrow compartment where abnormal erythroblasts accumulate and undergo apoptosis, resulting in systemic anemia.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">The transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) family, which include TGF-beta, activins, bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) and growth and differentiation factors (GDFs) are secreted proteins known to regulate numerous cellular processes during both development and tissue homeostasis. TGF-beta1, activin A, BMP-2 and BMP-4 have all been associated with the regulation of erythropoiesis in various model systems. TGF-beta1 both inhibits and promotes erythroid differentiation depending on the context, activin A was shown to be a pro-erythroid differentiation agent, while BMP-4 has been implicated in stress erythropoiesis and recovery from acute anemia in murine models. BMP-2 acts on early erythroid cells to increase colony formation in samples obtained from mobilized peripheral blood or bone marrow CD34+ cells. Abnormally high levels of some of these growth factors have been associated with various hematologic diseases. For example, high levels of GDF-15 are not usually a feature of normal erythropoiesis but in conditions of ineffective erythropoiesis, GDF-15 expression is elevated.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">The TGF-beta superfamily consists of more than 30 proteins and they signal through only a limited number of receptors and signaling pathways, pointing to inherent promiscuity and redundancy in their actions. Furthermore, in any given tissue, several different ligands may be found and signaling presumably occurs via an overlapping subset of receptors complicating the ability to associate particular ligands to their function. GDF11 is a member of the GDF subfamily and shares about 90% amino acid homology with GDF8, also known as myostatin. Both can bind the activin type IIA and B receptors and activate the Smad 2/3 signaling pathway. GDF11 plays a big role in development, taking part in the formation of muscle, cartilage, bone, kidney, and nervous system while in adult tissues, GDF11 was detected in the pancreas, intestine, kidney, skeletal muscle, brain and dental pulp. Low amounts of GDF-11 can be also found in the circulation. To this date, however, there is no evidence describing a role for GDF-11 in erythropoiesis.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">Type II receptors for activins can also bind GDF11. Two related type II receptors, ActRIIa and ActRIIb, have been identified (Mathews and Vale, 1991, Cell 65:973-982; Attisano et al., 1992, Cell 68: 97-108). Besides GDF11, ActRIIa and ActRIIb can biochemically interact with several other TGF-beta family proteins, including BMP7, Nodal, GDF8, and activin (Yamashita et al., 1995, J. Cell Biol. 130:217-226; Lee and McPherron, 2001, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 98:9306-9311; Yeo and Whitman, 2001, Mol. Cell 7: 949-957; Oh et al., 2002, Genes Dev. 16:2749-54). ALK4 is the primary type I receptor for activins, particularly for activin A, and ALK-7 may serve as a receptor for activins as well, particularly for activin B.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">A humanized fusion-protein consisting of the extracellular domain of activin-receptor type IIA (ActRIIA) and the human IgG1 Fc (ActRIIA-hFc) is currently being evaluated in phase II clinical trials for treatment of patients with anemia and bone disorders associated with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) as well as for those patients with□ beta-thalassemia. In healthy post-menopausal women, ActRIIA-hFc was shown to significantly increase hematocrit (Hct) and hemoglobin (Hgb) as well as bone mineral density. However, the identity of ActRIIA ligands sequestered by ActRIIA-hFc in the bloodstream remains unknown.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0034]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0035" num="0034">Provided herein are methods of treating anemia, or diseases or conditions associated with anemia or ineffective erythropoiesis, by using the level and/or activity of GDF11 as an indicator of responsiveness of a patient to the treatment with an activin type II receptor inhibitor, efficacy of the treatment with an activin type II receptor inhibitor, or appropriate dosage for the treatment with an activin type II receptor inhibitor. The diseases associated with anemia or ineffective erythropoiesis that can be treated in accordance with the methods described herein include, without limitation, thalassemia (e.g., beta thalassemia), myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic pernicious anemia, sickle cell anemia, and Diamond Blackfan anemia. The conditions associated with anemia or ineffective erythropoiesis that can be treated in accordance with the methods described herein include, without limitation, decreased red blood cell levels, decreased hemoglobin levels, decreased hematocrit levels, and decreased orthochromatic erythroblasts (Ery-C). In one embodiment, provided herein are methods for treating anemia. In one embodiment, provided herein are methods for treating thalassemia (e.g., beta thalassemia). In one embodiment, provided herein are methods for treating decreased red blood cell levels or methods for increasing red blood cell levels. An activin type II receptor inhibitor used in the methods described herein can be an inhibitor of ActRIIA and/or ActRIIB, such as any of the inhibitors described herein or known in the art. In a preferred embodiment, an activin type II receptor inhibitor is a humanized fusion-protein consisting of the extracellular domain of ActRIIA and the human IgG1 Fc domain (“ActRIIA-Fc,” e.g., SEQ ID NO:7).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0035]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0036" num="0035">The methods provided herein are based, in part, on the discovery that the levels of GDF11 are increased in the blood of human patients with beta-thalassemia and in a mouse model of beta-thalassemia, and that ActRIIA-mFc (ActRIIA fused to a murine IgG) reduces increased levels of GDF11 in the mouse model of beta-thalassemia (see Examples). Further, without being limited by theory, ligand trapping by ActRIIA-mFc corrects ineffective erythropoiesis and improves anemia in an experimental mouse model of thalassemia intermedia (Hbb<sup>th1/th1 </sup>mice). As shown in the Examples presented herein, treating of thalassemic mice (Hbb<sup>th1/th1</sup>) with ActRIIA-mFc increased red blood cell counts, hematocrit, hemoglobin, mean cell volume (MCV) and mean cell hemoglobin, increased orthochromatic erythroblasts (Ery-C), reduced bone marrow and spleen cellularity, reduced late basophilic/polychromatic erythroblasts (Ery-B), in the spleen and bone marrow, reduced the levels of bilirubin levels (indicative of a decrease in red blood cell destruction), and reduced apoptotic cells. Furthermore, the methods provided herein are based, in part, on the discovery that in an in vitro culture system GDF-11 inhibits growth of human bone marrow-derived erythroid precursors and ActRIIA-mFc rescues this inhibitory effect (see Examples). Taken together, the data presented herein indicate that GDF-11 levels, e.g., blood and/or serum levels of GDF11, can identify which patients may respond to ActRIIA-Fc and can be used to monitor clinical response to the drug. The data presented herein also indicate that ActRIIA-Fc (e.g., ActRIIA-mFc, or ActRIIA-hFc such as SEQ ID NO:7) is useful in treating anemia associated with ineffective erythropoiesis.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0036]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0037" num="0036">The findings described herein, illustrated in the Examples, indicate that detection of the levels and/or activity of GDF11 can be used (i) as a marker (e.g., serum biomarker) of the extent of ineffective erythropoiesis in a patient, (ii) as a marker to measure the patient's response to an activin type II receptor inhibitor (such as ActRIIA-Fc), or (iii) to evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of an activin type II receptor inhibitor (such as ActRIIA-Fc) in a patient following treatment, wherein the patient is a patient with anemia or a disease associated with anemia or ineffective erythropoiesis (such as thalassemia, e.g., beta-thalassemia). Thus, in certain embodiments, GDF11 can be used in the methods described herein as an indicator of efficacy of ActRIIA-Fc (e.g., ActRIIA-hFc such as SEQ ID NO:7) treatment and/or as an indicator of absence of response to the treatment with ActRIIA-Fc (e.g., ActRIIA-hFc such as SEQ ID NO:7). In addition, as described herein, GDF11 can be used as a reliable molecular marker to evaluate time-course treatment efficacy of ActRIIA-Fc (e.g., ActRIIA-hFc such as SEQ ID NO:7). Further, in a specific embodiment, provided herein is a method which comprises detection of the level and/or activity of GDF11 in the blood (e.g., detecting abnormal expression in a disease associated with ineffective erythropoiesis), and administration of an activin type II receptor inhibitor, such as ActRIIA-Fc, in a dose dependent on the level and/or activity of GDF11.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0037]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0038" num="0037">In one aspect, the methods provided herein comprise determining the level and/or activity of GDF11 in a tissue sample of a subject (e.g., serum or blood), selecting subjects having elevated level and/or activity of GDF11 over the normal level and/or activity of GDF11, and treating subjects having elevated level and/or activity of GDF11 with an activin type II receptor inhibitor. Elevated levels and/or activity of GDF11 in a tissue sample of a subject (e.g., serum or blood) can indicate that the patient may be responsive to the treatment with an activin type II receptor inhibitor. In one embodiment of the methods described herein, the activin type II receptor inhibitor is ActRIIA-Fc such as ActRIIA-hFc (e.g., SEQ ID NO:7).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0038]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0039" num="0038">GDF11 level and/or activity may be further used to evaluate appropriate dosing for a subject who is a candidate to be treated with an activin type II receptor inhibitor, to evaluate whether to adjust the dosage of the activin type II receptor inhibitor during treatment, and/or to evaluate an appropriate maintenance dose of the activin type II receptor inhibitor. If the GDF11 level and/or activity is outside the normal level and/or activity, dosing with an activin type II receptor inhibitor may be initiated, increased, reduced, delayed or terminated depending on the level and/or activity of GDF11. For example, if the GDF11 level and/or activity is elevated over the normal level and/or activity, dosing with an activin type II receptor inhibitor may be initiated or increased, and if the GDF11 level and/or activity is decreased over the normal level and/or activity, dosing with an activin type II receptor inhibitor may be reduced, delayed or terminated.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0039]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0040" num="0039">In one aspect, the methods described herein comprise administering to a subject an activin type II receptor inhibitor, and monitoring the level and/or activity of GDF11 in the subject. A decrease in the level and/or activity of GDF11 after administration of an activin type II receptor inhibitor (relative to the level and/or activity before administration of the activin type II inhibitor) can indicate that the subject is responsive to the treatment with the activin type II receptor inhibitor and/or that the treatment with the activin type II receptor inhibitor is efficacious. No change or increase in the level and/or activity of GDF11 after administration of an activin type II receptor inhibitor (relative to the level and/or activity before administration of the activin type II inhibitor) can indicate that the subject is not responsive to the treatment with an activin type II receptor inhibitor or that the subject requires a higher dose of the activin type II receptor inhibitor for efficacy.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0040]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0041" num="0040">In other aspects, the degree of change in the level and/or activity of GDF11 after administration of an activin type II receptor inhibitor (relative to the level and/or activity before administration of the activin type II inhibitor or relative to the normal levels and/or activity of GDF11) can indicate the appropriate dosage or dosing regimen of activin type II receptor inhibitor. For example, no decrease or a small decrease in the level and/or activity of GDF11 (e.g., less than 5%, less than 10%, less than 15%, less than 20%, or less than 25%, or less than 30% decrease) after administration of a dose of an activin type II receptor inhibitor (relative to the level and/or activity before administration of the activin type II inhibitor) can indicate that a higher dose of the activin type II receptor inhibitor is required or desirable for efficacy. Accordingly, in some embodiments, when assessment of the level and/or activity of GDF11 shows no decrease or an undesirably small decrease in the level and/or activity of GDF11 (e.g., less than 5%, less than 10%, less than 15%, less than 20%, or less than 25%, or less than 30% decrease) after administration of a dose of an activin type II receptor inhibitor to the patient, the patient is administered a higher dose of an activin type II receptor inhibitor (e.g., 20%, 25%, 30%, 50%, 75%, 100%, 200%, 300%, 400%, 500%, 600%, 700%, 800%, 900%, or 1000% higher dose).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0041]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0042" num="0041">In other embodiments, a decrease in the level and/or activity of GDF11 (for example, slight or average decrease, such as less than 10%, less than 15%, less than 20%, or less than 25%, less than 30%, less than 50%, or less than 75% decrease, or from 10% to 75% decrease, or from 25% to 50% decrease) after administration of a dose of an activin type II receptor inhibitor (relative to the level and/or activity before administration of the activin type II inhibitor) can indicate that the treatment with the activin type II receptor inhibitor is efficacious at the given dose and/or dosing regimen. Accordingly, in some embodiments, when assessment of the level and/or activity of GDF11 shows a decrease in the level and/or activity of GDF11 (for example, slight or average decrease, such as less than 10%, less than 15%, less than 20%, or less than 25%, less than 30%, less than 50%, or less than 75% decrease, or from 10% to 75% decrease, or from 25% to 50% decrease) after administration of a dose of an activin type II receptor inhibitor to the patient, the patient is administered the same dose of an activin type II receptor inhibitor. In a particular embodiment, when assessment of the level and/or activity of GDF11 shows an average or desirable decrease in the level and/or activity of GDF11 (for example, between 20% and 75%, between 25% and 75%, or between 30% and 60% decrease) after administration of a dose of an activin type II receptor inhibitor to the patient, the patient is administered the same dose of an activin type II receptor inhibitor. A large (or undesirably large) decrease in the level and/or activity of GDF11 (e.g., more than 50%, more than 60%, more than 70%, more than 75%, more than 80%, more than 90%, more than 95% decrease) after administration of a dose of an activin type II receptor inhibitor (relative to the level and/or activity before administration of the activin type II inhibitor) can indicate that a lower dose of the activin type II receptor inhibitor is desirable (e.g., to avoid the side effects of the treatment, such as hypertension). Accordingly, in some embodiments, when assessment of the level and/or activity of GDF11 shows a large (or undesirably large) decrease in the level and/or activity of GDF11 (e.g., more than 50%, more than 60%, more than 70%, more than 75%, more than 80%, more than 90%, more than 95% decrease) after administration of a dose of an activin type II receptor inhibitor to the patient, the patient is administered a lower dose of an activin type II receptor inhibitor (e.g., 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 75%, 80%, 90%, or 95% lower dose).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0042]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0043" num="0042">The monitoring of the level and/or activity of GDF11 can be performed by assessing the level and/or activity of GDF11 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, 6 weeks, 7 weeks, 8 weeks, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, 6 months, or 1 year after administration of an activin type II receptor inhibitor to the patient. The level and/or activity of GDF11 after administration of an activin type II receptor inhibitor to a patient, can also be used as an indicator of the appropriate or desirable frequency of administration of an activin type II receptor inhibitor to the patient. For example, if a decrease in the level and/or activity of GDF11 after administration of an activin receptor type II inhibitor is maintained over a time period (e.g., 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, 6 weeks, 7 weeks, 8 weeks, 10 weeks, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, 6 months, or 1 year), then the activin type II receptor inhibitor can be administered once during the time period (e.g. once a day, once a week, once in 2 weeks, once in 3 weeks, once in 4 weeks, once in 5 weeks, once in 6 weeks, once in 7 weeks, once in 8 weeks, once in 3 months, once in 4 months, once in 5 months, once in 6 months, or once a year). In a specific embodiment, if a decrease in the level and/or activity of GDF11 after administration of an activin receptor type II inhibitor is maintained over, e.g., 1 month, 2 months or 3 months, then the activin type II receptor inhibitor can be administered once in 1 month, 2 months, or 3 months, respectively.</div>

The administration of step (ii) can comprise a single administration of an activin type II receptor inhibitor (i.e., a single dose is administered one time to the subject) or multiple administrations of an activin type II receptor inhibitor (e.g., the administration may comprise a complete administration regimen). The assessment of step (iii) can be performed at any point following the administration of step (ii). For example, the assessment of step (iii) can be performed 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, 6 weeks, 7 weeks, 8 weeks, 10 weeks, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, 6 months, or 1 year following the administration of step (ii). As another example, the assessment of step (iii) can be performed 1-3 days, 2-4 days, 3-5 days, 5-7 days, 1-2 weeks, 2-3 weeks, 3-4 weeks, 1-2 months, 2-3 months, 3-4 months, 4-5 months, 5-6 months, or 6-12 months following the administration of step (ii). The therapeutic regimen can be adjusted based on the outcome of the assessments in steps (i) and (iii). For example, if the levels of GDF11 in the tissue of the subject determined in the assessment of step (i) are decreased relative to the levels of GDF11 in the tissue of the subject determined in the assessment of step (iii), then the dose of the activin type II receptor inhibitor administered to the subject can be maintained or decreased. Conversely, if the levels of GDF11 in the tissue of the subject determined in the assessment of step (i) are increased relative to the levels of GDF11 in the tissue of the subject determined in the assessment of step (iii), then the dose of the activin type II receptor inhibitor administered to the subject can be increased.

In these embodiments, the level and/or activity of GDF11 in a tissue sample is compared to the normal level and/or activity of GDF11 (e.g., the average level and/or activity of GDF11 in a sample from the same tissue of healthy subjects, such as subjects in the same age group who do not have anemia). In certain embodiments, the level and/or activity of GDF11 is deemed to be elevated over the normal level and/or activity of GDF11 when it is elevated at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 45%, at least 50%, at least 55%, at least 60%, at least 65%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 100%, at least 200%, at least 300%, or at least 500% over the normal level and/or activity of GDF11.

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0045]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0046" num="0045">The methods described herein are based, in part, on a finding that GDF11 inhibits growth of precursors of red blood cell, and thus the level of GDF11 can correlate with the level of red blood cells. It is desirable to maintain an optimal level of red blood cells in a patient because, while decreases in the levels of red blood cells, hemoglobin or hematocrit are associated with ineffective erythropoiesis and anemia, excessive increases in the levels of red blood cells, hemoglobin or hematocrit are associated with increase in blood pressure and other undesirable side effects (which may be caused by treatment with higher than optimal doses of an activin type II receptor inhibitor). Accordingly, it can be desirable to administer an activin type II receptor inhibitor in a dosing regimen that maintains the level and/or activity of GDF11 in a patient at or around (e.g., within 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60% or 75% of) the normal level and/or activity of GDF11.</div>

Such modified ActRIIA polypeptides when selected to retain activin binding, can be considered functional equivalents of the naturally-occurring ActRIIA polypeptides. Modified ActRIIA polypeptides can also be produced, for instance, by amino acid substitution, deletion, or addition. For instance, it is reasonable to expect that an isolated replacement of a leucine with an isoleucine or valine, an aspartate with a glutamate, a threonine with a serine, or a similar replacement of an amino acid with a structurally related amino acid (e.g., conservative mutations) will not have a major effect on the biological activity of the resulting molecule. Conservative replacements are those that take place within a family of amino acids that are related in their side chains. Whether a change in the amino acid sequence of an ActRIIA polypeptide results in a functional homolog can be readily determined by assessing the ability of the variant ActRIIA polypeptide to produce a response in cells in a fashion similar to the wild-type ActRIIA polypeptide.</div>

Such mutations may introduce or eliminate one or more glycosylation sites, such as O-linked or N-linked glycosylation sites. Asparagine-linked glycosylation recognition sites generally comprise a tripeptide sequence, asparagine-X-threonine (or asparagines-X-serine) (where “X” is any amino acid) which is specifically recognized by appropriate cellular glycosylation enzymes. The alteration may also be made by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the wild-type ActRIIA polypeptide (for O-linked glycosylation sites). A variety of amino acid substitutions or deletions at one or both of the first or third amino acid positions of a glycosylation recognition site (and/or amino acid deletion at the second position) results in non-glycosylation at the modified tripeptide sequence. Another means of increasing the number of carbohydrate moieties on an ActRIIA polypeptide is by chemical or enzymatic coupling of glycosides to the ActRIIA polypeptide. Depending on the coupling mode used, the sugar(s) may be attached to (a) arginine and histidine; (b) free carboxyl groups; (c) free sulfhydryl groups such as those of cysteine; (d) free hydroxyl groups such as those of serine, threonine, or hydroxyproline; (e) aromatic residues such as those of phenylalanine, tyrosine, or tryptophan; or (f) the amide group of glutamine. These methods are described in WO 87/05330 published Sep. 11, 1987, and in Aplin and Wriston (1981) CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem., pp. 259-306, incorporated by reference herein. Removal of one or more carbohydrate moieties present on an ActRIIA polypeptide may be accomplished chemically and/or enzymatically. Chemical deglycosylation may involve, for example, exposure of the ActRIIA polypeptide to the compound trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, or an equivalent compound. This treatment results in the cleavage of most or all sugars except the linking sugar (N-acetylglucosamine or N-acetylgalactosamine), while leaving the amino acid sequence intact. Chemical deglycosylation is further described by Hakimuddin et al. (1987) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 259:52 and by Edge et al. (1981) Anal. Biochem. 118:131. Enzymatic cleavage of carbohydrate moieties on ActRIIA polypeptides can be achieved by the use of a variety of endo- and exo-glycosidases as described by Thotakura et al. (1987) Meth. Enzymol. 138:350. The sequence of an ActRIIA polypeptide may be adjusted, as appropriate, depending on the type of expression system used, as mammalian, yeast, insect and plant cells may all introduce differing glycosylation patterns that can be affected by the amino acid sequence of the peptide. In general, ActRIIA proteins for use in humans can be expressed in a mammalian cell line that provides proper glycosylation, such as HEK293 or CHO cell lines, although other expression systems, such as other mammalian expression cell lines, yeast cell lines with engineered glycosylation enzymes and insect cells, are expected to be useful as well.</div>

A variety of screening assays are provided below, and such assays may be used to evaluate variants.

For example, the altered protein can be rendered either more stable or less stable to proteolytic degradation or other cellular processes which result in destruction of, or otherwise inactivation of a native ActRIIA polypeptide. Such variants, and the genes which encode them, can be utilized to alter ActRIIA polypeptide levels by modulating the half-life of the ActRIIA polypeptides. For instance, a short half-life can give rise to more transient biological effects and can allow tighter control of recombinant ActRIIA polypeptide levels within the patient.

The most widely used techniques for screening large gene libraries typically comprises cloning the gene library into replicable expression vectors, transforming appropriate cells with the resulting library of vectors, and expressing the combinatorial genes under conditions in which detection of a desired activity facilitates relatively easy isolation of the vector encoding the gene whose product was detected.

Effects of such non-amino acid elements on the functionality of a ActRIIA polypeptide may be tested by any method known to the skilled artisan. When an ActRIIA polypeptide is produced in cells by cleaving a nascent form of the ActRIIA polypeptide, post-translational processing may also be important for correct folding and/or function of the protein.

Well known examples of such fusion domains include, but are not limited to, polyhistidine, Glu-Glu, glutathione S transferase (GST), thioredoxin, protein A, protein G, an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region (Fc), maltose binding protein (MBP), or human serum albumin. A fusion domain may be selected so as to confer a desired property. For example, some fusion domains are particularly useful for isolation of the fusion proteins by affinity chromatography. For the purpose of affinity purification, relevant matrices for affinity chromatography, such as glutathione-, amylase-, and nickel- or cobalt-conjugated resins are used. Many of such matrices are available in “kit” form, such as the Pharmacia GST purification system and the QIAexpress™ system (Qiagen) useful with (HIS<sub>6</sub>) fusion partners. As another example, a fusion domain may be selected so as to facilitate detection of the ActRIIA polypeptides. Examples of such detection domains include the various fluorescent proteins (e.g., GFP) as well as “epitope tags,” which are usually short peptide sequences for which a specific antibody is available. Well known epitope tags for which specific monoclonal antibodies are readily available include FLAG, influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), and c-myc tags. In some cases, the fusion domains have a protease cleavage site, such as for Factor Xa or Thrombin, which allows the relevant protease to partially digest the fusion proteins and thereby liberate the recombinant proteins therefrom. The liberated proteins can then be isolated from the fusion domain by subsequent chromatographic separation. In certain preferred embodiments, an ActRIIA polypeptide is fused with a domain that stabilizes the ActRIIA polypeptide in vivo (a “stabilizer” domain). By “stabilizing” is meant anything that increases serum half life, regardless of whether this is because of decreased destruction, decreased clearance by the kidney, or other pharmacokinetic effect. Fusions with the Fc portion of an immunoglobulin are known to confer desirable pharmacokinetic properties on a wide range of proteins.

An ActRIIB-Fc fusion protein containing amino acids 20-119 of SEQ ID NO: 28 (i.e., SEQ ID NO:32), “ActRIIB(20-119)-Fc” has reduced binding to GDF-11 and activin relative to an ActRIIB-Fc fusion protein containing amino acids 20-134 of SEQ ID NO: 28 (i.e., SEQ ID NO:31), “ActRIIB(20-134)-Fc”, which includes the proline knot region and the complete juxtamembrane domain.

Thus, ActRIIB polypeptides comprising extracellular domains that stop at amino acid 134, 133, 132, 131, 130 and 129 of SEQ ID NO: 28 (or SEQ ID NO:16) are all expected to be active, but constructs stopping at amino acid 134 or 133 may be most active.

An alanine to asparagine mutation at position 24 of SEQ ID NO:16 or SEQ ID NO:28 introduces an N-linked glycosylation sequence without substantially affecting ligand binding.

In particular, ActRIIB polypeptides beginning at amino acid position 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24 of SEQ ID NO:16 or SEQ ID NO:28 will retain activity, and ActRIIB polypeptides beginning at amino acid positions 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29 of SEQ ID NO:16 or SEQ ID NO:28 are also expected to retain activity. An ActRIIB polypeptide beginning at amino acid position 22, 23, 24 or 25 of SEQ ID NO:16 or SEQ ID NO:28 will have the most activity.</div>

At these positions, it is expected that conservative mutations will be tolerated, although a K74A mutation is well-tolerated, as are R40A, K55A, F82A and mutations at position L79. R40 is a K in Xenopus, indicating that basic amino acids at this position will be tolerated. Q53 is R in bovine ActRIIB and K in Xenopus ActRIIB, and therefore amino acids including R, K, Q, N and H will be tolerated at this position. Thus, a general formula for an ActRIIB polypeptide for use in the methods and compositions described herein is one that comprises amino acids 29-109 of SEQ ID NO:16 or SEQ ID NO:28, but optionally beginning at an amino acid position ranging from 20-24 or 22-25 of SEQ ID NO:16 or SEQ ID NO:28 and ending at an amino acid position ranging from 129-134 of SEQ ID NO:16 or SEQ ID NO:28, and comprising no more than 1, 2, 5, or 15 conservative amino acid changes in the ligand binding pocket, and zero, one or more non-conservative alterations at amino acid positions 40, 53, 55, 74, 79 and/or 82 of SEQ ID NO:16 or SEQ ID NO:28 in the ligand binding pocket.

An asparagine to alanine alteration at position 65 of SEQ ID NO:16 or SEQ ID NO:28 (N65A) actually improves ligand binding in the A64 background, and is thus expected to have no detrimental effect on ligand binding in the R64 background. This change probably eliminates glycosylation at N65 in the A64 background, thus demonstrating that a significant change in this region is likely to be tolerated. While an R64A change is poorly tolerated, R64K is well-tolerated, and thus another basic residue, such as H may be tolerated at position 64.</div>

The alteration may also be made by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the wild-type ActRIIB polypeptide (for O-linked glycosylation sites). A variety of amino acid substitutions or deletions at one or both of the first or third amino acid positions of a glycosylation recognition site (and/or amino acid deletion at the second position) results in non-glycosylation at the modified tripeptide sequence. Another means of increasing the number of carbohydrate moieties on an ActRIIB polypeptide is by chemical or enzymatic coupling of glycosides to the ActRIIB polypeptide. Depending on the coupling mode used, the sugar(s) may be attached to (a) arginine and histidine; (b) free carboxyl groups; (c) free sulfhydryl groups such as those of cysteine; (d) free hydroxyl groups such as those of serine, threonine, or hydroxyproline; (e) aromatic residues such as those of phenylalanine, tyrosine, or tryptophan; or (f) the amide group of glutamine. These methods are described in International Patent Application No. WO 87/05330 published Sep. 11, 1987, and in Aplin and Wriston (1981) CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem., pp. 259-306, incorporated by reference herein. Removal of one or more carbohydrate moieties present on an ActRIIB polypeptide may be accomplished chemically and/or enzymatically. Chemical deglycosylation may involve, for example, exposure of the ActRIIB polypeptide to the compound trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, or an equivalent compound. This treatment results in the cleavage of most or all sugars except the linking sugar (N-acetylglucosamine or N-acetylgalactosamine), while leaving the amino acid sequence intact. Chemical deglycosylation is further described by Hakimuddin et al. (1987) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 259:52 and by Edge et al. (1981) Anal. Biochem. 118:131. Enzymatic cleavage of carbohydrate moieties on ActRIIB polypeptides can be achieved by the use of a variety of endo- and exo-glycosidases as described by Thotakura et al. (1987) Meth. Enzymol. 138:350. The sequence of an ActRIIB polypeptide may be adjusted, as appropriate, depending on the type of expression system used, as mammalian, yeast, insect and plant cells may all introduce differing glycosylation patterns that can be affected by the amino acid sequence of the peptide. In general, ActRIIB proteins for use in humans will be expressed in a mammalian cell line that provides proper glycosylation, such as HEK293 or CHO cell lines, although other expression systems, such as other mammalian expression cell lines, yeast cell lines with engineered glycosylation enzymes and insect cells, are expected to be useful as well.</div>

In a specific embodiment, introduction of an asparagine at position 24 of SEQ ID NO:16 or SEQ ID NO:28 (A24N) results in the creation of an NXT sequence that confers a longer half-life. Other NX(T/S) sequences can be found at 42-44 (NQS) and 65-67 (NSS), although the latter may not be efficiently glycosylated with the R at position 64 (i.e., in R64 polypeptides). N-X-S/T sequences may be generally introduced at positions outside the ligand binding pocket of ActRIIB, which is detailed above. Particularly suitable sites for the introduction of non-endogenous N-X-S/T sequences include amino acids 20-29, 20-24, 22-25, 109-134, 120-134 or 129-134 of SEQ ID NO:16 or SEQ ID NO:28.

Thus, desirable alterations that would create an N-linked glycosylation site are: A24N, R64N, S67N (possibly combined with an N65A alteration), E106N, R112N, G120N, E123N, P129N, A132N, R112S and R112T (with all amino acid positions corresponding to the positions they can be found in SEQ ID NO:16 or SEQ ID NO:28). Any S that is predicted to be glycosylated may be altered to a T without creating an immunogenic site, because of the protection afforded by the glycosylation.

Likewise, mutagenesis can give rise to variants which have intracellular half-lives dramatically different than the corresponding wild-type ActRIIB polypeptide. For example, the altered protein can be rendered either more stable or less stable to proteolytic degradation or other cellular processes which result in destruction of, or otherwise inactivation of a native ActRIIB polypeptide. Such variants, and the genes which encode them, can be utilized to alter ActRIIB polypeptide levels by modulating the half-life of the ActRIIB polypeptides. For instance, a short half-life can give rise to more transient biological effects and can allow tighter control of recombinant ActRIIB polypeptide levels within the patient. In an Fc fusion protein, mutations may be made in the linker (if any) and/or the Fc portion to alter the half-life of the protein.</div>

Such techniques will be generally adaptable for rapid screening of the gene libraries generated by the combinatorial mutagenesis of ActRIIB polypeptides. The most widely used techniques for screening large gene libraries typically comprises cloning the gene library into replicable expression vectors, transforming appropriate cells with the resulting library of vectors, and expressing the combinatorial genes under conditions in which detection of a desired activity facilitates relatively easy isolation of the vector encoding the gene whose product was detected. Preferred assays include activin binding assays and activin-mediated cell signaling assays.</div>

Such modifications include, but are not limited to, acetylation, carboxylation, glycosylation, phosphorylation, lipidation, and acylation. As a result, the modified ActRIIB polypeptides may contain non-amino acid elements, such as polyethylene glycols, lipids, poly- or mono-saccharide, and phosphates. Effects of such non-amino acid elements on the functionality of a ActRIIB polypeptide may be tested by any method known to the skilled artisan. When an ActRIIB polypeptide is produced in cells by cleaving a nascent form of the ActRIIB polypeptide, post-translational processing may also be important for correct folding and/or function of the protein. Different cells (such as CHO, HeLa, MDCK, 293, W138, NIH-3T3 or HEK293) have specific cellular machinery and characteristic mechanisms for such post-translational activities and may be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the ActRIIB polypeptides.</div>

Well known examples of such fusion domains include, but are not limited to, polyhistidine, Glu-Glu, glutathione S transferase (GST), thioredoxin, protein A, protein G, an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region (Fc), maltose binding protein (MBP), or human serum albumin. A fusion domain may be selected so as to confer a desired property. For example, some fusion domains are particularly useful for isolation of the fusion proteins by affinity chromatography. For the purpose of affinity purification, relevant matrices for affinity chromatography, such as glutathione-, amylase-, and nickel- or cobalt-conjugated resins are used. Many of such matrices are available in “kit” form, such as the Pharmacia GST purification system and the QIAexpress™ system (Qiagen) useful with (HIS<sub>6</sub>) fusion partners. As another example, a fusion domain may be selected so as to facilitate detection of the ActRIIB polypeptides. Examples of such detection domains include the various fluorescent proteins (e.g., GFP) as well as “epitope tags,” which are usually short peptide sequences for which a specific antibody is available. Well known epitope tags for which specific monoclonal antibodies are readily available include FLAG, influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), and c-myc tags. In some cases, the fusion domains have a protease cleavage site, such as for Factor Xa or Thrombin, which allows the relevant protease to partially digest the fusion proteins and thereby liberate the recombinant proteins therefrom. The liberated proteins can then be isolated from the fusion domain by subsequent chromatographic separation. In certain preferred embodiments, an ActRIIB polypeptide is fused with a domain that stabilizes the ActRIIB polypeptide in vivo (a “stabilizer” domain). By “stabilizing” is meant anything that increases serum half life, regardless of whether this is because of decreased destruction, decreased clearance by the kidney, or other pharmacokinetic effect. Fusions with the Fc portion of an immunoglobulin are known to confer desirable pharmacokinetic properties on a wide range of proteins. Likewise, fusions to human serum albumin can confer desirable properties. Other types of fusion domains that may be selected include multimerizing (e.g., dimerizing, tetramerizing) domains and functional domains (that confer an additional biological function, such as further stimulation of bone growth or muscle growth, as desired).</div>

A region of complementarity may fall within an intron, a coding sequence or a noncoding sequence of the target transcript, such as the coding sequence portion. Generally, a nucleic acid compound that inhibits an ActRII receptor will have a length of about 8 to about 500 nucleotides or base pairs in length, and optionally the length will be about 14 to about 50 nucleotides.

Such techniques are well known in the art, and include, for example, the hybridoma technique (originally developed by Kohler and Milstein, (1975) Nature, 256: 495-497), the human B cell hybridoma technique (Kozbar et al., (1983) Immunology Today, 4: 72), and the EBV-hybridoma technique to produce human monoclonal antibodies (Cole et al., (1985) Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R.

Monoclonal antibodies generally have a greater tendency (as compared to polyclonal antibodies) to discriminate effectively between the desired antigens and cross-reacting polypeptides. One characteristic that influences the specificity of an antibody:antigen interaction is the affinity of the antibody for the antigen. Although the desired specificity may be reached with a range of different affinities, generally preferred antibodies will have an affinity (a dissociation constant) of about 10<sup>−6</sup>, 10<sup>−7</sup>, 10<sup>−8</sup>, 10<sup>−9 </sup>or less.

However, these responses are unproductive because of ineffective erythropoiesis. Ineffective erythropoiesis is characterized by a requirement of RBC production which cannot be compensated by an accelerated proliferation and differentiation of immature erythroblasts due to the premature cell death by apoptosis of maturing cells. Therefore, imbalanced immature/mature erythroblasts ratio is a feature of ineffective erythropoiesis of thalassemia. To further study the impact of mActRIIA-Fc on erythroid differentiation and ineffective erythropoiesis, cell suspensions from mActRIIA-Fc-treated mice and their respective controls were labeled with antibodies to TfR1 and TER119. Erythroid precursors differentiation was analyzed by flow cytometry in TER119high gate as previously described (Liu et al., Blood 2006). Accordingly, mActRIIA-Fc-treated mice presented a decreased ratio of immature/mature erythroblasts ratio in spleen indicating the correction of ineffective stress erythropoiesis. In bone marrow the immature/mature erythroblasts ratio did not differ between control and mActRIIA-Fc-treated mice further suggesting that ineffective erythropoiesis in the bone marrow of thalassemic mice was not corrected by mActRIIA-Fc treatment. These results suggest that ActRIIa ligands contribute to erythroblast differentiation but also to ineffective spleen erythropoiesis in β-thalassemia.</div>

The excess of unbound free α-globin in maturing erythroid cells precipitates and leads to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cellular oxidative stress damage inducing premature death of erythroid precursors. The impact of mActRIIA-Fc on the generation of globin precipitates was further investigated. ROS generation on primary pro-erythroblast differentiation was evaluated by flow cytometry using dichlorodihydrofluorescein (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>).

A well-established in vitro model of pro-erythroblast differentiation was used (spleen precursors were cultured for 5 days in serum free stem cell expansion medium supplemented with mouse Stem Cell Factor, Epo and dexamethasone). These pro-erythroblast-enriched cultures were then differentiated in the presence of 1 U/ml Epo and 1 mg/ml Fe-Tf for three days. Similar to in vivo observations, treatment with mActRIIA-Fc increased total amounts of hemoglobin in thalassemic erythroblasts. However, those cells presented decreased amounts of membrane-associated precipitated hemoglobin when compared to control treated cells (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>). Accordingly, the amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) detected on those cells decreased in cells treated with mActRIIA-Fc (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>). Therefore, treatment with mActRIIA-Fc resulted in decreased cytotoxic globin precipitation and its associated ROS production, contributing to ineffective erythropoiesis. Altogether, these data suggested that targeting ActRIIa signaling modulated erythroblast differentiation and trapping of ActRIIa ligands by mActRIIA-Fc corrected ineffective erythropoiesis by favoring the formation of mature erythroblasts and reducing membrane-associated hemoglobin precipitates.</div>

Multiparametric flow cytometry comparative analysis on spleen cells from mice treated with PBS and mActRIIA-Fc showed that Fas-L expression was increased on immature late basophilic and polychromatic erythroblasts (Ery-B) and decreased on orthochromatic erythroblasts (Ery-C) (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). In contrast, Fas-L expression was not modulated on BM erythroblasts (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). Together, these results showed that ActRIIa signaling modulated Fas/Fas-L pathway on maturing erythroblasts. Collectively, these data suggested that ActRIIa signaling induced premature cell death of maturing erythroblasts committed to ineffective erythropoiesis. Surprisingly, Fas-L expression was decreased on Ery-A and Ery-C subsets of cells showing that the impact of ActRIIa signaling was more pronounced on maturing erythroblasts (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). The number of tunel positive cells was also increased in animals treated with mActRIIA-Fc (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>).

As both clinical and pharmacological findings pointed to a clear role for mActRIIA-Fc in stimulating RBC parameters, it was hypothesized that the effects of mActRIIA-Fc could be mediated by accessory cells in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. Human CD36+ cells, which are highly enriched for erythroid progenitors, were co-cultured with long-term BM cultures and then their erythroid differentiation was assessed following 6 days of culture in EPO (2U/mL)-supplemented media. At day 6, the output of the cultures was predominantly characterized as EryA (˜basophilic erythroblast) but with the addition of mActRIIA-Fc (50 μM), a significant fraction of CD36+ cells matured into EryB/C cells (polychromatic/orthochromatic erythroblasts), suggesting that factors produced by BM accessory cells mediated erythropoietic effects of mActRIIA-Fc and that, in contrast to EPO, mActRIIA-Fc could play a role in the latter stages or erythroblast maturation (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13D-13F</figref>). To identify cytokines that might mediate the effects of mActRIIA-Fc, CD36+ cells were treated with several ActRIIA ligands.
