<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Industrial processes, including industrial combustion processes, create a variety of gas streams, many of which are ultimately exhausted to the environment. These gas streams may include greenhouse gases or other gaseous components that may be desirable to be removed from the process gas stream, such as prior to exhausting these streams to the environment. An illustrative, non-exclusive example of such a greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide, and an illustrative, non-exclusive example of such a gas stream is a flue gas stream from a burner or other combustion unit. Flue and other gas streams containing carbon dioxide may be generated by a variety of industrial processes, such as power generation, heating, and steam generation. Many such processes are performed at atmospheric, or near-atmospheric, pressure and are air-fired, thereby resulting in flue gas streams that are at, or near, atmospheric pressure and which are highly diluted with nitrogen gas from the air stream used to support combustion.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventionally, carbon dioxide may be removed from flue gas streams by a variety of processes, such as processes that involve amine or ammonia treating of the flue gas stream, adsorbing the carbon dioxide with a solid adsorbent, and removing the carbon dioxide using physical solvents. Illustrative examples of such conventional processes are disclosed in D. Aaron and C. Tsouris, “Separation of CO<sub>2 </sub>from Flue Gas: A Review,” <i>Separation Science and Technology, </i>40, 321-48, 2005. Another example of a process for removing carbon dioxide from natural gas utilizes Joule-Thompson expansion of a gas stream to cool the gas stream using a refluxing distillation tower. This process may be referred to as a “Control Freeze Zone” process and is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,533,372, 5,062,270, 5,120,338, 5,956,971, and 6,053,007, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference. Yet another process is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,073,348, which discloses passing carbon-dioxide containing gas streams over surfaces that are cycled between freezing and melting temperatures, and the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">These processes, while effective, typically have high energy or solvent requirements, or demands, and may require high pressures to operate effectively. For example, for coal-fired power plants, removal of carbon dioxide from flue gases using an amine-treating process is estimated to reduce the net power generation by approximately 30%. Some such conventional processes also require pre-processing the flue, or other, gas stream so that it is dry (i.e., free of water), or substantially dry, so as to not cause blockage of the system due to the formation of ice.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure is directed to systems and methods for removing one or more solidifiable gas components from a process gas stream by direct contact with a cold liquid. The process gas stream includes at least one gas component that is frozen or otherwise solidified by direct contact with the cold liquid, such as in a contacting assembly, while one or more other gas components of the process gas stream remain in a gaseous state. The process gas stream may include water, and the cold liquid will have a different composition than the process gas stream. The contacting of the cold liquid with the process gas stream to form at least one solidified gas component may be performed at a pressure that is less than 200 psia, and optionally less than 100 psia, less than 50 psia, or even less than 35 psia or 30 psia, and the solidified gas component(s) may be removed from the contacting assembly as a slurry with cold liquid. In one or more embodiments, the gas-cold liquid contacting may be performed in a countercurrent manner in two or more stages. At least a portion of solids may be mechanically removed from generated slurry wherein removal occurs between at least one set of adjacent stages. The liquid-solid slurry optionally may be concentrated to increase the concentration of solidified gas component in the slurry by reducing the amount of the cold liquid in the slurry. The pressure of the slurry optionally may be increased using a liquid pump or other liquid-pressurizing mechanism, and the solidified gas components may be selectively removed from the cold liquid. Another illustrative, non-exclusive example of a suitable method for pressurizing the slurry is to heat the solids in a sealed container. When the slurry contains two or more solidified gas components, the solidified gas components may be separately and/or sequentially removed from the cold liquid, such as through heating of the slurry. The solids may be melted or vaporized and separated to form an outlet stream. As discussed herein, the outlet steam may be disposed of via a variety of mechanisms and/or a variety of applications, including disposing the outlet stream in a subsurface formation.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0015]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0016" num="0015">The present disclosure is directed to systems and methods for removing a solidifiable gas component from a gas stream by solidifying the solidifiable gas component with a cold liquid. As discussed in more detail herein, the systems and methods may directly contact the gas stream containing the solidifiable gas component with the cold liquid to freeze or otherwise solidify the solidifiable gas component. Through this direct contact with the cold liquid, the solidifiable gas component will freeze, or otherwise solidify, thereby removing the frozen (solidified) solidifiable gas component from the gas stream. Instead, the frozen (solidified) solidifiable gas component will form a mixture, or slurry, with the cold liquid. Thereafter, the systems and methods may separate the frozen (solidified) solidifiable gas component from the cold liquid. The separated components may then be converted to liquid or vapor, for example by heating, to form a stream for disposal or use elsewhere.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0016]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0017" num="0016">As used herein, the term “process gas stream” generally refers to any gas stream present in an industrial or commercial facility, regardless of whether the process gas stream is a reactant stream, a product stream, an intermediate (or reaction intermediary) stream, a waste (gas) stream, or an exhaust stream. Illustrative, non-exclusive examples of such industrial and/or commercial facilities include refineries, power plants, incinerators, smelters, chemical plants, natural gas treaters, and the like. Illustrative, non-exclusive examples of process gas streams from which one or more solidifiable gas components may be removed using systems and/or methods according to the present disclosure include, but are not limited to, flue gas streams and combustion exhaust streams. An additional illustrative, non-exclusive example of a process gas stream is a natural gas stream, such as which may contain carbon dioxide and/or hydrogen sulfide that may be removed with the systems and/or methods according to the present disclosure. Additionally or alternatively, a process gas stream from which one or more solidifiable gas components may be removed using systems and/or methods according to the present disclosure include, but are not limited to, streams in which a majority of the gas stream remains a gas-phase stream at the temperature and pressure in which the one or more solidifiable gas components are removed from the process gas stream by direct contact with the cold liquid.</div>

Illustrative, non-exclusive examples of solidifiable gas components that may be removed from a process gas stream using systems and/or methods according to the present disclosure include carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), water (H<sub>2</sub>O), hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), carbonyl sulfide (COS), and NOx compounds (e.g., NO and NO<sub>2</sub>). These components of a process gas stream may additionally or alternatively be referred to herein as gas-phase compounds, solidifiable gas-phase compounds, and solidifiable gas components of the process gas stream.</div>

Accordingly, “freezing” may include the compound first changing phases from a gas phase to a liquid phase and thereafter changing phases to the solid phase. Additionally or alternatively, “freezing” may include the compound subliming, precipitating, solidifying, or otherwise changing phases from a gas phase to a solid phase. As an illustrative example, at pressures that are at or near atmospheric pressure, water, hydrogen sulfide, and carbonyl sulfide will transition from a gas phase to a liquid phase and then to a solid phase. In contrast, at pressures below its triple point pressure of 5.2 atmospheres (73.5 psi), carbon dioxide will tend to sublime from the gas phase to the solid phase at pressures below its triple point. This changing of the states, or phases, of one or more compounds of a process gas using systems and/or methods according to the present disclosure refers to a change in the state of the compound without a change in the chemical composition of the compound. Accordingly, solidifying of one or more solidifiable gas component of a process gas stream is not intended to refer to chemically reacting the component to form one or more different compounds.</div>

After dehydration, the process gas stream had a composition of 80.7 mol % nitrogen gas, 14.5 mol % carbon dioxide, 3.8 mol % oxygen gas, 0.6 mol % water, 0.4 mol % carbon monoxide, a temperature of 2.2° C., a pressure of 16 psia, and a mass flow rate of 15,940 kg/hr. 3-methylpentane was utilized as the cold liquid, and a six-stage, countercurrent contacting assembly with recycled cold liquid was modeled. The cold liquid was maintained in a cold liquid reservoir at a temperature of −130° C. and was delivered to the first stage of the contacting assembly at a contacting temperature of −123° C. The contacting temperatures of the second-sixth stages were −104° C., −95° C., −92° C., −85° C., and −59° C., respectively. The recycled cold liquid had a composition of 99.6 mol % 3-methylpentane, 0.2 mol % carbon dioxide, 0.2 mol % nitrogen gas, and a flow rate of 21,924 kg/hr. A 50-30-15 mol % mixture of methane, ethane, and propane was utilized as the refrigerant for the cooling assembly for the cold liquid supply, and approximately 1.37 kg of coolant was recycled for every kilogram of inlet process (flue) gas that was treated. Carbon dioxide solubility in 3-methylpentane was based on data from <i>J. Chem. Eng. Data. </i>16(4), 412-4, 1971.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0077]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0079" num="0077">The treated gas stream produced by the simulation had a composition of 94.9 mol % nitrogen gas, 0.2 mol % carbon dioxide, 4.4 mol % oxygen gas, 0.0 mol % water, and 0.5 mol % carbon monoxide, and a flow rate of 12,575 kg/hr. Accordingly, the modeled example demonstrates that a substantial majority of the carbon dioxide was removed from the process gas stream. In the modeled example, only 0.2 mol % carbon dioxide was present in the treated gas stream, which corresponds to approximately 99% removal of carbon dioxide. The modeled system <b>10</b> utilized 90 horsepower (HP) of power to operate, largely due to the cooling assembly to maintain the cold liquid in a cold liquid reservoir at −130° C., which corresponds to less than 20% of the net power production by the power plant.</div>
