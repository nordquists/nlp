<li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Anemia is a decrease in number of red blood cells or less than the normal quantity of hemoglobin in the blood. Anemia can also be caused by decreased oxygen-binding ability of the hemoglobin. Anemia is the most common disorder of the blood. Anemia can be caused by ineffective erythropoiesis. Ineffective erythropoiesis is present if active erythropoiesis takes place but mature red blood cells fail to develop at the proper rate. Progenitor cells undergo apoptosis before the stage of mature red blood cells is reached.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">Myeloproliferative neoplasm- (MPN-) associated myelofibrosis is an umbrella term that is used to describe a clonal myeloid neoplasm that can develop directly (primary myelofibrosis (also known as agnogenic myeloid metaplasia, chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis, myelosclerosis with myeloid metaplasia, and idiopathic myelofibrosis)) or evolve from other myeloid neoplasms (polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia), and are characterized by bone marrow dysfunction and fibrosis, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and an increased inflammatory state. MPN-associated myelofibrosis results in excessive fibrous tissue formation in the bone marrow, which can lead to severe anemia, fatigue, weakness, and enlarged spleen and liver. Current treatments for MPN-associated myelofibrosis include hydroxyurea, splenectomy, and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, hydroxyurea treatment may worsen anemia and there is concern of its mutagenic potential with long-term use, splenectomy has a short media duration of response, may shorten postsplenectomy survival, and has high postoperative morbidity, and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can lead to leukemic transformation (Sochacki et al., 2016, Therapeutic approaches in myelofibrosis and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative overlap syndromes, Onco Targets Ther, 2016(9):2273-286). Thus, there remains a need for therapeutics for the treatment of MPN-associated myelofibrosis.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">Two related type II receptors, ActRIIA and ActRIIB, have been identified as the type II receptors for activins (Mathews and Vale, 1991, Cell 65:973-982; Attisano et al., 1992, Cell 68: 97-108). Besides activins, ActRIIA and ActRIIB can biochemically interact with several other TGF-beta family proteins, including BMP7, Nodal, GDF8, and GDF11 (Yamashita et al., 1995, J. Cell Biol. 130:217-226; Lee and McPherron, 2001, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 98:9306-9311; Yeo and Whitman, 2001, Mol. Cell 7: 949-957; Oh et al., 2002, Genes Dev. 16:2749-54). ALK4 is the primary type I receptor for activins, particularly for activin A, and ALK-7 may serve as a receptor for activins as well, particularly for activin B. ActRIIB signaling inhibitors have been described for treating ineffective erythropoiesis and myelodysplastic syndromes (see, e.g., International Patent Application Publication Nos. WO 2013/059347, WO 2011/020045, and WO 2016/090077).</div>

For example, ActRIIB polypeptides include polypeptides derived from the sequence of any known ActRIIB receptor having a sequence at least about 80% identical to the sequence of an ActRIIB polypeptide, and optionally at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or greater identity. For example, an ActRIIB polypeptide may bind to and inhibit the function of an ActRIIB protein and/or activin. An example of an ActRIIB polypeptide includes the human ActRIIB precursor polypeptide (SEQ ID NO:3 or SEQ ID NO:14). With respect to the ActRIIB precursor polypeptide whose amino acid sequence is depicted as SEQ ID NO:3 or SEQ ID NO:14 (i.e., the human ActRIIB precursor polypeptide), the signal peptide of the ActRIIB precursor polypeptide is located at amino acids 1 to 18; the extracellular domain is located at amino acids 19 to 134 and the potential N-linked glycosylation sites are located at amino acid positions 42 and 65. The nucleic acid sequence encoding the human ActRIIB precursor polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:3 is disclosed as SEQ ID NO:6 (SEQ ID NO:6 provides an alanine at the codon corresponding to amino acid position 64, but could be readily modified by one of skill in the art using methods known in the art to provide an arginine at the codon corresponding to amino acid position 64 instead).

By contrast, an Fc fusion protein with an arginine at position 64 of the ActRIIB precursor amino acid sequence (herein referred to as “R64”) has an affinity for activin and GDF-11 in the low nanomolar to high picomolar range (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20100068215, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated in its entirety).

An ActRIIB-Fc fusion protein containing amino acids 20-119 of SEQ ID NO:14 (i.e., SEQ ID NO:18), “ActRIIB(20-119)-Fc” has reduced binding to GDF-11 and activin relative to an ActRIIB-Fc fusion protein containing amino acids 20-134 of SEQ ID NO:14 (i.e., SEQ ID NO:17), “ActRIIB(20-134)-Fc”, which includes the proline knot region and the complete juxtamembrane domain. However, an ActRIIB-Fc fusion protein containing amino acids 20-129 of SEQ ID NO:14, “ActRIIB(20-129)-Fc” retains similar but somewhat reduced activity relative to the non-truncated extracellular domain of ActRIIB, even though the proline knot region is disrupted. Thus, ActRIIB polypeptides comprising extracellular domains that stop at amino acid 134, 133, 132, 131, 130 and 129 of SEQ ID NO:14 (or SEQ ID NO:3) are all expected to be active, but constructs stopping at amino acid 134 or 133 may be most active. Similarly, mutations at any of residues 129-134 are not expected to alter ligand binding affinity by large margins, as indicated by the fact that mutations of P129 and P130 of SEQ ID NO:14 do not substantially decrease ligand binding. Therefore, the ActRIIB polypeptides used in accordance with the methods and compositions described herein may end as early as amino acid 109 (i.e., the final cysteine) of SEQ ID NO:14 (or SEQ ID NO:3), however, forms ending at or between amino acid positions 109 and 119 of SEQ ID NO:14 (or SEQ ID NO:3) are expected to have reduced ligand binding ability.</div>

It is expected that an ActRIIB polypeptide beginning at amino acid 29 of the N-terminus of SEQ ID NO:3 or SEQ ID NO:14, or before these amino acid positions, will retain ligand binding activity. An alanine to asparagine mutation at position 24 of SEQ ID NO:3 or SEQ ID NO:14 introduces an N-linked glycosylation sequence without substantially affecting ligand binding. This confirms that mutations in the region between the signal cleavage peptide and the cysteine cross-linked region, corresponding to amino acids 20-29 of SEQ ID NO:3 or SEQ ID NO:14, are well tolerated. In particular, ActRIIB polypeptides beginning at amino acid position 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24 of SEQ ID NO:3 or SEQ ID NO:14 will retain activity, and ActRIIB polypeptides beginning at amino acid positions 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29 of SEQ ID NO:3 or SEQ ID NO:14 are also expected to retain activity.

At these positions, it is expected that conservative mutations will be tolerated, although a K74A mutation is well-tolerated, as are R40A, K55A, F82A and mutations at position L79. R40 is a K in Xenopus, indicating that basic amino acids at this position will be tolerated. Q53 is R in bovine ActRIIB and K in Xenopus ActRIIB, and therefore amino acids including R, K, Q, N and H will be tolerated at this position.

Sites outside the binding pocket, at which variability may be particularly well tolerated, include the amino and carboxy termini of the extracellular domain of ActRIIB, and positions 42-46 and 65-73. An asparagine to alanine alteration at position 65 of SEQ ID NO:3 or SEQ ID NO:14 (N65A) actually improves ligand binding in the A64 background, and is thus expected to have no detrimental effect on ligand binding in the R64 background. This change probably eliminates glycosylation at N65 in the A64 background, thus demonstrating that a significant change in this region is likely to be tolerated. While an R64A change is poorly tolerated, R64K is well-tolerated, and thus another basic residue, such as H may be tolerated at position 64.</div>

The alteration may also be made by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the wild-type ActRIIB polypeptide (for O-linked glycosylation sites). A variety of amino acid substitutions or deletions at one or both of the first or third amino acid positions of a glycosylation recognition site (and/or amino acid deletion at the second position) results in non-glycosylation at the modified tripeptide sequence. Another means of increasing the number of carbohydrate moieties on an ActRIIB polypeptide is by chemical or enzymatic coupling of glycosides to the ActRIIB polypeptide. Depending on the coupling mode used, the sugar(s) may be attached to (a) arginine and histidine; (b) free carboxyl groups; (c) free sulfhydryl groups such as those of cysteine; (d) free hydroxyl groups such as those of serine, threonine, or hydroxyproline; (e) aromatic residues such as those of phenylalanine, tyrosine, or tryptophan; or (f) the amide group of glutamine. These methods are described in International Patent Application No. WO 87/05330 published Sep. 11, 1987, and in Aplin and Wriston (1981) CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem., pp. 259-306, incorporated by reference herein. Removal of one or more carbohydrate moieties present on an ActRIIB polypeptide may be accomplished chemically and/or enzymatically. Chemical deglycosylation may involve, for example, exposure of the ActRIIB polypeptide to the compound trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, or an equivalent compound. This treatment results in the cleavage of most or all sugars except the linking sugar (N-acetylglucosamine or N-acetylgalactosamine), while leaving the amino acid sequence intact. Chemical deglycosylation is further described by Hakimuddin et al. (1987) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 259:52 and by Edge et al. (1981) Anal. Biochem. 118:131. Enzymatic cleavage of carbohydrate moieties on ActRIIB polypeptides can be achieved by the use of a variety of endo- and exo-glycosidases as described by Thotakura et al. (1987) Meth. Enzymol. 138:350. The sequence of an ActRIIB polypeptide may be subsequent, as appropriate, depending on the type of expression system used, as mammalian, yeast, insect and plant cells may all introduce differing glycosylation patterns that can be affected by the amino acid sequence of the peptide. In general, ActRIIB proteins for use in humans will be expressed in a mammalian cell line that provides proper glycosylation, such as HEK293 or CHO cell lines, although other expression systems, such as other mammalian expression cell lines, yeast cell lines with engineered glycosylation enzymes and insect cells, are expected to be useful as well.</div>

In a specific embodiment, introduction of an asparagine at position 24 of SEQ ID NO:3 or SEQ ID NO:14 (A24N) results in the creation of an NXT sequence that confers a longer half-life. Other NX(T/S) sequences can be found at 42-44 (NQS) and 65-67 (NSS), although the latter may not be efficiently glycosylated with the R at position 64 (i.e., in R64 polypeptides). N—X—S/T sequences may be generally introduced at positions outside the ligand binding pocket of ActRIIB, which is detailed above. Particularly suitable sites for the introduction of non-endogenous N—X—S/T sequences include amino acids 20-29, 20-24, 22-25, 109-134, 120-134 or 129-134 of SEQ ID NO:3 or SEQ ID NO:14. N—X—S/T sequences may also be introduced into the linker between the ActRIIB sequence and the Fc or other fusion component. Such a site may be introduced with minimal effort by introducing an N in the correct position with respect to a pre-existing S or T, or by introducing an S or T at a position corresponding to a pre-existing N. Thus, desirable alterations that would create an N-linked glycosylation site are: A24N, R64N, S67N (possibly combined with an N65A alteration), E106N, R112N, G120N, E123N, P129N, A132N, R112S and R112T (with all amino acid positions corresponding to the positions they can be found in SEQ ID NO:3 or SEQ ID NO:14). Any S that is predicted to be glycosylated may be altered to a T without creating an immunogenic site, because of the protection afforded by the glycosylation. Likewise, any T that is predicted to be glycosylated may be altered to an S. Thus the alterations S67T and S44T are encompassed herein. Likewise, in an A24N variant, an S26T alteration may be used.

Such techniques will be generally adaptable for rapid screening of the gene libraries generated by the combinatorial mutagenesis of ActRIIB polypeptides. The most widely used techniques for screening large gene libraries typically comprises cloning the gene library into replicable expression vectors, transforming appropriate cells with the resulting library of vectors, and expressing the combinatorial genes under conditions in which detection of a desired activity facilitates relatively easy isolation of the vector encoding the gene whose product was detected. Preferred assays include activin binding assays and activin-mediated cell signaling assays.</div>

Such modifications include, but are not limited to, acetylation, carboxylation, glycosylation, phosphorylation, lipidation, and acylation. As a result, the modified ActRIIB polypeptides may contain non-amino acid elements, such as polyethylene glycols, lipids, poly- or mono-saccharide, and phosphates. Effects of such non-amino acid elements on the functionality of an ActRIIB polypeptide may be tested by any method known to the skilled artisan. When an ActRIIB polypeptide is produced in cells by cleaving a nascent form of the ActRIIB polypeptide, post-translational processing may also be important for correct folding and/or function of the protein. Different cells (such as CHO, HeLa, MDCK, 293, W138, NIH-3T3 or HEK293) have specific cellular machinery and characteristic mechanisms for such post-translational activities and may be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the ActRIIB polypeptides.</div>

Well known examples of such fusion domains include, but are not limited to, polyhistidine, Glu-Glu, glutathione S transferase (GST), thioredoxin, protein A, protein G, an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region (Fc), maltose binding protein (MBP), or human serum albumin. A fusion domain may be selected so as to confer a desired property. For example, some fusion domains are particularly useful for isolation of the fusion proteins by affinity chromatography. For the purpose of affinity purification, relevant matrices for affinity chromatography, such as glutathione-, amylase-, and nickel- or cobalt-conjugated resins are used. Many of such matrices are available in “kit” form, such as the Pharmacia GST purification system and the QIAexpress™ system (Qiagen) useful with (HIS6) fusion partners. As another example, a fusion domain may be selected so as to facilitate detection of the ActRIIB polypeptides. Examples of such detection domains include the various fluorescent proteins (e.g., GFP) as well as “epitope tags,” which are usually short peptide sequences for which a specific antibody is available. Well known epitope tags for which specific monoclonal antibodies are readily available include FLAG, influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), and c-myc tags. In some cases, the fusion domains have a protease cleavage site, such as for Factor Xa or Thrombin, which allows the relevant protease to partially digest the fusion proteins and thereby liberate the recombinant proteins there from. The liberated proteins can then be isolated from the fusion domain by subsequent chromatographic separation. In certain preferred embodiments, an ActRIIB polypeptide is fused with a domain that stabilizes the ActRIIB polypeptide in vivo (a “stabilizer” domain). By “stabilizing” is meant anything that increases serum half life, regardless of whether this is because of decreased destruction, decreased clearance by the kidney, or other pharmacokinetic effect. Fusions with the Fc portion of an immunoglobulin are known to confer desirable pharmacokinetic properties on a wide range of proteins. Likewise, fusions to human serum albumin can confer desirable properties. Other types of fusion domains that may be selected include multimerizing (e.g., dimerizing, tetramerizing) domains and functional domains (that confer an additional biological function, such as further stimulation of bone growth or muscle growth, as desired).</div>

The ActRIIB polypeptide domain and the heterologous domain need not be adjacent in a fusion protein, and additional domains or amino acid sequences may be included C- or N-terminal to either domain or between the domains.</div>

Such stabilizing modifications include, but are not limited to, fusion proteins (including, for example, fusion proteins comprising an ActRIIB polypeptide and a stabilizer domain), modifications of a glycosylation site (including, for example, addition of a glycosylation site to an ActRIIB polypeptide), and modifications of carbohydrate moiety (including, for example, removal of carbohydrate moieties from an ActRIIB polypeptide).

For example, the salt concentration in the wash step can be selected from a low stringency of about 2.0 times SSC at 50° Celsius to a high stringency of about 0.2 times SSC at 50° Celsius.

Likewise, an ActRIIA polypeptide may be administered to a mouse or other animal, and one or more bone properties, such as density or volume may be assessed. The healing rate for bone fractures may also be evaluated. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is a well-established, non-invasive, quantitative technique for assessing bone density in an animal. In humans central DEXA systems may be used to evaluate bone density in the spine and pelvis. These are the best predictors of overall bone density. Peripheral DEXA systems may be used to evaluate bone density in peripheral bones, including, for example, the bones of the hand, wrist, ankle and foot. Traditional x-ray imaging systems, including CAT scans, may be used to evaluate bone growth and fracture healing. In addition, bone density can be measured using quantitative computed tomography (qCT). The mechanical strength of bone may also be evaluated.</div>

Assays which are performed in cell-free systems, such as may be derived with purified or semi-purified proteins, are often preferred as “primary” screens in that they can be generated to permit rapid development and relatively easy detection of an alteration in a molecular target which is mediated by a test compound. Moreover, the effects of cellular toxicity or bioavailability of the test compound can be generally ignored in the in vitro system, the assay instead being focused primarily on the effect of the drug on the molecular target as may be manifest in an alteration of binding affinity between an ActRIIA polypeptide and activin.</div>

To the mixture of the compound and ActRIIA polypeptide is then added a composition containing an ActRIIA ligand. Detection and quantification of ActRIIA/activin complexes provides a means for determining the compound's efficacy at inhibiting (or potentiating) complex formation between the ActRIIA polypeptide and activin. The efficacy of the compound can be assessed by generating dose response curves from data obtained using various concentrations of the test compound. Moreover, a control assay can also be performed to provide a baseline for comparison. For example, in a control assay, isolated and purified activin is added to a composition containing the ActRIIA polypeptide, and the formation of ActRIIA/activin complex is quantitated in the absence of the test compound. It will be understood that, in general, the order in which the reactants may be admixed can be varied, and can be admixed simultaneously. Moreover, in place of purified proteins, cellular extracts and lysates may be used to render a suitable cell-free assay system.</div>

The interaction between the compound and the ActRIIA or activin polypeptide may be covalent or non-covalent. For example, such interaction can be identified at the protein level using in vitro biochemical methods, including photo-crosslinking, radiolabeled ligand binding, and affinity chromatography (Jakoby W B et al., 1974, Methods in Enzymology 46: 1). In certain cases, the compounds may be screened in a mechanism based assay, such as an assay to detect compounds which bind to an activin or ActRIIA polypeptide. This may include a solid phase or fluid phase binding event. Alternatively, the gene encoding an activin or ActRIIA polypeptide can be transfected with a reporter system (e.g., β-galactosidase, luciferase, or green fluorescent protein) into a cell and screened against the library preferably by a high throughput screening or with individual members of the library. Other mechanism based binding assays may be used, for example, binding assays which detect changes in free energy. Binding assays can be performed with the target fixed to a well, bead or chip or captured by an immobilized antibody or resolved by capillary electrophoresis. The bound compounds may be detected usually using colorimetric or fluorescence or surface plasmon resonance.</div>

Leuk Res. 2011; 35(1):12-13). Anemia and red blood cell (RBC) transfusion dependence (TD) are independent adverse prognostic and predictive variables for survival among these patients (Passamonti F, et al. Blood. 2010; 115(9):1703-1708; Elena C, et al. Haematologica. 2011; 96(1):167-170).</div>

Am J Hematol. 2014; 89(7):766-770; Suragani R N, et al. Nat Med. 2014; 20(4):408-414). Luspatercept acts as an erythroid maturation agent by binding specific transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily ligands such as growth differentiation factor-11 (GDF11), blocking their inhibitory effect, and leading to increased RBC production (Suragani R N, et al. Nat Med. 2014; 20(4):408-414). In a recent phase 2 study, luspatercept was shown to be effective and well tolerated for the treatment of anemia in patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (Platzbecker U, et al.
