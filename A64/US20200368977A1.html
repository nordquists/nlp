<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Fabrication of large composite structures, such as aircraft, often may involve kitting, layup, assembly, and/or curing of elongate composite structures that may be many tens, or even hundreds, of feet long. Fabrication of such elongate composite structures presents unique manufacturing challenges.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Traditional manufacturing methods for fabricating composite structures include manually locating a plurality of plies of composite material on a layup mandrel to produce and/or define a composite layup. The composite layup subsequently is cured, on the layup mandrel, to produce and/or define the composite structure. While such traditional manufacturing methods may be effective at producing smaller composite structures, they may be inefficient when applied to producing larger composite structures. As an example, a manufacturing floor space needed to fabricate large composite structures utilizing traditional manufacturing methods may be substantial. As another example, an amount of time required to fabricate large composite structures utilizing traditional manufacturing methods may be quite large.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">Either of these manufacturing constraints may increase the cost of fabrication of the large composite structure.
