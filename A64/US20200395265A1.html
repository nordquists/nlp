<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">An electronic die can be directly attached to a substrate using solder bumps in flip chip packaging to provide a substantially high interconnect density. This flip chip packaging technology has been widely used in many applications ranging from consumer products to highly sophisticated system in package (SIP) designs, Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), radio frequency (RF) chipsets, PC chipsets, graphics, and memory packages. In addition to solder bumps, stud bumps, solder pastes, copper pillars or other local fixtures are used to in the flip chip packaging technology to couple the electronic die to the substrate electrically and mechanically. An additional potting or adhesive material can also be applied to fully or partially fill a space separating the electronic die and the substrate. However, the local fixtures and additional adhesive material are susceptible to and may be disrupted by mechanical stress caused by a thermal mismatch between the electronic die and substrate. In high frequency RF applications, use of the additional adhesive material may also compromise electrical performance of the RF integrated circuit formed on the electronic die or substrate. Thus, there is a need to couple an electronic die to a substrate in a secure manner while providing reliable electrical performance under different conditions.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Various implementations of systems, methods and devices within the scope of the appended claims each have several aspects, no single one of which is solely responsible for the attributes described herein. Without limiting the scope of the appended claims, after considering this disclosure, and particularly after considering the section entitled “Detailed Description” one will understand how the aspects of various implementations are used to reduce mechanical stress that causes interconnect failures in a flip chip semiconductor package and minimize detrimental factors that compromise electrical performance of any integrated circuits therein. Specifically, in an example, compliant interconnects are applied to replace flip chip interconnects made of copper pillars or solder bumps. The compliant interconnects form a reliable electrical interface while maintaining rigidity and mechanical robustness. Additionally, an external body (e.g., support structure) is applied outside a footprint of a corresponding semiconductor die to secure the semiconductor die to a substrate in the flip chip semiconductor package, thereby avoiding use of potting or adhesive material between the semiconductor and die and protecting performance of integrated circuits in the package from being compromised.</div>
