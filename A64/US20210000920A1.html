<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in humans. Despite advances in diagnosing and treating breast cancer, the prevalence of this disease has been steadily rising at a rate of about 1% per year since 1940. Today, the likelihood that a woman living in North America will develop breast cancer during her lifetime is one in eight. Despite recent advances in early diagnosis and treatment that has significantly improved outcomes, tumor resistance to chemotherapy and metastasis remains significant causes of mortality.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">The presence of hostile tumor microenvironment (TME) has resulted in poor access of the administered drugs to target cells and in tumor escape. The TME includes conditions such as high tissue pressure, hypoxia, nutritional starvation (for example, due to reduced glucose and other metabolites), increased lactate generation and resulting acidosis, increased infiltration of regulatory CD4+ T-cells (T-regs), myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and tumor associated macrophages (TAMs), presence of immunosuppressive cytokines (such as IL-10 and TGF-β), and expression of ligands targeted to immune suppressive receptors expressed by activated T-cells (such as CTLA4 and PD-1), and reduced T-cell proliferation, which helps to create immunosuppressive microenvironment allowing tumors to protect themselves from immune recognition, maintain tolerance, and evade elimination.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex structure that evolves with tumor progression to promote metastatic spread. In solid tumors, 5%-40% of the tumor mass consists of TAMs. TAMs can represent the most abundant immunosuppressive cell population in the tumor microenvironment, recruited by CSF-1 and CCL-2 (MCP-1) (Sica et al. 2006, Eur J Cancer., 42, 717-727).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">Resident macrophages in the breast are important for acting as sensors for tissue damage and maintain tissue homeostasis and immunity. Macrophages are critical mediators of inflammation and important regulators of mammary developmental processes. Balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors is key to the regulation of macrophage function within the TME. During inflammation and tumor development, circulating monocytes are recruited to the site of inflammation and to TME where they adopt a macrophage phenotype dictated by the presence of specific cytokines and growth factors. Once recruited to the tumor microenvironment, macrophages respond to the plethora of stimuli within the TME and differentiate (polarize) into various subsets. In humans, macrophage polarization is a continuum that spans two extremes from the classically activated microbicidal and pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages to the alternatively activated anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive M2 macrophages.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">The M1 macrophages are polarized by interferon gamma (IFNγ) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimuli, and secrete proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-12, reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen (RN), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). The validated cells surface markers of human M1 macrophages include high levels of CD14, C16, CD64, CD86, and HLA-DRα. M1 macrophages generally serve to eliminate pathogens and cells.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">In contrast, M2 macrophages generally produce anti-inflammatory cytokines and are involved in tissue remodeling and repair, angiogenesis, immunosuppression, and recruitment of regulatory T-cells. M2 macrophages can be further divided into M2a, M2b, M2c macrophages. M2a macrophages arise from IL-4 or IL-13 stimuli and release matrix-remodeling cytokines. Elevated expression of CD200R and CD86 are validated cell surface markers of M2a macrophages. M2b macrophages results from the recognition of immune complexes in combination with IL-1β or LPS stimuli and like M2a macrophages, they are involved in wound healing. The immunosuppressive M2c macrophages are the outcome of IL-10, TGFβ, glucocorticoids, or immune complex rich environments. M2c macrophages generate further immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-10 and matrix-remodeling factors such as matrix metalloproteases (MMPs; e.g., MMP-9). Elevated CD163 expression is a validated marker of M2c polarization.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">TAM phenotypes are thought to include a combination of markers typically assigned to the M1 and M2 phenotypes based on transcriptomic studies on TAMs (J. Xue, S. V. Schmidt, J. Sander et al., Immunity, Vol. 40, no. 2, pp. 274-288, 2014). However, the TAMs are typically associated with M2-like polarization state caused by tumor-derived lactic acid or secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13 from the different cells in the TME or B-cell derived immunoglobulins based on their function in the TME (Brady et al. Mediators of Inflammation. Volume 2016 (2016), Article ID 4549676).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">Despite being generally anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive and tumorigenic, attempts are being made to make TAMs tumoricidal and suppress tumor growth by activating immune response (Wynn et al. Nature 2013, 496:445-455). A low ratio of macrophages to CD8+ cells in breast cancers predicts survival suggesting a major role for macrophages in suppressing T cell activity against tumors (Ruffell, B. et al. P.N.A.S. USA. 2012; 109, 2796-2801). Infiltration of tumors by specific leukocyte cell subsets such as CD8+ and memory T-cells have linked to favorable outcomes in different cancers, suggesting that immune engagement can limit cancer growth and spread (Noy R, Pollard J W. Immunity, 2014; 41:49-61). Enhanced T-cell activity in tumors using checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1 has been found to be successful to some extent in clinical trials treating melanoma and lung cancers.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0037]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0038" num="0037">Polarization of macrophages to the M1 phenotype is regulated in vitro by inflammatory signals such as GM-CSF, IFNγ, TNFα, IL-1β and LPS as well as various transcription factors and microRNAs (miRNAs). Interferon regulatory factors determine the phenotype of macrophage polarization. IFNγ polarizes macrophages to M1 phenotype via the interferon regulatory pathway using Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) and STAT1. LPS induces M1 phenotype via the Toll-like Receptor family (such as TLR-4). miRNAs are small non-coding RNA of 22 nucleotides in length that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally, as they affect the rate of mRNA degradation. Several miRNAs have been shown to be highly expressed in M1-polarized macrophages, especially miRNA-155, miRNA-125, miRNA-127, miRNA-17, miRNA-20, miRNA-106a, and miRNA-378. Inhibition of these miRNA are said to reduce M1-polarization.</div>

M1 macrophages secrete proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-12, IL-23, reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by the activity of enzymes NADPH oxidases NOX1 and NOX2, reactive nitrogen species (RN), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) killing cells.

M2 macrophages can be further divided into M2a, M2b, M2c macrophages. M2a macrophages arise from IL-4 or IL-13 stimuli and release matrix-remodeling cytokines (Gunthner and Anders. Mediators of Inflammation. Vol. 2013 (2013), Article ID 731023). IL-4 polarizes macrophages to M2-phenotype using interferon regulatory pathway via IRF4 and STAT6 signaling. Elevated expression of CD200R and CD86 are validated cell surface markers of M2a macrophages. M2b macrophages results from the recognition of immune complexes in combination with IL-1β or LPS stimuli and like M2a macrophages, they are involved in wound healing. The immunosuppressive M2c macrophages are the outcome of IL-10, TGFβ, glucocorticoids, or immune complex rich environments. IL-10 polarizes macrophages to M2-phenotype using STAT3 signaling pathway (Gunthner and Anders. Mediators of Inflammation. Vol. 2013 (2013), Article ID 731023). M2c macrophages generate further immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-10 and matrix-remodeling factors such as matrix metalloproteases (MMPs; e.g., MMP-9). Elevated CD163 expression, ARG1, RETNLB, IL4R, CHIA, CD68 are validated markers of M2c polarization.</div>

Inhibition of these miRNA are said to reduced M2-polarization. Studies have shown that deficiency of the miRNA-processing enzyme DICER results in the repolarization of TAMs to IFNγ-mediated M1-like phenotype characterized by enhanced expression of proinflammatory cytokines and T-cell—recruiting chemokines and that rescue with let-7 partially restores M2-macrophage phenotype (Squadrito and Palma. Cell Cycle. 2016, VOL. 15, NO. 23, 3149-3150). DICER inactivation in TAMs greatly enhanced the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies, namely PD1 checkpoint blockade and CD40 agonistic antibodies, leading to complete tumor regressions in mice. (Id.) Additional markers of M2-macrophages include, but are not limited to, Arginase 1 (Arg1), macrophage scavenger receptors A, B and MARCO, Tie2R+, Grl−, F4/80+, MerTK+, CD206+, and CD200R.</div>

Thus, localized delivery of the therapy, for example, compositions comprising a repolarizing agent or a blockading agent, or both, close to the affected site within the breast milk ducts (breast ducts) is highly desirable. Intraductal administration of such compositions provide a local, effective, easy-to-administer therapy that would obviate the side effects of systemic treatment by reducing systemic exposure to the compositions comprising repolarizing agents and/or blockading agents. This would have the added benefit of reducing the possibility/risk of on-target-off-tumor effect. Local delivery to the breast duct by intraductal administration would reduce transit time, and provide faster exposure of the M2-macrophages in the TME to the compositions thereby, improving cytotoxic activity and efficacy while also reducing the potential for drug inactivation and/or degradation due to shorter transit to M2-macrophages.
