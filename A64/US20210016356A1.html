<div class="abstract" id="p-0001" num="0000">Portable lathes, portable lathe assembly kits, and associated methods. A portable lathe comprises two frame members, a plurality of guide bars, a tool assembly supported by the guide bars, and a feed assembly for translating the tool assembly along the guide bars. The feed assembly includes a first fixed linear feed element, a second fixed linear feed element, a driving rotary feed element, and a driven rotary feed element, and is configured such that rotating the driving rotary feed element translates the tool assembly along the guide bars. A portable lathe assembly kit comprises components of the portable lathe configured to be assembled together to install the portable lathe on a cylindrical workpiece. In some examples, a method of utilizing the portable lathe assembly kit comprises operatively receiving the cylindrical workpiece within the frame members by securing the cylindrical workpiece to a first lathe clamshell subassembly and operatively coupling a second lathe clamshell subassembly to the first lathe clamshell subassembly.</div>

Multiple entities listed with “and/or” should be construed in the same manner, i.e., “one or more” of the entities so conjoined. Other entities may optionally be present other than the entities specifically identified by the “and/or” clause, whether related or unrelated to those entities specifically identified. Thus, as a non-limiting example, a reference to “A and/or B,” when used in conjunction with open-ended language such as “comprising” may refer, in one embodiment, to A only (optionally including entities other than B); in another embodiment, to B only (optionally including entities other than A); in yet another embodiment, to both A and B (optionally including other entities).

A substantial amount of a recited degree or relationship may include at least 75% of the recited degree or relationship. For example, a first direction that is at least substantially parallel to a second direction includes a first direction that is within an angular deviation of 22.5° relative to the second direction and also includes a first direction that is identical to the second direction.</div>

This definition also allows that entities may optionally be present other than the entities specifically identified within the list of entities to which the phrase “at least one” refers, whether related or unrelated to those entities specifically identified.
