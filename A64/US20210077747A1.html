<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to the injection of a sample into a system. The invention lies in the field of chromatography, such as liquid chromatography (LC) and particularly in the field of samplers for High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). HPLC is a method of separating samples into their constituent parts. The sample can be separated for subsequent use, or the portions of the sample can be detected and quantified. More particularly, the present invention relates to a liquid chromatography system, a method performed in such a system and corresponding use of the system.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">LC systems are based on chromatographic separation, where a sample may be separated into a characteristic separation pattern by pumping the sample together with an elution solvent, i.e., the mobile phase, through a chromatographic column which contains a solid, i.e., a stationary phase. Analytes in the mobile phase interact with the stationary phase and depending on the intensity of interaction between the mobile phase and the stationary phase, the analytes are retained to a characteristic degree. As a result, components of the sample exit the separation column after different times depending on the strength of interaction, which time may be referred to as a retention time (RT). In simple words, components of a sample may be separated by means of a separation column whose content interacts differently with the different components of the sample. This determines the time that the components are retained in the separation column, which means that the RT is a characteristic for each component of a sample under given chromatographic conditions.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">In HPLC, the separation of compounds can be influenced by adjusting the composition of the mobile phase over time, and by adjusting the properties of the stationary phase. For instance, the separation accuracy of the column depends on the grain size of the packing material. Even though smaller grain sizes may achieve a better separation, it may result in a large resistance within a fluidic system, which may result in a decreased throughput. To counteract this, the trend in HPLC analyses is towards ever higher pressures. As such, all components of the HPLC system must withstand these higher pressures. In HPLC, a sampler may have the task of managing samples and introducing a defined quantity of a sample into the fluidics of a column at a defined point in time. In some instances, the sampler may use a needle which may be adapted to pick the sample up and then move it into a needle seat, which may subsequently be sealed at high pressures at a needle seat. Thereafter, a valve may switch the sample via the needle and the needle seat into the fluid path to the column.</div>

If the seal member P<b>14</b> is not completely chambered, there will be air gaps P<b>20</b> into which material can be extruded. As soon as the sealing material begins to flow away, the seal member P<b>14</b> becomes leaky as there is no back pressure on the seal member P<b>14</b>. In addition, the sealing member P<b>14</b> presses axially on the tube P<b>12</b>, so that the fluid-carrying bore can be very easily blocked.

The needle seat of US2011247405 may not allow for a stable, high pressure tight operation with a long service life, and it may cause blockage of downstream sections. In addition, components may be misaligned during the process of connecting the components to one another. The needle seat of DE102011075146 may be prone to buckling, and may generally be delicate, also impacting its service life.

</li> <heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0014]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0015" num="0014">In light of the above, it is an object of the present invention to overcome or at least alleviate at least some of the shortcomings and disadvantages of the prior art. That is, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved assembly that is adapted to receive a liquid from a needle, a corresponding sampler, system, method and use. In particular, it may be an object of the present invention to provide an assembly for receiving a liquid from a needle that is improved as regards its pressure tightness, has a relatively small dead volume, and a long service life. Furthermore, it may also be an object of the present invention to provide assemblies which are less prone to blockage, damages and/or contamination by previous runs.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0015]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0016" num="0015">It can also be an object of the present invention to provide a high-pressure resistant needle seat with a low dead volume. This should have a long service life and therefore little wear.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0016]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0017" num="0016">At least some of these objects are met by the present invention.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0017]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0018" num="0017">In a first aspect, the present invention relates to a needle assembly for facilitating connecting a needle and a needle receiving assembly. The needle assembly can comprise a needle and a needle housing. The needle defines an axial direction and a radial direction perpendicular to the axial direction. Moreover, along the axial direction a tip of the needle is more proximal than the rest of the needle. The needle housing comprises a cavity, which is occupied in part by the needle. In addition, the needle housing comprises at least one aligning component configured to increase alignment in the radial direction between the needle and the needle receiving assembly upon contact between the at least one aligning component and the needle receiving assembly.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0018]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0019" num="0018">Thus, the present invention provides a needle assembly with at least one aligning component for facilitating the alignment of the needle with the needle receiving assembly. This has multiple advantages over prior art solutions, e.g., not providing aligning means at all or providing a centering sleeve which can align the needle upon contact with the needle.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0019]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0020" num="0019">As an initial matter, the present invention facilitates bringing the needle into proper alignment with a needle receiving assembly. This can prevent or at least alleviate blockages of the flow path between the needle and the needle receiving assembly. Moreover, the present invention can particularly be advantageous in applications where precise alignment of the needle with the needle receiving assembly is desirable. Typically, a precise alignment of the needle may advantageous if the needle comprises a small diameter. For example, in some application, such as HPLC, the needle may comprise a very small inner diameter, such as, 50 ฮผm. Thus, a deviation of 50 ฮผm or more from the aligned position can completely block the needle, e.g. the needle would face a wall of the needle receiving assembly instead of an opening configured to receive the needle. Typically, in the above example, the deviation should be at most 20 ฮผm, or even better at most 10 ฮผm, best of all 0 ฮผm.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0020]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0021" num="0020">Such precise alignments are generally challenging to be achieved. Alternatively, they may require dedicated and complex actuators for automatically guiding the needle into proper alignment. The present invention can alleviate these issues by providing a needle housing with at least one aligning component. Thus, even if the needle and the needle receiving assembly are misaligned, the at least one aligning component can bring them into proper alignment during the connection between the two. Hence, the needle assembly can make the process of connecting the needle with the needle receiving assembly more ergonomic and manageable for a human user. In addition, the need of precise and complex actuators (e.g. in application wherein the needle is handled automatically) can be alleviated.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0021]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0022" num="0021">Moreover, in many applications, the dead volume following the needle when connected to the needle receiving assembly should be as small as possible. This is particularly advantageous when a high-pressure fluid is expected to flow through the needle, such as, in HPLC systems. As such, to achieve a small dead volume, the needle may also comprise a very small diameter. The smaller the needle and its diameter, the more precise the alignment of the needle with the needle receiving assembly should be. Thus, by facilitated the alignment of the needle, the present invention can allow for the use of small needles, which in turn can facilitate having a small dead volume after the needle. Again, this is particularly advantageous for high-pressure systems, such as, H PLC.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0022]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0023" num="0022">Furthermore, alignment of the needle with the needle receiving assembly is increased upon contact between the at least one aligning component and the needle receiving assembly. Thus, there is no need for the needle to contact other components for aligning purposes. Even more, by providing a needle housing with at least one aligning component, the present invention decreases the likelihood of the needle bumping, stinging, colliding, or pricking on the needle receiving assembly. This can be advantageous because it can avoid damages or abrasion of the needle and/or of the needle receiving assembly which can lead to blockages of the fluid path if not prevented. As such, the present invention may increase the durability of the needle and/or needle receiving assembly.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0023]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0024" num="0023">Further still, aligning the needle using the at least one aligning component of the needle housing, instead of using the needle itself, can be advantageous as it can reduce contamination. This is particularly the case if the needle is used to draw up a sample. In such cases, the tip of the needle is immersed in the sample. As such, a part of the sample can remain on the outer walls of the needle, even after the sample is drawn. If the needle contacts other components, the part of the sample remaining on the walls of the needle can be deposited on the contacted components. This can cause contamination of future samples. In many applications, this is a non-desired effect. The present invention avoids this by instead providing a needle housing with at least one aligning component which decreases the likelihood of the needle bumping, stinging, colliding, or pricking on other components, such as, the needle receiving assembly.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0024]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, the needle housing can comprise an outer lateral surface. In such embodiments, the aligning component of the needle housing can comprise an aligning outer surface that can be formed by at least a portion of the outer lateral surface of the needle housing. In other words, an aligning component (i.e. the aligning outer surface) can be provided on the outer surface of the needle housing. This can be advantageous if a portion of the needle housing can be received by the needle receiving assembly, i.e., if the needle receiving assembly can surround the needle housing, when connected. Thus, during the connection, the needle receiving assembly can contact the outer surface of the needle housing and more particularly the aligning outer surface, which can increase alignment in the radial direction between the needle and the needle receiving assembly.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0025]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, a diameter of cross sections of the aligning outer surface can decrease continuously along the axial direction such that for any two cross sections of the aligning outer surface wherein a first cross section is more proximal than a second cross section, the diameter of the first cross section can be smaller than the diameter of the second cross section. Each cross section of the aligning outer surface is an intersection between the aligning outer surface and a plane perpendicular to the axial direction. In other words, the diameter of the aligning outer surface can be expressed as a function of the position along the axial direction, which function is a strictly decreasing function along the downstream direction. This (i.e. the continuous decrease of the diameter) can facilitate a sliding motion between the needle housing and the needle receiving assembly during the connection. In other words, there can be no section of the aligning outer surface which can resist the needle to be received in the needle receiving assembly. For example, there can be no surface of the aligning outer surface being perpendicular to the axial direction. This can be achieved by the diameter of cross sections of the aligning outer surface decreasing continuously.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0026]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0027" num="0026">The aligning outer surface can comprise a most distal cross-section, which is more distal than the rest of the aligning outer surface, and a most proximal cross section, which is more proximal than the rest of the aligning outer surface. In some embodiments, the diameter of the most distal cross-section of the aligning outer surface can be larger than the diameter of the rest of the cross-sections of the aligning outer surface. Thus, the diameter of the aligning outer surface can continuously increase from the most proximal cross section to the most distal cross section. Hence, the needle housing can comprise more freedom of movement along the radial direction when the most proximal cross section is received in the needle receiving assembly. As the needle housing is received in the needle receiving assembly, its freedom of movement along the radial direction can be decreased. At the same time, alignment in the radial direction can be increased. When the most distal section is received, the freedom of movement can be at minimum, while alignment in the radial direction can be at maximum. For example, if the diameter of the most distal section of the needle housing matches an inner diameter of the needle receiving assembly (wherein the needle housing is received), the freedom of movement along the radial direction of the needle housing can be reduced almost completely.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0027]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, the diameter of the most proximal cross-section of the aligning outer surface can be at least 30%, preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 60% and at most 90%, such as 80% to 85% of the diameter of the most distal cross-section of the aligning outer surface. Typically, the smaller the diameter of the most proximal cross-section relative to the most distal cross-section, the larger the deviation in the radial direction that can be corrected by the aligning outer surface. On the other hand, the larger the diameter of the most proximal cross-section relative to the most distal cross-section, the smaller the force parallel to the axial direction opposing the insertion of the needle housing in the needle receiving assembly can be. In other words, the diameter of the most proximal cross-section and the most distal cross-section can determine the slope of the aligning outer surface. Moreover, determining the slope of the aligning outer surface may involve a trade-off between tolerable deviation in the radial direction and ease of slide between the needle housing and needle receiving assembly. The above dimensions generally provide a good trade-off between the two.</div>

Typically, a large diameter of the distal cross-section of the aligning outer surface can allow for larger deviations of the needle in the radial direction to be corrected. However, this may lead to a bulky needle housing. Thus, there can be a tradeoff between the size of the needle housing and the tolerable misalignment that can be corrected.</div>

For sake of completeness, it will be understood that <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1<i>b </i> </figref>is a longitudinal cross-sectional view of components that are generally rotational-symmetric. Further, it should also be understood that the Figures (unless indicated otherwise) are central longitudinal cross-sectional views, i.e., longitudinal cross sections including the central axis. Thus, the โpointsโ P<b>1</b> and P<b>1</b>โฒ are points on a circular line, and it should be understood that when these points are discussed in this specification, the points in the longitudinal cross-sectional view are meant. Further, the โpointsโ P<b>1</b> and P<b>1</b>โฒ and the corresponding circular line including these points are defined as the section on the aligning inner surface <b>2044</b>B being located at the same height in the axial direction as the most proximal section of the needle receiving assembly <b>100</b> when the needle assembly <b>200</b> is fully inserted in the needle receiving assembly <b>100</b>.

The distal diameter of the aligning inner surface <b>2044</b>B can correspond to the diameter of the most proximal surface of the needle receiving assembly <b>100</b> or can be slightly larger than the most proximal diameter of the needle receiving assembly <b>100</b>. As will be understood, if the distal diameter would be significantly larger than the distance between points P<b>1</b> and P<b>1</b>โฒ a proper alignment between the needle <b>202</b> and the needle receiving assembly <b>100</b> cannot be guaranteed.
