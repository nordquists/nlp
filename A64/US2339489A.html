<div class="description-paragraph">lCOMPOSITE BUILDING PANELS Filed Feb. 11, 1941 3 She'ets-Sheet 3 Patented Jan. 18, 1944 UNITED STATES PATENT OFFICE This invention relates to new and useful improvements in composite building wall panels and a method of making the same. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It is among the objects thereof to provide a wall panel of a composite structure having a facing material in the form of individual cut-out slabs attached thereto, to simulate brick or stone. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Heretofore, composite wall panels have been formed of fibrous material coated with a mastic material having crushed refractory particles sprinkled thereon, and having motor joints embossed therein. p </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> By employing a base material of suitable insulating and weatherproong properties and mounting a surfacing material of a different color and more weather-resisting properties on one side thereof, a product of superior quality and better appearance can be produced. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The invention will become more apparent from a description of the accompanying drawings constituting a part hereof in which like reference characters designate like parts, and in which: </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Fig. 1 is a View in perspective of a building wall panel embodying the principles of this invention; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Fig. 2 a View in perspective of a, combined punching die and pressure plate; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Fig. 3 a view in perspective of a female die; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Fig. 4 a View in perspective of a base board of which the panel is formed; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Fig. 5 a side elevational vieW of a portion of a wall employing panels simulating stone; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Fig. 6 a vertical cross-section of a panel board and male and female die, and sheet material from which the surface material is formed; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Fig. 7 a similar View; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Fig. 8 a vertical cross-section taken on the line 8-8,Fig. 6; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Fig. 9 a side elevational View diagrammatically illustrating a method of forming building-Wall panels in accordance with the present invention by continuous process; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Fig. 10 an end elevational view partially cut away of a cutting die; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Fig. 11 an exploded view partially in section and partially in front elevation of the assembled panel and the forming and cutting roll; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Fig. 12 an end elevational view of a combined pressure and heating roll; and </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Fig. 13 an exploded view of the finished panel in cross-section and the pressure and heating roll in front elevation partially cut away. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">asphalt or other adhesive substance made of a neutral or synthetic resin or glue. The numeral y 3, Fig. 1, designates rectangular slabs which have been punched from sheet 4, as shown in Figs. 6 </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">" and '1. The sheet material 4 may be any mate- With reference to Figs. 1 to 8 of the drawings, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">the numeral I designates the base board which may be compressed brous material treated with rial of a non-metallic base that is preferably of a character to be formed in sheets, as the sheet 4, so that when acted upon by a punch or cutting die, it will shear and be deposited on the adhesive material 2. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, a combined punch and forming die consisting of a platen 5 having slots 6 dividing it into block '1, some of which are provided with serrations or grooves 8, is adapted to cooperate with a punch block 9 having spaces IU corresponding to the block 'I of the male die member. These are mounted in a press, as shown in Figs. 6 to 8, in which the platen 5 is secured to a movable frame or ram II, and the punch block 9 is mounted in side frames I2. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The base material I is fed into the press between guide rollers I3 with the mastic 2 applied to the upper surface thereof. The sheet material 4 is fed between the platen 5 and punch block 9 between guide rollers I4, and by lowering the ram or frame 5 the blocks 3 are punched out of the sheet 4 through the punch block 9 and deposited on the mastic material 2 of the base sheet I, this operation being shown in Figs. 6 and '7. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> As appears from Fig. 7, the platen 5 not only acts to punch out the blocks or slabs 3, but presses the same into the adhesive substance which ows between the blocks, as shown at I5, Fig. 7. By employing an adhesive material 2 of a suitable color, diiferent from the color of the slab, the material flowing in the joints I5 produces a contrast simulating mortar joints between the slabs or stone, as the case may be. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> By making the slab material 3 in color of, asbestos or other fibers or fillers, with a suitable binder such as magnesium cement or a plastic resin, highly ornamental effects are obtainable, and various color effects may be thus produced. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The corrugations 8 of the punch block 5 form serrations having the appearance of a .rough surface cutting on some of the slabs, as appears from the panel of Fig. l. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The stone effect may be produced in various colors by passing the panel under a series of dies, blocking out different colored materials forming a staggered color effect in the finished panel. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> As shown in Fig. 1, the edges of the base panel I, are cut away to form shoulders I6 on the ends, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">shoulders l1 at the upper side, and is similarly cut away on the opposite side of the panel to form a shoulder I8 and a shoulder on the end opposite the shoulder I6, so that by joining the panels with their shoulders abutting, proper spacing of the slabs 3 is maintained in the assembled wall. j </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Still another method of producing the composite panel described in Figs. l to 8 inclusive is illustrated in Figs. 9 to 13 of the drawings, and will now be described. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The base panels I, having been coated with a mastic material 2, Fig. 9, are fed over a plurality of roll conveyors 20 to a combined forming and cutting drum 2| shown in Figs. 10 and 11. This drum may or may not be heated on the interior thereof. It is provided with annular and longitudinal projections 22 and 23, respectively, on which are mounted cutting blades 24 and 25. The sheet material 4 from which the slabbing is made is fed from the treating and drying apparatus over guide rolls 26 and 21, the latter acting to press the sheet 4 on the mastic material 2. The joined sheets then pass between the forming and cutting drum 2i and a supporting drum 2id, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">the members 22 and 23 forming longitudinal and transverse grooves 22a and 23a. The cutting knives 24 cutting through the sheet 4 into the mastic material 2 are shown in Fig. 11. The grooved and slotted material then passes into a heated pressure roll 'M5a shown in Figs. 12 and 13, the drum 26 having annular and transverse projections 2'!El and 28 corresponding to the projections 22 and 23 of drum 2I`. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Roll 26 is heated by steam or gas name on the interior thereof and acts upon the sheet material passing therebeneath to further press the slabs 3 into the mastic substance 2, and by the pressure and heat causes the mastic material 2 to ow through the slots formed by the cutting blades 24 into the grooves, partially filling the grooves as shown by the numeral 29, Fig. 13. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Here again, by using contrasting materials, a mortar joint effect is produced. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Although several embodiments of the invention have been herein illustrated and described, it will be evident to those skilled in the art that various modifications may be made in the details of construction without departing from the principles herein set forth. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> I claim: 1. The method of making composite building wall panels which consists in coating one surface 1'5 of a sheet material with a thermoplastic adhesive material, joining a surface sheet to said adhesive material, subjecting the joined sheets to external pressure, embossing grooves in said surface sheet material to simulate jointsof .building blocks and perforatingl the surface material and simultaneously heating the same to cause the adhesive material to flow through the perforations of the surface material to cover the base of the grooves formed therein. 2. The method of forming composite building wall panels which comprises coating a surface of p a sheet material with a thermoplastic adhesive material, applying a surface sheet to said adhesive material, subjecting the joined sheet mate- 30 rials to external pressure, embossing longitudinal and transverse grooves in the surface material to simulate building blocks, perforating the grooves in said surface material and subjecting said embossed sheet to the action of heatand pressure to initially cause theadhesive material to ow through the perforations in the grooves of the surface material and finally fuse said adhesive material to a solid state. </div>
