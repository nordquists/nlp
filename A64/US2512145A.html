<div class="description-paragraph">IAVEATOR. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> A64 1 Fa/z/ BY I Patented June 20, 1950 COLLAPSIBLE SHIPPING CRATE Asa J. Ford, Kansas City, Kans., assignor of-onehalf to John T. Sexton, Kansas City, Mo. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Application August 10, 1946, Serial No. 689,719 </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">6 Claims. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> This invention relates to packing structure particularly adaptable for encasing various types of articles for transportation and especially to shipping crates of .a collapsible nature having interconnecting means as a part thereof permitting quick assembling and disassemblying without manipulation of complicated parts. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The primary object of this invention is to provide a collapsible shipping crate having a number of separable sections, which when operably interconnected form a polygonal structure that is light in weight, capable of withstanding excessive stresses and pressures, and that is easily constructed and inexpensive to manufacture. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> An important object of this invention is the provision of a collapsible shipping crate having a platform formed of a number of beams joined by a series of spaced apart cross-bars, all of which beams and cross-bars are formed in a channel-like manner to provide raised, underlying supports for the crate and to present an effective and sturdy means for fastening loop members at the ends thereof to cooperate with hooks on the side walls of the crate when the same is placed in an assembled condition. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Another object of this invention is to provide a shipping crate that includes aplatform having a number of U-shaped loops extending outwardly from the periphery thereof, and side walls, each having corresponding hook members for each of the loops, which hooks are formed by rebending the free ends thereof whereby a quickly releasable, interlocking assembly is -presented that is capable of maintaining the crate in an assembled condition and adapted to permit collapsing the walls for storage or shipment in a superimposed, stacked relation. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> A further .object of this invention is to provide ina shipping crate having the aforesaid platform, side Walls and interlocking assembly, a top wall having a number of overlapping flaps for holding at least two of thewalls in spaced apart relation at the uppermost edgesthereof, and means giherent in those side walls for receiving the aps. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> A still further object of this invention is to provide a collapsible shipping crate having outturned flanges at the upper and lower edges of the side walls thereof to maintain the aforementioned interlocking means in rigid interengagement, and to present a tight fit between the said flaps and the'side walls that they overlap. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Other objects of this invention include the unique construction of the sections forming the walls of the .crateas well as many other objects 2 that will become apparent throughout the following specification, referring to the accompanying drawings wherein: </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Figure '1 is a perspective view of a collapsible shipping crate made in accordance with the present invention. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Fig. 2 is a cross-sectional view taken on line II--II of Fig. 1. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Fig. 3 is a cross-sectional view taken on line III.-II'I of Fig. 1; and </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Fig. 4 is a cross-sectional view taken on line IVIV of Fig. 1. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The walls forming the enclosed, polygonal crate illustrated in Fig. 1, comprise a number of separable and independently constructed sections, which when completely assembled, present a bottom wall or platform I0, a pair of side walls l2 and [4, a pair of end walls l6 and I8 and a top wall 20. Each of the six walls just described is constructed in a substantially like manner in that none are completely solid but comprise a number of spaced-apart members to present a light weight structure capable of packing material needing a maximum amount of ventilation. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The side walls I2 and I4 andthe end walls l6 and [8 are substantially identical, each including a number of spaced-apart, upright members or studs 22 and a number of cross-bars 24 that are also disposed in spaced-apart relation and welded or otherwise fixed to the studs 22. Each of the studs 22 comprises a U-shaped portion 26 and a pair of laterally extending flanges 28 on each side of portion 26. The cross-bars 24 lie flatly against the flanges 28 to present a partially closed channel throughout the length of studs 22, the ends of which are open. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> All of the members forming the platform I. have the same cross-sectional contour as the stud members 22, just described, and consist of a number of beams 30, spaced apart as in clear in Fig. 1, and disposed with the channel portion thereof opening upwardly to present a number of legs formed by the outer faces of U-shaped portions 32 thereof. These beams 30 have their ends open in the same manner as studs 22 and are joined by a number of cross-bars 34 formed in the-same manner butdisposed with the channel thereof opening downwardly where the flanges 36 and 38 of the beams 30 and the crossbars 34 respectively are contiguous and held together by spot welding or otherwise fusing the same to form the complete section III. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Extending outwardly from each end of all the beams .30 and the cross-bars 34 of the platform I is a U-shaped loop 40, the legs whereof straddle the outer wall of the U -shaped portions 32 thereof and are fixed thereto. A number of hook members 42 on each of the studs 22 of the sides I2 and I4 and the end walls 16 and I8 cooperate with respective loops 40 to provide an interlocking attachment of the side and end walls to platform "I. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> These hook members 42 are fixed to the bottom wall of the channel formed in the studs 22 and extend from the lowermost, open end thereof to terminate in a rebent portion 44 after first passing through its corresponding loop 40. i </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The lowermost cross bar 24 of each wall I2, l4, l6 and I8 is turned outwardly at its bottom edge as at 46 to a point partially covering the open end of studs 22 for presenting a firm support of the walls on the platform Ill and to add support to the hooks 42 if breaking away from the studs 22 should begin. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The top wall isformed of a number of bars 48 and 50 respectively disposed in crossed relation and joined together as shown in' Fig. 1 The bars 50 are in alignment-with the studs 22 of side walls l2 and M respectively and the ends thereof are turned down to present a flap 52extending into the uppermost, open end of each respective stud 22. The uppermost cross bar" 24 of 'each wall l2 and I4 is turned outwardly to present a flange 54 in the same manner as at 46 with respect to the lower bar 24; When the top wall 20 is .pla'ced in position therefore, the flaps '52 are disposed between the flange 54 and studs 22 and lateral displacement of the side walls l2 and i4 is prevented. An L-shaped member 56 fixed to each side walls l2 and I4 and near each end thereof prevents outward movement of the end walls l6 and I8 when the crate is filled for shipment. Any suitable means for tying the top 20 securely in place maybe used if such is found desirable or additionalbinding around'the entire crate utilized in the usual manner. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It is clear from the foregoing that by removing thetop wall 20, the entire assembly may becollapsed by swinging all the side and end walls outwardly until the hooks 42 and the loops 40 may be disengaged. All the separate sections of the crate may be then stacked together and tied into their legs'disposed 'at' the line of joinder between portions 32 and corresponding flange portions 35 and 38 respectively. Thus, the flange portion 46 of the lowermost cross-bar 24 of each end section I6 and I8 rests directly on the legs of underlying loop members 4ll, "'and the inner faces of said lowermost cross-bar 24 are in abutting relation with the ends of the cross-bar's 34 respectively. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This feature in cooperation with the interlocking loop and hook members 40 and 42 prevents inward movement of the end members 16 and I8. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The formof the platform ID as above described wherein the beams 30 raise the crates above the surface of the floor is its adaptability for use with finger lifts as are commonly used in warehouses and by shipping companies. The fingers of sucha lift are easily moved under the crate between the beams 30 to a position for engaging the series of cross bars 34 whereby the entire crate and its contentscan be movedabout or several crates stacked one on another for storage. Obviously in many types of goods wherein the side walls are not needed for support and where the goods are relatively durable in nature, the platform Ill may be used as a pallet as is common where finger lifts are employed. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In any event, whether or not platform Ill is so used as a pallet and the goods stacked in superimposed pallet loads, the crate may be filled and emptied more conveniently withthe walls of the crate entirely removed. After a number of articles sufiicient to fill a crate are placed in position, the side and end walls and the top are subsequently placed in assembled position. Conversely, when the crate reaches its destination the sections may be all removed and then the goods taken from the platform 10, or the same bodily lifted by a finger lift to a point of storage. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The length of the flaps 52 on the top section 20 is such as to permit the same to pass into respective loop members '40 when'the sections are stacked in superimposed relation with'the end walls 16 and I8 and the side walls l2 and I4 interposed between the top 20 and the bottom Hl'for holdingthe entire assembly in a compact bundle when reshipment is made. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It is contemplated that the crate just describe be used primarily for fire brick and the same has been designed in a strong and durable manner with that end in view. Obviously many other types of articles may be accommodated by the crate however and all the advantages above set forth will nevertheless emanate from its use in such manner. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> While a large number of advantages have been set forth, it is understood that those made possible by the formation of a collapsible shipping crate as herein illustrated and described are contemplated hereby. It is therefore desired to be limited only by the spirit of the invention and the scope of the appended claims. </div>
