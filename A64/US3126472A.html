No. 118,823 19 Claims. (El. 219124) This invention relates to a contour welding machine and is particularly directed to a method and a machine for making Welds of irregular contour. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and a machine for welding irregular contours with mechanical controls to provide, rst a constant linear welding speed along the weld contour; second, a constant angle of torch to the weld contour; and, third, a constant angle of weld line to horizontal. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> lt is a further objective to meet the requirements of a welding machine for irregular contours by a mechanism having a variable speed of part rotation, a variable horizontal torch position and a variable vertical torch position, all of these variables being controlled by simple cams mathematically designed in accordance with a particular part. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It is another object of the invention to provide a machine which has an adjustable axis of rotation so that the torch position can be shifted relative to the work part and also a machine which can be provided with a double support for a work part such as an adjustable tailstock which is optionally available when required. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It is a further object to provide a machine of the type described which can be readily adapted to various parts by a change of the control cams. </div>

<div class="description-paragraph"> FIGURE 10, a view of a work part of arbitrary design illustrating the theory of the cam design construction. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">General Theory of Machine Referring, first of all, to FIGURE l0 where there is shown an arbitrary part contour, a completely arbitrary center of rotation C is chosen on the part. The part is to be rotated about this center at some variable rate, and this rate depends entirely upon the contour of the part and is determined in the following manner. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> First, consider that the arbitrary curve has selected points P1, P2, P2, etc. which are equally spaced and at each of these points tangent lines T1, T2, T3, etc. are drawn. The angles between the adjacent tangent lines can then be labeled a1, a2, a3, etc. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It Will be seen that during the time interval that the weld has progressed from point P1 to P2, the part must rotate through the angle a1. This is to meet the requirements of constant angle of weld line to horizontal. Dur- 3,126,472 Patented Mar. 24, 1964 ing the identical time interval that the weld progresses from P2 to P3, the part must rotate through the angle a2. The time intervals are identical because of an assumed constant weld speed and identity of distance from point to point. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Since it is an object to keep the weld plane in a constant attitude to the torch, and since the successive angles are not necessarily equal although the time intervals are, the speed of rotation is varied. It will be plain that the sharper the curvature, the faster must be the speed of rotation. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In the case of a straight line, the rotation actually stops; and in the case of a concave curve, the rotation actually reverses. Thus, it is clear that the speed of rotation is a function only of the curvature of the part. In addition, of course, the torch must move vertically and horizontally as required to maintain constant welding speed. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The contour may be divided into a group of segments, each segment consisting of a straight line or a circular arc. If the radius of any arc is defined as r, and the speed of rotation as w, then the speed of rotation during any particular segment is: w=K/r, where K is a constant governed by the actual welding speed desired in inches per minute. In other words, the speed of rotation at any time is inversely proportional to the radius of the segment being welded. Stated another way, the speed of rotation at any point is proportional to the curvature of the part at that point. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It should be noted that the lineal welding speed may be held constant in the design of the machine as described above, or alternately a predetermined variation may be designed in, simply by varying K from segment to segment as may be desired. This technique can also be used with completely circular parts to increase or decrease the welding speed during welding. This situation has arisen where it is desired to build up the weld thickness by slowing down in critically stressed areas. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Once the relationship of part position to speed of rotation is established, the other two variables are then determined. It is known that the weld point progresses along the weld path at a uniform rate. It is also known that the angular position of the part progresses at a predetermined variable rate. Therefore, the part position is known at any time as well as the torch position on the part at any time. Accordingly, the torch position relative to the machine at any given instance can be determined, and, by plotting successive positions of the horizontal and vertical torch locations, the cam contours required to achieve t these locations are found. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The foregoing is a graphical method of cam design for vertical and horizontal movement or offset. Another method involves only an analytical procedure. As stated above, the instantaneous rate of rotation is inversely proportional to the radius of curvature at the point being welded. Now if the center of curvature of the part at that point coincided with the center of rotation, the torch position would not need to change. This is the case with a circular part. lf the center of curvature of the part does not coincide with the center of rotation, the torch must move vertically or horizontally or both. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The total movement of the part may be considered as consisting of two superimposed movements. The first component is an imaginary angular movement about the center of curvature at the angular rate that the part is actually rotating about the center of rotation. The second component would be an imaginary translation of this center of curvature along an arc whose center is the center of rotation, whose radius is the distance between center of curvature and center of rotation, at a velocity equal to the center to center distance multiplied by the angulartvelocity of the part. The sum of these two components is, of course, equal to the rotation of the part about the center of rotation. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Now consider the movement of the torch necessitated by the component of part rotating about center of curvature. The torch movement is zero. The second component is a translation of this center of rotation. Obviously, the torch movement must be equal to this translation. Otherwise, the torch would increase or decrease its distance from the part, which is not allowable. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The foregoing can be seen intuitively. It can be proven rigorously by vector analysis. The simple conclusions reached are as follows: </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> (l) The instantaneous speed of rotation is equal to the linear weld speed divided by the radius of curvature at that instant. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> (2) The instantaneous movement of the torch is along a path parallel to and at a velocity equal to the movement of center of curvature about the center of rotation. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Additionally, an axial cam (not shown) can be used to move the torch along an axis parallel to the axis of rotation. With this addition, the machine is capable of making a three-dimensionalrweld at constant welding speed. In this application, the basic derivations described above remain valid provided only that the threedimensional contour is projected into the plane of rotation. In so doing the linear weld speed desired is broken down into two components, one in the plane of rotation which is used in the analysis described above, the other parallel to the axis of rotation which is used to generate the axial cam. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Diagrammatic FIG URES 8 and 9 Referring now to the machine design, reference is specically made to the simplified diagrammatic presentations of FIGURES 8 and 9 for any given work piece 20 as shown in FIGURE 8. There is a work mounting on a shaft 22 connected to the internal gear 22a and planetary gear set 24 with a sun gear 26 driven through a shaft 28 which carries a speed cam 30, power arriving through a shaft 32, worm gear 34 and a drive gear 36. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It will be seen that the actual output to the work piece will be the result of the rotation of the sun gear 26 as modified by the rotation of the planetary gear set 24 on the planetary carrier 38 which is mounted in bearings on the sun gear shaft 28. The planetary carrier is controlled by a rack bar 40 actuated by linkage 42 and 44 controlled by a cam follower rod 46. If the planetary carrier is moved in the same direction as the sun gear, while the sun gear 26 moves at a constant velocity, the output shaft slows down. On the other hand, if the planetary carrier moves in the opposite direction of the sun gear, the output shaft speeds up. The planetary set, therefore, is the means of obtaining a variable speed output from a constantly rotating input shaft and a cam-generated planetary carrier movement. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The simplified diagram, FIGURE 8, is only intended to illustrate the principle of variable speed control through a cam driven planetary carrier. With the planetary carrier stationary, there is a reduction of 2:1 between the driving sun gear and the driven internal gear. Therefore in the actual machine, a compensating fixed 2:1 gear ratio is inserted between the sun gear and cam shaft. This is omitted in FIGURE 8 for clarity. The succeeding description is based on the inclusion of this fixed 2:1 ratio. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Regardless of speed variations during rotation, it is evident that one complete revolution of the output shaft takes place during one complete revolution of the cam shaft. Since, at the end of one revolution the cam is at the same place as at the beginning of a revolution, the cam obviously produces no change between the beginning and end points of a complete revolution. Since one complete revolution of the output or quill shaft takes place in one complete revolution of the cam shaft, it is further evident that the average speed of the quill shaft is the i about these points as centers. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">same as the speed of the cam shaft (which rotates at constant speed). At any point during a given revolution, the quill shaft may be either ahead of or behind its average speed. The angle that it is ahead of or behind the cam shaft is controlled by the position of the planetary gear carrier. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The linear rate of weld along the weld line is constant. The rate of cam shaft rotation is constant. Therefore, the two are proportional. Since the cam shaft makes a complete revolution while the complete traverse of the weld line is made, it follows that the cam shaft makes 360 divided by total weld length in inches degrees of rotation per inch of weld. Therefore, the cam position at any point on the weld line is calculated by the simple relationship: </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Degrees of Cam Rotation: </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 360 Weld IQIIgih to pollltxm This is defined as the cam angle. There is a definite cam angle for every point on the Weld line. There is also a definite quill angle for every point on the weld line. This quill angle is such that the tangent to the weld point is horizontal. (Horizontal is relative only since it changes as the machine is tilted backwards.) These angles are geometric properties of the part being welded. For any given point, the difference between quill angle and cam angle is the differential angle of that point. The differential angle is the amount that the quill shaft leads or lags the cam shaft. The speed cam is generated from a table made up of a list of cam angles against quill angles for a succession of arbitrarily spaced points around the weld line. When the cam angles are subtracted from the corresponding quill angles, the differential angles result. These differential angles plotted against the cam angle give the speed cam outline. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Mechanically, the speed cam drives a follower rod 46 which, through two arms 42, 44 on a torque shaft 43, drives a rack in mesh With a gear on the O.D. of the planetary pinion carrier. The arm ratio on the torque shaft is, for example, in the ratio of 5:8. For example, a 1 rise of the cam causes Ya 1" movement of the roller rod. This in turn causes an 8/5 or 1.6 movement of the rack in mesh with the gear on the O D. of the pinion carrier. When this gear has a pitch diameter of 6", this rack movement causes an angular movement of the planetary carrier of 30.56. The ratio of planetary carrier movement to output shaft is 2:3. Accordingly, the output shaft is moved forward 45.8 per inch rise of the speed cam. Stated another way, one degree advance of the outputtshaft requires a cam rise of 1/45.8=.02182". Y It is this constant which is used -to convert differential angle to cam rise. Take a cam base circle with a 5" radius and a follower roller with a radius of .375". Therefore, to lay out the cam, we plot points on the cam angle lines (5.375 l-.02182 diif. angle) inches away from the center of the cam and draw circles of .375 radius The envelope of these circles is the cam contour. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It is also necessary to have a horizontal or offset motion and a vertical motion of the welding head or torch. In connection with vertical movement if a circular part is being welded, the torch need not move up or down at all. However, in the case of a non-circular part, there must be a vertical compensation again generated by a cam. f </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In FIGURE 9 it will be seen that the welding torch 48 is carried by a head 5th which is vertically movable on slides 52 and horizontally movable on slides 54. The horizontal movement is controlled by a cam 60 which drives a cam follower 62 acting through linkage A64, 66 and 68 to act on the basic head unit 5t). The vertical motion of the welding head is controlled through a plate 70 which rests on a cam follower 72 on link 74 con- LA trolled by a torque bar 76, another link 78 and a cam follower rod 80 which rides against a vertical control cam 90. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> For offset motion, i.e., horizontal, assuming that the weld is made at 12 oclock position, the weld point would be directly above the center of rotation when a circular part is welded. No offset motion is required for this type of part. When a non-circular part is welded, the welding head must shift horizontally to provide for constant welding speed. This motion is positive if in the direction of quill rotation, and negative if against it. Cam 60 provides for this motion in a way that a rise in the cam produces a movement of the offset slide in the direction of the quill movement. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> During the course of a complete traverse the torch passes through a point of offset at least twice. These points may be termed null points. It will be noted that at a null point the center of are, center of rotation and weld point lie in a straight line. With these points in mind the offset can be determined with the following formula: </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Oifset=R2 sin (quill angle-quill null angle) with R2 defined as equal to the distance from the center of rotation to the center of the arc. Graphically, the offset at a given point may be determined by constructing a normal to the curve at that point and measuring the perpendicular distance from that point to the center of rotation (FIGURE l0). </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> For vertical motion, as stated, in the case of a noncircular part, the torch must move up and down during the weld. A quill shaft rotates at a varying speed as described. In the case of a straight line section it actually stops. Furthermore, in case of a concave section, the quill actually rotates backwards. The vertical cam 90 is mounted on the cam shaft 28 which always rotates in the folward direction at a constant speed. The construction of the vertical cam based on the mathematics of FIGURE 10, and keeping in mind the null angle position is: </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Vertical risezRl-l-RZ cos (quill angle-quill null angle) where R2 is equal. to the distance from center of rotation to the center of arc, and R1 is the radius of the arc. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Construction of Machine In FIGURE 1 the base of the machine is shown at 1110 having spaced trunnion arms 102 with trunnion bearings 104 horizontally disposed to carry the entire load of the welding machine. A solid weldment housing 106 is trunnioned on the bearings 164 for movement on the horizontal axis. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Projecting forward from this weldment are two heavy support tubes 1198 and 111) which extend to the right as shown in FIGURE 1. On the right-hand or extending end of these tubes is mounted a slidable tailstock assembly 112 controlled by a crankwheel 114. This tailstock assists in the support of a part having Ia longitudinal extent such as shown at 116 in dotted lines. Extending from the trunnion housing 106 is a support tube 120 buttressed by gusset plates 122 to support a rear assembly 124 on which is slidably mounted a welding head arm 130. This entire assembly is rotatable on a horizontal axis back and forth to permit control of the weld point with respect to any particular part. This motion can be controlled by a lead screw (not shown) The welding head arm 130 carries a shiftable welding head assembly 132 which has a welding rod holder tool 134 at the work. This welding head assembly has an arcuate adjustment on the welding head 13) in conventional arrangement and the details of feeding the weld rod and the flux are also conventional. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In connection with the operation of the machine it is' essential that the welding head 130 have a horizontal and vertical motion with respect to the basic support housing 124. As previously described, the horizontal movement is sometimes referred to as the offset motion. Accordingly, the head is mounted on a frame 138 which in turn is mounted on horizontal slide bars and 142 (FIGURE 5 there being suitable protective covers 144 at the ends of the slides to protect the bearing surfaces. A horizontal counterbalance cylinder 146 is associated with the slide 130 to reduce the amount of energy required to shift the slide. The head 130 is associated with the frame 138 through vertical slide bars 151) and 152 mounted on the frame 138 and a vertical counterbalance mechanism 154 is provided again to facilitate the ease of motion of the head 130. Again suitable dust protector bellows 156 can be applied to the end of the bearing rods. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The mechanism for actuating the head 130 originates in a cam shaft 160 (FIGURES 1 and 4) at the rear of the machine, this shaft carrying a spindle speed cam 30, a horizontal or offset feed cam 60 and a vertical control cam 90. This cam shaft 160 is connected to the work spindle 162 through a double planetary gear set. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The first planetary gear set indicated generally at 164 has a function of changing the ratio of speed between the intermediate shaft 174 and the cam shaft 160. It will be seen that the power from motor 166 comes from a motor shaft 16S through suitable gearing or belting 169 to a worm gear shaft 17), this driving the worm gear 172 associated with the intermediate shaft 174. Normally, there is a 2 to l reduction between the cam shaft 160 and the spindle so that the rear planetary seat is locked up and all the cams operate at a speed twice the average speed of the output or spindle shaft. This is suitable for symmetrical parts. If a non-symmetrical part is being run, it is necessary to have a 1 to l ratio between the cam shaft and the spindle and the planetary gear set 164 when unlocked provides this 1 to 1 ratio. The forward planetary gear set performs the function of the set shown in FIG- URE 8. The center gear 176 (FIGURE 4) driven by the shaft 174 and the worm gear 172 is located inside the planetary pinions 178 on the carrier 130, the carrier having external gear teeth at 182 which engage the teeth of a rack bar 134 (FIGURE 5) which is suitably mounted for horizontal sliding motion in bearings 186. This bar 184 compares with the bar 40 of FIGURE 8. The bar 184 is controlled by a link 188 on a speed control torque bar 19t) which has a cam follower link 192 engaging cam 30. The cam follower element 194 is mounted on a rod 196 which slides in a cylinder 198 (FIGURE 5) under the bias of a spring 204i or any suitable fluid biasing device to keep the follower in contact with the cam. Each of the cam followers will have a similar device as shown by the housings 202 and 21M (FIGURE 2). The contours, therefore, of the speed cam 30 will reiiect in the horizontal motion of the rod 184 which controls the position of the planetary carrier 1S@ and thus reflects on the speed of the output shaft 162 geared to the planetary carrier. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The offset or horizontal control for the slide 130 originates at the cam 60 which has a follower roller 210 on a link 212 secured to the horizontal control torque bar 214 suitably mounted in bearings and having a riser link 216 carrying an adjustable follower mechanism 218 having a roller 221B which acts in a groove 222 on supporting frame 133. A screw 224 controls the position of cam follower 220 (FIGURE 5) the cam follower 218 being slidable in a frame 226 formed in the riser link 216. Thus, motion of the follower on cam 60 will be reflected in the motion of the follower 22@ which will actuate the frame 138 horizontally carrying with it the head 130. This mechanism produces a variable ratio between the horizontal control torque bar and the horizontal slide, and is used for such times as link 254 is used as explained below. In such cases this variable ratio permits adjustment for the desired factor of proportionately between offset movement and speed cam profile. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The Vertical motion of the head 130 is controlled by the cam 90 which has a follower mechanism 230 on a link 232 depending from the vertical control torque bar 234 which extends through suitable mounting bearings 236 to a point adjacent the work mounting where a link 233 with a follower 240 bears against the lower surface of a vertical support plate 242. Plate 242 is mounted in dependent relation to the welding head 130. Thus rotation of the cam 90 transmits the proper vertical motion through the follower 23d and the torque control rod 234 to the follower 24th where it reects in the vertical motion of the head 130 on the vertical slide shafts 150 and 152. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In FIGURE the dotted linkage slightly below center of the view comprises a link 25@ on the speed torque control rod 190 and a link 252 on the horizontal control rod 214, these links being tied together by a vertical link element 254. In certain circumstances, it is possible to link the horizontal torque bar with the speed control barv utilizing a single cam for their operation, thus avoiding the necessity of one cam in the assembly. When this is done, the links 25) and 252 are connected by link 254; otherwise link 254 is removed. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Operation of the Device' The entire trunnion assembly may be hoisted to a certain angle through a link 260 controlled by a motor 262 through suitable gearing so that the proper weld angle is obtained for the particular part. The device, as above described, can now be operated to make a continuous weld on a part 116, for example, which is rotated on the quill 162. The cams having been designed according to the description are located on the shaft 160. The electrical circuitry is connected to the welding unit 132 and the device is started. The work rotates at a speed determined by the basic input to the worm gear 172 as modied by the forward planetary gearing assembly as reected by the motion of the cam 36. At the same time, the offset motion is controlled by cam 60 in the horizontal movement and the vertical motion is controlled by the cam 90 so that the point of the weld 134 is maintained in an accurate position relative to the part as it rotates' with a constant weld speed. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> An optional fourth cam 390 can be mounted directly on the quill to substitute for the vertical motion cam in cases where the work part has no concave sections. A rigid arm 302 extending downwardly at an angle from the headV 13@ (see FIGURE l) has a follower 304 which rides directly on the cam 162. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> As previously indicated, an axial cam (not shown) can be also operated by the cam shaft 160 to move the slide 130 along an axis parallel to the axis of rotation of the part. With this adaptation, a three-dimensional weld can be accomplished. </div>
