<div class="description-paragraph">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Now with more particular reference to the drawings, the portable isolator enclosure is supported on a standard litter indicated at 16, having a stretcher 19 supported on it. The litter has wheels 17 and a tilt and height adjustment mechanism 18 of a conventional type familiar to those skilled in the art. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The entire isolator can be attached to an emergency door connecting it to another chamber by bringing the end of the other chamber 50 against the gasket 48, which is supported in a groove 51 in the frame member 15. The other isolator 50 is held to the isolator by means of a clamp 52. The isolator includes the main frame 10, stretcher slide 11, door frame 12, supports 13 and bag 14. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The main frame 10 includes the elongated laterally spaced longitudinally extending side members which extend from door frame 12 to the end remote from the door frame, where they are connected together by the rear cross member 49. The door frame 12 is fixed to the side members of the main frame 10 and the door frame extends upwardly therefrom. The door frame has side members and a top member and a bottom member 15 which define an opening of a size suitable to receive a stretcher with a large man on it. The clamp 36 is of a type familiar to those skilled in the art. Clamp 36 extends through the cross member 49 and the end of clamp 36 engages an end of the litter 16. The clamp 36 urges the litter into engagement with the front cross member 46 of the main frame 10. The stretcher slide plate 28 is fixed to the main frame 10 at its front end. The stretcher slide plate is fixed to the bottom member 15 of the door frame by bolts 47. Groove 48 is formed in the front end of frame member 15 and groove 48 receives a gasket 53. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> A person may be transferred from the isolator chamber disclosed herein to a second isolator or to a sterile room by moving the door frame of the isolator disclosed into engagement with a second isolator indicated by phantom lines 50 and the gasket 48 will form a seal between the two isolators while a person is being transferred. The clamping member 52 is adapted to hold the two isolators together while the transfer is being made. The transfer of the patient on the stretcher can be made without exposing either the patient or stretcher to contamination of the atmosphere around the chamber. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The bottom member IS of the door has spaced upper and lower members indicated which define the space and an opening 53 is formed in the stretch slide and in the upper part of the member 15 so that air can pass from the duct 39 from the source of filtered air 40. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> A hat-shaped member 23 provides a space to receive an X- ray cassette and for the circulation of air. The hat-shaped member is generally U-shaped in cross section and has its front end and sides supported on the stretcher slide plate 28. Stretcher 19 has legs 54 which rest on the stretcher slide plate on opposite sides of the hat-shaped member 23. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The bottom wall of bag 14 extends under the slide plate, under the lower member I5 of the door frame, and the bag is held in sealed relation with the door frame 12 by ring 45. The stretcher slide plate is supported in spaced relation to the main frame 10. The slide plate extends back into the bag and supports the stretcher 19. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The bag 14, door frame 12 and door 24 form an enclosure for the stretcher and person on it. The stretcher 19 with its mattress 20, stretcher slide plate 11 and hat-shaped member 23 are all inside the enclosure. When the bag is in place with its rim around its open end held to the door frame, the entire bag and frame can be supported on the litter 16 and transported. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> By moving the member 15 into engagement with a second isolator chamber, the litter l9, mattress 20 andperson on the litter can be transferred into another sterile chamber without exposing them to contamination of the atmosphere around the chamber. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The bag may be made of a transparent plastic material having a reinforcing or abrasion resistant fabric or other backing at its bottom to give it strength and resistance to puncture. The bag 14 is sealingly attached to the frame 12 by means of a clamping and sealing ring 45. Ring 45 engages the periphery of the bag 14 adjacent its open end and squeezes it into sealing engagement with the groove 52in the door frame 12. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> A stretcher slide 28 is received in the bag and the stretcher l9 rests on the stretcher slide 28. The stretcher 19 has a mattress 20 on it as shown. An opening 21 is provided for intravenous fluids to be given to a patient inside the bag and armports are provided for access through suitable glove arrangements in a conventional manner. The stretcher has a first part 40 and a second part 41 of approximately equal length hinged together to swing about an axis 42. A waste disposal bag 32 is also supported on the isolator so waste can be moved out of the bag 14. The frame 10 is clamped to the litter stretcher by clamp 36, which hasan end 54 which engages the litter l6 and urges the litter into engagement with said door frame. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Filtered air is admitted through opening 39. The support rods 13 are taller than said door so that a patient may assume a sitting position in said bag. The stretcher 19 is hinged at its midpart so that a patient may be held in a sitting position by the support stay 37. The floor of the isolator is made of X-ray penetrable material so that the patient in the isolator maybe X-rayed. A battery operated life support system 40 is built into the carriage. Air flows into the head end of the isolator bag and is discharged out the foot end. A filter 41 is provided in the bag to prevent back flow due to changes in the pressure in the isolator bag. The bag 14 has a relatively small open end wherein it receives the door frame 12. The bag tapers to a large size at the support rods 13 so that the patient has headroom to sit upright in the bag. </div>
