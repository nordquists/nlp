<heading>CROSS-REFERENCE</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">This is a division of Ser. No. 739,033 filed Nov. 5, 1976 which in turn is a continuation of Ser. No. 632,975 filed Nov. 18, 1975, abandoned.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This invention relates to compounds having pharmaceutical activity, to a process for their production, to intermediates useful in that process and to pharmaceutical compositions containing the active compounds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">More specifically, this invention relates to cyclic amides and amines in which the nitrogen atom and one α-carbon atom are substituted by aliphatic groups, to the preparation of such compounds via novel carboxylic acids or their esters and to pharmaceutical compositions containing the cyclic amides and amines.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Natural prostaglandins and analogues thereof are known to possess a wide variety of pharmacological activities.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Offenlegungsschrift No. 2323193 discloses that pyrazolidine derivatives of the formula (I)': ##STR2## wherein A is CH═CH or C.tbd.C; R is H, an alkali metal, an amine salt, or an ≯ 12C hydrocarbon or chlorohydrocarbon residue; m is 0 or 1; n is 0-6; p is 0-6; and Y and Z are O or H<sub>2</sub> except that Y and Z are not both O;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">have similar biological properties to the prostaglandins or are antagonists of prostaglandins.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A paper by Bolliger and Muchowski (Tet. Letters, 1975, 2931) describes the preparation of 11-desoxy-8-azaprostaglandin E<sub>1</sub>, but states only that one epimer thereof was more active in several biological assays than the other epimer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A class of compounds has now been discovered within which useful pharmacological activity is displayed. For example compounds within this class have anti-gastric secretion activity, cardiovascular activity e.g. anti-hypertensive activity, platelet aggregration inhibition activity, effect the respiratory tract e.g. bronchodilator activity, and have antifertility and smooth muscle activity. In general it may be said that compounds within this class have a range of pharmacological activities similar to those shown by the natural prostaglandins, but that these activities tend to be rather more selective.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Accordingly the present invention provides a compound of the formula (I): ##STR3## wherein: X is CO, protected CO, CROH in which R is hydrogen or C<sub>1-4</sub> alkyl and in which the OH moiety may be protected;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Y is CH<sub>2</sub> CH<sub>2</sub> or CH═CH;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Z is CO or CH<sub>2</sub> ;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">n is 1 to 8;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">m is 1, 2 or 3;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">R<sub>1</sub> is hydrogen, CH<sub>2</sub> OH, CH<sub>2</sub> OH in which the OH moiety is protected, CO<sub>2</sub> W wherein W is hydrogen or CO<sub>2</sub> W represents an ester group in which the ester moiety contains from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, or CONH<sub>2</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">R<sub>2</sub> is hydrogen, C<sub>1-4</sub> alkyl, or taken together with R<sub>3</sub> and the carbon atom to which it is attached represents a carbonyl group;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">R<sub>3</sub> is hydrogen, hydroxy or protected hydroxy;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">R<sub>4</sub> is hydrogen or C<sub>1-9</sub> alkyl;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">and salts thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In formula (I), often n will be 3 to 8, R<sub>2</sub> will be a hydrogen atom or methyl group, or taken together with R<sub>3</sub> and the carbon atom to which it is attached will represent a carbonyl group, and X will be CO, CROH in which R is hydrogen or C<sub>1-4</sub> alkyl and in which the OH moiety may be protected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Suitable protected CO groups X include groups formed by conventional carbonyl addition and condensation reactions such as ketals, thioketals, hemithioketals, oximes, semicarbazones, hydrazones and the like. Of such groups often the ketal type derivatives will be most useful, for example when X is a group ##STR4##</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Examples of suitable groups X include CO, CHOH, C(CH<sub>3</sub>)OH and C(C<sub>2</sub> H<sub>5</sub>)OH. Preferably X is CO, CHOH or C(CH<sub>3</sub>)OH, most preferably CO. Similarly it is often preferred that Y is CH<sub>2</sub> CH<sub>2</sub> and also that Z is CO.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">While n may be 1 to 8, n is most suitably 1 to 5. Within this narrower range, the preferred values for n include 3,4 and 5,3 being the most preferred. Thus it will be seen that the α side chain of the compounds of the formula (I) will often be of the formula (CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub> 'R<sup>1</sup> wherein n<sup>1</sup> is 6,7 or 8, preferably 6.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">We believe that the most valuable compounds of the formula (I) are given when m is 1 and also when m is 2. Further, we have found that in some pharmacological test systems compounds wherein m is 1 demonstrate a rather higher potency than the corresponding compounds wherein m is 2.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Suitable protected hydroxy groups include readily hydrolysable groups such as acylated hydroxy groups in which the acyl moiety contains 1 to 4 carbon atoms, for example the acetoxy group, and hydroxy groups etherified by readily removable inert groups such as benzyl or like groups. Preferably the hydroxy moieties in formula (I) are unprotected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Suitable groups R<sub>1</sub> include hydrogen, CH<sub>2</sub> OH, CO<sub>2</sub> H and the methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, phenyl, benzyl, toluyl or like ester of the said CO<sub>2</sub> H acid group. Normally however R<sub>1</sub> will be hydrogen, CH<sub>2</sub> OH, CO<sub>2</sub> H or a C<sub>1-4</sub> alkyl ester of the said CO<sub>2</sub> H acid group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Of the variants possible for R<sub>2</sub>, the most suitable include hydrogen, methyl and ethyl, and of these methyl and ethyl are often preferred. Most usually R<sub>2</sub> will be methyl.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">R<sub>3</sub> is hydrogen, hydroxy or protected hydroxy. Suitable protected hydroxy groups R<sub>3</sub> have of course been described above. Preferably R<sub>3</sub> is hydrogen or hydroxy, most preferably hydroxy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">R<sub>4</sub> is hydrogen or a C<sub>1-9</sub> alkyl group. Suitable examples of R<sub>4</sub> include C<sub>4-9</sub> alkyl groups which may be straight chain alkyl groups, such as n-butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl and n-heptyl, or may be alkyl groups, such as the aforenamed alkyl groups, branched by one or two methyl groups (at the same or different carbon atoms).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Thus for example R<sub>4</sub> may be a group CH<sub>2</sub> R<sub>5</sub>, CH(CH<sub>3</sub>)R<sub>5</sub> or C(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> R<sub>5</sub>, wherein R<sub>5</sub> is a straight chain alkyl group such that the carbon content of the resultant group R<sub>4</sub> is 4 to 9. Suitably R<sub>5</sub> is n-butyl or n-pentyl.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In general preferred groups R<sub>4</sub> include straight chain pentyl, hexyl and heptyl groups. Of these, straight chain hexyl is often the most useful.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The compounds of the formula (I) may form conventional acid salts when W is hydrogen. Such salts include those with alkali and alkaline earth metals, suitably sodium and potassium, and ammonium and substituted ammonium salts. Also, when Z is CH<sub>2</sub>, the resultant amine of the formula (I) may form acid addition salts with conventional pharmaceutically acceptable acids Examples of such acids include hydrochloric, hydrobromic, phosphone, acetic, fumaric, salicylic, citric, lactic, mandelic, tartaric and methylsulphonic acids.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A group of compounds of particular interest within formula (I) include compounds of the formula (II): ##STR5## wherein: X<sup>1</sup> is CO, or CHOH or C(CH<sub>3</sub>)OH in which the OH moieties may be protected;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">m<sup>1</sup> is 1 or 2;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">n<sup>1</sup> is 1 to 5;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">R<sup>1</sup> <sub>2</sub> is hydrogen or C<sub>1-4</sub> alkyl;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">R<sup>1</sup> <sub>3</sub> is hydrogen, hydroxy or protected hydroxy;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">R<sup>1</sup> <sub>4</sub> is hydrogen or C<sub>4-9</sub> alkyl; and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Y and W are as defined in formula (I); and salts thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In formula (II), suitable examples of X<sup>1</sup> include CO, CHOH and C(CH<sub>3</sub>)0H. Normally it is preferred that X<sup>1</sup> is CO, Y is CH<sub>2</sub> CH<sub>2</sub>, m<sup>1</sup> is 1, and n<sup>1</sup> is 3 or 5 (most preferably 3).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Suitably R<sup>1</sup> <sub>2</sub> is hydrogen, methyl or ethyl. Of these three values, R<sup>1</sup> <sub>2</sub> is most suitably methyl or ethyl, preferably methyl. Similarly, suitably R<sup>1</sup> <sub>3</sub> is hydrogen or hydroxy, preferably hydroxy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Suitable and preferred straight chain and branched alkyl groups R<sup>1</sup> <sub>4</sub> include those previously described as suitable and preferred for the group R<sub>4</sub> when R<sub>4</sub> is a C<sub>4-9</sub> alkyl group. Such preferred groups R<sup>1</sup> <sub>4</sub> include straight chain pentyl, hexyl and heptyl, and of these normally the most useful is straight chain hexyl.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Of the variants possible for W as defined in formula (I), normally we prefer that W is hydrogen or a C<sub>1-4</sub> alkyl group such as the methyl or ethyl groups.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Thus it can be seen that within formula (II) there is a sub-group of particular utility of the formula (III): ##STR6## wherein: m<sup>1</sup> is 1 or 2;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">n<sup>11</sup> is 6 or 8;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">R<sup>1</sup> <sub>2</sub> is hydrogen, methyl or ethyl;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">R<sup>1</sup> <sub>4</sub> is n-pentyl, n-hexyl or n-heptyl; and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">W is hydrogen or C<sub>1-4</sub> alkyl; and salts thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In formula (III), m<sup>1</sup> is preferably 1 and n<sup>11</sup> is preferably 6. Similarly R<sup>1</sup> <sub>2</sub> is most usefully methyl or ethyl (preferably methyl), and R<sup>1</sup> <sub>4</sub> is preferably n-hexyl. Lastly in formula (III) W<sup>1</sup> is most suitably a C<sub>1-4</sub> alkyl group such as the methyl or ethyl group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The most useful compounds within formula (III) include the following:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">2-(6'-Ethoxycarbonyl-n-hexyl)-1-(3"-hydroxy-3"-methyl-n-nonyl)-pyrrolidin-3,5-dione.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">2-(6'-Ethoxycarbonyl-n-hexyl)-1-(3"-hydroxy-3"-methyl-n-octyl)-pyrrolidin-3,5-dione.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">2-(6'-Ethoxycarbonyl-n-hexyl)-1-(3"-hydroxy-3"-methyl-n-decyl)-pyrrolidin-3,5-dione.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">2-(6'-Ethoxycarbonyl-n-hexyl)-1-(3"-hydroxy-3"-ethyl-n-nonyl)-pyrrolidin-3,5-dione.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In formula (I), when Z is CH<sub>2</sub> a useful group of compounds includes those of formula (IV): ##STR7## wherein: X<sup>1</sup>, Y, m<sup>1</sup>, n<sup>1</sup>, R<sup>1</sup> <sub>2</sub>, R<sup>1</sup> <sub>3</sub> and R<sup>1</sup> <sub>4</sub> are as defined in formula (II); and R<sup>1</sup> <sub>1</sub> is CH<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>2</sub> OH or CH<sub>2</sub> OH in which the OH moiety is protected; and salts thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">X<sup>1</sup> in formula (IV) may be CO, CHOH or C(CH<sub>3</sub>)OH in which the OH moiety may be protected. In general it may be said that X<sup>1</sup> is most usefully CHOH or C(CH<sub>3</sub>)OH. Also Y is preferably CH<sub>2</sub> CH<sub>2</sub>, and n<sup>1</sup> is preferably 3 or 5 (most preferably 3).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Suitable examples of the group R<sup>1</sup> <sub>2</sub> include hydrogen, methyl and ethyl, preferred examples include hydrogen and methyl. In the same way, suitable examples of R<sup>1</sup> <sub>3</sub> include hydrogen and hydroxy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Suitable and preferred examples of the group R<sup>1</sup> <sub>4</sub> include those described for R<sup>1</sup> <sub>4</sub> in relation to formula (II).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">R<sup>1</sup> <sub>1</sub> may be CH<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>2</sub> OH or CH<sub>2</sub> OH in which the OH moiety is protected. When R<sup>1</sup> <sub>1</sub> is CH<sub>3</sub>, then often R<sup>1</sup> <sub>2</sub> and R<sup>1</sup> <sub>3</sub> will be hydrogen, R<sup>1</sup> <sub>4</sub> will represent a straight chain pentyl, hexyl or heptyl group, and X<sup>1</sup> will be CHOH or C(CH<sub>3</sub>)OH. In the same way when R<sub>1</sub> is CH<sub>2</sub> OH (or less preferably CH<sub>2</sub> OH in which the OH moiety is protected), X<sup>1</sup> will normally be CHOH or C(CH<sub>3</sub>)OH, R<sup>1</sup> <sub>2</sub> will be hydrogen, methyl or ethyl, preferably hydrogen or methyl, and R<sup>1</sup> <sub>3</sub> will be hydrogen or hydroxy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A second useful group of compounds when Z is CH<sub>2</sub> are those of formula (V): ##STR8## wherein: m<sup>1</sup>, n<sup>1</sup>, X<sup>1</sup>, Y, W, R<sup>1</sup> <sub>2</sub>, R<sup>1</sup> <sub>3</sub> and R<sup>1</sup> <sub>4</sub> are as defined in formula (II); and salts thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In formula (V) it is normally preferred that n<sup>1</sup> is 3 or 5, most preferably 3, and that Y is CH<sub>2</sub> CH<sub>2</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Suitably X<sup>1</sup> is CO, CHOH or C(CH<sub>3</sub>)OH, while of these values X<sup>1</sup> is most often CO.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">R<sup>1</sup> <sub>2</sub> is hydrogen or C<sub>1-4</sub> alkyl, and suitable examples of such groups R<sup>1</sup> <sub>2</sub> include hydrogen, methyl and ethyl, preferably methyl. Again, suitably R<sup>1</sup> <sub>3</sub> in formula (V) is hydrogen or hydroxy, preferably hydroxy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Suitable and preferred values for R<sup>1</sup> <sub>4</sub> and W in formula (V) include those values stated to be suitable and preferred for R<sup>1</sup> <sub>4</sub> and W earlier in the specification in relation to formula (II).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It will of course be realised that the compounds of the formula (I) have asymmetric centres, and thus are capable of existing in a number of stereoisomeric forms. The invention extends to each of these stereoisomeric forms, and to mixtures thereof. The different stereoisomeric forms may be separated one from the other by the usual methods.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound of the formula (I), which process comprises either decarboxylating a compound of the formula (VI): ##STR9## wherein m, n, Y, R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub> and R<sub>4</sub> are as defined in formula (I), to yield a compound of the formula (I) wherein X is CO, and thereafter if desired converting X in the thus formed compound to protected CO by conventional methods, or to CROH by reduction when R is hydrogen or by reaction with a C<sub>1-4</sub> alkyl Grignard reagent or C<sub>1-4</sub> alkyl metallic complex when R is C<sub>1-4</sub> alkyl, and then optionally protecting the CROH hydroxy moiety; or reacting a compound of the formula (I) wherein Z is CO with a vigorous reducing agent to convert it into the coresponding compound wherein Z is CH<sub>2</sub> and wherein other carbonyl functions present in the chosen compound of the formula (I) are reduced, and thereafter if desired oxidising one or more of these reduced carbonyl functions back to carbonyl functions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The decarboxylation reaction may be brought about under basic, acid or neutral conditions in conventional manner. For example when m=1 the reaction is conveniently effected by heating the chosen compound of the formula (VI) in a suitable solvent such as toluene or xylene.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The conversion of a compound of the formula (I) wherein X is CO to the corresponding compound wherein X is protected CO may be carried out under conventional reaction conditions for, for example, carbonyl addition and condensation reactions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The conversion of a compound of the formula (I) wherein X is CO to the corresponding compound where X is CHOH may be carried out by conventional methods for reducing a ketone to an alcohol, for example by sodium borohydride reduction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The conversion of a compound of the formula (I) wherein X is CO to the corresponding compound wherein X is CROH in which R is C<sub>1-4</sub> alkyl may be carried out by conventional Grignard or alkyl metal, (suitably alkyl lithium) reactions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">After the decarboxylation reaction the group W may be varied in compounds wherein R<sub>1</sub> is CO<sub>2</sub> W by conventional de-esterification and/or esterification reactions. Similarly protected CROH and R<sub>3</sub> hydroxy moieties may be deprotected by conventional methods. For example, when R<sub>3</sub> is a benzyloxy group, the benzyl group may readily be removed by hydrogenolysis. Thus it may be seen that `protected hydroxy` compounds of the formula (I) are useful intermediates in the preparation of the corresponding `free hydroxy` compounds of the formula (I).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When W is hydrogen, salts of compounds of the formula (I) may be prepared in conventional manner, for example by reacting the chosen compound of the formula (I) with the required base.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Similarly compounds of the formula (I) wherein R<sub>1</sub> is CONH<sub>2</sub> may be prepared by conventional methods from other compounds of the formula (I), for example by ammonolysis of the corresponding compound wherein R<sub>1</sub> is an ester group CO<sub>2</sub> W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Also compounds of the formula (I) wherein R<sub>3</sub> is OH may be prepared by conventional reduction or Grignard reactions on the corresponding compound wherein CR<sub>2</sub> R<sub>3</sub> is a carbonyl group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The reduction of a compound of the formula (I) wherein Z is CO to give the corresponding compound wherein Z is CH<sub>2</sub> requires a vigorous reducing agent. Suitable such reagents include lithium aluminium hydride and its chemical equivalents. The reaction conditions used for this reaction are generally those conventionally associated with the use of lithium aluminium hydride.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Due to the potency of the reducing agent used to effect the desired Z=CO to Z=CH<sub>2</sub> conversion in a compound of the formula (I), if the starting compound of the formula (I) wherein Z=CO contains a carbonyl function in addition to that of Z, then this additional carbonyl function will also be reduced. Accordingly when compounds of the formula (I) wherein Z is CH<sub>2</sub> are required in which such other carbonyl functions are present, they must be prepared from corresponding compounds of the formula (I) wherein Z is the CH<sub>2</sub> and the said other carbonyl functions are reduced, by selective oxidation. Examples of such selective oxidation are given in the following three paragraphs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A compound of the formula (I) wherein Z is CH<sub>2</sub> and X is CO may be prepared by the oxidation of the corresponding compound wherein X is CHOH. A suitable oxidising agent for this reaction is a chromium trioxide-pyridine mixture in methylene chloride.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A compound of the formula (I) wherein Z is CH<sub>2</sub> and R<sub>1</sub> is a group CO<sub>2</sub> W may be prepared by the oxidation and optional subsequent salification or esterification of the corresponding compound of the formula (I) wherein R<sub>1</sub> is CH<sub>2</sub> OH. A suitable oxidising agent for this reaction is a chromic acid-acetic acid mixture.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A compound of the formula (I) wherein Z is CH<sub>2</sub> and CR<sub>2</sub> R<sub>3</sub> represents a carbonyl group may be prepared by the oxidation of the corresponding compound of the formula (I) wherein CR<sub>2</sub> R<sub>3</sub> is a CHOH group. A suitable oxidising agent for this reaction is a chromium trioxide-pyridine mixture in methylene chloride.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It will be realised that the optional interconversions described above for compounds of the formula (I) wherein Z is CO after their preparation by decarboxylation may just as readily be carried out with compounds of the formula (I) wherein Z is CH<sub>2</sub> after their preparation by reduction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is frequently convenient to generate the compound of formula (VI) in situ from a corresponding ester of the formula (VII): ##STR10## where CO<sub>2</sub> R<sub>6</sub> is a conventional ester group. In such a case R<sub>6</sub> is preferably a benzyl group or a lower alkyl group such as methyl or ethyl or the like. It has been found that often it is sufficient to bring about de-esterification and subsequent decarboxylation in the chosen compound of the formula (VII) simply to leave the compound standing in an inert solvent, for example overnight. Otherwise the desired de-esterification and decarboxylation in the chosen compound of the formula (VII) can be brought about by treatment with, for example, lithium iodide dihydrate and collidine in anhydrous solvents. In cases where m=1, the compound of the formula (VII) can also for example be de-esterified and decarboxylated by heating the compound alone or preferably, in a high boiling solvent such as toluene or xylene.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It will be appreciated that compounds of the formulae (VI) and (VII) are useful intermediates and as such form a useful aspect of this invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The compounds of formula (VII) may be prepared by the ring closure of the corresponding diester of formula (VIII): ##STR11## wherein m, n, Y, R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub> and R<sub>4</sub> are as defined in formula (I), R<sub>6</sub> is as defined in formula (VII), and R<sub>7</sub> is a group such that CO<sub>2</sub> R<sub>7</sub> is an ester group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the processes of the invention the group R<sub>1</sub> in the intermediates of formula (VI), (VII) and (VIII) will often represent an ester group CO<sub>2</sub> W, and if for example acids of the formula (I) (wherein R<sub>1</sub> is CO<sub>2</sub> H) are required they can be obtained by de-esterification of the corresponding compound of the formula (I) wherein R<sub>1</sub> is an ester group CO<sub>2</sub> W. Usually the ester group CO<sub>2</sub> R<sub>7</sub> in formula (VIII) will be the same ester group as CO<sub>2</sub> W, and for the sake of convenience the ester group CO<sub>2</sub> R<sub>6</sub> will also normally be the same ester group as CO<sub>2</sub> W. The ester groups CO<sub>2</sub> W/R<sub>6</sub> /R<sub>7</sub> are suitably C<sub>1-4</sub> alkyl esters such as methyl and ethyl esters.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Generally, the ring closure takes place in a dry organic solvent using a strong base such as sodium hydride or sodium ethoxide (or other <sup>-</sup> OR<sub>6</sub> or <sup>-</sup> OR<sub>7</sub> group) to bring about the initial proton abstraction from the α-methylene group. It has been found that sodium ethoxide in benzene, or potassium t-butoxide in toluene, benzene or hexamethylphosphoramide give good results.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Compounds of formula (VIII) are novel useful intermediates and as such, form an aspect of this invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Compounds of formula (VIII) may be prepared by the esterification of a corresponding acid or by the reaction of a compound of the formula (IX): ##STR12## with a reactive acylating derivative of an acid of the formula (X):</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">The displacement reaction occurs under conventional reaction conditions, for example, in an alcoholic solvent in the presence of Na<sub>2</sub> CO<sub>3</sub> or pyridine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Compounds within the formula (I) have useful pharmacological activity. For example compounds within the formula (I) have anti-gastric secretion activity, cardiovascular activity e.g. anti-hypertensive activity, platelet aggregation inhibition activity, effect the respiratory tract e.g. bronchodilator activity, and have antifertility and smooth muscle activity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In general it may be said that compounds within the formula (I) have a range of pharmacological activities similar to those shown by the natural prostaglandins, but that these activities tend to be rather more selective.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The invention therefore also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the formula (I) and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">Tablets and capsules for oral administration may be in unit dose presentation form, and may contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, for example syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, or polyvinyl-pyrollidone; filler for example lactose, sugar, maize-starch, calcium phosphate, sorbitol or glycine; tabletting lubricants, for example magnesium stearate, talc, polyethylene glycol or silica; disintegrants, for example potato starch; or acceptable wetting agents such as sodium lauryl sulphate. The tablets may be coated according to methods well known in normal pharmaceutical practice. Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups, or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, for example sorbitol, syrup, methyl cellulose, glucose syrup, gelatin, hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, aluminium stearate gel or hydrogenated edible fats, emulsifying agents, for example lecithin, sorbitan monooleate, or acacia; non-aqueous vehicles (which may include edible oils), for example almond oil, fractionated coconut oil, oily esters such as glycerine, propylene glycol, or ethyl alcohol; preservatives, for example methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid, and if desired conventional flavouring or colouring agents. The compounds of the formula (I) may also if desired be incorporated in a foodstuff, for example in the form of a biscuit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For parenteral administration, fluid unit dosage forms are prepared utilizing the compound of the formula (I) and a sterile vehicle. The compound, depending on the vehicle and concentration used, can be either suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. In preparing solutions the compound can be dissolved for injection and filter sterilized before filling into a suitable vial or ampoule and sealing. Advantageously, adjuvants such as a local anesthetic, preservatives and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle. Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner except that the compound is suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved and sterilization cannot be accomplished by filtration. The compound can be sterilized by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspending in the sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the compound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When appropriate, the compositions of this invention may be presented as an aerosol for, or as a microfine powder for insufflation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As is common practice, the compositions will usually be accompanied by written or printed directions for use in the medical treatment concerned.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It has been found that a number of the compounds of the formula (I) are potent inhibitors of gastric secretion, and thus have commercial utility as anti-ulcer agents. In treatment of this nature, the composition containing the formula (I) will preferably be formulated in a manner to allow oral administration, Normally 0.01 mg/kg to 500 mg/kg per day, most suitably 0.1 to 100 mg/kg per day, of the compound of the formula (I) in composition form will be administered in such treatment. Examples of such compounds of the formula (I) include those of formulae (II) and (III) as hereinbefore defined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Also a number of compounds of the formula (I) have particularly useful activity on the respiratory tract, and thus find utility as for example bronchodilators. Normally compositions containing such compounds of the formula (I) will be formulated as an aerosol, or as a microfine powder for insufflation, and the treatment will comprise the administration of from 0.001 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg per day of the compound in composition form.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, a number of compounds of the formula (I) are particularly potent inhibitors of platelet aggregation, and thus compositions containing such compounds are useful inter alia for administration to humans and animals to prevent clot formation for example after surgery to prevent postoperative thrombosis; in geriatric patients to prevent transient cerebral ischemic attacks; and long-term prophylaxis following myocardial infarcts and strokes--and in general in the treatment or prophylaxis of any disorder caused by an over pronounced tendency of blood platelets to aggregrate. Such compositions also have applications in the storage of whole blood in blood banks, and whole blood to be used in heart-lung machines, or to be circulated through organs, e.g heart and kidneys, which have been removed from a cadaver and prior to transplant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It will of course be realised that the precise dosage used in the treatment of any of the hereinbefore described disorders will depend on the actual compound of the formula (I) used, and also on other factors such as the seriousness of the disorder being treated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The invention also provides a method of treatment and/or propylaxis of disorders in human beings which comprises the administration to the sufferer of an effective amount of a compound of the formula (I).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It will be realised that when the compound of the formula (I) exhibits platelet aggregration inhibition activity then the invention also provides a method of inhibiting such aggregration in vivo.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The following Examples illustrate the preparation of compounds of the formula (I) and their pharmacological properties.</div>
