<div class="description-paragraph">The antiallergic activity and antiinflammatory activity of Compound (I) are described below:</div>
<heading>Test for antiallergic activity</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Antiallergic activity was investigated by a homologous PCA (passive cutaneous anaphlaxis) of rats for 48 hours, where Wistar male rats having body weights of 180 to 220 g were used for sampling of antiserum and Wistar male rats having body weights of 120 to 140 g were used for the PCA test.</div>
<heading>A) Preparation of anti EWA rat serum</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Anti-egg white albumin (EWA) rat serum was prepared according to Stotland and Share's method [Canad. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 52, 1114 (1974)]. That is, 1 mg of EWA was mixed with 20 mg of aluminum hydroxide gel and 0.5 ml of mixed vaccine of pertussis, diphtheria and tetanus, and the mixture was subcutaneously administered in four portions into rat's footpad. After 14 days, blood was sampled from the carotid artery, and the serum was separated from the sampled blood, and preserved under freezing at -80° C. The potency of the antiserumin in the homologous PCA for 48 hours was 1:32.</div>
<heading>B) Homologous PCA test of rats for 48 hours</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Groups each consisting of 3 rats were used, and 0.05 ml of anti-EWA rat serum diluted with a physiological saline solution to 8 times as much was incutaneously injected each at two positions of depilated back to make the animals passively sensitised. After 47 hours, the compound of the present invention, or its solution (physiological saline solution or CMC solution) was orally administered. One hour thereafter, 0.5 ml/100 g of 1% Evan's blue physiological saline solution containing 2 mg of the antigen EWA was administered into the tail vein, and 30 minutes thereafter, the animals were sacrificed by exsanguination. Then, the skins were stripped and the amount of leaked pigment at the blue-dyed parts was measured according to the Katayama et al method [Microbiol. Immunol. 22, 89 (1978)]. That is, the blue-dyed parts were cut out by scissors, and placed in test tubes containing 1 ml of 1N KOH and incubated at 37° C. for 24 hours. Then, 9 ml of a mixture of 0.6N phosphoric acid and acetone (5:13) was added thereto, and the mixture was shaked and centrifuged at 2,500 rpm for 10 minutes. Absorbancy of the supernatant at 620 μm was measured, and the amount of leaked pigment was quantitatively determined by the calibration curve prepared in advance. An average of measurements at the two position was made a value for one zooid, and inhibition rate for the individual zooid was calculated by the following formula: ##EQU1##</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Cases where, the inhibition rate is 50% or higher, were regarded as positive PCA inhibition activity, and the minimum administered dosage, where a positive case was observed in at least one of three zooids was regarded as minimum effective dosage (MED). The results are shown in Table 5.</div>
<heading>Acute Toxic Test</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Groups each consisting of 3 dd, male mice having body weights of 20±1 g were used, and the compound of the present invention was administered orally (po: 300 mg/kg) or intraperitoneally (ip: 100 mg/kg). Mortality 7 days after the administration was observed to obtain MLD (minimum lethal dosage). The results are shown in Table 5.</div>
<heading>Antiinflammatory Activity Test</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Antiinflammatory activity was examined according to Rat carageenin paw edema [J. Pathol. 104, 15-29 (1971)], Groups each consisting of three Wistar male rats weighing 150 g were used. The test compound was suspended in 0.3% aqueous CMC solution and the suspension was given orally. Sixty minutes later, 0.1 ml of 0.1% carageenin was subcutaneously injected in a hind paw to form carageenin paw edema.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The volume of paw was measured before the administration and 3 hours after the administration of carageenin with plethysmometer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The ratio of the volume 3 hours after the administration to that before the administration of carageenin was calculated and each ratio is compared with the ratio of control group (0.3% CMC was administered) to give the edema inhibiting percentage. The results are shown in Table 6.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">As is evidenced in Tables 5 and 6, Compound (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof have PCA inhibiting activity and/or carageenin paw edema inhibiting activity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">PCA inhibiting activity is believed to be on the basis of an activity inhibiting liberation of chemical mediator such as histamine from fat skin cell. Therefore, Compound (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are believed to be useful for treating an allergic disease such as bronchus asthma which is caused by trachea contractile activity of chemical mediator such as histamine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">On the other hand, carageenin paw edema inhibiting activity is believed to be on the basis of prostaglandin biosynthesis inhibiting activity. Thus, Compound (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are believed to be useful for treating an acute inflammation and rheumatism which are ascribed to excessive prostaglandin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Compound (I) includes a compound having both antiallergic and antiinflammatory activities described above which is useful for the treatment of allergic diseases accompanied by inflammation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In view of the pharmacological activity of Compound (I), Compound (I) can be used in various medicament forms for the administration purposes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present medicament composition can be prepared by uniformly mixing an effective amount of a free Compound (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as an active component with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. The carrier can take a wide range of forms in accordance with a desirable medicament form for the administration. These medicament compositions are desirably in a unit dosage form suitable for the oral administration or injection administration. In the preparation of a composition in the oral dosage form, any useful, pharmaceutically acceptable carrier can be used. For example, an oral liquid preparation such as a suspended medicament or syrup medicament can be prepared using water; sugars such as sucrose, sorbitol, fructose, etc.; glycols such as polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, etc.; oils such as sesame oil, olive oil, soybean oil, etc.; antiseptics such as alkyl parahydroxybenzoate, etc.; and flavors such as strawberry flavor, peppermint, etc. Powder, pills, capsules and tablets can be prepared using an excipient such as lactose, glucose, sucrose, mannitol, etc.; a disintegrator such as starch, sodium alginate, etc.; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate, talc, etc.; a binder such as polyvinyl alcohol, hydroxypropylcellulose, gelatin, etc.; a surfactant such as fatty acid esters; and a plasticizer such as glycerine, etc. Tablets and capsules are the most useful, oral unit dosage forms because of easy administration. To prepare tablets and capsules, solid carriers for medicament are used. Injection solution can be prepared using a carrier consisting of a salt solution, a glucose solution or a mixture of the salt solution and the glucose solution. The effective dosage of Compound (I) is 1 to 20 mg/kg/day for a human being, and number of administration is 3 to 4 per day.</div>

After completion of the reaction, the mixture is cooled until the temperature is brought back to room temperature, 4 l of aqueous 10% acetic acid solution is added thereto and the mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature overnight. After stirring the mixture at room temperature for 3 hours, deposited crystals are separated by filtration, and 6 l of water is added thereto. After stirring the mixture at room temperature for 30 minutes, the deposited crystals are separated by filtration. After the addition of 3 l of toluene to the crystals, the mixture is stirred at room temperature for one hour. The crystals are separated by filtration and dried over heating under reduced pressure to yield 393.9 g of 2-(4-methoxycarbonylphenoxy) methyl benzoic acid.</div>
