<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates to a silver halide photographic light sensitive material comprising a coupler capable of chelation and a method for forming images by the use thereof.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a silver halide color photographic light sensitive material (hereinafter, simply referred to as "light sensitive material"), there are generally used a silver halide light sensitive emulsion and a dye forming coupler which reacts with an oxidized developing agent to form a dye.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As a cyan coupler, there have been employed phenols and naphthols, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,369,929 and 2,474,293.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">However, a cyan dye image obtained from phenols or naphthols have problems in color reproduction. Thus, the absorption spectrum of these cyan dyes is not sharp in the shorter wavelength region and unwanted absorption, i.e. asymmetric absorption, is present in the blue region. To solve this problem, in negative films, the asymmetric absorption has conventionally been corrected by masking with a colored coupler. However, this also resulted in reduction in sensitivity, making it unacceptable. In the case of reversal photographic material and color paper, effective correction means are little known and color reproduction is deteriorated. As a novel cyan coupler having a preferred absorption, a coupler with an imidazole nucleus was proposed in European Patent 249,453. This coupler, however, was insufficient in dye fastness for practical use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">On the other hand, a dye formed from a 5-pyrazolone type coupler, which has been widely employed and studied as a magenta dye image forming coupler, was excellent in heat and light fastness, but it has an asymmetric absorption, which causes color contamination in the yellow color component. To overcome this problem, pyrazolobenzimidazole, indazolone, pyrazolotriazole, imidazopyrazole, pyrazolopyrazole and pyrazolotetrazole type couplers were proposed. In fact, these couplers were preferable from the point of color reproduction. However, the dye formed from these couplers has the problem that image lasting quality is remarkably low and the image is subject to discoloration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As a means for improving the fastness of these dyes, Japanese Patent examined 4-47811 discloses a technique of bringing an azo or azomethine dye formed on coupling-reaction with a developing agent into contact with a polyvalent metal ion, in which the developing agent and coupler both have a site capable of chelating to form a bidentate or terdentate metal-chelated dye image.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">To obtain the thus metal-chelated dye image, the developing agent necessitates having ametal-chelating site. Accordingly, it is not compatible with developing agents which are widely employed at the present time, and is therefore commercially too expensive. The thus metal-chelated dye image was proved to be insufficient in image lasting quality and further improvements are required. In addition, dye formability is insufficient and improvements thereof have been desired.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a silver halide photographic light sensitive material sufficiently improved in image fastness and an image forming method by the use thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Another object is to provide a silver halide photographic light sensitive material containing a coupler capable of forming a chelate dye, which is excellent in spectral-absorption characteristics, such a cyan dye having a sharp absorption edge in the short wavelength side and no asymmetric absorption in the green region and blue region, and magenta dye having a sharp absorption and no asymmetric absorption in the blue region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Another object is to means for forming an image by the use of conventionally used developing agent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Another object is to provide a silver halide photographic light sensitive material comprising a novel coupler capable of forming a chelate dye upon coupling reaction with a developing agent and an image forming method by the use thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Another object is to provide a processing method for forming an image by processing a light sensitive material comprising a novel coupler capable of forming a chelated dye upon coupling reaction with a developing agent with a processing solution containing a metal ion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Another object is to provide a novel, metal-chelated coupler capable of forming a metal chelated dye upon coupling reaction with a developing agent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The above objects can be accomplished by a silver halide photographic light sensitive material comprising a support having thereon a silver halide emulsion layer containing a coupler, wherein said coupler is capable of forming a dye upon oxidative coupling with a developing agent including a salt thereof, which has, in the molecule, at least two sites capable of chelating with a metal ion to form a 5-membered or 6-membered chelate ring, thereby said coupler forming a metal-chelate dye along with said developing agent and the metal ion; and an image forming method comprising exposing said silver halide photographic light sensitive material and subjecting the exposed photographic material to photographic processing.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">The coupler of the invention is used in an amount of ×10<sup>-3</sup> to 1 mol, preferably 1×10<sup>-2</sup> to 8×10<sup>-1</sup> mol per mol of silver halide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The coupler of the invention can be used in combination with another kind of cyan coupler or magenta coupler.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Methods and techniques which have been employed in conventional dye forming couplers are also applied to the coupler of the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The coupler of the invention is usable as a material for use in any type of color photographic light sensitive materials. As examples thereof are cited nonincorporated-coupler type color forming process and incorporated-coupler type color forming process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the case where the coupler is applied to the nonincorporated-coupler type color forming process, the coupler is dissolved in an alkaline aqueous solution or organic solvent (alcohol, etc.) and the solution is added to a developer to be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the case where the coupler is applied to the incorporated-coupler type color forming process, the coupler is incorporated in a photographic light sensitive material. Exemplarily, the coupler is incorporated in a silver halide emulsion and the emulsion is coated on a support to form a photographic light sensitive material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The coupler of the invention can be used in a color photographic light sensitive material such as a color negative film, positive film and color printing paper.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The color photographic material including a color printing paper may be monocolor use or multicolor use. A multicolor photographic light sensitive material comprises dye image-forming component units having light-sensitivity respectively in three primary color regions of the spectrum. Each component unit is comprised of mono- or multi-layer emulsion layer having light-sensitivity in a spectral region. Component layers of the photographic light sensitive material including the image-forming component units can be arranged in various manners known in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A representative multicolor photographic light sensitive material comprises a support having thereon a cyan dye image-forming component unit comprising a red-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer containing a cyan coupler, a magenta dye image-forming component unit comprising a green-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer containing a magenta coupler and a yellow dye image-forming component unit comprising a blue-sensitive silver halide emulsion layer containing a yellow coupler.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The photographic light sensitive material may be optionally provided with an additional layer, such as a layer containing a metal ion-containing compound, filter layer, interlayer, protective layer or sub-layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the case of using the coupler of the invention, the metal ion-containing compound may be incorporated in the same or different layer from the coupler, or in a processing solution. In the case of using the metal-chelated coupler of the invention, it is not necessary to make contact with the metal ion-containing compound. In this case, the photographic material may be processed with a processing solution containing the metal ion-containing compound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A developing agent used in the invention forms a color dye upon coupling with the coupler of the invention. The coupler has sites within the molecule which are capable of forming a bidentate or terdentate chelate with a metal ion, so that the developing agent does not necessitate any chelating site. Thus, conventionally-used developing agents are usable, therefore, it is advantageous in cost.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The coupler of the invention can be incorporated in a silver halide emulsion according to the method, as known in the art. The coupler, for example, is dissolved in an organic high boiling solvent having a boiling point of 175° C. or higher such as tricresyl phosphate or dibutyl phthalate or a low boiling solvent such as butyl acetate or butyl propionate and the resulting solution is mixed with an aqueous gelatin solution containing a surfactant. The mixture is emulsified by means of a high-speed rotating mixer or colloid mill and thereafter added to a silver halide emulsion used in the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The composition of silver halide used in a photographic light sensitive material containing the coupler of the invention comprises silver chloride, silver chlorobromide or silver chloroiodobromide. It may be a combined mixture of silver chloride and silver bromide. In the case where a silver halide emulsion is applied to a color print paper, rapid developability is required and, with respect to the composition of silver halide, it is preferable to contain chloride. Accordingly, silver chloride, or silver chlorobromide or silver chloroiodobromide containing 1 mol% or more of silver chloride.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The silver halide emulsion used in the invention is chemically sensitized according to conventional methods. The silver halide emulsion can be spectrally sensitized to a desired wavelength region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">An antifogging agent or stabilizer may be incorporated in the silver halide emulsion for the purpose of preventing fogging during the course of manufacture, storage and processing of a photographic light sensitive material, and stabilize photographic performance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a color photographic light sensitive material containing the coupler of the invention are usable an anticolor-staining agent, dye image stabilizer, UV absorbent, antistatic agent, matting agent and surfactant, as used in convention a photographic light sensitive material. These are referred to, for example, Research Disclosure 176 22-31 (Dec., 1978).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The color photographic light sensitive material of invention is color-developed according to the method known in the art. A developing agent or its precursor may be incorporated in a hydrophilic colloid layer of the photographic material, which can be processed in an alkaline activator bath.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The color photographic light sensitive material is, after color development, subjected to bleaching and fixing. Bleaching and fixing may be conducted at the same time. After fixing, washing is carried out. Stabilizing may be conducted instead of washing, or both processing may be conducted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Another preferred embodiment of forming a metal-chelated image of the invention is to incorporate a metal ion-containing compound in a photographic light sensitive material. The metal ion compound may be incorporated in a layer containing the coupler of the invention or adjacent layer thereto. The metal ion compound maybe water soluble or oil soluble. When the coupler is oil soluble, the metal ion compound be preferably oil soluble and, similarly to the case of the coupler, it is dissolved in a high boiling solvent to be added. In this case, the photographic light sensitive material can be subjected to conventional color photographic processing. It is therefore advantageous that a stable image can be obtained according to the same processing method as in convention photographic materials.</div>
