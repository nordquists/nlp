<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates to a novel heat-developable light-sensitive material containing decolorizable dyes and having excellent decolorizeation performance and storability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention also relates to a method of forming color images which provides excellent color differentiation and sharpness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention further relates to a method of forming color images readily and quickly through a heat development process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A silver halide light-sensitive material is characterized by high light sensitivity and by providing high-definition images. However, because of use of processing solutions having a complex composition, a development process for this material involves adverse effect on the environment and complicated solution control. In recent years, there have been developed and sold heat-developable dye-transfer type light-sensitive materials which can readily and quickly form high-quality color images through use of a small amount of water and application of heat without use of development-processing solute well as image-forming apparatuses which make use of such light-sensitive materials (PICTROGRAPHY 2000 and 3000 and PICTROSTAT 100 and 200 manufactured by Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.). Also, heat-developable, silver-salt-diffusion-transfer type light-sensitive materials are described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) Nos. 62-283332 and 63-198050. However, it has been found that images formed from such diffusion-transferred dyes or silver do not have sufficiently satisfactory sharpness in certain uses such as color negatives and plate-making intermediate materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Meanwhile, colloidal silver or filter dyes have been used for the purpose of improving color differentiation and sharpness. However, since colloidal silver forms fog nuclei, it must be isolated from a silver halide emulsion layer, thus incurring an increase in overall layer thickness due to employment of an additional intermediate layer(s). Thus, the effect of use of colloidal silver is greatly reduced. Filter dyes which have conventionally been used are eluted into a processing solution or cause decolorizeation. When such filter dyes are applied to a heat-developable light-sensitive material, they, together with image-forming dyes, are transferred onto a dye-fixing material, or cause image contamination due to insufficient decolorizeation. Further, in a system in which a light-sensitive material is heat-developed with a small amount of water being applied thereto, water-soluble dyes, when used, are eluted into the water and contaminate the water. Accordingly, the water cannot be used repeatedly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">An image-forming method which solves the above problems is disclosed in JP-A No. 6-337511. In this method, water-insoluble organic pigments are dispersed in a light-sensitive material in the form of solid fine grains, and the light-sensitive material is heat-developed in the presence of water. Since no organic pigments are transferred to a dye-fixing material, dye images are not contaminated. However, when certain sharpness is to be achieved as described above, transferred images are not usable, and thus there is no choice but to use images formed on the light-sensitive material. This is not preferred, since water-insoluble organic pigments remain on the light-sensitive material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">To solve the above problem, a method of forming images through use of solid dispersion dyes is disclosed in JP-A No. 8-101487. However, this method has been found to involve the following problems: part of dyes are solubilized and move during storage of a light-sensitive material; and the reactivity between couplers and color developing agents deteriorates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">JP-A No. 9-146247 discloses a system in which substances color-developed by leuco dyes and color developers are decolorized by alkali during a development process. This system exhibits excellent decolorizeation, but requires a large amount of color developers. Thus, this system consumes alkali so that the reactivity between couplers and color developing agents deteriorates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For simple, quick processing without use of processing solutions or with minimized use of processing solutions, the present inventors studied a method in which an exposed light-sensitive material is used while it is unfixed. As a result, this method has been found to involve the following problems: the color differentiation of green light and red light from blue light is insufficient due to the insufficient difference between the intrinsic sensitivity of silver halide contained in a blue-light-sensitive layer and that of green-light-sensitive and red-light-sensitive layers; sharpness is impaired due to halation during photographing; and image quality is impaired due to optical scattering caused by remaining silver halide. To solve these problems, the present inventors have found a method in which coloring dyes having a certain structure are introduced into a light-sensitive material, and in addition, a silver halide emulsion which contains tabular grains primarily having (100) and (111) major faces with high silver chloride content is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A photographic silver halide light-sensitive material must have high sensitivity. Sensitivity is effectively increased by increasing the sensitivity of silver halide grains or the amount of application of silver halide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As a technique for applying the advantage of quick development of an emulsion with high silver chloride content to a photographic light-sensitive material, a technique for using in a photographic light-sensitive material an emulsion containing tabular grains having (100) major faces with high silver chloride content is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,264,337, 5,292,632, and 5,310,635 and WO 94/22,054. An emulsion with high silver chloride content was used to obtain a high developing speed, and the same processing solutions can be used for processing both photographic light-sensitive materials and printing light-sensitive materials. However, these publications do not mention the incorporation of certain coloring dyes into a light-sensitive material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Also, according to Japanese Patent Application Publication (JP-B) No. 7-120014, a heat-developable light-sensitive material exhibits high sensitivity and less fogging through use of silver halide grains having (100) major faces and having such an aspect that the length of one side is at least two times or at most 0.5 times an arithmetic mean of lengths of two other sides. However, these methods do not provide improved picture quality, particularly improved sharpness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Silver chloride tabular grains having (100) major faces are also described in various other publications; for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,314,798, EP-534,395A, EP-617,321A, EP-617,317A, EP-617,318A, EP-617,325A, Wo 94/22,051, EP-616,255A, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,356,764, 5,320,938, and 5,275,930.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Tabular grains having (111) major faces are described in various publications, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,439,520. U.S. Pat. No. 5,250,403 describes very thin tabular grains having an average equivalent circular diameter of at least 0.7 Mm and a thickness of not greater than 0.07 Mm. Further, U.S. Pat. No. 4,435,501 discloses a technique for epitaxially growing a silver salt on the surfaces of tabular grains. Also, techniques for the improvement of performance of tabular grains are disclosed in EP-0,699,947A, EP-0,699,951A, EP-0,699,945A, EP-0,701,164A, EP-0,699,944A, EP-0,701,165A, EP-0,699,948A, EP-0,699,946A, EP-0,699,949A, and EP-0,699,950A. These publications disclose techniques regarding silver bromide and silver iodobromide, but do not mention silver halide grains of silver chloride having (111) major faces. Also, no mention was made of actions and effects of coloring dyes having a certain structure in the case where these coloring dyes are used in light-sensitive materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Meanwhile, it is observed that for a light-sensitive material containing processing agents, coloring dyes, if contained, prolong the development time. This is because the coloring dyes consume alkali for their dissociation. Accordingly, it has been difficult in some cases to incorporate a sufficient amount of coloring dyes into a light-sensitive material.</div>

<heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">First will be described dyes of the present invention, which are decolorized through reaction with a decolorizing agent at the time of a development process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The dyes of the present invention are characterized by decolorizeation effected by reaction with a decolorizing agent at the time of a development process as well as characterized by non-diffusion. The dyes are further characterized in that even after they are decolorized in a development process, at least a part of the dyes remains non-diffusible. Through use of such dyes, the invention provides a light-sensitive material having excellent storability, providing images having excellent sharpness and granularity, and capable of being processed in a simple and quick manner.

<div class="description-paragraph">The structure of each of these compounds was confirmed by NMR, MS spectrum, and elementary analysis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The above-mentioned dyes in the present invention are used in a yellow filter layer, a magenta filter layer, or an anti-halation layer, each layer serving as a decolorizing dye layer. Consequently, in case in which the light-sensitive layers comprising a red-sensitive layer, a green-sensitive layer, and a blue-sensitive layer in this order from the most vicinity of the support, a yellow filter layer may be provided between the blue-sentitive layer and the green-sensitive layer; a magenta filter layer may be provided between the green-sensitive layer and the red-sensitive layer; and a cyan filter layer (anti-halation layer) may be provided between the red-sensitive layer and the support. The amounts of dyes are such that transmission densities of the yellow filter layer, magenta filter layer, and the antihalation filter layer for blue light, green light, and red light, respectively, may come to be 0.03 to 3.0, more preferably 0.1 to 2.0. Specifically, the amount may be 0.005 to 2 mmol/m<sup>2</sup>, more preferably 0.05 to 1 mmol/m<sup>2</sup>, depending on ε and the molecular weight of the dye.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The light-sensitive material in the present invention may contain two or more dyes in a single layer. Thus, the above-mentioned anti-halation layer may contain a mixture of an yellow dye, a magenta dye, and a cyan dye.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The light-sensitive material of the present invention contains a decolorizing dye. Before the dye is incorporated into the light-sensitive material, the dye is preferably dissolved in oil and/or an oil-soluble polymer, and then the thus-formed oil droplets are dispersed in a hydrophilic binder. Preferable methods for preparing dye dispersions include an emulsion dispersion method described, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 2,322,027. When this method is used, there may be employed an oil having high boiling point described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,555,470, 4,536,466, 4,587,206, 4,555,476, and 4,599,296 and JP-B No. 3-62256, optionally in combination with an organic solvent having a boiling point of 50° C.-160° C. An oil-soluble polymer may be used instead of the oil or in combination with the oil. Some examples thereof are described in PCT Wo 88/00723. The oil having high boiling point and/or the polymer are used in an amount of 0.01 to 10 g, preferably 0.1 to 5 g per gram of the dye used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Alternatively, the dye may be dissolved in a polymer through a latex dispersion method. Specific examples of latex used for impregnation in the process are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,199,363, German Patent Application Laid-Open (OLS) Nos. 2,541,274, 2,541,230, JP-B No. 53-41091, and EP-029,104.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">To disperse oil droplets in a hydrophilic binder, a variety of surfactants may be used. Such surfactants are described, for example, in JP-A No. 59-157636 (p37-p38) and Kochi Gijutsu Vol. 5 (published in Mar. 22, 1991 by As-tech Company Ltd., p136-p138). Alternatively, phosphate ester-type surfactants described in JP-A Nos. 7-56267 and 7-228589 and German Patent Application Laid-Open No. 932,299A may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The hydrophilic binder may preferably be a water-soluble polymer. Examples of water-soluble polymers may include natural compounds such as proteins (e.g., gelatin and gelatin derivatives); polysaccharides such as cellulose derivatives, starch, acacia, dextrin, and pullulan; and synthetic polymer compounds such as polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and acrylamide polymers. These water-soluble polymers may be used in combination of two or more species. A combination with gelatin is particularly preferred. Gelatin may be selected from among lime-treated gelatin, acid-treated gelatin, and so-called delimed gelatin having a reduced calcium content, which may be used singly or in combination according to the purposes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the present invention, the dyes may decolorizeize through the reaction with a decolorizing agent in the processing stage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The decolorizing agent or a precursor thereof in the present invention is preferably a nucleophilic agent or a precursor thereof, more preferably a base or a precursor thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Examples of the decolorizing agent may include alcohols or phenols (R51OH), amines or anilines ((R52)<sub>3</sub> N), hydroxylamines ((R52)<sub>2</sub> NOR52), sulfinic acids (R51SO<sub>2</sub> H) or their salts, sulfurous acid or their salts, thiosulfuric acid or their salts, carboxylic acids (R51CO<sub>2</sub> H) or their salts, hydrazines ((R52)<sub>2</sub> NN(R52)<sub>2</sub>), guanidines ([(R52)<sub>2</sub> N]<sub>2</sub> C═NH), aminoguanidines ((R52)<sub>2</sub> NR52N(R52N)C═NH), amidines, thiols (R51SH), cyclic or linear active methylene compounds (Z53--CH<sub>2</sub> --Z54, wherein Z53 and Z54 are equivalent to Z51 and Z52 and may be linked to each other to form a ring), and anionic species derived from these compounds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Of these, preferred ones are hydroxylamines, sulfinic acids, sulfurous acids, guanidines, aminoguanidines, heterocyclic thiols, cyclic or linear active methylene compounds, and active methine compounds, with guanidines and aminoguanidines being particularly preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">These decolorizing agents may be added incorporated into light-sensitive materials in advance or incorporated into the materials in processing stages through appropriate methods. Alternatively, the decolorizing agents may be transformed into precursors before being incorporated into the light-sensitive materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The above-mentioned decolorizing agents may decolorizeize the dyes through nucleophilic addition to the dye molecules induced by interaction thereof in processing stages. Preferably, the below-described steps are employed for forming a color image on a silver halide light-sensitive material and for decolorizing the dyes in a simultaneous fashion: image-forming exposing a silver halide light-sensitive material containing dyes; laminating a processing material containing a decolorizing agent or its precursor thereto subsequent to or simultaneous with the exposure so that their film surfaces are affixed to each other; heating; and separating the materials by peeling. In this case, the density of the dye after being decolorized is 1/3 or less, preferably 1/5 or less, the initial density. The amount of the decolorizing agent used is 0.1 to 200 times, preferably 0.5 to 100 times, that of the dye in mol.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The dyes of the present invention are usable in a variety of systems. Preferably, they are used in a system containing a self-contained color developing agent and a coupler. Detailed description of the developing agent and the coupler will be provided hereinlater.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The silver halides which may be used in the present invention are silver chloride, silver bromide, silver iodobromide, silver chlorobromide, silver chloroiodide, or silver chloroiodobromide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The silver halide emulsions used in the present invention may be of the surface latent image type or of the internal latent image type. Internal latent image type emulsions, being used in combination with nucleating agents or fogging agents, serve as direct reversal emulsions. The internal latent image type emulsions may be of the core/shell type in which the inside portion and the surface portion of an emulsion particle have different phases. Alternatively, silver halides having different compositions may be joined together through epitaxial junction. The silver halide emulsions may be monodispersed emulsions or multidispersed emulsions. Preferably, as described in JP-A No. 1-167,743 and 4-223,463, monodispersed emulsions are mixed to thereby adjust gradation. The grain size is preferably within the range of 0.1 to 2 micrometers, particularly preferably 0.2 to 1.5 micrometers. The crystal habit of the silver halide grains may be of a regular crystal shape such as cubic, octahedral, and tetradecahedral; an irregular crystal shape such as spherical and high-aspect-ratio tabular; or of a crystal shape having crystal defect such as twinned crystal planes; or their combined shapes .</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Preferred silver halide grains in the present invention will next be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the present invention, at least one light-sensitive layer contains:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">i) an emulsion containing silver halide grains comprised of at least 50 mol % silver chloride, wherein tabular grains having (100) major faces account for at least 50% of the projected area, each grain having a rectangular projected area of an adjacent edge ratio of 1:1 to 1:2 and an aspect ratio of at least 2; or</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">ii) an emulsion containing silver halide grains comprised of at least 50 mol % silver chloride, wherein tabular grains having (111) major faces account for at least 50% of the projected area, each grain having a hexagonal projected area of an adjacent edge ratio of 1:1 to 1:10 and an aspect ratio of at least 2. In the context of the present invention, it suffices if 50% or more of the projected area of the silver halide grains contained in the emulsion satisfies the above-mentioned requirement. Preferably, not less than 70% of the projection area satisfies the above-mentioned requirement.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As used herein, the term "aspect ratio" refers to a value obtained by dividing the diameter of a circle that defines an area equivalent to the projected area by the grain thickness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a first mode of the present invention, the silver halide grain has (100) major outer surfaces. Therefore, the projected area of the grain provides a rectangular shape. It is necessary that the ratio of adjacent sides of the rectangular projected area fall within the range of 1:1 to 1:2. If an emulsion formed of rod-shaped grains or quasi-cubic rectangular parallelpiped grains is used, the effect of the present invention cannot be obtained. In the present invention, tabular grains each providing a substantially square-shaped projected area having an adjacent side ratio of 1:1 to 1:1.5 are preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a second mode of the present invention, the silver halide grain has (111) major outer surfaces. Therefore, the projected area of the grain provides a hexagonal shape. It is necessary that the ratio of two adjacent sides of the hexagonal projected area fall within the range of 1:1 to 1:10. If an emulsion formed of triangular-shaped grains is used, the effect of the present invention cannot be obtained. In the present invention, tabular grains each providing a substantially regular hexagonal projected area having an adjacent side ratio of 1:1 to 1:5 are preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The shape of the silver halide grains may be determined by electromicroscopy through a carbon replica method in which silver halide grains and latex particles which serve as references for standard sizes are simultaneously subjected to shadowing with heavy metals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Regarding the halogen composition of the silver halide grains of the present invention, the silver chloride based on content of silver chlorobromide, silver chloroiodide, or silver chloroiodobromide is 50 mol % or more. Needless to say, silver chloride itself may be used. Although the emulsions of the present invention may contain silver iodide, the silver iodide content is preferably not less than 2 mol %, more preferably not less than 1 mol %. It is also preferable that the silver halide emulsion is constituted by grains each having a layer structure having a plurality of intra-grain layers of different halogen compositions. When expressed by circle-equivalent projected area, the size of the silver halide grains used in the present invention is preferably 0.1 to 10 micrometers, more preferably 0.3 to 5 micrometers, and most preferably 0.5 to 4 micrometers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In order to prepare an emulsion used in the present invention, i.e., an emulsion containing a silver halide grains comprised of at least 50 mol % silver chloride, wherein tabular grains having (100) major faces account for at least 50% of the projected area, each grain having a rectangular projected area of an adjacent edge ratio of 1:1 to 1:2 and an aspect ratio of at least 2, or an emulsion containing silver halide grains comprised of at least 50 mol % silver chloride, wherein tabular grains having (111) major faces account for at least 50% of the projected area, each grain having a hexagonal projected area of an adjacent edge ratio of 1:1 to 1:10 and an aspect ratio of at least 2, a variety of methods including conventionally known ones may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When emulsions of tabular grains having (100) major outer surfaces with high AgCl content are prepared, methods described, for example, in JP-A Nos. 5-204,073, 51-88,017, 63-24,238, and 7-146,522 may arbitrarily be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Methods for preparing emulsions of tabular grains having (111) major outer surfaces with high AgCl content are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,399,215, 4,404,463, and 5,217,858, and JP-A No. 2-32. In the case of emulsions with high AgCl content, under conditions in which no adsorptive substances are present, (100) faces generally come to be outer surfaces. Therefore, by use of an adsorptive substance that favors the (111) face, and through elimination of nuclei of regular crystals, single twinned crystal nuclei, and non-parallel twinned crystal nuclei during a physical ripening process after twin crystal nuclei are formed, nuclei of parallel multi-twinned crystals can be selectively obtained. The thus-obtained nuclei are allowed to grow, to thereby obtain a light-sensitive silver halide emulsion containing tabular grains. The rule of thumb regarding formation of silver chloride tabular grains showing (111) faces is reported in "Journal of Photographic Science," Vol. 36, page 182 (1988).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The critical point in the preparation of tabular grains used in the present invention is how to make nuclei that grow to have a tabular shape. In this regard, as described in the aforementioned literature in connection with preparation methods, addition of iodide ions or bromide ions during the initial stage of grain formation or addition of a compound that exhibits preferred adsorption on a specific face is effective.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The mean grain thickness of the tabular grains used in the present invention is from 0.01 to 0.5 micrometers, preferably from 0.01 to 0.4 micrometers, most preferably from 0.05 to 0.4 micrometers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The mean grain thickness is an arithmetic average of the thickness of all the tabular grains contained in the emulsion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In order to form tabular grains having a high aspect ratio, it is important that twin crystal nuclei of a small size be formed. To this end, a variety of measures are taken, including low temperature, high pBr content, low pH, use of a reduced amount of a specific type of gelatin with low methionine content or a low molecular weight, or use of a phthalated gelatin derivative, or nuclei formation in a reduced nuclei formation time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">After formation of nuclei, tabular grains (parallel multi-twinned crystal nuclei) alone are formed through physical ripening, to thereby eliminate nuclei of other regular crystals, single twinned crystal nuclei, and non-parallel twinned crystal nuclei so as to selectively form nuclei of parallel multi-twinned crystals. Thereafter, soluble silver salts and soluble halogen salts are added to induce growth of grains, yielding an emulsion formed of tabular grains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The emulsion used in the present invention is preferably monodisperse.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The coefficient of variance of the circle-equivalent diameter of the projected area of all the silver halide grains contained in the emulsion used in the present invention is preferably 30% to 3%, more preferably 25% to 3%, most preferably 20% to 3%. The range over 30% is not preferred in terms of homogeneity of grains. However, the present invention is not limited by this numerical figure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The coefficient of variance of circle-equivalent diameter represents a value obtained by dividing the standard deviation of the circle-equivalent diameters of respective silver halide grains by the mean circle-equivalent diameter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When the grains have phases containing iodides or chlorides, these phases may be uniformly distributed within grains or may be localized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Other silver salts, for example, silver rhodanide, silver sulfide, silver selenide, silver carbonate, silver phosphate, and organic acid salts of silver may be contained as separate grains or part of silver halide grains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The tabular grains of the present invention may have dislocation lines.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A dislocation line is a linear lattice defect occurring along the boundary between a region which has already slid and a region which has not slid yet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">References regarding dislocation lines of a silver halide crystal include: 1) C. R. Berry, J. Appl. Phys., 27, 636 (1956); 2) C. R. Berry, D. C. Skilman, J. Appl. Phys., 35, 2165 (1964); 3) J. F. Hamilton, Phot. Sci. Eng., 11, 57 (1967); 4) T. Shiozawa, J. Soc. Phot. Sci. Jap., 34, 16 (1971); 5) T. Shiozawa, J. Soc. Phot. Sci. Jap., 35, 213 (1972). Dislocation lines can be analyzed by the X-ray diffraction method or the direct observation method through use of a low-temperature transmission electron microscope.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When dislocation lines are to be directly observed through a transmission electron microscope, silver halide grains are sampled from an emulsion while exercising care not to apply so large a pressure as to generate a dislocation line in grains, and the thus-sampled gains are placed on a mesh for observation through an electron microscope and are then observed by the transmission method while being cooled to prevent an electron beam-induced damage (such as printout).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this case, since thicker grains are less likely to transmit an electron beam, it is desirable to use a high-voltage (200 kV or higher for a thickness of 0.25 μm) electron microscope in order to obtain a clear view.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">JP-A No. 63-220,238 discloses a technique related to controlled introduction of dislocation lines into respective silver halide grains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This publication demonstrates that tabular grains in which dislocation lines have been introduced are superior in photographic characteristics such as sensitivity and reciprocity to tabular grains having no dislocation lines.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the case of tabular grains, the position and number of dislocation lines as viewed in a direction perpendicular to the main plane thereof can be obtained for each grain through study of the above-described electron-microphotograph of the grains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Emulsions used in the present invention and other photographic emulsions to be used therewith will next be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Specifically, the present invention can use any of silver halide emulsions prepared using various methods as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,500,626 (column 50), U.S. Pat. No. 4,628,021, Research Disclosure (abbreviated as IM, hereinafter) No. 17,029 (1978), RD No. 17,643, pp. (Dec. 22-23, 1978), RD No. 18,716, p.648 (Nov., 1979), EZ No. 307,105, pp. 863-865 (November, 1989), JP-A Nos. 62-253,159, 64-13,546, 2-236,546, 3-110,555; and further, P. Grafkides, Chemie et Phisque Photographique, Paul Montel, Paris (1967); G. F. Duffin, Photographic Emulsion Chemistry, Focal Press, (1966); V. L. Zelikman et al., Making and Coating Photographic Emulsion, Focal Press, (1964); and so on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a process of preparing the light-sensitive silver halide emulsions used in the present invention, it is prferable to carry out the so-called desalting operation, that is, removal of excess salts from the silver halide emulsions. The removal can be effected using the noodle washing method which comprises gelling the gelatin, or using a flocculation method which takes advantage of a polyvalent anion-containing inorganic salt (such as sodium sulfate), an anionic surfactant, an anionic polymer (such as sodium polystyrenesulfonate), or a gelatin derivative (such as an aliphatic acylated gelatin, an aromatic acylated gelatin or an aromatic carbamoylated gelatin). Preferably, a flocculation method is employed in the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The light-sensitive silver halide emulsions used in the present invention may contain heavy metals such as iridium, rhodium, platinum, cadmium, zinc, thallium, lead, iron and osmium for various purposes. These compounds may be used alone, or as combination of two or more thereof. The amount of heavy metals added, though it depends on their intended purpose, is generally of the order of 10<sup>-9</sup> to 10<sup>-3</sup> mole per mole of silver halide. Those metals may be introduced into emulsion grains so that the distribution thereof is uniform throughout the grains or localized in the inner or surface part of the grains. Specifically, the emulsions described in e.g., JP-A Nos. 2-236,542, 1-116,637 and 4-126,629 are preferably used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the step for the formation of silver halide grains in the light-sensitive silver halide emulsions of the present invention, a rhodanate, ammonia, a tetra-substituted thiourea compound, an organic thioether derivative as described in JP-B No. 47-11,386, a sulfur-containing compound as described in JP-A No. 53-144,319 or so on can be used as a solvent for silver halides.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For details of other conditions descriptions in the above-cited books, namely P. Grafkides, Chemie et Phisque Photographique, Paul Montel, (1967); G. F. Duffin, Photographic Emulsion Chemistry, Focal Press, (1966); and V. L. Zelikman et al., Making and Coating Photographic Emulsion, Focal Press, (1964); may be referred to. Specifically, the present silver halide emulsions can be prepared by any of an acid process, a neutral process and an ammonia process. Further, a method suitably employed for reacting a soluble silver salt with a soluble halide may be any of a single jet method, a double jet method and a combination thereof. In order to obtain a monodisperse emulsion, a double jet method is preferably adopted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Also, a reverse mixing method in which silver halide grains are produced in the presence of excessive silver ions may be employed. In addition, as a type of a double jet method the so-called controlled double jet method may also be used, in which the pAg of the liquid phase from which silver halide grains are to be precipitated is maintained constant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Moreover, for the purpose of increasing the speed of grain growth, the concentration, the amount, and the incorporation rate of a silver salt or a halide may be increased (as described in JP-A Nos. 55-142,329, 55-158,124 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,650,757).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, the agitation of a reaction solution may be carried out by any of known methods. On the other hand, the temperature and the pH of a reaction solution during the formation of silver halide grains may be chosen properly in accordance with the intended purpose. An appropriate pH range is from 2.2 to 8.5, more preferably from 2.5 to 6.0.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Light-sensitive silver halide emulsions are, in general, chemically sensitized silver halide emulsions. In chemically sensitizing light-sensitive silver halide emulsions used in the present invention, there may be used known chemical sensitization processes for emulsions of conventional light-sensitive materials. Examples of these processes include a chalcogen sensitization process (e.g., a sulfur sensitization process, a selenium sensitization process and a tellurium sensitization process), a noble metal sensitization process (using gold, platinum, palladium or the like), and a reduction sensitization process. These processes may be employed alone or in combination of two or more (as described, e.g. in JP-A Nos. 3-110,555 and 5-241,267). Such chemical sensitization may also be carried out in the presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compound (as described in JP-A No. 62-253,159). Further, an anti-fogging agent recited hereinafter may be added after the completion of chemical sensitization. Specifically the addition of an anti-fogging agent can be performed in the ways as described in JP-A Nos. 5-45,833 and 62-40,446.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The pH during the chemical sensitization is preferably from 5.3 to 10.5, and more preferably from 5.5 to 8.5; while the pAg is preferably from 6.0 to 10.5, and more preferably from 6.8 to 9.0.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The amount of coating of light-sensitive silver halide used in the present invention is within the range of 1 mg to 10 g, preferably 0.1 g to 10 g, on a silver basis per square meter of a light-sensitive material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In order to impart color sensitivities, including green sensitivity, red sensitivity, and infrared sensitivity, upon light-sensitive silver halide used in the present invention, light-sensitive silver halide emulsions are spectrally sensitized with methine dyes or other dyes. Further, if necessary, a blue-sensitive emulsion may be spectrally sensitized in the blue color region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Suitable dyes which can be used for the foregoing purpose include cyanine dyes, merocyanine dyes, complex cyanine dyes, complex merocyanine dyes, holopolar cyanine dyes, hemicyanine dyes, styryl dyes and hemioxonol dyes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Specific examples of such sensitizing dyes are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,617,257, JP-A Nos. 59-180,550, 64-13,546, 5-45,828, 5-45,834, and so on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">These sensitizing dyes may be employed individually or in combination. In particular, combinations of sensitizing dyes are often used for supersensitization or for wavelength adjustment of spectral sensitization.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In addition to sensitizing dyes, there may be incorporated, into silver halide emulsions, other dyes which themselves do not spectrally sensitize silver halide emulsions, or compounds which do not substantially absorb light in the visible region but can exhibit supersensitizing effect (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,615,641 and JP-A No. 63-23,145).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">These sensitizing dyes may be added to silver halide emulsions during, before, or after the chemical ripening, or before or after the formation of the nuclei of silver halide grains according to the descriptions of U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,183,756 and 4,225,666. These sensitizing dyes and supersensitizers may be added to the emulsion as a solution in an organic solvent, such as methanol, dispersion in gelatin or solution containing a surfactant. A suitable amount of each of such ingredients added is generally in the range of from 10<sup>-8</sup> to 10<sup>-2</sup> mole per mole of silver halide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Additives used in the aforementioned steps and known photographic additives which can be used in the present invention are described in the aforementioned RD Nos. 17,643, 18,716 and 307,105, and the portions where relevant descriptions are given are shown below.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">(RC: right column, LC: left column)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the first and second embodiments of the light-sensitive material according to the second aspect of the present invention, the light-sensitive material is constructed such that a photographic constituent layer placed on a support therefor, the photographic constituent layer including at least one photographic light-sensitive layer formed of light-sensitive silver halide, a compound that forms a dye through a coupling reaction with an oxidized product of a developing agent (the compound will hereafter may be referred to as a coupler), and a binder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the present invention, there may basically be employed color reproduction through a subtractive color process in order to prepare a light-sensitive material used for recording original scenes and reproducing recorded scenes in the form of color images. That is, there are provided at least three light-sensitive layers which have individual photosensitivities in blue, green, and red regions, each of which layers contains a color coupler capable of forming dyes of yellow, magenta, or cyan having the relation of a complementary color to its own light-sensitive wavelength region, thereby recording color information regarding original scenes. Color photographic printing paper having the relationship between light-sensitive wavelengths and hues to be developed similar to that of the light-sensitive material is exposed to light which has passed through the thus-obtained dye images, to thereby reproduce original scenes. Alternatively, information regarding dye images obtained through the photographing of original scenes may be read by a scanner or the like, and based on the thus-read information, images may be reproduced for viewing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The light-sensitive material of the present invention may comprise a light-sensitive layer sensitive to light of three or more wavelength regions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Also, light-sensitive wavelength regions and hues to be developed may have relationship other than the above-mentioned relationship of a complementary color and light sensitive. In such a case, read image information may undergo image processing such as hue conversion so as to reproduce original color information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to the present invention, it is preferable that at least two kinds of silver halide emulsions sensitive to light of the same wavelength region and having different mean grain projected areas be contained. The expression "sensitive to light of the same wavelength region" as used in the present invention refers to "effectively sensitive to light of the same wavelength region." Accordingly, even when emulsions are somewhat different in spectral sensitivity, the emulsions are considered as sensitive to light of the same wavelength region if their major light-sensitive regions overlap each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this case, difference in mean grain projected area between the emulsions is preferably 1.25 times, more preferably 1.4 times or greater, most preferably 1.6 times or greater. When three kinds or more of emulsions are used, this relationship is preferably satisfied between emulsions having a smallest mean grain projected area and a largest mean grain projected area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to the present invention, in order to incorporate in a light-sensitive material a plurality of emulsions sensitive to light of the same wavelength region and having different mean grain projected areas, separate light-sensitive layers may be provided for respective emulsions, or alternatively a single light-sensitive layer may mixedly contain these emulsions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When these emulsions are contained separately in respective layers, an emulsion having a greater mean grain projected area is preferably contained in an upper layer (positioned closer to an incident light source).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When these emulsions are contained separately in respective layers, color couplers to be combined preferably have the same hue. However, light-sensitive layers may have different hues to be developed through the mixing of couplers which develop into different hues. Alternatively, couplers having different hue-absorbing profiles may be contained in respective light-sensitive layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the present invention, emulsions sensitive to light of the same wavelength region are preferably applied such that the ratio of the number of silver halide grains per unit area of a light-sensitive material contained in these emulsions comes to be greater than the ratio of a value obtained by dividing the amount of silver of an applied emulsion by the mean grain projected area of silver halide grains contained in the emulsion to the 3/2 power and such that this tendency is more remarkable for an emulsion having a greater mean grain projected area. This provides images having good granularity even when development is performed at high temperatures. Also, high developing performance and wide exposure latitude are both attained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Conventionally, in order to attain a desired granularity value of a color negative for photographing use, not only has a silver halide emulsion been improved, but also there has been used a so-called DIR coupler which releases a development-inhibiting compound upon coupling reaction with an oxidized product of a developing agent. A light-sensitive material of the present invention provides an excellent granularity value even when no DIR coupler is used, and will provide a more improved granularity value when a DIR compound is used in combination.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the present invention, organometal salts may be used as oxidizer together with light-sensitive silver halide. Among these organometal salts, an organic silver salts are particularly preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Examples of the organic compounds which may be used for the preparation of the above-mentioned organic silver salts serving as an oxidant include benzotriazoles, fatty acids and other compounds described in U. S. Pat. No. 4,500,626, columns 52-53. The silver acetylide, which is described in U. S. Pat. No. 4,775,613, is also useful. These organic silver salts may be used alone or in a combination of two or more of them.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The organic silver salts may be used in an amount of from 0.01 to 10 moles, preferably from 0.01 to 1 mole, per mole of light-sensitive silver halide. The total weight of the light-sensitive silver halide and the organic silver salts used for coating is in the range of 0.05 to 10 g/m<sup>2</sup>, preferably 0.1 to 4 g/m<sup>2</sup>, in terms of the weight of silver.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The binder for a constituent layer of the light-sensitive material is preferably hydrophilic material, examples of which include those described in the aforementioned RD, and those described at pages 71-75 of JP-A No. 64-13546. Specifically, the binder is preferably a transparent or translucent hydrophilic binders, exemplified by a naturally occurring compound, such as a protein including gelatin and a gelatin derivative; and polysaccharides including a cellulose derivative, starch, gum arabic, dextran and pullulane, as well as a synthetic polymer such as polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone and acrylamide polymer. Also usable as the binder is a highly water-absorbent polymer described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,960,681 and JP-A No. 62-245,260. More specifically, those polymers are homo- or copolymers of vinyl monomers having --COOM or --SO<sub>3</sub> M (wherein M stands for a hydrogen atom or an alkali metal), and copolymers of a vinyl monomer having the foregoing group and other vinyl monomers (e.g., such as sodium methacrylate and ammonium methacrylate, Sumikagel L-5H, trade name, a product of Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.). The binders recited above may be used in combination of two or more thereof. In particular, it is preferable to use gelatin in combination with some of the foregoing binders. As for the gelatin, lime-processed gelatin, acid-processed gelatin or delimed gelatin having reduced contents of calcium and the like may be properly chosen depending on the intended purpose. Also, it is preferable that those gelatins be used in combination.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the present invention, the weight of the binder used for coating is preferably not more than 30 g/m<sup>2</sup>, more preferably 1 g/m<sup>2</sup> to 20 g/m<sup>2</sup>, most preferably 2 g/m<sup>2</sup> to 15 g/m<sup>2</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Four-equivalent couplers and two-equivalent couplers may both be used in the present invention. Their non-diffusion groups may form a polymer chain. Specific examples of such couplers are described in detail in T.H. James, "The Theory of the Photographic Process," 4th edition, pages 291-334 and 354-361, and JP-A Nos. 58-123,533, 58-149,046, 58-149,047, 59-111,148, 59-124,399, 59-174,835, 59-231,539, 59-231,540, 60-2,950, 60-2,951, 60-14,242, 60-23,474, 60-66,249, 8-110,608, 8-146,552 and 8-146,578.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">In addition, the electron donor precursors as described in JP-A No. 3-160,443 are preferable for use in the light-sensitive material of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For such purposes as prevention of color mixing, improvement in the color reproduction and the like, a reducing agent may be used in an intermediate layer or in a protective layer.

<div class="description-paragraph">In the present invention, the total amounts of the developing agent and the reducing agent is 0.01-20 moles, preferably 0.01-10 moles, per mole of silver.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the present invention, four-equivalent couplers or two-equivalent couplers may be suitably selected in accordance with the species of the developing agent. Proper selection of couplers prevents production of dull colors attributed to interlayer transfer of oxides of the developing agent. Specific examples of both types of couplers, i.e., four-equivalent couplers and two-equivalent couplers, are described in detail in "The Theory of the Photographic Process," 4th edition, edited by T. H. James, at pages 291-334, 354-361, JP-A No. 58-12,353, 58-149,046, 58-149,047, 59-11,114, 59-124,399, 59-174,835, 59-231,539, 59-231,540, 60-2,951, 60-14,242, 60-23,474, 60-66,249, and other patents and literature listed hereinabove.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Hydrophobic additives such as couplers, and developing agents to form a hue may be introduced into layers of a light-sensitive material by known methods described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,322,027. In this case, an organic solvent having a high boiling point described in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,555,470, 4,536,466, 4,536,467, 4,587,206, 4,555,476, 4,599,296, or JP-B No. 3-62,256 may be used, if necessary, in combination with an organic solvent having a low boiling point in the range of 50° to 160° C. These dye-donating compounds, and high-boiling-point organic solvents may be used in combinations of two or more species.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The amount of the organic solvent having a high boiling point is not more than 10 g, preferably not more than 5 g, more preferably in the range of 1 g to 0.1 g based on 1 g of hydrophobic additive; or not more than 1 cc, preferably not more than 0.5 cc, particularly preferably not more than 0.3 cc based on 1 g of the binder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A dispersion method utilizing a polymer as described in JP-B No. 51-39,853 and JP-A No. 51-59,943 and a method wherein a hydrophobic additive converted into a dispersion of fine grains is added to a light-sensitive material as described in JP-A No. 62-30,242 may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In addition to the above methods, in the case where the hydrophobic additive is a compound substantially insoluble in water, the hydrophobic compound may be converted into a dispersion of fine grains and included in a binder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When dispersing a hydrophobic compound to form a hydrophilic colloidal dispersion, a variety of surfactants may be used. For example, surfactants described in JP-A No. 59-157,636, pp. 37-38 and in the aforesaid Research Disclosure may be used. In addition, a phosphoric ester-type surfactant described in JP-A Nos. 7-56,267 and 7-228,589 and in German Patent Application Laid-Open No. 1,932,299A may also be used in the light-sensitive material of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The light-sensitive material of the present invention may contain a compound which activates the development and stabilizes the image. Preferred examples of these compounds are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,500,626, columns 51-52.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The light-sensitive material used in the present invention may include at least three types of light-sensitive layers having different spectral sensitivities and different hues of dyes with one another. Each of the layers may be separated into a plurality of silver halide emulsion layers which have substantially same color sensitivity, but different light sensitivity. Each of the aforementioned three types of layers are preferably sensitive to one of blue light, green light, or red light. The arrangement is generally in order of a red-sensitive layer, a green-sensitive layer, and a blue-sensitive layer from the support. Other arrangements may be employed according to purposes. For example, an arrangement described in JP-A No. 7-152,129 may be employed. Silver halides, dye-donating couplers, and color developing agents of the present invention may be included in the same layer, or may be added different layers so long as they can react. For example, when a layer containing a color developing agent and a layer containing a silver halide are disposed separately, the raw storage stability of a light-sensitive material can be enhanced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The relationship of each layer's spectral sesitivity and a coupler's hue is arbitrary. When a light-sensitive material is constructed such that it incorporates a cyan coupler into a red-sensitive layer, a magenta coupler into a green-sensitive layer, and a yellow coupler into a blue-sensitive layer, conventional color papers may be used for direct exposure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Other than the aforementioned yellow filter layer, magenta filter layer, and cyan filter layer, a variety of non-light-sensitive layers such as a protective layer, an undercoat layer, or an intermediate layer may be formed between the silver halide emulsion layers of the light-sensitive material, on the top emulsion layer, or on the bottom emulsion layer thereof. Further, a variety of supplementary layers, such as a back layer, may be formed on the reverse side of the support. More specifically, it is possible to form various layers including the above-mentioned construction layer, an undercoat layer described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,051,335, an intermediate layer containing a solid pigment described in JP-A Nos. 1-167,838 and 61-20,943, an intermediate layer containing a reducing agent or a DIR compound described in JP-A Nos. 1-120,553, 5-34,884 and 2-64,634, an intermediate layer containing an electron transport layer described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,017,454 and 5,139,919 and in JP-A No. 2-235,044 and a protective layer containing a reducing agent described in JP-A No. 4-249,245 as well as a combination of two or more of these layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A dye which may be used in a yellow filter layer or in an antihalation layer is preferably a dye which loses its color or which is eliminated at the time of development so that it exerts no influence on the density of image after the process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The dye which is present in the yellow filter layer or in the antihalation layer loses its color or is eliminated at the time of development when the amount of the dye remaining after processing is less than one third, preferably less than one tenth, of the amount of the dye present before processing. This may be attained by a phenomenon wherein the component of the dye is leached out of the light-sensitive material or is transferred into the processing material at the time of development, or by a phenomenon wherein the component of the dye undergoes a reaction and becomes a colorless compound at the time of development.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The light-sensitive material of the present invention is preferably hardened with a hardener.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Examples of the hardener include those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,678,739, column 41 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,791,042, and in JP-A Nos. 59-116,655, 62-245,261, 61-18,942 and 4-218,044. More specifically, examples of these hardeners include an aldehyde (e.g., formaldehyde), an aziridine, an epoxy, a vinylsulfone (e.g., N,N'-ethylene-bis(vinylsulfonylacetamide)ethane), a N-methylol compound (e.g., dimethylolurea), boric acid, metaboric acid and a polymeric compound (e.g., a compound described in JP-A No. 62-234,157).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">These hardeners are used in an amount of 0.001 to 1 g, preferably, 0.005 to 0.5 g, per gram of a hydrophilic binder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The light-sensitive material may contain an anti-fogging agent or a photographic stabilizer as well as a precursor thereof, examples of which include the compounds described in the aforesaid Research Disclosure, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,089,378, 4,500,627 and 4,614,702, JP-A No. 64-13,564, pp. 7-9, pp. 57-71 and pp. 81-97, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,775,610, 4,626,500 and 4,983,494, JP-A Nos. 62-174,747, 62-239,148, 1-150,135, 2-110,557, 2-178,650 and RD 17,643 (1978) pp. 24-25.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The amount of these compounds is preferably in the range of 5×10<sup>-6</sup> to 1×10<sup>-1</sup> mole, more preferably 1×10<sup>-5</sup> to 1×10<sup>-2</sup> mole, per mole of silver.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">After the light-sensitive material of the present invention has undergone image-forming exposure, images are formed by first bonding the post-exposure light-sensitive material to a processing material having a support and a base and/or a base precursor provided thereon so that the light-sensitive layer surface and the processing layer surface of the processing material are bonded to each other, and subsequently subjecting to a heat development. It is preferable that water in an amount of 10% to 100% that required for the maximum swelling of the entirety of the coating films which constitute the light-sensitive material and the processing material is supplied to the light-sensitive material or the processing material during heat development, and thereafter the two materials are attached to each other and heated for color generation and development. However, the present invention is not limited by such a mode. Also, the developing agent may preferably be incorporated into the light-sensitive material or the processing material according to needs. Again, the present invention is not limited to this mode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The light-sensitive material of the present invention may be processed under conditions where unreacted silver halide remains unfixed. In this case, a color image is formed on the light-sensitive material, where silver halide remains. In other words, in the case in which a light-sensitive material is used while retaining the residual silver halide thereon, the present light-sensitive material containing an emulsion of tabular, high-AgCl-content grains having (100) or (111) major faces provides images having excellent sharpness as compared with when other types of silver halide are used, and when the coloring dye of the present invention having a specific structure is used in combination, even enhanced sharpness can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention was made in an attempt to attain excellent granularity and exposure latitude as well as improved sharpness when the aforementioned heat development is performed, and further to mitigate the load imposed on the environment which may otherwise be incurred by solution development. However, the present invention may be applied to an activator method through use of an alkaline processing solution, or a method in which images are developed through use of a processing solution containing a development agent and a base.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A thermal process of a light-sensitive material is well known in the art. For example, a light-sensitive material for heat development and a heat development process are described in "Shashinkogaku no kiso (Fundamentals of Photographic Engineering)", pp. 553-555, Corona Co., Ltd.

<div class="description-paragraph">The term "activator process" refers to a developing process in which a light-sensitive material containing a color developing agent is treated with a processing solution containing no color developing agent. The characteristic feature of the activator process is that the processing solution for the process does not contain a color developing agent which is contained in an ordinary developing solution. The processing solution for the activator process may contain other components, such as an alkali and an auxiliary developing agent. Examples of the activator processes are described in literature such as EP-A Nos. 545,491A1 and 565,165A1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Methods for developing a light-sensitive material by means of a processing solution containing a developing agent and a base are described in RD Nos. 17,643, pp. 28-29, 18,716, pp. 651, left column to right column, and 307,105, pp. 880-881.</div>

In addition, also usable in the present invention is a base generating method in which a combination of a slightly water-soluble basic metal compound and a compound capable of reacting with the metal contained in the foregoing basic metal compound by use of water as a medium to form a complex compound (hereinafter referred to as a complex forming compound) is used, as described in and EP-A No. 210,660 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,740,445.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The amount of the base or the base precursor to be used in the present invention is in the range of 0.1 to 20 g/m<sup>2</sup>, preferably 1 to 10 g/m<sup>2</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The light-sensitive material of the present invention may contain a thermal solvent so as to accelerate heat development. Examples of the thermal solvent include polar organic compounds described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,347,675 and 3,667,959.

Electroconductive inorganic particles, such as SnO<sub>2</sub> and Sb<sub>2</sub> O<sub>5</sub>, may be provided onto the surface of the support to impart surface roughness so that the surface condition is improved. Further, it is preferable that the support is designed in such a way that the tips of the roll are slightly elevated relative to other parts so that transfer of the cut end mark in the roll core is prevented. Although the heat process may be carried out after film forming, after surface process, after application of back layer (e.g., antistatic agent, lubricating agent or the like) and after application of undercoatr, the heat process is carried out preferably after the application of an anti-static agent.</div>

No. 4,740,445, combination use of a slightly water-soluble basic metal compound and a compound which is capable of forming a complex compound with metal ions in the basic metal compound mediated by water (called a complexing compound) may be advantageously employed for forming a base. In this case, the slightly water-soluble basic metal compound is preferably incorporated in the light-sensitive material and the complexing compound is preferably incorporated in the processing material or vice versa. Particularly, a method for forming guanidines may be advantageously employed in that the formed guanidines may also serve as an effective dye-decolorizing agent.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">Other mordants described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,675,316 and 2,882,156 may also be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the present invention, a development stop agent may be incorporated in the processing material, so that the agent acts simultaneously with development.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As used herein, the development stop agent is a compound that immediately neutralizes or reacts with base to reduce the concentration of the base contained in the film to thereby stop development, or a compound that interacts with silver or silver salts to inhibit development. Specific examples of the development stop agent may include acid precursors that release acid by the application of heat, electrophilic compounds that causes substitution reaction with co-existing base, nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds, and mercapto compounds and their precursors. More specific examples are described in JP-A No. 62-253,159 on pp. 31-32.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Also, the following is an advantageous combination: a zinc salt of mercaptocarboxylic acid described in JP-A No. 8-54,705 is incorporated into the light-sensitive material, and one of the aforementioned complex-forming compounds is incorporated into the processing material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Similarly, a printout preventive agent that acts on silver halide may be contained in the processing material so that the agent acts during development. Examples of the printout preventive agent may include monohalogen compounds described in JP-B No. 54-164, trihalogen compounds described in JP-A No. 53-46,020, compounds described in JP-A 48-45,228 which are constituted by a halogen and aliphatic carbon atoms bonded to the halogen, and polyhalogen compounds typified by tetrabromoxylene described in JP-B 57-8,454. Development inhibitors, for example, 1-Phenyl-5-mercaptotetrazole described in British Patent No. 1,005,144 are also effective.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The amount of the printout preventive agent may be preferably 10<sup>-4</sup> to 1 mole, particularly preferably 10<sup>-3</sup> to 10<sup>-1</sup> mole, per mole of silver.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Alternatively, the processing material may contain a physical development nucleus and the solvent for silver halide, so that the solvent for silver halide solubilizes the silver halide contained in the light-sensitive material concurrently with development and fixes the silver halide to the processing layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The physical development nucleus reduces the soluble silver salt diffused from the light-sensitive material to convert it to physically developed silver which is to be fixed to the processing layer. Any physical development nucleus known as such may be used in the present invention. Examples of the physical development nucleus include colloidal particales of a heavy metal (such as zinc, mercury, lead, cadmium, iron, chromium, nickel, tin, cobalt, copper, and ruthenium), a noble metal (such as palladium, platinum, silver, and gold), a chalcogen compound composed of the foregoing and a substance, for example, sulfur, selenium or tellurium. These physical development nucleus substances are obtained by reducing a corresponding metal ion utilizing a reducing agent such as ascorbic acid, sodium borohydride or hydroquinone to produce a colloidal dispersion of metal or by mixing the corresponding metal ion with a solution of soluble sulfide, selenide or telluride to produce a colloidal dispersion of insoluble metal sulfide, metal selenide or metal telluride, respectively. These colloidal grains are formed preferably in a hydrophilic binder such as gelatin. The method for preparing colloidal silver grains is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 2,688,601. If necessary, a desalting process may be conducted in the preparation of the colloidal silver, as is known in a method for preparing silver halide emulsion wherein excessive salt is removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The grain diameters of these physical development nuclei are preferably in the range of 2 to 200 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The physical development nuclei are present in an amount ranging normally from 10<sup>-3</sup> to 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, preferably from 10<sup>-2</sup> to 10 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, in the processing layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Although the physical development nuclei may be prepared separately from a coating solution and thereafter the physical development nuclei may be added to the coating solution, the physical development nuclei may be prepared, for example, through the reaction between silver nitrate and sodium sulfide or between silver chloride and a reducing agent in a coating solution containing a hydrophilic binder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Silver, silver sulfide, palladium sulfide or the like is preferably employed as a physical development nucleus. When using as an image the physically developed silver, which has been transferred to a processing material, it is preferable to use palladium sulfide, silver sulfide and the like, because they have small Dmin and high Dmax values.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The solvent for silver halide may be a known compound, examples of which include thiosulfates (such as sodium thiosulfate and ammonium thiosulfate), sulfites (such as sodium sulfite and sodium hydrogen sulfite), thiocyanates (such as potassium thiocyanate and ammonium thiocyanate), thioethers (such as 1,8-di-3,6-dithiaoctane, 2,2'-thiodiethanol, 6,9-dioxa-3,12-dithiatetradecane-1,14-diol as described in JP-B No. 47-11,386), a compound having a 5- or 6-membered imido ring (such as urasil and hydantoin as described in Japanese patent application No. 6-325,350), and a compound represented by the following general formula (VI) as described in JP-A No. 53-144,319. A mesoion thiolate compound of trimethyltriazolium thiolate described in "Analytica Chemica Acta", vol. 248, pp. 604 to 614 (1991), is also a preferred compound. A compound which is described in Japanese patent application No. 6-206,331 and which is capable of fixing and stabilizing silver halide may also be used as a solvent for silver halide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">
</div> <pre listing-type="equation" xml:space="preserve">N(R.sup.1)(R.sup.2)--C(═S)--X--R.sup.3                 (VI)</pre>
<div class="description-paragraph">wherein X represents a sulfur atom or an oxygen atom, each of R<sup>1</sup> and R<sup>2</sup>, which may be the same or different, represents an aliphatic group, an aryl group, a heterocyclic residue or an amino group, R<sup>3</sup> represents an aliphatic group or an aryl group, wherein R<sup>1</sup> and R<sup>2</sup> or R<sup>2</sup> and R<sup>3</sup> may join together to form a 5-membered or a 6-membered heterocyclic ring. The above-described solvents for silver halide may be used in combination.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Among the above-described compounds, a compound having a 5-membered or 6-membered imido ring, such as sulfite, urasil or hydantoin, is particularly preferred. The addition of urasil or hydantoin in the form of potassium salt is preferable, because the salt can suppress gloss reduction during the storage of the processing material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The content of the total amount of the solvent for silver halide in the processing layer is in the range of 0.01 to 50 mmol/m<sup>2</sup>, preferably 0.1 to 30 mmol/m<sup>2</sup>, and more preferably 1 to 20 mmol/m<sup>2</sup>. The total amount of the solvent for the silver halide in the light-sensitive material is in the range of 1/20 to 20 times, preferably 1/10 to 10 times, and more preferably 1/3 to 3 times the amount (mol) of silver coated on the light-sensitive material. When using the solvent for silver halide, it may be added to a solvent, such as water, methanol, ethanol, acetone, dimethylformamide or methylpropyl gycol, or to an alkaline or acidic aqueous solution, or otherwise a dispersion comprising fine solid grains of the solvent for the silver halide may be added to a coating solution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The processing material, similar to the light-sensitive material, may contain a variety of auxiliary layers such as a protective layer, undercoat layer, a back layer, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The processing material is preferably constructed such that a processing layer is provided on a continuous web.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As used herein, the term "the continuous web of the processing material" refers to the mode in which the length of the processing material is sufficiently longer than the major side of the corresponding light-sensitive material when processing is performed, so that the processing material can be used without being cut at a portion thereof, and long enough so as to enable processing of a plurality of light-sensitive materials. Generally, the length of the processing material is 5 times or more the width but 1,000 times or less the width. Although the width of the processing material is arbitrarily determined, it is preferably not shorter than the width of the corresponding light-sensitive material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to another preferable mode, a plurality of light-sensitive materials are processed in parallel. In this case, the width of the processing material is preferably equal to or more than the "width of the light-sensitive material"×"number of light-sensitive materials that are processed in parallel."</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Such a continuous-web-type processing material is particularly advantageous when the light-sensitive material has a length of 50 cm or more, or when a plurality of light-sensitive materials are continuously processed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Also, when such a continuous web processing material is used, the light-sensitive material can be easily peeled off the processing material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The continuous-web-type processing material is preferably fed from a feeding roll, and disposed of by being wound on a take-up roll. Particularly in the case in which the light-sensitive material has a large size, this makes disposal of the waste material quite easy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As described above, the continuous-web-type processing material considerably improves handling thereof as compared with conventional sheet materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Although the thickness of the support used in the processing material of the present invention is arbitrarily determined, the thinner may be preferable. Particularly preferably, the thickness is between 4 μm to 40 μm, inclusive. When the thickness falls within this range, the amount of the processing material per unit area increases, to thereby make the processing material roll compact.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The material of support is not particularly limited, and any material that withstands temperature during processing may be used. Generally, there may be employed a photographic support such as paper, a synthetic polymer (film), and the like, as described in "Shashinkogaku no kiso--Gin'en Shashin Hen (Fundamentals of Photographic Engineering--Silver Salt Photography Section)," pp. 223-240, edited by Photographic Society of Japan and published by Corona Co., Ltd., 1979. Specific examples of the support include polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene naphthalate, polycarbonate, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, polypropylene, polyimide, and cellulose (e.g., triacetylcellulose). Alternatively, there may be used these films in which pigments such as titanium dioxide are incorporated, synthetic paper made from polypropylene, mixed paper made from synthetic resin pulp and natural pulp, Yankee paper, baryta paper (photographic base paper), and coated paper (especially cast-coat paper).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">These may be used singly or in combination therewith. Alternatively, synthetic polymer may be laminated onto either face or both faces of the paper to construct a support.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Other supports which may be used in the present invention may include those described in JP-A Nos. 62-253,159, pp. 29-31, 1-161,236, pp. 14-17, 63-316,848, 2-22,651 and 3-56,955 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,001,033.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Also preferable is a support mainly made from a styrene-based polymer having a syndiotactic structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The surfaces of these supports may be coated with a hydrophilic binder and an antistatic agent such as carbon black and semiconductive metal oxides such as alumina sol and tin oxide. Aluminum-deposited supports may also be advantageously used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the present invention, a preferable method of developing a light-sensitive material that has been used in photographing with a camera, etc. may include applying a specific amount of water (10% to 100% that required for the maximum swelling of the entirety of the coating films excepting back layers of both the light-sensitive material and the processing material) to the light-sensitive material or the processing material, superposing the light-sensitive material and the processing material one on another, and then heating at a temperature between 60° C. and 100° C. for 5 to 60 seconds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the present invention, the light-sensitive material and/or the processing material are attached to each other in a state swollen with water. Since the swollen film is unstable, it is critical that the amount of water be limited to the above range so as to prevent local unevenness of color development.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The amount of water required for achieving the maximum swelling can be obtained by immersing in water the light-sensitive material having a coating film thereon to be measured, and when sufficiently swollen, measuring the film thickness, and subtracting the weight of the coating film from the computed maximum swelling volume. An example of measuring the swelling degree is also described in Photographic Science Engineering, vol. 16, page 449 (1972).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the present invention, it is primarily attempted that image information is acquired in the form of digital data by use of a scanner or a similar device with developed silver that has been produced from the development process and undeveloped silver halide not being removed. However, the conventional approach of analog-mode optically exposure on a print material such as color paper may also be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the present invention, after photographing and subsequent image forming, other methods for preventing obstacles against perfect reading of images may also be used in combination. Particularly, since undeveloped silver halide produces high haze in gelatin film to elevate the density of the background of an image, silver halide used in the present is considered to be advantageous in reduction of such an effect. However, the detailed mechanism will be elucidated by future research.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In order to make prints on color paper or heat development light-sensitive materials by use of such color photographic materials, there may be used methods described in JP-A No. 5-241,251, 5-19,364, and 5-19,363.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention will be described in detail by way of examples.</div>
<heading>Example 1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Preparation of tabular silver iodobromide emulsion</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(Step A): An aqueous solution (1,600 cc) containing gelatin (7.5 g) and KBr (4.3 g) was stirred while the temperature of the solution was maintained at 40° C. Aqueous 1.2 M AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution (41 cc) and aqueous 1.4 M KBr/KI solution (41 cc) containing KI (12 mol%) were simultaneously added thereto in double jets for 40 seconds. Gelatin (36 g) was added. Subsequently, the temperature of the mixture was raised to 58° C. Aqueous 0.4 M AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution (36 cc) and subsequently ammonia were added. The mixture was aged for 15 minutes and neutralized with acetic acid. Aqueous 1.9 M AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution (782 cc) and aqueous 1.9 M KBr solution (700 cc) were added for 17 minutes while pAg being maintained at 8.4 and the flow rate being accelerated (the flow at the point of completion of addition was 4.2 times that at the point of starting addition). Thereafter, the resultant emulsion was cooled to 35° C. and washed by use of the customary flocculation method. Gelatin (49 g) was added so as to adjust pH to 5.5 and pAg to 8.8. The thus-obtained emulsion contained 1.2 mol of silver and 65 g of gelatin per kg. The grains in the emulsion were tabular grains having a size of 0.27 microns.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(Step B) An aqueous solution (1,150 cc) containing the thus-obtained emulsion (30 g, which served as a seed emulsion), gelatin (33 g), and KBr (1.2 g) was stirred while the temperature of the mixture was maintained at 75° C. Aqueous 1.8 M AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution (387 cc) and aqueous 1.6 M KBr/KI solution (427 cc) containing KI (10 mol %) were added thereto for 38 minutes in double jets with the flow rate being accelerated (the flow at the point of completion of addition was 3.3 times that at the point of starting addition).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(Step C) Subsequently, the mixture was cooled to 55° C. Aqueous 1 M AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution (30 cc) and aqueous 0.3 M KI solution (100 cc) were quantitatively added over 3 minutes, and then aqueous KBr solution was added to adjust pAg 9.1. Thereafter, an aqueous 2 M AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution (194 cc) and aqueous 2.2 M KBr solution (165 cc) were added.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Subsequently, the resultant emulsion was cooled to 35° C. and washed by use of the customary flocculation method. Gelatin (75 g) was added so as to adjust pH to 5.8 and pAg to 8.9.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Tabular grains having a mean equivalent spherical diameter of 0.86 microns were obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The thus-obtained emulsion was subjected to spectral and chemical sensitization by the addition of the below-described spectral sensitizing dyes (blue-sensitive, green-sensitive, and red-sensitive), Compound I, potassium thiocyanate, chloroauric acid, and sodium thiosulfate at 60° C., pH=6.2, and pAg=8.4. The amount of chemical sensitizing agent was adjusted so as to maximize the sensitivity for exposure of 1/100 sec.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">The thusprepared lightsensitive material I101, cut to have an ordinary 135 negative film size, perforated, and housed in a camera, was used for photographing a person and a Macbeth chart.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">To the lightsensitive layer surface of the lightsensitive material which had been used for photography was applied 40° C. water in an amoun of 15 cc/m<sup>2</sup> (corresponding to 45% of the volume of maximum swelling) and the waterapplied surface was superposed on the film of processing material IR-1. Heat was applied for 20 seconds from the back surface of the lightsensitive material by use of a 83° C. heat drum. When the processing material IR-1 was peeled off from the lightsensitive material I101, there was obtained a negative image on the lightsensitive material. This image was read with a digital image reading device FRONTIER SP1000 (by Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.), imageprocessed, and output by use of a heat development printer (PICTOGRAPHY 3000, Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.). The prints of the person's figure were excellent in respect of sharpness and granularity. When the light sensitive material was similarly processe after being left to stand for three days under humidity of 80%, excellent prints were obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The dye compounds according to the present invention, exhibited excellent decolorizing properties upon processing, and the dyes were completely decolorized when they underwent processing. Also, analysis of the processing material after processing revealed that neither compounds of the present invention nor adducts of guanidinium picolinate (nucleophoic reagent, i.e., decolorizing agent) were present.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Moreover, there was obtained an unexpected effect that addition of the dye of the preset invention improved stability of the emulsions over time.</div>
<heading>Comparative Example 1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Each of the following dyes (yellow, magenta, and cyan; 4 g each) was combined with 25% aqueous solution (4 g) of surfactant (30) and water (92 ml), and the mixture was processed for 24 hours in a DINOMILL by use of glass beads (mean diameter: 0.75 mm). The glass beads were removed, and a dispersion of each solid dye was obtained. ##STR258##</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">By use of these dye dispersions, a lightsensitive material I102 was prepared. The lightsensitive material I102 contained the abovedescribed solid dye dispersions instead of the yellow, magenta, and cyan dyes contained in lightsensitive material I101 prepared in Example 1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When similar procedures in Example 1, i.e., photographing, heat development, reading, image processing, and outputting, were performed by use of the lightsensitive material I102, prints of the person's figure with excellent sharpness and granularity were obtained. However, when the light sensitive material I102 was similarly processed after being left to stand at 45° C. for three days under humidity of 80%, sensitivity of the lightsensitive material decreased to provide images with poor quality, as the images on the negative did not sufficiently develop color</div>

An aqueous solution (A) (10.5 ml) containing silver nitrate (0.5 g) and an aqueous solution (B) (10 ml) containing potassium bromide (0.35 g) were added thereto with vigorous stirring over 150 seconds. Thirty seconds following completion of addition, 10% aqueous potassium bromide solution (12 ml) was added. Thirty seconds thereafter, the temperature of the reaction mixture was elevated to 75° C. Lime-treated gelatin (35.0 g) and distilled water (250 ml) were added, and subsequently, an aqueous solution (C) (39 ml) containing silver nitrate (10.0 g) and an aqueous solution (D) (30 ml) containing potassium bromide (6.7 g) were added for 3 minutes and 15 seconds with the rate of addition being increased. Subsequently, an aqueous solution (E) (302 ml) containing silver nitrate (96.7 g) and an aqueous solution (F) containing potassium iodide and potassium bromide (molar ratio=7:93, the concentration of potassium bromide: 26%) were added over 20 minutes with the rate of addition being increased. During the addition, the silver potential of the reaction mixture was controlled to be -20 mV with respect to the saturated calomel electrode. Furthermore, an aqueous solution (G) (97 ml) containing silver nitrate (24.1 g) and a 21.9% aqueous potassium bromide solution (H) were added over 3 minutes so that the silver potential of the reaction mixture was 25 mV with respect to the saturated calomel electrode. After completion of addition, the reaction mixture was maintained at 75° C. for 1 minute, and then the reaction mixture was cooled to 55° C. Subsequently, 1N sodium hydroxide solution (15 ml) was added. Two minutes thereafter, an aqueous solution (I) (100 ml) containing silver nitrate (5 g) and an aqueous solution (j) (200.5 ml) containing potassium iodide (4.7 g) was added over 5 minutes.

<div class="description-paragraph">The support used in the present invention was prepared as follows:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Polyethylene-2,6-naphthalate (PEN) polymer (100 parts by weight) was compounded with Tinuvin P.326 (Ciba-Geigy; a UV absorber, 2 parts by weight) and brought to dryness. The compound was melted at 300° C. and extruded through a T-shaped die. The extruded material was subjected to longitudinal stretching (×3.3) at 140° C. and subsequently to transversal stretching (×3.3) at 130° C. The resultant stretched film was thermally set at 250° C. for 6 seconds to thereby obtain a PEN film having a thickness of 92 μm. To the thus-obtained PEN film were added blue dyes, magenta dyes, or yellow dyes (I-1, I-4, I-6, I-24, I-26, I-27, and II-5 described in Technical Disclosure Bulletin No. 94-6023) to obtain a yellow concentration of 0.01, a magenta concentration of 0.08, and a cyan concentration of 0.09. The film was wound on a stainless steel rod having a diameter of 20 cm, and a thermal hysteresis was applied at 113° C. for 30 hours, to thereby obtain a support resistant to curling.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Coating of an undercoating layer</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The thus-obtained support was subjected to corona discharge treatment, UV discharge treatment, and glow treatment on both surfaces. To the surface on which a light-sensitive layer was provided, an undercoat liquid (10 cc/m<sup>2</sup>) containing gelatin (0.1 g/m<sup>2</sup>), sodium α-sulfo-di-2-ethylhexylsuccinate (0.01 g/m<sup>2</sup>), salicylic acid (0.025 g/m<sup>2</sup>), PQ-1 (0.005 g/m<sup>2</sup>), and PQ-2 (0.006 g/m<sup>2</sup>) was applied by use of a bar coater so as to provide an undercoat layer, which thereafter was dried at 115° C. for 6 minutes.

<div class="description-paragraph">Warm water (40° C., 18 ml/m<sup>2</sup>) was applied to the surface of the exposed light-sensitive material, and this surface was attached to the surface of processing material II-P-1 in a face-to-face manner. Heat was applied thereto by use of a heat drum at 83° C. for 15 seconds. Subsequently, a light-sensitive material was peeled off to confirm that a wedge-like image which developed magenta color was obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For fixing purposes, a second step was performed by use of processing material II-P-2. Briefly, in the second step, water (12 cc/m<sup>2</sup>) was applied to processing material II-P-2, the surface of the wet material was bonded in a face-to-face manner to the previously processed (first step) light-sensitive material, and the integrated body was heated at 70° C. for 20 seconds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When the unexposed portions of the obtained samples were visually checked, all colored layers were found to be completely decolorized. The transmission density of each of the colored samples was measured, and sensitivity of each light-sensitive material was determined by use of a so-called characteristic curve. When the relative sensitivity was expressed by an inverse number of the amount of exposure corrsponding to the density 0.15 higher than the fogging density, light-sensitive materials II-101 through II-106 were all fall within the same range with variation within ±0.1. Therefore, these light-sensitive materials were found to have almost identical sensitivities.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The maximum density of these samples were measured. In all cases, bleaching of silver halide was not performed. In both cases of presence and absence of fixing procedure, almost the same results were obtained. The results obtained in the case of absence of fixing procedure are shown in Table 23.</div>
