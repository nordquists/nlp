<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0610">Compounds of the formula 1 may contain chiral centers and therefore may exist in different enantiomeric and diastereomeric forms. This invention relates to all optical isomers and all stereoisomers of compounds of the formula 1, both as racemic mixtures and as individual enantiomers and diastereoisomers of such compounds, and mixtures thereof, and to all pharmaceutical compositions and methods of treatment defined above that contain or employ them, respectively. Individual isomers can be obtained by known methods, such as optical resolution, fractional crystallization, optically selective reaction, or chromatographic separation in the preparation of the final product or its intermediate. Individual enantiomers of the compounds of formula 1 may have advantages, as compared with the racemic mixtures of these compounds, in the treatment of various disorders or conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0611">In so far as the compounds of formula 1 are basic compounds, they are all capable of forming a wide variety of different salts with various inorganic and organic acids. Although such salts must be pharmaceutically acceptable for administration to animals, it is often desirable in practice to initially isolate the base compound from the reaction mixture as a pharmaceutically unacceptable salt and then simply convert to the free base compound by treatment with an alkaline reagent and thereafter convert the free base to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. The acid addition salts of the base compounds of this invention are readily prepared by treating the base compound with a substantially equivalent amount of the chosen mineral or organic acid in an aqueous solvent or in a suitable organic solvent, such as methanol or ethanol. Upon careful evaporation of the solvent, the desired solid salt is readily obtained. The acids which are used to prepare the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the aforementioned base compounds of this invention are those which form non-toxic acid addition salts, i.e., salts containing pharmaceutically acceptable anions, such as the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, nitrate, sulfate or bisulfate, phosphate or acid phosphate, acetate, lactate, citrate or acid citrate, tartrate or bi-tartrate, succinate, maleate, fumarate, gluconate, saccharate, benzoate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate and pamoate (i.e., 1,1′-methylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate)) salts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0612">The present invention also includes isotopically labeled compounds, which are identical to those of formula 1, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the present invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, sulfur, fluorine and chlorine, such as <sup>2</sup>H, <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>11</sup>C, <sup>14</sup>C, <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>18</sup>O, <sup>17</sup>O, <sup>31</sup>P, <sup>32</sup>P, <sup>35</sup>S, <sup>18</sup>F, and <sup>36</sup>Cl, respectively. Compounds of the present invention, prodrugs thereof, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said compounds or of said prodrugs which contain the aforementioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Certain isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as <sup>3</sup>H and <sup>14</sup>C are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated, i.e., <sup>3</sup>H, and carbon-14, i.e., <sup>14</sup>C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., <sup>2</sup>H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labeled compounds of formula 1 and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the Examples below, by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.</div>

In general, these compounds are most desirably administered in doses ranging from about 3 mg to about 600 mg per day, in single or divided doses (i.e., from 1 to 4 doses per day), although variations will necessarily occur depending upon the species, weight and condition of the patient being treated and the patient's individual response to said medicament, as well as on the type of pharmaceutical formulation chosen and the time period and interval at which such administration is carried out. However, a dosage level that is in the range of about 10 mg to about 100 mg per day is most desirably employed. In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effects, provided that such higher dose levels are first divided into several small doses for administration throughout the day.</div>

Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often very useful for tabletting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in gelatin capsules; preferred materials in this connection also include lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs are desired for oral administration, the active ingredient may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matter or dyes, and, if so desired, emulsifying and/or suspending agents as well, together with such diluents as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin and various like combinations thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0688">For parenteral administration, solutions of a compound of the present invention in either sesame or peanut oil or in aqueous propylene glycol may be employed. The aqueous solutions should be suitably buffered (preferably pH greater than 8) if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic.

The preparation of all these solutions under sterile conditions is readily accomplished by standard pharmaceutical techniques well known to those skilled in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0689">This invention relates to methods of treating anxiety, depression, schizophrenia and the other disorders referred to in the description of the methods of the present invention, wherein a novel compound of this invention and one or more of the other active agents referred to above (e.g., an NK1 receptor antagonist, tricyclic antidepressant, 5HT1D receptor antagonist, or serotonin reuptake inhibitor) are administered together, as part of the same pharmaceutical composition, as well as to methods in which such active agents are administered separately as part of an appropriate dose regimen designed to obtain the benefits of the combination therapy. The appropriate dose regimen, the amount of each dose of an active agent administered, and the specific intervals between doses of each active agent will depend upon the subject being treated, the specific active agent being administered and the nature and severity of the specific disorder or condition being treated. In general, the novel compounds of this invention, when used as a single active agent or in combination with another active agent, will be administered to an adult human in an amount from about 3 mg to about 300 mg per day, in single or divided doses, preferably from about 10 to about 100 mg per day. Such compounds may be administered on a regimen of up to 6 times per day, preferably 1 to 4 times per day, especially 2 times per day and most especially once daily. Variations may nevertheless occur depending upon the species of animal being treated and its individual response to said medicament, as well as on the type of pharmaceutical formulation chosen and the time period and interval at which such administration is carried out. In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effect, provided that such larger doses are first divided into several small doses for administration throughout the day.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0690">A proposed daily dose of a 5HT reuptake inhibitor, preferably sertraline, in the combination methods and compositions of this invention, for oral, parenteral or buccal administration to the average adult human for the treatment of the conditions referred to above, is from about 0.1 mg to about 2000 mg, preferably from about 1 mg to about 200 mg of the 5HT reuptake inhibitor per unit dose, which could be administered, for example, 1 to 4 times per day. A proposed daily dose of a 5HT1D receptor antagonist in the combination methods and compositions of this invention, for oral, parenteral, rectal or buccal administration to the average adult human for the treatment of the conditions referred to above, is from about 0.01 mg to about 2000 mg, preferably from about 0.1 mg to about 200 mg of the 5HT1D receptor antagonist per unit dose, which could be administered, for example, 1 to 4 times per day.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0691">For intranasal administration or administration by inhalation, the novel compounds of the invention are conveniently delivered in the form of a solution or suspension from a pump spray container that is squeezed or pumped by the patient or as an aerosol spray presentation from a pressurized container or a nebulizer, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. The pressurized container or nebulizer may contain a solution or suspension of the active compound. Capsules and cartridges (made, for example, from gelatin) for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of a compound of the invention and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch. Formulations of the active compounds of this invention for treatment of the conditions referred to above in the average adult human are preferably arranged so that each metered dose or “puff” of aerosol contains 20 μg to 1000 μg of active compound. The overall daily dose with an aerosol will be within the range 100 μg to 10 mg. Administration may be several times daily, for example 2, 3, 4 or 8 times, giving for example, 1, 2 or 3 doses each time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0692">The ability of the novel compounds of this invention to bind to the dopamine D<sub>2 </sub>receptor can be determined using conventional radioligand receptor binding assays. All receptors can be heterologously expressed in cell lines and experiments conducted in membrane preparations from the cell lines using procedures outlined below. IC<sub>50 </sub>concentrations can be determined by nonlinear regression of concentration-dependent reduction in specific binding. The Cheng-Prussoff equation can be used to convert the IC<sub>50 </sub>to Ki concentrations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0006">Dopamine D<sub>2 </sub>Receptor Binding Assay:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0693">[<sup>3</sup>H]Spiperone binding to a membrane preparation from CHO-hD<sub>2</sub>L cells is carried out in 250 μl of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>and 1% DMSO at pH 7.4. Duplicate samples containing (in order of addition) the test compounds, 0.4 nM [<sup>3</sup>H]spiperone and approximately 12 μg protein are incubated for 120 minutes at room temperature. Bound radioligand is separated by rapid filtration under reduced pressure through Whatman GF/B glass fiber filters previously treated with 0.3% polyethyleneimine. Radioactivity retained on the filter is determined by liquid scintillation spectrophotometry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0694">Title compounds of the Examples, below, were tested using the above assay, in which specific binding determined in the presence of 1 mM haloperidol was 95%. All of the title compounds exhibited Ki values less than or equal to 75 nM (see Tables 1 and 2, below). Preferred embodiments of compounds of the present invention preferably exhibit Ki values of no more than 100 nM, more preferably no more than 50 nM, even more preferably no more than 25 nM, most preferably no more than 10 nM.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0695">D<sub>2 </sub>intrinsic activity of title compounds of the Examples, below, was determined using the [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine uptake assay described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0007">[<sup>3</sup>H]Thymidine Uptake Assay for D<sub>2 </sub>Intrinsic Activity</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0696">Cells are serum deprived by washing twice with 200 μl of serum-free media. 90 μl serum-free media was added to each well. The plates ware incubated for two to three hours. 10 μl of serum-containing media, as a positive control, vehicle (serum-free media), negative control (an antagonist) or test compounds and standards (10 μl of a 10 μM solution for a final concentration of 1 μM) in serum-free media were added to wells. The plates are returned to the incubator. Eighteen hours later [<sup>3</sup>H]thymidine is added (0.5 μCi/well in 10 μl of serum-free media) and the plates are returned to the incubator. Four hours later trypsin (0.25%) is added (100 μl/well). The plates are returned to the incubator, once again. One hour later the assay is terminated by rapid filtration through Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters. Filters are washed four times with 500 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.0 buffer, for example, using a Brandel MLR-96T cell harvester. Radioactivity remaining on the filters are estimated, for example, with a Wallac 1205 Betaplate liquid scintillation counter (50% efficiency). Intrinsic activity is defined as total uptake (1 μM Quinpirole) minus serum-free media (no uptake). Test compounds are compared to 1 μM Quinpirole (full DA agonist), which was classified as 100% intrinsic activity. All assays are preferably performed in triplicate, with each drug occupying one full column (8 wells) per plate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0697">Compounds of the present invention preferably exhibit at least 1% to up to 90% intrinsic activity, more preferably at least 10% to up to 90% activity, more preferably at least 10% to up to 80% activity, more preferably at least 20% to up to 60% intrinsic activity, even more preferably at least 30% to up to 50% intrinsic activity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0698">Each of the title compounds produced as described in the Examples, below, were also tested using the above assay. All of the title compounds tested in this assay exhibited an intrinsic activity between 2 and 83 percent. See Tables 1 and 2, below, for results obtained from each of the compounds tested.</div>

<heading>Synthesis of 7-{4-[4-(2,3-Dichloro-phenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-butoxy}-3,4-dihydro-1H-[1,8]naphthyridin-2-one</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0702">A first intermediate compound, 2-Benzyloxy-7-chloro-[1,8]naphthyridine, was produced, as follows. To a solution of benzyl alcohol (5.0 mL, 48.0 mmol) in THF (50 mL) cooled to 0° C. was added KOtBu (1M in THF, 46 mL, 46.0 mmol). The solution was stirred at 0° C. for 20 min and then added via cannula to a suspension of 2,7-dichloro-[1,8]naphthyridine (10.0 g, 50.2 mmol, J. Org. Chem. 1981, 46, 833) in DMF (50 mL) and THF (50 mL) cooled to 0° C. The orange suspension was stirred at 0° C. for 15 min and at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction was quenched with saturated NH<sub>4</sub>Cl and H<sub>2</sub>O. The mixture was extracted with EtOAc. The organic layer was filtered through celite to remove an orange clay-like precipitate. The organic layer was washed with H<sub>2</sub>O and brine, and concentrated to give an orange solid. The solid was absorbed onto SiO<sub>2 </sub>and purified by liquid chromatography (2% EtOAC/48% Hexanes/50% CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>) to give the first intermediate compound as a white solid (6.37 g, 23.5 mmol, 51%). MS: APCI: M+1: 271.0 (Exact Mass: 270.06).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0703">A second intermediate compound, 2-Benzyloxy-7-(4-benzyloxy-butoxy)-[1,8]naphthyridine, was produced, as follows. To a solution of 4-benzyloxy-1-butanol (4.9 mL, 28.2 mmol, 1.2 equiv) in THF (20 mL) cooled to 0° C. was added KO<sup>t</sup>Bu (1M in THF, 27 mL, 27 mmol, 1.15 equiv).

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0706">A fourth intermediate compound, 4-(7-Oxo-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-[1,8]naphthyridin-2-yloxy)-butyraldehyde, was produced using either a Dess-Martin oxidation reaction or a Swern oxidation reaction, as described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0707">Dess-Martin oxidation: To a cloudy solution of the Dess-Martin periodinane (2.80 g, 6.60 mmol, 1.5 equiv) in CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2 </sub>(13 mL) was added a solution of 7-(4-hydroxy-butoxy)-3,4-dihydro-1H-[1,8]naphthyridin-2-one (1.04 g, 4.40 mmol) in CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2 </sub>(25 mL) via cannula. The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 5 h and stored in the freezer overnight. A 1:1 mixture of saturated Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>and saturated NaHCO<sub>3 </sub>(50 mL) was added followed by Et<sub>2</sub>O. The mixture was stirred for 10 min and then extracted with Et<sub>2</sub>O/EtOAc (2:1). The organic layer was washed with saturated NaHCO<sub>3 </sub>and brine, dried over Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>and concentrated to give the fourth intermediate compound as a pale yellow oil (1.06 g, used crude in next reaction). MS: APCI: M+1: 235.1 (Exact Mass: 234.10).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0708">Swern oxidation: A solution of oxalyl chloride (9.97 mL, 112 mmol) in CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2 </sub>was cooled to −70° C. and DMSO (15.6 mL, 220 mmol) was carefully added. The solution was stirred at −60° C. for 10 min and then a solution of 7-(4-hydroxy-butoxy)-3,4-dihydro-1H-[1,8]naphthyridin-2-one (23 g, 97.5 mmol) in DMSO (70 mL) was added dropwise at ˜50˜–60° C. The reaction mixture was stirred at −60° C. for 20 min and then triethylamine (72 mL, 0.513 mol) was added dropwise. The reaction was warmed to room temp and stirred for 30 min. The mixture was poured into ice-water and the organic phase was separated. The aqueous phase was extracted with CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, combined with the organic phase, washed with brine, dried over Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and concentrated under vacuum to give the crude product. Purification by column chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate 2:1) followed by recrystallization provided the fourth intermediate compound (12.7 g, 54.3 mmol, 56%).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0709">In the final step of the synthesis reaction, the title compound, 7-{4-[4-(2,3-Dichloro-phenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-butoxy}-3,4-dihydro-1H-[1,8]naphthyridin-2-one was produced as follows: To a solution of 4-(7-oxo-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-[1,8]naphthyridin-2-yloxy)-butyraldehyde (1.06 g, crude from previous reaction) was added a solution of 2,3-dichlorophenylpiperazine (1.02 g, 4.40 mmol) in dichloroethane (5 mL). The solution was stirred for 15 min and NaBH(OAc)<sub>3 </sub>(1.21 g, 5.72 mmol, 1.3 equiv) was added as a powder. The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 3 h and quenched with saturated NaHCO<sub>3 </sub>and H<sub>2</sub>O. The mixture was extracted with EtOAc. The organic layer was washed with saturated NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O and brine, dried over Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>and concentrated to give a yellow foam/oil. Purification by liquid chromatography (4% MeOH/CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>) afforded the title compound as a white foam (1.20 g, 2.67 mmol, 61% over 2 steps). The HCl salt was formed by dissolving the title compound (800 mg, 1.78 mmol) in Et<sub>2</sub>O (20 mL) and CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2 </sub>(2 mL) followed by the addition of 1N HCl in Et<sub>2</sub>O (1.75 mL). The resulting white precipitate was collected by filtration, washed with Et<sub>2</sub>O and dried to give a white solid (801 mg). MS: APCI: M+1: 449.1 (Exact Mass: 448.14).</div>
