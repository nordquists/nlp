<heading>CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">This application claims benefit of U.S. provisional application 60/618,203, filed Oct. 12, 2004, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">The invention relates to a chemical genus of peri-substituted, bicyclic acids useful for the treatment and prophylaxis of occlusive artery disease and related prostaglandin-mediated disorders.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Atherosclerosis is the pathology underlying several of mankind's most lethal diseases, such as myocardial infarction and peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD). PAOD represents atherosclerosis of the large and medium arteries of the limbs, particularly to the lower extremities, and includes the aorta and iliac arteries. It often coexists with coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease. Persons with PAOD are at increased risk of other vascular events such as myocardial infarction or stroke [Waters, R E, Terjung R L, Peters K G &amp; Annex B H. J. Appl. Physiol. 2004; Ouriel K. Lancet, 2001, 258:1257-64; Kroger, K. Angiology, 2004, 55:135-138]. Clinically significant lesions may gradually narrow the peripheral arteries leading to pain on walking usually relieved by rest (claudication), ischemic ulcers, gangrene, and sometimes limb amputation. Medical therapy is generally ineffective but operations bypassing or replacing the lesion with artificial or venous grafts improve blood flow distally, at least until they become restenosed [Haustein, K. O., <i>Int. J. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther., </i>35:266 (1997)]. Recently, it has been discovered through human genetic linkage studies that DNA variants of the PTGER3 gene that encodes the prostaglandin E<sub>2 </sub>receptor subtype 3 (known as EP3) increase the risk of an individual developing PAOD (see US published application 2003/0157599). Thus, antagonists of prostaglandin E<sub>2 </sub>(PGE<sub>2</sub>) binding to the EP3 receptor may provide effective treatment or prophylaxis for PAOD.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">In response to various extracellular stimuli, prostaglandins are rapidly generated from free arachidonic acid through the consecutive action of the cyclo-oxygenases and synthases. The prostaglandins exert their action in close proximity to the site of their synthesis. To date, eight prostanoid receptors have been cloned and characterized. These receptors are members of the growing class of G-protein-coupled receptors. PGE<sub>2 </sub>binds preferentially to the EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4 receptors; PGD<sub>2 </sub>to the DP and FP receptors; PGF<sub>2α</sub>, to the FP and EP3 receptors; PGI<sub>2 </sub>to the IP receptor and TXA<sub>2 </sub>to the TP receptor. PGE<sub>2 </sub>binding to the EP3 receptor has been found to play a key role in the regulation of ion transport, smooth muscle contraction of the GI tract, acid secretion, uterine contraction during fertilization and implantation, fever generation and hyperalgesia. The EP3 receptor has been detected in many organs such as the kidney, the gastrointestinal tract, the uterus and the brain. In the cardiovascular system, EP3 is expressed by vascular endothelium and smooth muscle, and at least four isoforms of EP3 are expressed on human platelets [Paul, B. Z., B. Ashby, and S. B. Sheth, Distribution of prostaglandin IP and EP receptor subtypes and isoforms in platelets and human umbilical artery smooth muscle cells. British Journal of Haematology, 1998. 102(5): p. 1204-11.]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">Prostanoids, acting through specific membrane receptors belonging to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have an essential role in vascular homeostasis, including platelet function regulation. Among the prostanoids, thomboxane A2 (TxA<sub>2</sub>) is a potent stimulator of platelet aggregation, whereas prostaglandin (PG) I<sub>2 </sub>inhibits their activation. On the other hand, prostaglandin E<sub>2 </sub>(PGE<sub>2</sub>) has been reported to have a biphasic effect on platelet response, potentiating their aggregation at low concentrations and inhibiting it at higher concentrations. It has been shown that the stimulatory effects of PGE<sub>2 </sub>on platelet aggregation are exerted mainly through EP3 receptor, one of the four subtypes of receptors activated by PGE<sub>2</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">Local synthesis of prostaglandins in the arterial vessel wall may play a profound role in atherosclerosis. While only COX-1 is present in the healthy vessel wall, both COX-1 and COX-2 are present in arteriosclerotic plaque [Schonbeck, U., et al., Augmented expression of cyclooxygenase-2 in human atherosclerotic lesions. Am J Pathol, 1999. 155(4): p. 1281-91; Cipollone, F., et al., Overexpression of functionally coupled cyclooxygenase-2 and prostaglandin E synthase in symptomatic atherosclerotic plaques as a basis of PGE<sub>2</sub>-dependent plaque instability. Circulation, 2001. 104(8): p. 921-7]. Their increased expression, together with increased expression of prostaglandin E synthase, may account for the increased production of PGE<sub>2 </sub>noted above. In genetically modified mice lacking the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R), formation of atherosclerotic plaque can be reduced by treatment with rofecoxib, a selective inhibitor of COX-2, through reducing production of PGE<sub>2 </sub>and other prostaglandins [Burleigh M E, Babaev V R, Oates J A, Harris R C, Gautam S, Riendeau D, Marnett L J, Morrow J D, Fazio S, Linton M F. Cyclooxygenase-2 promotes early atherosclerotic lesion formation in LDL receptor-deficient mice. Circulation. Apr. 16, 2002;105(15):1816-23].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">Within the atherosclerotic plaque, vascular smooth muscle cells have been shown to express EP3 receptors and PGE<sub>2 </sub>stimulates their proliferation and migration, a hallmark of atherosclerotic plaque formation [Blindt R, Bosserhoff A K, vom Dahl J, Hanrath P, Schror K, Hohlfeld T, Meyer-Kirchrath J. Activation of IP and EP(3) receptors alters cAMP-dependent cell migration. Eur J Pharmacol. May 24, 2002;444(1-2):31-7]. It is, therefore, plausible that chronically inflamed vessels produce sufficient quantities of PGE<sub>2 </sub>to activate EP<sub>3 </sub>receptors on vascular smooth muscles cells (contributing to atherosclerotic lesion formation) and on platelets (contributing to thrombosis). Locally produced PGE<sub>2 </sub>(from platelets themselves, vessel wall components, and inflammatory cells) potentiates platelet aggregation by suboptimal amounts of prothrombotic tissue factors, which might not cause aggregation by themselves, through priming of protein kinase C. The intracellular events triggered by activation of the EP<sub>3 </sub>receptor may enhance platelet aggregation by opposing the effect of PGI<sub>2 </sub>and enhancing the effects of primary aggregating agents such as collagen. EP<sub>3 </sub>receptor activation may therefore contribute to atherosclerosis and the risk of thrombosis observed in pathological states such as vasculitis and PAOD.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">Current treatments for PAOD either address increased risk for cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke, or provide symptomatic relief for claudication. All of these treatments affect platelet function. Treatments reducing risk for cardiovascular events include low dose asprin (sufficient to reduce platelet aggregation while still permitting the production of PGI<sub>2 </sub>by the vessel wall) and inhibitors of the platelet adenosine diphosphate receptor inhibitor (clopidogrel). Binding of adenosine diphosphate to the platelet adenosine diphosphate receptor causes a drop in platelet cAMP with consequent platelet activation and aggregation. Treatments providing symptomatic relief from claudication include platelet phosphodiesterase type 3 inhibitors such as cilostazol which act to increase intracellular levels of cAMP. Inhibitors of the platelet adenosine diphosphate receptor or the platelet phosphodiesterase type 3 act directly or indirectly to increase the content of cAMP in platelets, thereby inhibiting platelet activation and consequent aggregation with thrombus formation. PGE<sub>2 </sub>binding to EP3 acts to decrease cAMP, therefore an antagonist of PGE<sub>2 </sub>binding to the EP3 receptor, by opposing the PGE<sub>2</sub>-dependent decrease in cAMP needed to induce platelet activation and consequent aggregation, or by opposing the PGE<sub>2</sub>-dependent decrease in vascular smooth muscle cell cAMP needed to stimulate migration, might be expected to provide therapeutic benefit in PAOD. Such an antagonist may also be disease-modifying by inhibiting or reducing atherosclerotic plaque formation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">Prostaglandins furthermore have been implicated in a range of disease states including pain, fever or inflammation associated with rheumatic fever, influenza or other viral infections, common cold, low back and neck pain, skeletal pain, post-partum pain, dysmenorrhea, headache, migraine, toothache, sprains and strains, myositis, neuralgia, synovitis, arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis, degenerative joint diseases (osteoarthritis), gout and ankylosing spondylitis, bursitis, burns including radiation and corrosive chemical injuries, sunburns, pain following surgical and dental procedures, immune and autoimmune diseases; cellular neoplastic transformations or metastic tumor growth; diabetic retinopathy, tumor angiogenesis; prostanoid-induced smooth muscle contraction associated with dysmenorrhea, premature labor, asthma or eosinophil related disorders; Alzheimer's disease; glaucoma; bone loss; osteoporosis; Paget's disease; peptic ulcers, gastritis, regional enteritis, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis or other gastrointestinal lesions; GI bleeding; coagulation disorders selected from hypoprothrombinemia, hemophilia and other bleeding problems; and kidney disease.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">While circulating levels of prostanoids are extremely low in healthy individuals [FitzGerald G A, Brash A R, Falardeau P &amp; Oates J A. JCI 1981 68:12472-1275], the local concentration of PGE<sub>2 </sub>can dramatically increase in inflammatory states. For example, the local production of PGE<sub>2 </sub>was shown in vitro to increase more than 30-fold in aortoiliac occlusive disease [Reilly J, Miralles M, Wester W &amp; Sicard G. Surgery, 1999, 126:624-628]. It is, therefore, plausible that chronically inflamed vessels produce sufficient quantities of PGE<sub>2 </sub>to activate EP<sub>3 </sub>receptors on platelets. In this environment, the intracellular events triggered by activation of the EP<sub>3 </sub>receptor may enhance platelet aggregation by opposing the effect of PGI<sub>2 </sub>and enhancing the effects of primary aggregating agents such as ADP. EP<sub>3 </sub>receptor activation may therefore contribute to the thrombosis observed in pathological states such as vasculitis and atherosclerosis. Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease (PAOD) is an atherosclerotic illness that affects primarily the elderly as a consequence of occlusion of the lumen of peripheral arteries, mainly the femoral artery and it is associated with an increased risk of vascular events as myocardial infraction or stroke [Waters, R E, Terjung R L, Peters K G &amp; Annex B H. J. Appl. Physiol. 2004; Ouriel K. Lancet, 2001, 258:1257-64; Kroger, K. Angiology, 2004, 55:135-138]. Several clinical studies have shown that treatment with prostaglandins improves PAOD symptoms [Reiter M, Bucek R, Stumpflen A &amp; Minar E. Cochrane Database Syst. Rev. 2004, 1:CD000986; Bandiera G, Forletta M, Di Paola F M, Cirielli C. Int. Angiol. 2003, 22:58-63; Matsui K, Ikeda U, Murakami Y, Yoshioka T, Shimada K. Am. Heart J. 2003, 145:330-333] supporting the linkage between PAOD and prostanoid receptor function.</div>

<heading>DEFINITIONS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">Throughout this specification the terms and substituents retain their definitions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">Alkyl is intended to include linear, branched, and, except when otherwise specified, cyclic hydrocarbon structures and combinations thereof. Lower alkyl refers to alkyl groups of from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Examples of lower alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, s-and t-butyl and the like. Preferred alkyl and alkylene groups are those of C<sub>20 </sub>or below. Cycloalkyl is a subset of alkyl and includes cyclic hydrocarbon groups of from 3 to 8 carbon atoms. Examples of cycloalkyl groups include c-propyl, c-butyl, c-pentyl, norbornyl, adamantyl and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">C<sub>1 </sub>to C<sub>20 </sub>Hydrocarbon includes alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl and combinations thereof. Examples include benzyl, phenethyl, cyclohexylmethyl, camphoryl and naphthylethyl.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">Alkoxy or alkoxyl refers to groups of from 1 to 8 carbon atoms of a straight, branched, cyclic configuration and combinations thereof attached to the parent structure through oxygen. Examples include methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, cyclopropyloxy, cyclohexyloxy and the like. Lower-alkoxy refers to groups containing one to four carbons.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">Oxaalkyl refers to alkyl residues in which one or more carbons (and their associated hydrogens) have been replaced by oxygen. Examples include methoxypropoxy, 3,6,9-trioxadecyl and the like. The term oxaalkyl is intended as it is understood in the art [see <i>Naming and Indexing of Chemical Substances for Chemical Abstracts</i>, published by the American Chemical Society, ¶196, but without the restriction of ¶127(a)], i.e. it refers to compounds in which the oxygen is bonded via a single bond to its adjacent atoms (forming ether bonds). Similarly, thiaalkyl and azaalkyl refer to alkyl residues in which one or more carbons have been replaced by sulfur or nitrogen, respectively. Examples include ethylaminoethyl and methylthiopropyl. The term “oxo” referring to a substituent intends double-bonded oxygen (carbonyl). Thus, for example, the excluded “oxo” ring systems are:</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">Acyl refers to groups of from 1 to 8 carbon atoms of a straight, branched, cyclic configuration, saturated, unsaturated and aromatic and combinations thereof, attached to the parent structure through a carbonyl functionality. One or more carbons in the acyl residue may be replaced by nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur as long as the point of attachment to the parent remains at the carbonyl. Examples include formyl, acetyl, propionyl, isobutyryl, t-butoxycarbonyl, benzoyl, benzyloxycarbonyl and the like. Lower-acyl refers to groups containing one to four carbons.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">Aryl and heteroaryl mean a 5- or 6-membered aromatic or heteroaromatic ring containing 0-3 heteroatoms selected from O, N, or S; a bicyclic 9- or 10-membered aromatic or heteroaromatic ring system containing 0-3 heteroatoms selected from O, N, or S; or a tricyclic 13- or 14-membered aromatic or heteroaromatic ring system containing 0-3 heteroatoms selected from O, N, or S. Aromatic 6- to 14-membered carbocyclic rings include, e.g., benzene, naphthalene, indane, tetralin, and fluorene and the 5- to 10-membered aromatic heterocyclic rings include, e.g., imidazole, pyridine, indole, thiophene, benzopyranone, thiazole, furan, benzimidazole, quinoline, isoquinoline, quinoxaline, pyrimidine, pyrazine, tetrazole and pyrazole.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">Arylalkyl means an alkyl residue attached to an aryl ring. Examples are benzyl, phenethyl and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">Substituted alkyl, aryl, cycloalkyl, heterocyclyl etc. refer to alkyl, aryl, cycloalkyl, or heterocyclyl wherein up to three H atoms in each residue are replaced with halogen, haloalkyl, hydroxy, loweralkoxy, carboxy, carboalkoxy (also referred to as alkoxycarbonyl), carboxamido (also referred to as alkylaminocarbonyl), cyano, carbonyl, nitro, amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, mercapto, alkylthio, sulfoxide, sulfone, acylamino, amidino, phenyl, benzyl, heteroaryl, phenoxy, benzyloxy, or heteroaryloxy. In the claims below, methylenedioxy and ethylenedioxy are mentioned as substituents. While methylenedioxy is attached at adjacent carbons on the ring, ethylenedioxy can be attached either at adjacent carbons on the ring or at the same carbon, forming a spirodioxole (ketal), analogous to the spirothiazolidinyl.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">The term “halogen” means fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">The term “prodrug” refers to a compound that is made more active in vivo. Activation in vivo may come about by chemical action or through the intermediacy of enzymes. Microflora in the GI tract may also contribute to activation in vivo.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">In the characterization of the variables, it is recited that A and B represent a pair of fused 5-, 6- or 7-membered rings and that the fused A/B ring system may contain from zero to four heteroatoms chosen from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur. It is intended that these rings may exhibit various degrees of unsaturation from fully saturated to aromatic. Aromatic and partially unsaturated rings are preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">It will be recognized that the compounds of this invention can exist in radiolabeled form, i.e., the compounds may contain one or more atoms containing an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Radioisotopes of hydrogen, carbon, phosphorous, fluorine, and chlorine include <sup>2</sup>H, <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>14</sup>C, <sup>15</sup>N, 35S, <sup>18</sup>F, and <sup>36</sup>Cl, respectively. Compounds that contain those radioisotopes and/or other radioisotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Tritiated, i.e. <sup>3</sup>H, and carbon-14, i.e., <sup>14</sup>C, radioisotopes are particularly preferred for their ease in preparation and detectability. Radiolabeled compounds of formula Ia of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art. Conveniently, such radiolabeled compounds can be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Examples and Schemes by substituting a readily available radiolabeled reagent for a non-radiolabeled reagent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">As used herein, and as would be understood by the person of skill in the art, the recitation of “a compound” is intended to include salts, solvates, co-crystals and inclusion complexes of that compound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">The term “solvate” refers to a compound of Formula I in the solid state, wherein molecules of a suitable solvent are incorporated in the crystal lattice. A suitable solvent for therapeutic administration is physiologically tolerable at the dosage administered. Examples of suitable solvents for therapeutic administration are ethanol and water. When water is the solvent, the solvate is referred to as a hydrate. In general, solvates are formed by dissolving the compound in the appropriate solvent and isolating the solvate by cooling or using an antisolvent. The solvate is typically dried or azeotroped under ambient conditions. Co-crystals are combinations of two or more distinct molecules arranged to create a unique crystal form whose physical properties are different from those of its pure constituents. Pharmaceutical co-crystals have recently become of considerable interest for improving the solubility, formulation and bioavailability of such drugs as itraconazole [see Remenar et al. <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </i>125, 8456-8457 (2003)] and fluoxetine. Inclusion complexes are described in <i>Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy </i>19<sup>th </sup>Ed. (1995) volume 1, page 176-177. The most commonly employed inclusion complexes are those with cyclodextrins, and all cyclodextrin complexes, natural and synthetic, with or without added additives and polymer(s), as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,324,718 and 5,472,954, are specifically encompassed within the claims. The disclosures of Remington and the '718 and '954 patents are incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">The terms “methods of treating or preventing” mean amelioration, prevention or relief from the symptoms and/or effects associated with lipid disorders. The term “preventing” as used herein refers to administering a medicament beforehand to forestall or obtund an acute episode. The person of ordinary skill in the medical art (to which the present method claims are directed) recognizes that the term “prevent” is not an absolute term. In the medical art it is understood to refer to the prophylactic administration of a drug to substantially diminish the likelihood or seriousness of a condition, and this is the sense intended in applicants' claims. As used herein, reference to “treatment” of a patient is intended to include prophylaxis. Throughout this application, various references are referred to. The disclosures of these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference as if written herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067">The term “mammal” is used in its dictionary sense. Humans are included in the group of mammals, and humans would be the preferred subjects of the methods of treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068">The compounds described herein may contain asymmetric centers and may thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms. Each chiral center may be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry, as (R)- or (S)-. The present invention is meant to include all such possible isomers, as well as, their racemic and optically pure forms. Optically active (R)- and (S)-, or (D)- and (L)- isomers may be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques. When the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds or other centers of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended that the compounds include both E and Z geometric isomers. Likewise, all tautomeric forms are also intended to be included.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">The graphic representations of racemic, ambiscalemic and scalemic or enantiomerically pure compounds used herein are taken from Maehr <i>J. Chem. Ed. </i>62, 114-120 (1985): solid and broken wedges are used to denote the absolute configuration of a chiral element; wavy lines and single thin lines indicate disavowal of any stereochemical implication which the bond it represents could generate; solid and broken bold lines are geometric descriptors indicating the relative configuration shown but denoting racemic character; and wedge outlines and dotted or broken lines denote enantiomerically pure compounds of indeterminate absolute configuration. Thus, the formula II is intended to encompass pure enantiomers as well as racemic mixtures and any intermediate mixture of enantiomers:</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0073">The configuration of any carbon-carbon double bond appearing herein is selected for convenience only and unless explicitly stated, is not intended to designate a particular configuration. Thus the carbon-carbon double bond depicted arbitrarily above as E may be Z, E, or a mixture of the two in any proportion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0074">Terminology related to “protecting”, “deprotecting” and “protected” functionalities occurs throughout this application. Such terminology is well understood by persons of skill in the art and is used in the context of processes which involve sequential treatment with a series of reagents. In that context, a protecting group refers to a group which is used to mask a functionality during a process step in which it would otherwise react, but in which reaction is undesirable. The protecting group prevents reaction at that step, but may be subsequently removed to expose the original functionality. The removal or “deprotection” occurs after the completion of the reaction or reactions in which the functionality would interfere. Thus, when a sequence of reagents is specified, as it is in the processes of the invention, the person of ordinary skill can readily envision those groups that would be suitable as “protecting groups”. Suitable groups for that purpose are discussed in standard textbooks in the field of chemistry, such as <i>Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis </i>by T. W. Greene [John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1991], which is incorporated herein by reference. Particular attention is drawn to the chapters entitled “Protection for the Hydroxyl Group, Including 1,2- and 1,3-Diols” (pages 10-86).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0075">The abbreviations Me, Et, Ph, Tf, Ts and Ms represent methyl, ethyl, phenyl, trifluoromethanesulfonyl, toluenesulfonyl and methanesulfonyl respectively. A comprehensive list of abbreviations utilized by organic chemists (i.e. persons of ordinary skill in the art) appears in the first issue of each volume of the <i>Journal of Organic Chemistry. </i>The list, which is typically presented in a table entitled “Standard List of Abbreviations” is incorporated herein by reference. In one embodiment, there are from one to three substituents and they are chosen independently from halogen, trifluoromethyl, methyl, methoxy, trifluoromethoxy, methanesulfonyl, methylenedioxy, and ethylenedioxy. For example, in compound A38 in Table 1, below, there are two substituents, chlorine and fluorine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0076">While it may be possible for the compounds of formula Ib to be administered as the raw chemical, it is preferable to present them as a pharmaceutical composition. According to a further aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula Ib, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, together with one or more pharmaceutically carriers thereof and optionally one or more other therapeutic ingredients. The carrier(s) must be “acceptable” in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0077">The formulations include those suitable for oral, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular, intravenous and intraarticular), rectal and topical (including dermal, buccal, sublingual and intraocular) administration. The most suitable route may depend upon the condition and disorder of the recipient. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing into association a compound of formula Ib or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof (“active ingredient”) with the carrier, which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0078">Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder (including micronized and nanoparticulate powders) or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. The active ingredient may also be presented as a bolus, electuary or paste.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0079">A tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, lubricating, surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide sustained, delayed or controlled release of the active ingredient therein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0080">The pharmaceutical compositions may include a “pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier”, and this expression is intended to include one or more inert excipients, which include starches, polyols, granulating agents, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents, and the like. If desired, tablet dosages of the disclosed compositions may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques, “Pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” also encompasses controlled release means.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0081">Compositions of the present invention may also optionally include other therapeutic ingredients, anti-caking agents, preservatives, sweetening agents, colorants, flavors, desiccants, plasticizers, dyes, and the like. Any such optional ingredient must, of course, be compatible with the compound of the invention to insure the stability of the formulation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0082">The dose range for adult humans is generally from 0.1 μg to 10 g/day orally. Tablets or other forms of presentation provided in discrete units may conveniently contain an amount of compound of the invention which is effective at such dosage or as a multiple of the same, for instance, units containing 5 mg to 500 mg, usually around 10 mg to 200 mg. The precise amount of compound administered to a patient will be the responsibility of the attendant physician. However, the dose employed will depend on a number of factors, including the age and sex of the patient, the precise disorder being treated, and its severity. The frequency of administration will depend on the pharmacodynamics of the individual compound and the formulation of the dosage form, which may be optimized by methods well known in the art (e.g. controlled or extended release tablets, enteric coating etc.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0083">Combination therapy can be achieved by administering two or more agents, each of which is formulated and administered separately, or by administering two or more agents in a single formulation. Other combinations are also encompassed by combination therapy. For example, two agents can be formulated together and administered in conjunction with a separate formulation containing a third agent. While the two or more agents in the combination therapy can be administered simultaneously, they need not be.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0086">The compounds of the invention were assayed for their binding on prostanoid EP3 receptors according to the method of Abramovitz et al. [<i>Bioch. Biophys. Acta, </i>1473, 285-293 (2000)]. Chart 1 shows the activity in column 2. Compounds with IC<sub>50</sub>&lt;1 μM are shown as +++; compounds with IC<sub>50 </sub>1-10 μM are shown as ++; and compounds with IC<sub>50</sub>&gt;10 μM are shown as +.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0087">Processes for obtaining the compounds of the invention are presented below. In general, the compounds of the present invention may be prepared by the methods illustrated in the general reaction schemes as, for example, described below, or by modifications thereof, using readily available starting materials, reagents and conventional synthesis procedures. In these reactions, it is also possible to make use of variants that are in themselves known, but are not mentioned here.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0088">Generally compounds of the Formula I may be prepared from appropriately functionalized substituted bicyclo cores as shown in schemes 1 to 14. In particular when node “a” is a nitrogen atom, one may either first functionalize the carbon atom, node “b”, of bicycle core G1 (which in Scheme 1 is a halogen atom) via palladium mediated Heck coupling to provide carbon linked ester (G2). Otherwise the linkage at ‘node b=C’, may be functionalized thru a heteroatom (G5) as shown in Scheme 2. The intermediates G2 and G5 then may be functionalized at the node “a” (a nitrogen atom of a bicycle core) to provide peri-substituted esters G3 and G6, respectively. The hydrolysis of the ester provides the carboxylic acid (G4 or G7), which are encompassed by the Formula I.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0092">Processes for obtaining the compounds of the invention are presented below. In general, the compounds of the present invention may be prepared by the methods illustrated in the general reaction schemes as, for example, described below, or by modifications thereof, using readily available starting materials, reagents and conventional synthesis procedures. In these reactions, it is also possible to make use of variants that are in themselves known, but are not mentioned here.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0093">Generally compounds of the Formula I may be prepared from appropriately functionalized substituted bicyclo cores as shown in schemes 1 to 14. In particular when node “a” is a nitrogen atom, one may either first functionalize the carbon atom, node “b”, of bicycle core G1 (which in Scheme 1 is a halogen atom) via palladium mediated Heck coupling to provide carbon linked ester (G2). Otherwise the linkage at ‘node b=C’, may be functionalized thru a heteroatom (G5) as shown in Scheme 2. The intermediates G2 and G5 then may be functionalized at the node “a” (a nitrogen atom of a bicycle core) to provide peri-substituted esters G3 and G6, respectively.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0096">When the node “b” as carbon bears an ester or a nitrile functional group, reduction provides the corresponding alcohol or amine, G8, as in Scheme 3 and 4. The alcohol or amine may be subsequently alkylated, acylated or reacted with an isocyanate to provide peri-substituted bicyclic intermediate G9, which in turn can be converted to compounds of formula I, where the linker contain diverse tethers, as depicted in G10. Alternatively, amine G8 may be reacted with cyclic (saturated or aryl/heteroaryl) isocyanates bearing a carboxylate ester to provide a more rigid cyclic linker separating the bicyclic core and the acyl sulphonamide functionality as in G11 (Scheme 4). In similar fashion, the derivatives wherein the carbon of the bicylic core G1 directly bears a nitrogen (e.g. nitro/amine, G13/G14) provide corresponding amides or ureas as spacer for the carboxylic acid G16, as shown in Scheme 5.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0100">Bicyclic cores wherein both the nodes “a” and “b” are carbons, can be obtained from starting materials such as G17. The fuctionalization of the halogen bearing carbon through a palladium-mediated ether or amine formation via Buchwald chemistry, followed by introduction of an acyl or formyl group via electrophilic reaction provides the key peri-functionalized intermediate G18. The latter reaction is particularly applicable where the ring (b) of the bicyclic core is electron rich. Reaction of the ketone or aldehyde by a Wittig reagent yields the desired olefin linked ester, which may be reduced to provide corresponding saturated linker, if desired. Alternatively, the ketones or aldehydes may be reacted with appropriate enolate (or even homo-enolate) to provide additional functional groups (Y4=OH, e.g.) in the linker portion, to provide G20. The functional group Y4 may be further derivatized, or eliminated to provide the olefin linkage. In addition, the benzylic alcohol of G19 may be converted to a halide (e.g. Br) and the benzylic halide may thus be converted via Heck coupling or alternatively reacted with ICH2CH2COOR [Higuchi K. et. Al. Org. Letters 2003 3704-3704] to provide product G22. The aldehyde/ketone G18 upon reaction with a homo-enolate provides the ester G20. Subsequent hydrolysis of G20 or G22 leads to the acids G21 and G23, respectively.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0102">Additional examples of highly reactive/electrophilic bicyclic cores, in which introduction of heteroatom-linked functionalities provides access to both carbon-linked peri-functionalities, are shown in scheme 7 and 8. These synthetic routes provide means to introduce the acyl portion of the fragment containing diverse linkers. These chemistries provide for introduction of sulphur linked aryl and heteroaryl groups and allow for adjustment of sulphur oxidation state, as well, thus providing access to analogs represented by G28 and G33. Alternatively, by use of ketones G34, one may prepare compounds related to G28/G33, which provide access to cores such as benzofuran and benzothiophene, G37</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0106">The synthetic routes outlined above essentially all utilize a bicyclic core, which is appropriately derivatized to provide compounds described by formula I. The following chemistries provide for introduction of at least one of the peri-fragments as part of the construction of bicyclic core. The chemistry in Scheme 12, involves a three component condensation reaction, whereby an α,γ-diketoester (G39), upon reaction with an aldehyde and a primary amine, provides a monocyclic product G40. The product G40 upon reaction with e.g. hydrazine (or mono substituted hydrazine) provides the peri-substituted bicyclic core (in this case a 5-5 ring system, as shown by G41), which then leads to the analog G42.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0108">Other examples of chemistries that involve formation of bicyclic cores are outlined in Schemes 11 and 12, which present syntheses of benzimidazole-based cores. In order to prepare a peri-substituted system, the R1 group is introduced regiospecifically at step G44-G45, which, upon subsequent ring closure, provides the desired peri-substituted derivative G46. In Scheme 12, the desired regiospecific introduction of the R1 group is accomplished by O-&gt;N acyl migration followed by reduction of amide to secondary amine. In this case, ring closure also provides the desired peri-substituents, as by G54.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0111">Another example of the chemistries involved in formation of bicyclic cores with desired peri-functionalization is depicted in Scheme 13. Here, a thermal cyclization of an amine with a cyclic disposed γ-keto acid G59 provides the required bicyclic intermediate G60. Bromination followed by e.g. Heck reaction provides the desired peri-bicyclic derivative G62 that upon ester deprotection provides the acid G63. This chemistry allows synthesis of essentially non aromatic ring systems and also provides for formation of bicyclic ring systems wherein the ring (a) is 5-membered. Ring (a) is produced during the cyclization reaction, whereas the size of the ring (b) is controlled by the use of the cyclic ketone at the initial step of the synthesis and thus allow for formation of “5-N” bicyclic system. In addition to the size, the substituent and presence of heteroatoms in the cyclic ketone also allows flexibility. The nature of the tertiary group may also be varied and this may be introduced at the cyclic ketone stage, which allows significant control over its regiochemistry. The positions X5/X6 may be heteroatoms and/or contain additional substituents as well.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0117">Finally, several appropriately functionalized bicylic cores are either commercially available or their syntheses are described in the published literature or could be inferred by one skill in the art. Examples of several of these are described as part of the Specific Examples and some of these are summarized below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0118">For bicyclic systems wherein one of the nodes is nitrogen, indole derivatives serve as a readily accessible and useful core. The 4-bromo and 4-hydroxy indoles are commercially available. The 7 substituted indoles, e.g. 7-CO<sub>2</sub>R, 7-alkoxy, 7-benzyloxy, etc. can be prepared by Batcho-Leimgruber chemistry from appropriately substituted 2-nitrotoluene, (Org Synthesis Co, Vol. 7). This approach also provides access to 7-Me, 7-CHO, 7-CN, and 7-OH indoles by functional group manipulations. Alternatively, the 7-halo indoles are accessible from 2-halo anilines via Bartoli chemistry (Bartoli, G. et.al. Tett. Letters, 1989, 30, 2129-2132). Diverse 7-substituted indoles may also be prepared via selective fuctionalization of indole via directed ortho metalation according to the procedure of Snieckus, [Snieckus V. et.al. Org Letters 2003, 1899-1902]. These various approaches also provide access to other substituted indole derivatives. The 8-hydroxytetrahydroquinolines, a [6:6]-based core, can be obtained from commercially available 8-hydroxy quinoline by reduction. 8-OH-1H-Quinolin-2-one. 2,6-dihydroxy anilines or related heterocycles may be transformed to 5-hydroxy-4H-benzo[1,4]oxazin-3-one, 5-hydroxy-4H-benzo[1,4]oxazin-2,3-dione, 4-hydroxy-3H-benzooxazol-2-one, bicyclic derivatives. Various anilines may be converted to isatin analogs using the literature procedures, and examples of these are described in the specific example section below. Synthesis of a series of [5:5] bicyclo cores (e.g. imidazothiazole and pyrrolopyarzolone) are described in the specific examples. A diverse group of [6:5] bicyclo cores can also be obtained analogous to literature syntheses of cores such as imidazopyridine and imidazopyrimidine [Katritzky A. R. et.al. JOC 2003, 68, 4935-37], pyrrolopyrimides [Norman M. et.al. JMC 2000, 43, 4288-4312]. These diverse bicyclo cores may then be derivatized to provide analogs of formula.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0119">Overall, the range of chemistries shown above allows for preparation of potent prostenoid antagonists/agonists. The chemistry allows manipulation of the core structure and introduction of optimal functional groups to provide a desired balance of hydrophobicity-hydrophilicity; it allows introduction of hydrogen bond donor and acceptors with desired topology; it allows adjustment of desired physical characteristics suitable for achieving desired pharmaceutical and ADME properties (e.g. membrane permeability, low plasma protein binding, desired metabolic profile etc.). The ability to adjust physical characteristics permits suitable formulation for oral bioavailability, which in turn allows for control over the size and frequency of dose administered to mammals to achieve desired pharmacological response. The ability to adjust metabolic profile allows for minimizing potential for drug-drug interactions. Thus the scope of this invention not only provides for preparation of potent prostenoid antagonists with proper isozyme selectivity to be useful tools for research, it also provides compounds are of value in therapy.</div>
