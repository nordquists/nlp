<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">The paper by L. L. Sohn, O. A. Saleh, G. R. Facer, A. J. Beavis, R. S. Allan, and D. A. Notterman, ‘Capacitance cytometry: Measuring biological cells one by one’, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (USA), Vol. 97, No. 20, Sep. 26, 2000, pp. 10687-10690 discloses a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) biochip capable of capacitance detection of biological entities (mouse cells).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">This prior art shows that passive micro-channel biochip devices are fabricated using fusion bonding of a combination of various substrates, such as: acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer, polycarbonate, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), polyethylene, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), polymethylpentene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polysulfone, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyurethane, polyvinylchloride (PVC), polyvinylidine fluoride (PVF). These Prior Art USA patents show that mechanical stamping or thermal forming techniques are used to define a network of micro-channels in a first substrate prior its fusion bonding to another such substrate, as to form microchannels between the two bonded substrates. The result is a simple passive micro-channel biochip device which can be patterned with conductive layers as to connect an external processor used to provoke fluid movement by electrophoresis or electroosmosis, analysis and data generation. An example of such passive micro-channel biochip devices obtained from the fusion of such polymeric substrates is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,167,910 &lt;&lt;Multi-layer microfluidic devices&gt;&gt;.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">The Prior Art also indicates that passive micro-channel biochip devices can be fabricated from the combination of various micro-machined silica or quartz substrates. Again, assembly and fusion bonding is required. The result is again a simple passive biochip device which can be patterned with conductive layers as to connect an external processor used to provoke fluid movement by electrophoresis or electroosmosis, analysis and data generation. An example of such passive micro-channel biochip devices obtained from the fusion of such silica substrates is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,131,410 &lt;&lt;Vacuum fusion bonding of glass plates&gt;&gt;.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">The cited US patents also indicate that passive micro-channel biochip devices can be fabricated from a passive micro-machined silicon substrate. In that case, the silicon substrate is used as a passive structural material. Again, assembly and fusion bonding of at least two sub-assemblies is required. The result is again a simple passive biochip to connect to an external processor used to provoke fluid movement, analysis and data generation. An example of such passive micro-channel biochip devices obtained from a passive micro-machined silicon substrate is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,705,018 &lt;&lt;Micromachined peristaltic pump&gt;&gt;.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">The cited US patents also indicate that active micro-reservoir biochip devices can be fabricated from machining directly into an active silicon substrate. In that case, the control electronics integrated in the silicon substrate is used as an active on-chip fluid processor and communication device. The result is a sophisticated biochip device which can perform, into pre-defined reservoirs, various fluidics, analysis and (remote) data communication functions without the need of an external fluid processor in charge of fluid movement, analysis and data generation. An example of such active micro-reservoir biochip devices obtained from an active micro-machined silicon substrate is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,117,643 &lt;&lt;(Bioluminescent bioreporter integrated circuit&gt;&gt;.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">These Prior Art references also indicate that passive polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) biochips have been developed for the detection of biological entities using gold coated capacitor electrodes. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an example of such passive polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) biochips with gold electrodes (L. L. Sohn, O. A. Saleh, G. R. Facer, A. J. Beavis, R. S. Allan, and D. A. Notterman, ‘Capacitance cytometry: Measuring biological cells one by one’, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (USA), Vol. 97, No. 20, Sep. 26, 2000, pp. 10687-10690).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">These Prior Art references also indicate that wax has been used to fabricate such microchannels. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows that this process requires the top covers of the microchannels to be first bonded to a carrier wafer using a low temperature wax. Then, a photosensitive benzocyclobutene, BCB, is spun-on, exposed and developed as to define the sidewalls of the microchannels. Then the photodefined BCB of the carrier wafer is properly aligned and bonded to a receiving wafer integrating the bottoms of the microchannels. Then the wax of the carrier wafer is heated above its melting point as to detach the BCB bonded sidewalls and covers of the carrier wafer onto the bottoms of the receiving wafer, thus creating microchannels. An example of such an approach in shown in the paper by A. Jourdain, X. Rottenberg, G. Carchon and H. A. C. Tilmanstitled, ‘Optimization of O-Level Packaging for RF-MEMS Devices’, Transducers 2003, The 12th International Conference on Solid State Sensors, Actuators and Microsystems, Boston, Jun. 8-12, 2003, pp. 1915-1918 &lt;&lt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">These Prior Art references also indicate that parylene could be used to fabricate such microchannels. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows that a carrier wafer could be first coated with 1.3 um of AZ1813 sacrificial photoresist over which a 0.38 um thick layer of parylene could be deposited and patterned as to expose the underlying layer of parylene. Following local etch of the exposed parylene the underlying sacrificial photoresist could be dissolved in acetone as to leave an array of free-standing parylene covers on the carrier wafer. The patterned receiving wafer integrating the sidewalls and bottoms of the microchannels could be coated with another layer of 0.38 um thick layer of parylene, could be aligned and could be pressed against the free standing pattern of parylene on the carrier wafer while heating at 230° C. under a vacuum of 1.5*10<sup>−4 </sup>Torr. The two parylene layers could polymerize together and will result in bond strength of 3.6 MPa. An example of such an approach in shown in the paper by H. S. Kim and K. Najafi, ‘Wafer Bonding Using Parylene and Wafer-Level Transfer of Free-Standing Parylene Membranes’, Transducers 2003, The 12th International Conference on Solid State Sensors, Actuators and Microsystems, Boston, June 8-12, 2003, pp. 790-793.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">Embodiments of the present invention provide a new, simple, inexpensive, high precision, gold-free, sodium-free and potassium-free process allowing the formation, at a temperature of less than 250° C., of hundreds if not thousands of microfluidics microchannels on a CMOS wafer integrating hundreds if not thousands of digital and/or analog CMOS control logic and/or high voltage CMOS drivers capable of performing sensing and/or microfluidics actuation functions. The novel BioMEMS fabrication process uses a layer of silicon nitride exposed to anhydrous hydrofluoric acid as a temporary adhesion layer between a carrier wafer and a multitude of photolithographically defined microfluidics microchannels to be transferred onto the Device Wafer integrating a large number (potentially hundreds or thousands) of digital and/or analog CMOS control logic and/or high voltage CMOS drivers capable of performing sensing and/or microfluidics actuation functions.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">According to a second aspect of the invention there is provided a method of forming a MEMS device containing microchannels, comprising depositing a silicon nitride layer on a carrier wafer; modifying a surface portion of said silicon nitride layer by exposure to anhydrous HF to form a modified surface layer; forming a patterned first structure on said modified surface layer; forming a patterned second structure on a device wafer; bonding said first and second structure together to form microchannels; and releasing said carrier wafer by heating said structures to decompose said modified surface layer.</div>
