<heading id="h-0001">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to certain aminoaryl sulphonamide derivatives, their stereoisomers, their salts, their preparation and medicine containing them.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Various central nervous system disorders such as anxiety, depression, motor disorders etc., are believed to involve a disturbance of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) or serotonin. Serotonin is localized in the central and peripheral nervous systems and is known to affect many types of conditions including psychiatric disorders, motor activity, feeding behavior, sexual activity, and neuroendocrine regulation among others. 5-HT receptor subtypes regulate the various effects of serotonin. Known 5-HT receptor family includes the 5-HT<sub>1 </sub>family (e.g. 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>), the 5-HT<sub>2 </sub>family (e.g. 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>), 5-HT<sub>3</sub>, 5-HT<sub>4</sub>, 5-HT<sub>5</sub>, 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>and 5-HT<sub>7 </sub>subtypes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>receptor subtype was first cloned from rat tissue in 1993 (Monsma, F. J.; Shen, Y.; Ward, R. P.; Hamblin, M. W., Molecular Pharmacology, 1993, 43, 320-327) and subsequently from human tissue (Kohen, R.; Metcalf; M. A.; Khan, N.; Druck, T.; Huebner, K.; Sibley, D. R., Journal of Neurochemistry, 1996, 66, 47-56). The receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) positively coupled to adenylate cyclase (Rust, M.; Traiffort, E.; Arrang, J-M.; Tardivel-Lacombe, L.; Diaz, L.; Leurs, R.; Schwartz, J-C., Biochemical Biophysical Research Communications, 1093, 193, 268-276). The receptor is found almost exclusively in the central nervous system (CNS) areas both in rat and in human.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">In situ hybridization studies of the 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>receptor in rat brain using mRNA indicate principal localization in the areas of 5-HT projection including striatum, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle and hippocampal formation (Ward, R. P.; Hamblin, M. W.; Lachowicz, J. E.; Hoffman, B. J.; Sibley, D. R.; Dorsa, D. M., Neuroscience, 1995, 64, 1105-1111). Highest levels of 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>receptor mRNA has been observed in the olfactory tubercle, the striatum, nucleus accumbens, dentate gyms as well as CA<sub>1</sub>, CA<sub>2 </sub>and CA<sub>3 </sub>regions of the hippocampus. Lower levels of 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>receptor mRNA were seen in the granular layer of the cerebellum, several diencephalic nuclei, amygdala and in the cortex. Northern blots have revealed that 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>receptor mRNA appears to be exclusively present in the brain, with little evidence for its presence in peripheral tissues.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">The high affinity of a number of antipsychotic agents for the 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>receptor, in addition to its mRNA localization in striatum, olfactory tubercle and nucleus accumbens suggests that some of the clinical actions of these compounds may be mediated through this receptor. Its ability to bind a wide range of therapeutic compounds used in psychiatry, coupled with its intriguing distribution in the brain has stimulated significant interest in new compounds which are capable of interacting with or affecting the said receptor. At present, there are no known fully selective agonists. Significant efforts are being made to understand the possible role of the 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>receptor in psychiatry, cognitive dysfunction, motor function and control, memory, mood and the like. To that end, compounds which demonstrate a binding affinity for the 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>receptor are earnestly sought both as an aid in the study of the 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>receptor and as potential therapeutic agents in the treatment of central nervous system disorders, for example see C. Reavill and D. C. Rogers, Current Opinion in Investigational Drugs, 2001, 2(1):104-109, Pharma Press Ltd.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">There are many potential therapeutic uses for 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>ligands in humans based on direct effects and on indications from available scientific studies. These studies include the localization of the receptor, the affinity of ligands with known in vivo activity, and various animal studies conducted so far. Preferably, antagonist compounds of 5-h<sub>6 </sub>receptors are sought after as therapeutic agents. One potential therapeutic use of modulators of 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>receptor function is in the enhancement of cognition and memory in human diseases such as Alzheimer's. The high levels of receptor found in important structures in the forebrain, including the caudate/putamen, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, and cortex suggest a role for the receptor in memory and cognition since these areas are known to play a vital role in memory (Gerard, C.; Martres, M. P.; Lefevre, K.; Miguel, M. C.; Verge, D.; Lanfumey, R.; Doucet, E.; Hamon, M.; E I Mestikawy, S., Brain Research, 1997, 746, 207-219). The ability of known 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>receptor ligands to enhance cholinergic transmission also supported the potential cognition use (Bentey, J. C.; Boursson, A.; Boess, F. G.; Kone, F. C.; Marsden, C. A.; Petit, N.; Sleight, A. J., British Journal of Pharmacology, 1999, 126 (7), 1537-1542).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Studies have found that a known 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>selective antagonist significantly increased glutamate and aspartate levels in the frontal cortex without elevating levels of noradrenaline, dopamine, or 5-HT. This selective elevation of neurochemicals known to be involved in memory and cognition strongly suggests a role for 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>ligands in cognition (Dawson, L. A.; Nguyen, H. Q.; Li, P. British Journal of Pharmacology, 2000, 130 (1), 23-26). Animal studies of memory and learning with a known selective 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>antagonist found some positive effects (Rogers, D. C.; Hatcher, P. D.; Hagan, J. J. Society of Neuroscience, Abstracts, 2000, 26, 680).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">A related potential therapeutic use for 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>ligands is the treatment of attention deficit disorders (ADD, also known as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder or ADHD) in both children and adults. Because 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>antagonists appear to enhance the activity of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway and because ADHD has been linked to abnormalities in the caudate (Ernst, M; Zametkin, A. J.; Matochik, J. H.; ions, P. A.; Cohen, R. M., Journal of Neuroscience, 1998, 18(15), 5901-5907), 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>antagonists may attenuate attention deficit disorders.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">International Patent Publication WO 03/066056 A1 reports that antagonism of 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>receptor could promote neuronal growth within the central nervous system of a mammal. Another International Patent Publication WO 03/065046 A2 discloses new variant of human 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>receptor, and proposes that human 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>receptor is being associated with numerous other disorders.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Early studies examining the affinity of various CNS ligands with known therapeutic utility or a strong structural resemblance to known drugs suggests a role for 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>ligands in the treatment of schizophrenia and depression. For example, clozapine (an effective clinical antipsychotic) has high affinity for the 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>receptor subtype. Also, several clinical antidepressants have high affinity for the receptor as well and act as antagonists at this site (Branchek, T. A.; Blackburn, T. P., Annual Reviews in Pharmacology and Toxicology, 2000, 40, 319-334).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">Further, recent in vivo studies in rats indicate that 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>modulators may be useful in the treatment of movement disorders including epilepsy (Stean, T.; Routledge, C.; Upton, N., British Journal of Pharmacology, 1999, 127 Proc. Supplement-131P; and Routledge, C.; Bromidge, S. M.; Moss, S. F.; Price, G. W.; Hirst, W.; Newman, H.; Riley, G.; Gager, T.; Stean, T.; Upton, N.; Clarke, S. E.; Brown, A. M., British Journal of Pharmacology, 2000, 30 (7), 1606-1612).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">Taken together, the above studies strongly suggest that compounds which are 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>receptor modulators, i.e. ligands, may be useful for therapeutic indications including: the treatment of diseases associated with a deficit in memory, cognition, and learning such as Alzheimer's and attention deficit disorder; the treatment of personality disorders such as schizophrenia; the treatment of behavioral disorders, e.g. anxiety, depression and obsessive compulsive disorders; the treatment of motion or motor disorders such as Parkinson's disease and epilepsy; the treatment of diseases associated with neurodegeneration such as stroke or head trauma; or withdrawal from drug addiction including addiction to nicotine, alcohol, and other substances of abuse.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">Such compounds are also expected to be of use in the treatment of certain gastrointestinal (GI) disorders such as functional bowel disorder. See for example, B. L. Roth et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 1994, 268, pages 1403-14120, D. R. Sibley et al., Molecular Pharmacology, 1993, 43, 320-327, A. J. Sleight et al., Neurotransmission, 1995, 11, 1-5, and A. J. Sleight et al., Serotonin ID Research Alert, 1997, 2(3), 115-118.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">Furthermore, the effect of 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>antagonist and 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>antisense oligonucleotides to reduce food intake in rats has been reported thus potentially in treatment of obesity. See for example, Bentley et al., British Journal of Pharmacology, 1999, Suppl., 126, A64: 255; Wooley et al., Neuropharmacology, 2001, 41: 210-129; and WO 02/098878.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">International Patent Publications WO 2004/055026 A1, WO 2004/048331 A1, WO 2004/048330 A1 and WO 2004/048328 A2 (all assigned to Suven Life Sciences Limited) describes related prior art. These PCT applications and the references reported therein are all incorporated herein. Further WO 98/27081, WO 99/02502, WO 99/37623, WO 99/42465 and WO01/32646 (all assigned to Glaxo SmithKline Beecham PLC) disclose a series of aryl sulphonamide and sulphoxide compounds as 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>receptor antagonists and which are claimed to be useful in the treatment of various CNS disorders. While some 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>modulators have been disclosed, there continues to be a need for compounds that are useful for modulating 5-HT<sub>6</sub>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0209">Male wistar rats (230-280 g) obtained from N I.N. (National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India) were used as an experimental animal. Four animals were housed in each cage. Animals were kept on 20% food deprivation before one day and given water ad libitum throughout the experiment, and maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle. Also the rats were habituated to individual arenas for 1 hour in absence of any objects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0152" num="0210">One group of 12 rats received vehicle (1 mL/Kg) orally and another set of animals received compound of the formula (I) either orally or i.p., before one hour of the familiar (T1) and choice trial (T2). The experiment was carried out in a 50×50×50 Cm open field made up of acrylic. In the familiarization phase, (T1), the rats were placed individually in the open field for 3 min., in which two identical objects (plastic bottles, 12.5 Cm height×5.5 Cm diameter) covered in yellow masking tape alone (a1 and a2) were positioned in two adjacent corners, 10 Cm. from the walls. After 24 hour of the (T1) trial for long-term memory test, the same rats were placed in the same arena as they were placed in T1 trial. Choice phase (T2) rats were allowed to explore the open field for 3 min. in presence of one familiar object (a3) and one novel object (b) (Amber color glass bottle, 12 Cm high and 5 Cm in diameter. Familiar objects presented similar textures, colors and sizes. During the T1 and T2 trial, exploration of each object (defined as sniffing, licking, chewing or having moving vibrissae whilst directing the nose towards the object at a distance of less than 1 Cm) were recorded separately by stopwatch. Sitting on an object was not regarded as exploratory activity, however, it was rarely observed. T1 is the total time spent exploring the familiar objects (a1+a2). T2 is the total time spent exploring the familiar object and novel object (a3+b).</div>

The 10 Cm<sup>2 </sup>perspex platform, lying 1 Cm below the water surface, was placed in the centre of one of the four imaginary quadrants, which remained constant for all rats. The black Perspex used in the construction of the maze and platform offered no intramaze cues to guide escape behavior. By contrast, the training room offered several strong extramaze visual cues to aid the formation of the spatial map necessary for escape learning. An automated tracking system, [Videomot 2 (5.51), TSE systems, Germany] was employed. This program analyzes video images acquired via a digital camera and an image acquisition board that determined path length, swim speed and the number of entries and duration of swim time spent in each quadrant of the water maze.</div>

<heading id="h-0125">Passive Avoidance Apparatus</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0220">Animals were trained in a single-trial, step through, light-dark passive avoidance paradigm. The training apparatus consisted of a chamber 300 mm in length, 260 mm wide, and 270 mm in height, constructed to established designs. The front and top were transparent, allowing the experimenter to observe the behavior of the animal inside the apparatus. The chamber was divided into two compartments, separated by a central shutter that contained a small opening 50 mm wide and 75 mm high set close to the front of the chamber. The smaller of the compartments measured 9 mm in width and contained a low-power (6V) illumination source. The larger compartment measured 210 mm in width and was not illuminated. The floor of this dark compartment consisted of a grid of 16 horizontal stainless-steel bars that were 5 mm in diameter and spaced 12.5 mm apart. A current generator supplied 0.75 mA to the grid floor, which was scrambled once every 0.5 s across the 16 bars. A resistance range of 40-60 microohms was calculated for a control group of rats and the apparatus was calibrated accordingly. An electronic circuit detecting the resistance of the animal ensured an accurate current delivery by automatic variation of the voltage with change in resistance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0126" num="0000">Experimental Procedure</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0221">This was carried out as described previously (Fox et al., 1995). Adult male Wistar rats weighing 200-230 g were used. Animals were brought to the laboratory 1 h before the experiment. On the day of training, animals were placed facing the rear of the light compartment of the apparatus. The timer was started once the animal has completely turned to face the front of the chamber. Latency to enter the dark chamber was recorded (usually &lt;20 s), and having completely entered the dark compartment an inescapable foot shock of 0.75 mA for 3 s was administered to the animal. Animals were then returned to their home cages. Between each training session, both compartments of the chamber were cleaned to remove any confounding olfactory cues. Recall of this inhibitory stimulus was evaluated 24 h, 72 h and on 7 day post-training by returning the animal into the light chamber and recording their latency to enter the dark chamber, a criterion time of 300 s was employed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0222">Some of the compounds did show the significant increase in latency to reach the dark zone, at 10 mg/Kg oral dose. The representative data for the example 6 is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in graphical form.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0223">The data shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> demonstrates that the compounds of the present invention improve the cognition and more specifically, the consolidation of memory, in the time induced disruption model.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0174" num="0235">The antagonist property of the compounds at the human 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>receptors was determined by testing their effect on cAMP accumulation in stably transfected HEK293 cells. Binding of an agonist to the human 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>receptor will lead to an increase in adenyl cyclase activity. A compound that is an agonist will show an increase in cAMP production and a compound that is an antagonist will block the agonist effect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0175" num="0236">Human 5-HT<sub>6 </sub>receptors were cloned and stably expressed in HEK293 cells.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0177" num="0238">cAMP content was determined by EIA (enzyme-immunoassay) using the Amersham Biotrak cAMP EIA kit (Amersham RPN 225). The procedure used is as described for the kit. Briefly, cAMP is determined by the competition between unlabeled cAMP and a fixed quantity of peroxidase-labelled cAMP for the binding sites on anti-cAMP antibody. The antibody is immobilized onto polystyrene microtitre wells precoated with a second antibody. The reaction is started by adding 50 uL, peroxidase-labeled-cAMP to the sample (100 uL) preincubated with the antiserum (100 uL) for 2 hours at 4° C. Following 1 hour incubation at 4° C., the unbound ligand is separated by a simple washing procedure. Then an enzyme substrate, trimethylbenzidine (1), is added and incubated at room temperature for 60 min. The reaction is stopped by the addition of 100 uL 1.0 M sulphuric acid and the resultant color read by a microtitre plate spectrophotometer at 450 nM within 30 minutes.</div>
