<heading id="h-0002">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to novel kinase inhibitors and modulator compounds useful for the treatment of various diseases. More particularly, the invention is concerned with such compounds, kinase/compound adducts, methods of treating diseases, and methods of synthesis of the compounds. Preferrably, the compounds are useful for the modulation of kinase activity of Raf kinases and disease polymorphs thereof.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Several members of the protein kinase family have been clearly implicated in the pathogenesis of various proliferative diseases and thus represent important targets for treatment of these diseases. Some of the proliferative diseases relevant to this invention include cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, and retinopathies. Important examples of kinases which have been shown to cause or contribute to the pathogensis of these diseases including, but not limited to, BRaf, CRaf, Abl, KDR(VEGF), EGFR/HER1, HER2, HER3, cMET, FLT-3, PDGFR-a, PDGFR-b, p38, cKIT, JAK2.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">A major signaling pathway downstream of cell surface growth factor receptor activation is the Ras-RAF-MEK-ERK-MAP kinase pathway (Peyssonnaux, C. et al, Biol. Cell (2001)93: 53-62, Cancers arise when mutations occur in one or more of the proteins involved in this signaling cascade. Cell proliferation and differentiation become dysregulated and cell survival mechanisms are activated which allow unregulated cancer cells to override protective programmed cell death surveillance. Mutations in the p21-Ras protein have been shown to be a major cause of dysregulation of this signaling pathway, leading to the development of human cancers. P21-Ras mutations have been identified in approximately 30% of human cancers (Bolton et al, <i>Ann. Rep. Med. Chem</i>. (1994)29: 165-174). Cancer-causing mutations in the P21-Ras protein lead to a constitutively active signaling cascade, causing unregulated activation of the downstream components of the RAF-MEK-ERK-MAP kinase pathway (Magnuson et al, <i>Semin. Cancer Biol</i>. (1994)5: 247-253). The three RAF kinases which participate in this signaling cascade are known as ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF (Peyssonnaux, C. et al, <i>Biol. Cell </i>(2001)93: 53-62; Avruch, J., <i>Recent Prog. Horm. Res</i>. (2001)56: 127-155; Kolch, W., <i>Biochem. J</i>. (2000)351: 289-305). These RAF kinase isoforms are all activated by Ras, and thus are activated in cancers that result from mutated and upregulated p21-Ras protein activity. In addition to activation of this signaling cascade at the initial p21-Ras protein level, mutations have also been found in BRAF kinase which results in activation of the cascade downstream from p21-Ras (Davies, H., et al, <i>Nature </i>(2002)417: 949-954). A dominant single site mutation at position 600 in the BRAF kinase was shown to be particularly aggressive and linked to approximately 80% of the observed human malignant melanomas. This mutation substitutes the negatively charged amino acid glutamic acid for the normally occurring neutral amino acid valine. This single site mutation is sufficient to render the mutated BRAF kinase constitutively active, resulting in signaling pathway dysregulation and human cancer. Hence small molecule inhibitors of BRAF kinase are a rational approach to the treatment of human malignancy, whether the signaling mutation is at the level of the upstream p21-Ras protein or at the level of BRAF kinase.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">The majority of small molecule kinase inhibitors that have been reported have been shown to bind in one of three ways. Most of the reported inhibitors interact with the ATP binding domain of the active site and exert their effects by competing with ATP for occupancy. Other inhibitors have been shown to bind to a separate hydrophobic region of tire protein known as the “DFG-in-conformation” pocket, and still others have been shown to bind to both the ATP domain and the “DFG-in-conformation” pocket. Examples specific to inhibitors of RAF kinases can be found in Lowinger et al, <i>Current Pharmaceutical Design </i>(2002)8: 2269-2278; Dumas, J. et al, <i>Current Opinion in Drug Discovery </i>&amp; <i>Development </i>(2004)7: 600-616; Dumas, J. et al, WO 2003068223 A1 (2003); Dumas, J., et al, WO 9932455 A1 (1999), and Wan, P. T. C., et al, Cell (2004)116: 855-867.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Physiologically, kinases are regulated by a common activation/deactivation mechanism wherein a specific activation loop sequence of the kinase protein binds into a specific pocket on the same protein which is referred to as the switch control pocket (see WO 200380110049 for further details). Such binding occurs when specific amino acid residues of the activation loop are modified for example by phosphorylation, oxidation, or nitrosylation. The binding of the activation loop into the switch pocket results in a conformational change of the protein into its active form (Huse, M. and Kuriyan, <i>J. Cell </i>(109)275-282.).</div>

In step 1, a suitable chloropyrimidine ester 1 is reacted with an R4-substituted amine to provide compounds of formula 2. Preferred conditions for Scheme 1, step 1, include polar solvents such as DMF, THF, acetonitrile, dioxane, water or mixtures thereof in the presence of optionally added bases such as tri ethyl amine at temperatures between 0° C. and 100° C. Reduction of ester 2 provides alcohol 3. Preferred reagents for the transformation of step 2 include lithium aluminum hydride in THF at temperatures ranging from 0° C. to room temp. As shown in step 3, aldehyde 4 can be prepared by oxidation of alcohol 3 with oxidants such as manganese dioxide. Condensation of aldehyde 4 with ester 5 (step 4) provides pyridopyrimidinone 6. Preferred conditions for step 4 include optional heating (30-150° C.) in DMF or DMAc in the presence of potassium carbonate or cesium carbonate for a period of time ranging from 1 h to 4 days. Other preferred conditions for Scheme 1, step 4 include combining aldehyde 4, ester 5 and alumina-supported potassium fluoride in DMAc with stirring and optional sonication and/or optional heating (30-150° C.) for a period of 30 min to 48 h. The group “P” in formula 5-8 represents a hydrogen atom or an optional amine protecting group, such as tert-butyl carbamate (Boc), benzyl carbamate (Cbz), acetamide or the like. It is understood by those skilled in the art that the moiety R3-N—P—X2 in formulae 5-8 might also represent an amino surrogate such as nitro or cyano that can be converted to an amino group or aminomethyl group in step 7 by reduction under suitable conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0203" num="0284">In Scheme 1, step 5, the thiomethyl moiety of 6 can be oxidized to a sulfoxide or sulfone to provide 7. Preferred reagents for such transformations include peroxybenzoic acids, oxone, oxaziridines, or other oxidants that will be recognized as standard oxidants of sulfur atoms by those skilled in the art. In practice, mixtures of sulfoxides and sulfones can be used in step 6 without prior separation. In step 6, the sulfone or sulfoxide moiety of 7 can be converted to a Z6 moiety that is linked to the pyridopyrimidinone through a heteroatom to provide 8 by the contacting of 7 with moieties of Z6-H [for example NH(R4)<sub>2</sub>, HOR4 or HSR4] optionally in the presence of a base such as potassium tert-butoxide, sodium hydride or the like or, alternatively, in the presence of a strong acid such as hydrochloric acid. Preferred solvents for such transformations include dioxane, DMF, THF, alcoholic solvents or neat Z6-H at temperatures ranging from 0° C. to 200° C. Those skilled in the art will recognize that in certain instances, compounds of formula 8 can be prepared directly from compounds of formula 6 using the conditions of step 6. In the instance that Z6 is hydrogen, preferred methods include exposure of compounds of formula 6 or 7 to hydrogen gas in the presence of a suitable hydrogenation catalyst, for example Raney Nickel® or Pd on carbon in a suitable solvent such as ethanol, methanol, ethyl acetate or THF.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0204" num="0285">In Scheme 1, step 7, the optional protecting group P of formula 8 can be removed, if necessary, by appropriate de-protection conditions (for example, acidic hydrolysis for a Boc or hydrogenation for a Cbz) to provide compounds of formula 9. Step 7 may also encompass the conversion of amine surrogates (such as nitro) into amines by appropriate chemistries (for example, reduction of a nitro group with Zn/ammonium chloride or by hydrogenation with a Pd catalyst). Finally, the conversion of compounds of formula 9 to compounds of formula 10, an aspect of formula Ia. can be accomplished in step 8 by reaction with isocyanates of formula A-NCO, 11. It will be understood that the isocycantes 11 may be either introduced into the reaction directly or may be prepared in situ, for example, by the decomposition of acyl azides (Curtius rearrangement) in the presence of 9. It will be further understood by those skilled in the art that certain carbamates, for example trichloroethyl carbamates (12) and isopropenyl carbamates (13) also function as isocyanate equivalents and will find use in step 8.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0205" num="0286">An alternative preparation of intermediate 6 is shown in Scheme 2. Treatment of aldehyde 4 from Scheme 1 with ethyl (triphenylphosphoranylidene)acetate provides compounds of formula 14. Bromination of 14 with N-bromosuccinimide (step 2) provides bromide 15. In step 3, Suzuki-type couplings of 15 with boronic acids 16 in the presence of palladium catalysts provide compounds of formula 6, useful for the preparation of compounds of formula 10 as illustrated in Scheme 1.</div>

When the Z6 moiety is attached to the pyrrolidine ring through a Z6 nitrogen atom, a Z6 oxygen atom or a Z6 sulfur atom, compounds of formula 1 can be prepared by contacting the amine Z6-H, the alcohol Z6-H or the thiol Z6-H with compound 19, either neat (Z6-H as solvent) or in a suitable solvent such as DMF, DMSO or an alcoholic solvent at temperatures ranging from −78° C. to 200° C. in the presence of suitable base such as triethylamine, potassium carbonate, or potassium tert-butoxide. When the Z6 moiety is attached to the pyrimidine through a Z6 carbon atom, preferred methods include contacting compound 19 with a species of formula Z6-M in the presence of a palladium catalyst, wherein M is a species that participates in transition-metal catalyzed cross-coupling reactions.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0872" num="0961">B-Raf(V600E) Kinase Assay: The activity of B-Raf(V600E) kinase was determined by following the formation of ADP from the reaction through coupling with the pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase system (e.g., Schindler, et al. Science (2000)289, 1938-1942). In this assay, the oxidation of NADH (thus the decrease at A<sub>340nm</sub>) was continuously monitored spectrophotometrically. The reaction mixture (100 μl) contained B-Raf(V600E) kinase (2.1 nM nominal concentration), unphosphorylated, full-length MEK1 (45 nM), MgCl<sub>2 </sub>(13 mM), pyruvate kinase (3.5 units), lactate dehydrogenase (5.5 units), phosphoenolpyruvate (1 mM), and NADH (0.28 mM), in 60 mM Tris buffer, containing 0.13% octyl-glucoside and 3.5% DMSO concentration at pH 7.5. The test compounds were incubated with the reaction mixture at 30° C. for 2 h or 4 h. The reaction was initiated by adding ATP (0.2 mM, final concentration). The absorption at 340 ran was continuously monitored for 3 h at 30° C. on a Polarstar Optima plate reader (BMG). The reaction rate was calculated using the 1.5 h to 2.5 h time frame. Percent inhibition was obtained by comparison of reaction rate with that of a control (i.e. with no test compound). IC<sub>50 </sub>values were calculated from a series of percent inhibition values determined at a range of inhibitor concentrations using software routines as implemented in the GraphPad Prism software package.</div>
