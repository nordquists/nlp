No. 12/270,215, filed on Nov. 13, 2008; which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/987,681, filed on Nov. 13, 2007, titled “WINDOW ASSEMBLY AND WINDOW SPACER”; and to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/049,593, filed on May 1, 2008, titled “WINDOW ASSEMBLY AND WINDOW SPACER”; and to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/049,599, filed on May 1, 2008, titled “MANUFACTURE OF WINDOW ASSEMBLY AND WINDOW SPACER”; and to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/038,803, filed on Mar. 24, 2008, titled “WINDOW ASSEMBLY AND WINDOW SPACER”; the disclosures of which are each hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">An insulated glazing unit often includes two facing sheets of glass separated by an air space. The air space reduces heat transfer through the unit, to insulate the interior of a building to which it is attached from external temperature variations. As a result, the energy efficiency of the building is improved, and a more even temperature distribution is achieved within the building. A rigid pre-formed spacer is typically used to maintain the space between the two facing sheets of glass.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">Various embodiments will be described in detail with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals represent like parts and assemblies throughout the several views. Reference to various embodiments does not limit the scope of the claims attached hereto. Additionally, any examples set forth in this specification are not intended to be limiting and merely set forth some of the many possible embodiments for the appended claims.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> illustrate an example sealed unit <b>100</b> according to the present disclosure. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic front view of sealed unit <b>100</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic perspective view of a corner section of sealed unit <b>100</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, sealed unit <b>100</b> includes sheet <b>102</b>, sheet <b>104</b>, and spacer <b>106</b>. Spacer <b>106</b> includes elongate strip <b>110</b>, filler <b>112</b>, and elongate strip <b>114</b>. Elongate strip <b>110</b> includes apertures <b>116</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">In some embodiments, sealed unit <b>100</b> includes sheet <b>102</b>, sheet <b>104</b>, and spacer <b>106</b>. Sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> are made of a material that allows at least some light to pass through. Typically, sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> are made of a transparent material, such as glass, plastic, or other suitable materials. Alternatively, a translucent or semi-transparent material is used, such as etched, stained, or tinted glass or plastic. More or fewer layers or materials are included in other embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">One example of a sealed unit <b>100</b> is an insulated glazing unit. Another example of a sealed unit <b>100</b> is a window assembly. In further embodiments a sealed unit is an automotive part (e.g., a window, a lamp, etc.). In other embodiments a sealed unit is a photovoltaic cell or solar panel. In some embodiments a sealed unit is any unit having at least two sheets (e.g., <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>) separated by a spacer, where the spacer forms a gap between the sheets to define an interior space therebetween. Other embodiments include other sealed units.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">In some embodiments the spacer <b>106</b> includes elongate strip <b>110</b>, filler <b>112</b>, and elongate strip <b>114</b>. Spacer <b>106</b> includes first end <b>126</b> and second end <b>128</b> that are connected together at joint <b>124</b> (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Spacer <b>106</b> is disposed between sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> to maintain a desired space between sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. Typically, spacer <b>106</b> is arranged near to the perimeter of sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. However, in other embodiments spacer <b>106</b> is arranged between sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> at other locations of sealed unit <b>100</b>. Spacer <b>106</b> is able to withstand compressive forces applied to sheets <b>102</b> and/or <b>104</b> to maintain an appropriate space between sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. Interior space <b>120</b> is bounded on two sides by sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> and is surrounded by spacer <b>106</b>. In some embodiments spacer <b>106</b> is a window spacer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">Elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> are typically long and thin strips of a solid material, such as metal or plastic. An example of a suitable metal is stainless steel. An example of a suitable plastic is a thermoplastic polymer, such as polyethylene terephthalate. A material with low or no permeability is preferred in some embodiments, such as to prevent or reduce air or moisture flow therethrough. Other embodiments include a material having a low thermal conductivity, such as to reduce heat transfer through spacer <b>106</b>. Other embodiments include other materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">Elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> are typically flexible, including both bending and torsional flexibility. Bending flexibility (as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) allows spacer <b>106</b> to be bent to form corners (e.g., corner <b>122</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>). Bending and torsional flexibility also allows for ease of manufacturing, such as by allowing the spacer to be stored on a spool, and allowing the spacer to be more easily handled by robots or other automated assembly devices. Such flexibility includes either elastic or plastic deformation such that elongate strips <b>110</b> or <b>114</b> do not fracture during installation into sealed unit <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">In some embodiments, elongate strips include an undulating shape, such as a sinusoidal or other undulating shape (such as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). The undulating shape provides various advantages in different embodiments. For example, the undulating shape provides additional bending and torsional flexibility, and also provides stretching flexibility along a longitudinal axis of the elongate strips. An advantage of such flexibility is that the elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> (or the entire spacer <b>106</b>) are more easily manipulated during manufacturing without causing permanent damage (e.g., kinking, creasing, or breaking) to the elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> or to the spacer <b>106</b>. The undulating shape provides increased surface area per unit of length of the spacer, providing increased surface area for bonding the spacer to one or more sheets. In addition, the increased surface area distributes forces present at the intersection of an elongate strip and the one or more sheets to reduce the chance of breaking, cracking, or otherwise damaging the sheet at the location of contact.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">In some embodiments, filler <b>112</b> is arranged between elongate strip <b>110</b> and elongate strip <b>114</b>. Filler <b>112</b> is a deformable material in some embodiments. Being deformable allows spacer <b>106</b> to flex and bend, such as to be formed around corners of sealed unit <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, filler <b>112</b> is a desiccant that acts to remove moisture from interior space <b>120</b>. Desiccants include molecular sieve and silica gel type desiccants. One particular example of a desiccant is a beaded desiccant, such as PHONOSORB® molecular sieve beads manufactured by W. R. Grace &amp; Co. of Columbia, Md. If desired, an adhesive is used to attach beaded desiccant between elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">In many embodiments, filler <b>112</b> is a material that provides support to elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> to provide increased structural strength. Without filler <b>112</b>, the thin elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> may have a tendency to bend or buckle, such as when a compressive force is applied to one or both of sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. Filler <b>112</b> fills (or partially fills) space between elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> to resist deformation of elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> into filler <b>112</b>. In addition, some embodiments include a filler <b>112</b> having adhesive properties that further allows spacer <b>106</b> to resist undesired deformation. Because the filler <b>112</b> is trapped in the space between the elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> and the sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>, the filler <b>112</b> cannot leave the space when a force is applied. This increases the strength of the spacer to more than the strength of the elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> alone. As a result, spacer <b>106</b> does not rely solely on the strength and stability of elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> to maintain appropriate spacing between sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> and to prevent buckling, bending, or breaking. An advantage is that the strength and stability of elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> themselves can be reduced, such as by reducing the material thickness (e.g., T7 shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) of elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b>. In doing so, material costs are reduced. Furthermore, thermal transfer through elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> is also reduced. In some embodiments, filler <b>112</b> is a matrix desiccant material that not only acts to provide structural support between elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b>, but also functions to remove moisture from interior space <b>120</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">Examples of filler materials include adhesive, foam, putty, resin, silicon rubber, and other materials. Some filler materials are a desiccant or include a desiccant, such as a matrix desiccant material. Matrix desiccant typically includes desiccant and other filler material. Examples of matrix desiccants include those manufactured by W.R. Grace &amp; Co. and H.B. Fuller Corporation. In some embodiments, filler <b>112</b> includes a beaded desiccant that is combined with another filler material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">In some embodiments, filler <b>112</b> is made of a material providing thermal insulation. The thermal insulation reduces heat transfer through spacer <b>106</b> both between sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>, and between the interior space <b>120</b> and an exterior side of spacer <b>106</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">In some embodiments, elongate strip <b>110</b> includes a plurality of apertures <b>116</b> (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Apertures <b>116</b> allow gas and moisture to pass through elongate strip <b>110</b>. As a result, moisture located within interior space <b>120</b> is allowed to pass through elongate strip <b>110</b> where it is removed by desiccant of filler <b>112</b> by absorption or adsorption. In one possible embodiment, elongate strip <b>110</b> includes a regular and repeating arrangement of apertures. For example, one possible embodiment includes apertures in a range from about 10 to about 1000 apertures per inch, and preferably from about 500 to about 800 apertures per inch. Other embodiments include other numbers of apertures per unit length.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">In some embodiments it is desirable to provide as much aperture area as possible through elongate strip <b>110</b>. In one example, the aperture area is defined as a percentage of the elongate strip area (e.g. prior to forming the apertures) over at least a region of the elongate strip <b>110</b>. In some embodiments the aperture area is in a range from about 5% to about 75% of at least a region of the elongate strip <b>110</b>, and preferably in a range from about 40% to about 60%. Other embodiments include other percentages.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">In another embodiment, apertures <b>116</b> are used for registration. In yet another embodiment, apertures provide reduced thermal transfer. In one example, apertures <b>116</b> have a diameter in a range from about 0.002 inches (about 0.005 centimeter) to about 0.05 inches (about 0.13 centimeter) and preferably from about 0.005 inches (about 0.015 centimeter) to about 0.02 inches (about 0.05 centimeter). Some embodiments include multiple aperture sizes, such as one aperture size for gas and moisture passage and another aperture size for registration of accessories or other devices, such as muntin bars. Apertures <b>116</b> are made by any suitable method, such as cutting, punching, drilling, laser forming, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">Spacer <b>106</b> is connectable to sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, filler <b>112</b> connects spacer <b>106</b> to sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. In other embodiments, filler <b>112</b> is connected to sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> by a fastener. An example of a fastener is a sealant or an adhesive, as described in more detail below. In yet other embodiments, a frame, sash, or the like is constructed around sealed unit <b>100</b> to support spacer <b>106</b> between sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, spacer <b>106</b> is connected to the frame or sash by another fastener, such as adhesive. Spacer <b>106</b> is fastened to the frame or sash prior to installation of sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> in some embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">Ends <b>126</b> and <b>128</b> (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of spacer <b>106</b> are connected together in some embodiments to form joint <b>124</b>, thereby forming a closed loop. In some embodiments a fastener is used to form joint <b>124</b>. Examples of suitable joints are described in more detail with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21-25</figref>. Spacer <b>106</b> and sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> together define an interior space <b>120</b> of sealed unit <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, interior space <b>120</b> acts as an insulating region, reducing heat transfer through sealed unit <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">A gas is sealed within interior space <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, the gas is air.

In this embodiment, sealed unit <b>100</b> includes sheet <b>102</b>, sheet <b>104</b>, and spacer <b>106</b>. Sealants <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> are also shown.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">Sheet <b>102</b> includes outer surface <b>310</b>, inner surface <b>312</b>, and perimeter <b>314</b>. Sheet <b>104</b> includes outer surface <b>320</b>, inner surface <b>322</b>, and perimeter <b>324</b>. In one example, W is the thickness of sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. W is typically in a range from about 0.05 inches (about 0.13 centimeter) to about 1 inch (about 2.5 centimeters), and preferably from about 0.1 inches (about 0.25 centimeter) to about 0.5 inches (about 1.3 centimeters). Other embodiments include other dimensions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">Spacer <b>106</b> is arranged between inner surface <b>312</b> and inner surface <b>322</b>. Spacer <b>106</b> is typically arranged near perimeters <b>314</b> and <b>324</b>. In one example, D1 is the distance between perimeters <b>314</b> and <b>324</b> and spacer <b>106</b>. D1 is typically in a range from about 0 inches (about 0 centimeter) to about 2 inches (about 5 centimeters), and preferably from about 0.1 inches (about 0.25 centimeter) to about 0.5 inches (about 1.3 centimeters). However, in other embodiments spacer <b>106</b> is arranged at other locations between sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">Spacer <b>106</b> maintains a space between sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. In one example, W1 is the overall width of spacer <b>106</b> and the distance between sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. W1 is typically in a range from about 0.1 inches (about 0.25 centimeter) to about 2 inches (about 5 centimeters), and preferably from about 0.3 inches (about 0.76 centimeter) to about 1 inch (about 2.5 centimeters). Other embodiments include other dimensions. In some embodiments W1 is also the space between sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. In other embodiments, the space between sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> is slightly larger than W1, such as due to the presence of one or more other materials, such as sealants <b>302</b> and <b>304</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">Spacer <b>106</b> includes elongate strip <b>110</b> and elongate strip <b>114</b>. Elongate strip <b>110</b> includes external surface <b>330</b>, internal surface <b>332</b>, edge <b>334</b>, and edge <b>336</b>. In some embodiments elongate strip <b>110</b> also includes apertures <b>116</b>. Elongate strip <b>114</b> includes external surface <b>340</b>, internal surface <b>342</b>, edge <b>344</b>, and edge <b>346</b>. In some embodiments, external surface <b>330</b> of elongate strip <b>110</b> is visible by a person when looking through sealed unit <b>100</b>. Internal surface <b>332</b> of elongate strip <b>110</b> provides a clean and finished appearance to spacer <b>106</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">In one example, T1 is the overall thickness of spacer <b>106</b> from external surface <b>330</b> to external surface <b>340</b>. T1 is typically in a range from about 0.02 inches (about 0.05 centimeter) to about 1 inch (about 2.5 centimeters), and preferably from about 0.05 inches (about 0.13 centimeter) to about 0.5 inches (about 1.3 centimeters), and more preferably from about 0.15 inches (about 0.4 centimeter) to about 0.25 inches (about 0.6 centimeter). T2 is the distance between elongate strip <b>110</b> and elongate strip <b>114</b>, and more specifically the distance from internal surface <b>332</b> to internal surface <b>342</b>. T2 is also the thickness of filler material <b>112</b> in some embodiments. T2 is in a range from about 0.02 inches (about 0.05 centimeter) to about 1 inch (about 2.5 centimeters), and preferably from about 0.05 inches (about 0.13 centimeter) to about 0.5 inches (about 1.3 centimeters), and more preferably from about 0.15 inches (about 0.4 centimeter) to about 0.25 inches (about 0.6 centimeter).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">The thickness of spacer <b>106</b> involves a balancing of multiple factors. One factor is the ability of spacer <b>106</b> to be formed around a corner. Some of these dimensions are beneficial to enable spacer <b>106</b> to be formed along a radius, such as to form a corner, without damaging spacer <b>106</b> or filler <b>112</b>. Generally the thinner spacer <b>106</b> is, the more bending can occur without damaging spacer <b>106</b> or filler <b>112</b>. Another factor to consider is the heat transfer characteristic. Generally, the thinner spacer <b>106</b> (an in particular elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b>), the less heat transfer will occur across spacer <b>106</b> between sheet <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. On the other hand, a thicker filler layer <b>112</b> generally provides greater insulating characteristics across the spacer <b>106</b> from external surface <b>340</b> to external surface <b>330</b>. Another factor is the cost of materials. The thicker spacer <b>106</b> is, the more expensive the spacer will be to make because of the increased material required. A further consideration is that filler <b>112</b> should have sufficient desiccant to adequately remove moisture from interior space <b>120</b>. If filler <b>112</b> is too thin, there may not be a sufficient amount of desiccant to remove moisture, possibly resulting in condensation of the moisture on sheets <b>102</b> or <b>104</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">In some embodiments the dimension T2 is an average dimension. For example, in some embodiments elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> and filler <b>112</b> are not flat and straight, but rather have an undulating shape. As a result, the distance T2 may vary slightly with the undulating shape. In these embodiments, T2 is an average thickness. Other embodiments include other dimensions than those discussed above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">In some embodiments, a first sealant material <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> is used to connect spacer <b>106</b> to sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. In one embodiment, sealant <b>302</b> is applied to an edge of spacer <b>106</b>, such as on edges <b>334</b> and <b>344</b>, and the edge of filler <b>112</b> and then pressed against inner surface <b>312</b> of sheet <b>102</b>. Sealant <b>304</b> is also applied to an edge of spacer <b>106</b>, such as on edges <b>336</b> and <b>346</b>, and an edge of filler <b>112</b> and then pressed against inner surface <b>322</b> of sheet <b>104</b>. In other embodiments, beads of sealant <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> are applied to sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>, and spacer <b>106</b> is then pressed into the beads.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">In some embodiments, first sealant <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> is a material having adhesive properties, such that first sealant <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> acts to fasten spacer <b>106</b> to sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. Typically, sealant <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> is arranged to support spacer <b>106</b> such that spacer <b>106</b> extends in a direction normal to inner surfaces <b>312</b> and <b>322</b> of sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. First sealant <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> also acts to seal the joint formed between spacer <b>106</b> and sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> to inhibit gas or liquid intrusion into interior space <b>120</b>. Examples of first sealant <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> are primary sealants. Examples of primary sealants include polyisobutylene (PIB), butyl, curable PIB, hot melt silicon, acrylic adhesive, acrylic sealant, and other Dual Seal Equivalent (DSE) type materials. Other embodiments include other materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">In some embodiments, a reactive sealant is included. In other embodiments a sealant having a low viscosity is included. In yet other embodiments a sealant having a long cure time is included. In another embodiment, a non-reactive hot melt is included. In further embodiments a temperature cured sealant is included. Elongate strips provide a good heat transfer media in some embodiments to transfer heat from a sealant. In some embodiments the heat transfer is further improved by using stainless steel elongate strips.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">First sealant <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> is illustrated as extending out from the edges of spacer <b>106</b>, such that the first sealant <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> contacts surfaces <b>330</b> and <b>340</b> of elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b>. The additional contact area between first sealant <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> and spacer <b>106</b> is beneficial. For example, the additional surface area increases adhesion strength. The increased thickness of sealants <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> also improves the moisture and gas barrier. In some embodiments, however, sealants <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> are confined to space between spacer <b>106</b> and sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>.</div>

Sealed unit <b>100</b> includes sheet <b>102</b>, sheet <b>104</b>, spacer <b>106</b>, and second sealant <b>402</b> and <b>404</b>. Sealed unit <b>100</b> defines an interior space <b>120</b> between inner surface <b>312</b> and inner surface <b>322</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">In this embodiment, second sealant <b>402</b> and <b>404</b> is included to provide a second barrier against gas and fluid intrusion into interior space <b>120</b>.

Sealant <b>404</b> is applied at the intersection of elongate strip <b>114</b> and sheet <b>104</b>, and connects to external surface <b>340</b> and inner surface <b>322</b>. In some embodiments, second sealant provides additional thermal insulation. Examples of second sealant <b>402</b> and <b>404</b> are secondary sealants. Examples of secondary sealants include reactive hot melt beutal (such as D-2000 manufactured by Delchem, Inc. located in Wilmington, Del.), curative hot melt (such as HL-5153 manufactured by H.B. Fuller Company), silicon, copolymers of silicon and polyisobutylene, and other dual seal equivalents. Other embodiments include other materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">In one example, sealants <b>402</b> and <b>404</b> have a width W2 and W3. W2 and W3 are typically in a range from about 0.1 inches (about 0.25 centimeter) to about 1 inch (about 2.5 centimeters), and preferably from about 0.1 inches (about 0.25 centimeter) to about 0.3 inches (about 0.76 centimeter). In some embodiments, the sum of W2 and W3 is in a range from about 20 percent to about 100 percent of the width of spacer <b>106</b> (e.g., W1 shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), and preferably from about 50 percent to about 90 percent. A benefit of embodiments in which the second sealant (e.g., <b>402</b>) extends entirely (100%) across surface <b>340</b> of spacer <b>106</b> is that the second sealant provides an additional layer of insulation across all of spacer <b>106</b>, providing improved thermal performance. T4 is the thickness of sealants <b>402</b> and <b>404</b>. T4 is typically in a range from about 0.1 inches (about 0.25 centimeter) to about 1 inch (about 2.5 centimeters), and preferably from about 0.1 inches (about 0.25 centimeter) to about 0.3 inches (about 0.76 centimeter).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">As discussed in more detail herein, in some embodiments spacer <b>106</b> is formed directly on a sheet (e.g., sheet <b>104</b>).

In this embodiment, spacer <b>106</b> includes elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> that are generally flat and smooth (e.g. having an amplitude of about 0 inches (about 0 centimeter) and a period of about 0 inches (about 0 centimeter)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">In one example, elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> are made of stainless steel. One benefit of stainless steel is that it is resistant to ultraviolet radiation. Other metals are used in other embodiments, such as titanium or aluminum. Titanium has a lower thermal conductivity, a lower density, and better corrosion resistance than stainless steel. An aluminum alloy is used in some embodiments, such as an alloy of aluminum and one or more of copper, zinc, magnesium, manganese or silicon. Other metal alloys are used in other embodiments. Another embodiment includes a material that is coated. A painted substrate is included in some embodiments. Some embodiments of elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> are made of a material having memory. Some embodiments include elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> made of a polymer, such as plastic. Other embodiments include other materials or combinations of materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">In this example, elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> have a thickness T5 and T6. T5 and T6 are typically in a range from about 0.0001 inches (about 0.00025 centimeter) to about 0.01 inches (about 0.025 centimeter), and preferably from about 0.0003 inches (about 0.00076 centimeter) to about 0.004 inches (about 0.01 centimeter). In some embodiments T5 and T6 are about equal. In other embodiments, T5 and T6 are not equal. Other embodiments include other dimensions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">In some embodiments, the materials used to form elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b>, allow elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> to have at least some bending flexibility and torsional flexibility. Bending flexibility allows spacer <b>106</b> to form a corner (e.g., corner <b>122</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), for example. In addition, bending flexibility allows elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> to be stored in a roll or on a spool as rolled stock. Rolled stock saves space during transportation and is therefore easier and less expensive to transport. Portions of elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> are then unrolled during assembly. In some embodiments a tool is used to guide elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> into the desired arrangement and to insert filler <b>112</b> to form spacer <b>106</b>. In other embodiments, a machine or robot is used to automatically manufacture spacer <b>106</b> and sealed unit <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a schematic front view of a portion of another example spacer <b>106</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> includes an enlarged view of a portion of spacer <b>106</b>. Spacer <b>106</b> includes elongate strip <b>110</b>, filler <b>112</b>, and elongate strip <b>114</b>. In this embodiment, elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> have an undulating shape. The laterally undulating shape defines peaks that extend in a direction transverse to a longitudinal direction of the elongate strips.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">In some embodiments, elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> are formed of a ribbon of material, which is then bent into the undulating shape. In some embodiments, the elongate strip material is metal, such as steel, stainless steel, aluminum, titanium, a metal alloy, or other metal. Other embodiments include other materials, such as plastic, carbon fiber, graphite, or other materials or combinations of these or other materials. Some examples of the undulating shape include sinusoidal, arcuate, square, rectangular, triangular, and other desired shapes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">In one embodiment, undulations are formed in the elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> by passing a ribbon of elongate strip material through a roll-former. An example of a suitable roll-former is a pair of corrugated rollers. As the flat ribbon of material is passed between the corrugated rollers, the teeth of the roller bend the ribbon into the undulating shape. Depending on the shape of the teeth, different undulating shapes can be formed. In some embodiments, the undulating shape is sinusoidal. In other embodiments, the undulating shape has another shape, such as squared, triangular, angled, or other regular or irregular shape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">Other embodiments form undulating elongate strips in other manners. For example, some embodiments form undulating elongate strips by injection molding. A continuous injection molding process is used in some embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">One of the benefits of the undulating shape is that the flexibility of elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> is increased over that of a flat ribbon, including bending and torsional flexibility, in some embodiments. The undulating shape of elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> resist permanent deformation, such as kinks and fractures, in some embodiments. This allows elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> to be more easily handled during manufacturing without damaging elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b>. The undulating shape also increases the structural stability of elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> to improve the ability of spacer <b>106</b> to withstand compressive and torsional loads. Some embodiments of elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> are also able to extend and contract (e.g., stretch longitudinally), which is beneficial, for example, when spacer <b>106</b> is formed around a corner. In some embodiments, the undulating shape reduces or eliminates the need for notching or other stress relief.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">In one example, elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> have material thicknesses T7. T7 is typically in a range from about 0.0001 inches (about 0.00025 centimeter) to about 0.01 inches (about 0.025 centimeter), and preferably from about 0.0003 inches (about 0.00076 centimeter) to about 0.004 inches (about 0.01 centimeter). Such thin material thickness reduces material costs and also reduces thermal conductivity through elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b>. In some embodiments, such thin material thicknesses are possible because of the undulating shape of elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> increases the structural strength of elongate strips.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">In one example, the undulating shape of elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> defines a waveform having a peak-to-peak amplitude and a peak-to-peak period. The peak-to-peak amplitude is also the overall thickness T9 of elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b>. T9 is typically in a range from about 0.005 inches (about 0.013 centimeter) to about 0.1 inches (about 0.25 centimeter), and preferably from about 0.02 inches (about 0.05 centimeter) to about 0.04 inches (about 0.1 centimeter). P1 is the peak-to-peak period of undulating elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b>. P1 is typically in a range from about 0.005 inches (about 0.013 centimeter) to about 0.1 inches (about 0.25 centimeter), and preferably from about 0.02 inches (about 0.05 centimeter) to about 0.04 inches (about 0.1 centimeter). As described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, larger waveforms are used in other embodiments. Yet other embodiments include other dimensions than described in this example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a schematic front view of a portion of another example embodiment of spacer <b>106</b>. Spacer <b>106</b> includes elongate strip <b>110</b>, filler <b>112</b>, and elongate strip <b>114</b>. This embodiment is similar to the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, except that elongate strip <b>114</b> has an undulating shape that is much larger than the undulating shape of elongate strip <b>110</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">In one example, elongate strip <b>114</b> has a material thickness T10. T10 is typically in a range from about 0.0001 inches (about 0.00025 centimeter) to about 0.01 inches (about 0.025 centimeter), and preferably from about 0.0003 inches (about 0.00076 centimeter) to about 0.004 inches (about 0.01 centimeter). The undulating shape of elongate strip <b>114</b> defines a waveform having a peak-to-peak amplitude and a peak-to-peak period. The peak-to-peak amplitude is also the overall thickness T12 of elongate strip <b>114</b>. T12 is typically in a range from about 0.05 inches (about 0.13 centimeter) to about 0.4 inches (about 1 centimeters), and preferably from about 0.1 inches (about 0.25 centimeter) to about 0.2 inches (about 0.5 centimeter). P2 is the peak-to-peak period of large undulating elongate strip <b>114</b>. P2 is typically in a range from about 0.05 inches (about 0.13 centimeter) to about 0.5 inches (about 1.3 centimeters), and preferably from about 0.1 inches (about 0.25 centimeter) to about 0.3 inches (about 0.76 centimeter). In some embodiments, the small undulating shape of elongate strip <b>110</b> has a range from about 5 to about 15 peaks per peak of the large undulating shape of elongate strip <b>114</b>. In some embodiments, elongate strip <b>110</b> and elongate strip <b>114</b> are reversed, such that elongate strip <b>110</b> has a larger waveform than elongate strip <b>114</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">Some embodiments having the large undulating elongate strip <b>114</b> benefit from increased stability. The larger undulating waveform has an overall thickness that is increased. This thickness resists torsional forces and in some embodiments provides increased resistance to compressive loads. Larger waveform elongate strip <b>114</b> can be expanded and compressed, such as to stretch to form a corner. In one embodiment, larger waveform elongate strip <b>114</b> is expandable between a first length (having the large undulating shape) and a second length (in which elongate strip <b>114</b> is substantially straight and substantially lacking an undulating shape). In some embodiments, the second length is in a range from 25 percent to about 60 percent greater than the first length, and preferably from about 30 percent to about 50 percent greater. Larger waveform elongate strip <b>114</b> also includes greater surface area per unit length of spacer <b>106</b>, such as for connection with first sealant <b>302</b> and <b>304</b>, second sealant <b>402</b> and <b>404</b>, and filler <b>112</b>. The greater surface area also provides increased strength and stability in some embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">In some embodiments, portions of elongate strip <b>114</b> are connected to elongate strip <b>110</b> without filler <b>112</b> between. For example, a portion of elongate strip <b>114</b> is connected to elongate strip <b>110</b> with a fastener, such as a high adhesive, weld, rivet, or other fastener.</div>

In some embodiments, filler <b>804</b> includes a desiccant that removes moisture from interior space <b>120</b>. In other embodiments one or more of the fillers <b>112</b> and/or <b>804</b> do not include desiccant. For example, in some embodiments, filler <b>112</b> is a sealant and filler <b>804</b> includes a desiccant. In some embodiments an aperture is not included in elongate strip <b>110</b>. Also, in some embodiments a separate sealant <b>304</b> is not required, such as if filler <b>112</b> is a sealant.</div>

In some embodiments, apertures <b>1102</b> are slots, slits, holes, and the like. A fastener <b>1102</b> is then inserted into the aperture and connected to elongate strip <b>110</b>. One example of a fastener <b>1102</b> is a screw. Another example is a pin. Another example of fastener <b>1102</b> is a tab. Apertures <b>1102</b> are not required in all embodiments.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">In this embodiment, elongate strip <b>110</b> is divided into two strips that are separated by thermal break <b>1210</b>. The separation of elongate strip <b>110</b> by thermal break <b>1210</b> further reduces heat transfer through elongate strip <b>110</b> to improve the insulating properties of spacer <b>106</b>. For example, if sheet <b>102</b> is adjacent a relatively cold space and sheet <b>104</b> is adjacent a relatively warm space, some heat transfer may occur through elongate strip <b>114</b>. Thermal break <b>1210</b> reduces the heat transfer through elongate strip <b>114</b>. Thermal break <b>1210</b> typically extends along the entire length of elongate strip <b>110</b>.

Some embodiments of spacer <b>106</b> are able to form a corner without being damaged (e.g., kinking, fracturing, etc.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">In this example, elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> include an undulating shape. As a result, elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> are capable of expanding and compressing as necessary. The undulating shape is able to expand by stretching. In the illustrated example, elongate strip <b>114</b> has been expanded to form the corner. In some embodiments, the undulating shape of elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> is expandable from a first length (having an undulating shape) to a second length (at which point the elongate strip is substantially flat and without an undulating shape). The second length is typically in a range from about 5 percent to about 25 percent longer than the first length, and preferably from about 10 percent to about 20 percent longer than the first length. The stretch length can be increased by increasing the amplitude of the undulations of unstretched elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b>, thereby providing additional length of material for stretching.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0138">In some embodiments, the undulating shape of elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> is also compressible. The illustrated embodiment shows elongate strip <b>110</b> slightly compressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139">In some embodiments, spacer <b>106</b> has bending flexibility as shown. For example, a radius of curvature (as measured from a centerline <b>1310</b> of spacer <b>106</b>, is typically in a range from about 0.05 inches (about 0.13 centimeter) to about 0.5 inches (about 1.3 centimeters), and preferably from about 0.05 inches (about 0.13 centimeter) to about 0.25 inches (about 0.6 centimeter) without undesired kinking or fracture to elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b>. In other embodiments, the radius of curvature in spacer <b>106</b> is also attainable without permanently damaging filler <b>112</b>, such as by causing cracking or forming air gaps in filler <b>112</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0140">In some embodiments, the distance between first and second elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> is substantially constant without significant narrowing at the corner. For example, D10 is the distance between elongate strip <b>110</b> and elongate strip <b>114</b> in a substantially linear portion of spacer <b>106</b>. D12 is the distance between elongate strip <b>110</b> and elongate strip <b>114</b> in a portion of spacer <b>106</b> that has been formed into about a 90 degree corner. In some embodiments, D12 is in a range from about 95% to about 100% of D10. In other embodiments, D12 is in a range from about 75% to about 100% of D10. As a result of the substantially constant thickness of spacer <b>106</b>, spacer has substantially constant thermal properties in linear portions and non-linear portions, such as corners.</div>

The second region <b>1402</b> is between the first region <b>1400</b> and the third region <b>1404</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0143" num="0142">The undulating shape of elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> give spacer <b>106</b> flexibility in all three dimensions including bending flexibility in two dimensions as well as stretching and compression flexibility in a third dimension. The undulating shape of elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> further provides spacer <b>106</b> with a twisting (e.g. torsional) flexibility about the longitudinal axis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0144" num="0143">In addition to the cornering flexibility illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, spacer <b>106</b> also exhibits a lateral flexibility illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. In this example, first region <b>1400</b> extends substantially straight along a longitudinal axis A1. A third region <b>1404</b> of spacer <b>106</b> is bent such that third region <b>1404</b> is substantially straight along a longitudinal axis A2. Upon bending of third region <b>1404</b>, second region <b>1402</b> is also bent and has a curved shape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0144">Bending of third region <b>1404</b> is accomplished by applying a force in the direction of arrow F1 to third region <b>1404</b> while maintaining first region <b>1400</b> fixed in alignment with axis A1. The force causes spacer <b>106</b> to bend, as shown.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0145">When the force in direction F1 is applied to third region <b>1404</b>, elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> bend. Upon bending, the undulating shape of elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> changes. Elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> are capable of extending at one edge (thereby decreasing the amplitude of the undulations in that region). As a result, spacer <b>106</b> bends in the direction of arrow F1. In another embodiment, the undulating shape contracts on one side, thereby increasing the amplitude of the undulations. Such contraction allows spacer <b>106</b> to bend in the direction of arrow F1. In another embodiment, bending causes both a contraction of the undulations on one end and an extension of the undulations at another end.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0147" num="0146">In some embodiments, first region <b>1400</b> and third region <b>1404</b> are bent to form an angle A3, without damaging spacer <b>106</b>.

Body <b>2604</b> includes an orifice <b>2612</b> that extends from a top surface of body <b>2604</b> through output nozzle <b>2610</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0183" num="0182">During operation, filler is supplied to jig <b>2600</b> by a source, such as a pump (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26-30</figref>).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0184" num="0183">Elongate strip guides <b>2602</b> and <b>2606</b> cooperate with output nozzle <b>2610</b> to guide elongate strips and to supply filler therebetween. Elongate strip guides <b>2602</b> and <b>2606</b> are spaced from output nozzle <b>2610</b> a sufficient distance D20 (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>) apart such that elongate strips (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26-30</figref>) can pass on either side of output nozzle <b>2610</b> and between output nozzle <b>2610</b> and elongate strip guides <b>2602</b> and <b>2606</b>. In this way, elongate strips are maintained at a proper separation D21 (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) during filling. Elongate strip guides <b>2602</b> and <b>2606</b> are relatively thin D22 to enable jig <b>2600</b> to form tight corners. D22 is typically in a range from about 0.1 inches (about 0.25 centimeter) to about 0.5 inches (about 1.3 centimeters), and preferably from about 0.2 inches (about 0.5 centimeter) to about 0.3 inches (about 0.76 centimeter).</div>

The lower portion has a height H1 (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>). Height H1 is typically slightly larger than the width of elongate strips, such that when a bottom surface of the lower portion is placed onto a surface (e.g., a sheet of glass), the elongate strips fit between the surface and the bottom surface of body <b>2604</b>. Output nozzle <b>2610</b> extends out from the upper portion of body <b>2604</b> a height H2. H2 is typically less than H1. The difference between H2 and H1 is the height H3. If the bottom surface of jig <b>2600</b> is placed onto a surface, H3 is the height between the bottom of output nozzle <b>2610</b> and the surface. Typically, H3 is about equal to the desired thickness of a layer of filler material. If filler material is to be applied in multiple layers, H3 is typically an equivalent fraction of the width of the elongate strip. For example, if filler is going to be applied in three layers, then H3 is typically about ⅓ of the total width of the elongate strip, so that each layer will fill about ⅓ of the space. In other embodiments, filler is applied in a number of layers, where the number of layers is typically in a range from about 1 layer to about 10 layers, and preferably in a range from about 1 layer to about 3 layers. Such a multi-layered filler is sometimes referred to herein as a horizontal stack.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0213" num="0212"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref> is a flow chart illustrating an exemplary method <b>4800</b> of making a sealed unit. Method <b>4800</b> includes operations <b>4802</b>, <b>4804</b>, <b>4806</b>, <b>4808</b>, <b>4810</b>, and <b>4812</b>. Method <b>4800</b> is used to make a sealed unit including a first sheet, a second sheet, and a spacer therebetween.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0214" num="0213">Method <b>4800</b> begins with operation <b>4802</b> during which elongate strip material is obtained. In one embodiment, elongate strip material is obtained in the form of rolled stock. In some embodiments a spool is used having the rolled elongate strip material wound thereon. An example spool is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 58-60</figref>. In some embodiments two spools are obtained—a first spool providing material to make a first elongate strip and a second spool providing material to make a second elongate strip. Dual spools allow the elongate strips to be processed at the same time. An example of an elongate strip material is a long, thin strip of metal or plastic.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0215" num="0214">In some embodiments, a large number of the same or very similar window assemblies are manufactured. In such embodiments, the size and length of a spacer does not vary. An advantage of this method of manufacturing is that the same elongate strip material can be used to make all of the spacers, such that down time required to change elongate strip materials or make other process modifications is reduced or eliminated. As a result, the productivity of the manufacturing is improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0216" num="0215">In other embodiments, a variety of different window assemblies are manufactured, such as having window assemblies of different sizes or shapes. This type of manufacturing is sometimes referred to as custom window manufacturing or one-for-one manufacturing. In such embodiments, various types and sizes of spacers are needed for assembly with various types and sizes of window sheets. In some embodiments the materials (such as elongate strip materials) are manually selected and installed in a manufacturing system depending on the sealed unit that is next going to be made. However, such manual changing of materials results in a down time that reduces the productivity of the manufacturing system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0217" num="0216">An alternative method of custom manufacturing involves the use of an automated material selection device. The automated material selection device is loaded with a plurality of different elongate strip materials, such as having different widths, lengths, thicknesses, shapes, colors, material properties, or other differences. In some embodiments, each material is stored on a spool in which the material is wound around the spool. When a sealed unit is about to be manufactured, a control system determines the type of spacer needed, and the elongate strip material that is needed to make that spacer. The control system then selects that elongate strip material from one or more of the spools and obtains the material from the spool. The automated material selection device then advances that material to the next stage of the manufacturing system where it will be formed into the appropriate spacer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0218" num="0217">In some embodiments two or more spools are provided for each elongate strip material. One advantage of having multiple spools is that multiple strips of elongate strip material can be processed at once. For example, if a spacer requires two elongate strips, the two elongate strips can be processed simultaneously to reduce manufacturing time. Another advantage of having multiple spools is that the automated material selection device continues to operate even after one spool of material has been depleted, by selecting another spool having the same material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0219" num="0218">Yet another advantage of having multiple spools is that the automated material selection device can be programmed to reduce waste. For example, if about 12 feet (about 3.7 meters) of material remains on a first spool but 40 feet (12 meters) of the same material is on a second spool, the automated material selection device is programmed to determine the most effective use of the available materials to reduce waste. If the next sealed unit to be manufactured requires a length of 8 feet (2.4 meters) of material, the automated material selection device determines whether to use a portion of the 12 feet (3.7 meters) on the first spool or a portion of the 40 feet (12 meters) on the second spool. If the automated material selection device also knows that the following sealed unit to be manufactured requires 12 feet (3.7 meters) of material, the automated material selection device will save the 12 feet (3.7 meters) of material on the first spool for use in the second sealed unit. In this way the entire 12 feet (3.7 meters) is utilized, resulting in no or little waste. On the other hand, if the automated material selection device had instead continued to use the first real until it was depleted, the 8 foot (2.4 meters) section of material would have been removed from the first spool. As a result, 4 feet (1.2 meters) of material would have remained on the first spool. The 4 feet (1.2 meters) of material may be too short for later use, resulting in 4 feet (1.2 meters) of wasted material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0220" num="0219">After obtaining elongate strip material, operation <b>4804</b> is performed to form undulations in the elongate strip material. In one embodiment, undulations are formed by passing the extra material through a roll-former. The roll-former bends elongate strip material to form the desired undulating shape in the elongate strip material. In some embodiments, the undulations are sinusoidal undulations in the elongate strip material. In other embodiments, the undulations are other shapes, such as squared, triangular, angled, or other regular or irregular shapes. If two or more spools of elongate strip material are provided by operation <b>4802</b>, the two or more elongate strip materials are processed simultaneously by one or more roll-formers. Such simultaneous processing reduces manufacturing time and can also improve uniformity among elongate strip materials used to form the same spacer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0221" num="0220">Although operation <b>4804</b> is shown as an operation following operation <b>4802</b>, alternate embodiments perform operation <b>4804</b> prior to operation <b>4802</b>, such that the undulating shape of elongate strip materials is pre-formed in the elongate strip material prior to wrapping onto the spool. In yet another embodiment, elongate strip materials do not include undulations, such that operation <b>4804</b> is not required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0222" num="0221">After forming undulations, operation <b>4806</b> is then performed to cut the elongate strip material to the desired length. Any suitable cutting apparatus is used. If elongate strip materials are being processed simultaneously, cutting can be performed at the same time to reduce manufacturing time and to improve uniformity of elongate strips, such as to have uniform lengths. Alternatively, each elongate strip is cut sequentially. Operation <b>4806</b> can alternatively be performed prior to operation <b>4804</b>, prior to operation <b>4802</b>, or after subsequent operations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0223" num="0222">In addition to cutting to length, additional processing steps are performed during operation <b>4806</b> in some embodiments. One processing step involves the formation of apertures (e.g., apertures <b>116</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) in one of the elongate strips. Another processing step is the formation of additional features in the spacer, such as formation of apertures for connection of a muntin bar or other window feature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0224" num="0223">Once the elongate strips have been formed and cut to length, operation <b>4808</b> is performed to apply filler between the elongate strips to form an assembled spacer. In one embodiment, application of filler between the elongate strips is performed using a nozzle to insert a filler material between two elongate strips. An example of a suitable nozzle is nozzle <b>2610</b> of manufacturing jig <b>2600</b> illustrated and described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26-30</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0225" num="0224">Operation <b>4808</b> typically begins by aligning ends of two (or more) portions of substantially parallel elongate strips and inserting the nozzle between the elongate strips at that end. As filler is inserted between the elongate strips, the nozzle moves at a steady rate along the elongate strips to apply a substantially equal amount of filler between the elongate strips. Operation <b>4808</b> continues until the nozzle has reached the opposite ends of the elongate strips, such that substantially all of the spacer contains the filler.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0226" num="0225">In some embodiments, the nozzle includes a heating element that heats the filler material to a temperature above the melting point of the filler. The heating liquefies (or at least softens) the filler to allow the nozzle to apply the filler between the elongate strips. The filler fills in space between the elongate strips. The elongate strips act as a form to prevent filler from slumping. The flow rate of filler is controlled along with the movement of the nozzle along the elongate strips to provide the correct amount of filler to adequately fill the space between the elongate strips without overfilling. In an alternate embodiment, the nozzle is stationary and the elongate strips are moved relative to the nozzle at a steady rate. After filling, the spacer is allowed to cool. The filler typically stiffens as it cools, and in some embodiments the filler adheres to the internal surfaces of the elongate strips.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0227" num="0226">Operation <b>4810</b> is next performed to connect the spacer to a first sheet. In some embodiments, operation <b>4810</b> involves applying an adhesive or a sealant to an edge of the spacer and pressing the spacer onto a surface of the first sheet, such as near a perimeter of the first sheet. Alternatively, the sealant or adhesive is applied to the first sheet, and the spacer is pressed into the sealant or adhesive. Typically, the spacer is placed near to the perimeter of the window. In some embodiments the ends of the spacer are connected together to form a loop. Connection of the ends of the spacer is described in more detail with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21-25</figref>. The ends are connected in such a way that a sealed joint is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0228" num="0227">The flexibility of the spacer in multiple directions makes operation <b>4810</b> easier than if a rigid spacer were used. The flexibility allows the spacer to be easily moved and manipulated into position on the first sheet whether done manually or automatically, such as using a robot. Specifically, the flexibility allows the spacer to bend and flex in whatever direction is needed to route the spacer to the appropriate location on the first sheet. Furthermore, the flexibility allows the spacer to be easily bent to match the shape of the first sheet, such as to form corners of a generally rectangular sheet, or to match the curves of an elliptical sheet, circular sheet, half-circle sheet, or a sheet having another shape or configuration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0229" num="0228">During operation <b>4810</b>, the spacer can be bent to form one or more corners. Formation of a corner can be done in multiple ways. One method of forming a corner is to do so freely by hand. In this method, the operator carefully bends the spacer to match the shape of the perimeter of the first sheet (or other shape) as closely as possible. Another method of forming a corner involves the use of a corner tool. One example of a corner tool is a corner vice. A portion of the spacer is inserted into the corner vice which is then lightly clamped to the spacer to form the desired shape. Another example of a corner tool is a mandrel that is used to guide the spacer upon formation of a corner. Other embodiments include other guides or tools that assist in the formation of a corner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0230" num="0229">Although operation <b>4810</b> is described as being performed after operation <b>4808</b>, other embodiments perform operation <b>4810</b> simultaneous to operation <b>4808</b>. In such embodiments, filler is inserted within elongate strips at the same time as the spacer is connected to a first sheet. Such a process can be performed manually. Alternatively, a nozzle, tool, jig, or automated device (or combination of devices), such as a robotic assembly device is used. An example of a manufacturing jig and nozzle are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26-30</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0231" num="0230">In some embodiments only a single filler material is used. In other embodiments, the nozzle applies a filler as well as one or more separate sealants or adhesives. For example, the filler is applied to a central portion of the spacer, between two elongate strips, and an adhesive or sealant is applied on one or both sides of the filler. In this way the adhesive or sealant is arranged between the spacer and the first sheet to connect the spacer with the first sheet. The adhesive or sealant is also used in some embodiments to connect the second sheet to the opposite side of the spacer during operation <b>4812</b>. In some embodiments, one or more additional sealant layers are applied to one or more external surfaces of the spacer to further seal edges between the spacer and the first and second sheets. The additional sealant layers can be applied at the same time as operations <b>4808</b>, <b>4810</b>, and <b>4812</b> or after operation <b>4812</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0232" num="0231">Once the spacer has been connected to the first sheet, operation <b>4812</b> is then performed to connect a second sheet to the spacer to form a sealed unit. It is noted, however, that additional processing steps are performed between operations <b>4810</b> and <b>4812</b> in some embodiments, such as adding muntin bars or changing the content of the interior space.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0233" num="0232">In some embodiments, operation <b>4812</b> involves applying the adhesive or sealant of operation <b>4810</b> to a side of the spacer opposite the first sheet. Alternatively, the adhesive or sealant is applied directly to the second sheet. The second sheet is then placed onto the spacer to connect the spacer to the second sheet. In this way a sealed interior space is formed between first and second sheets, and surrounded by the spacer. The first and second sheets are held in a spaced relationship to each other by the spacer, to form a complete sealed unit. Alternatively, the first sheet and attached spacer are placed onto the second sheet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0234" num="0233">In some embodiments the spacer joint is kept open until after operation <b>4812</b> such that air present within the interior space can be removed through the joint, such as by purging with another gas or using a vacuum chamber to remove gas from the interior space. Once the vacuum or purge is completed, the joint is then sealed. In another embodiment, operation <b>4812</b> is performed in a vacuum chamber or chamber including a purge gas. In some such embodiments, the joint is sealed as part of operation <b>4810</b> prior to connection of the second sheet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0235" num="0234">In another possible embodiment, operations <b>4808</b>, <b>4810</b>, and <b>4812</b> are performed simultaneously. In such an embodiment, the first and second sheets are arranged in a spaced relationship and the spacer is filled and connected directly to the first and second sheets in a single step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0236" num="0235">An alternative method is a method of forming and connecting a spacer to a first sheet. This alternative method includes operations <b>4802</b>, <b>4804</b>, <b>4806</b>, <b>4808</b>, and <b>4810</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>. In this embodiment, a second sheet is not required and operation <b>4812</b> is not required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0237" num="0236"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 49-52</figref> illustrate alternate embodiments of methods useful in the manufacture of a sealed unit. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref> illustrates an example method of making and storing a spacer. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref> illustrates an example method of customizing and storing a spacer. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref> illustrates an example method of retrieving a stored spacer and connecting the stored spacer to sheets to form a sealed unit. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref> illustrates an example method of forming and connecting a spacer to a first sheet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0238" num="0237"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref> is a flow chart of an example method <b>4900</b> of making and storing a spacer. The method includes operations <b>4902</b>, <b>4904</b>, and <b>4906</b>. It is sometimes desirable to store assembled spacers prior to connection with window sheets. A multi-spacer storage is provided for this purpose, such as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 54-57</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0239" num="0238">Method <b>4900</b> begins with operation <b>4902</b> during which a spacer is formed. An example of forming a spacer includes operations <b>4802</b>, <b>4804</b>, <b>4806</b>, and <b>4808</b> described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>. The spacer includes one or more elongate strips, and preferably two or more elongate strips having an undulating shape. Filler is arranged between the elongate strips.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0240" num="0239">After formation of the spacer, operation <b>4904</b> is performed to allow the spacer to cool, if necessary. In some embodiments, filler is heated when inserted between elongate strips. It is advantageous to allow the filler to cool to allow the filler to set in the appropriate configuration, such as to prevent slumping, dripping, or deformation of the filler. In addition, if the spacer is allowed to cool while straight, the spacer will be less prone to curl during installation. However, operation <b>4904</b> is not required by all embodiments. In some embodiments, operation <b>4904</b> is performed during or after operation <b>4906</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0241" num="0240">Operation <b>4906</b> is next performed to store the spacer in multi-spacer storage. In one exemplary embodiment, the spacer is rolled onto a spool. The spool is then placed into a location of the storage rack. An example of a storage rack and spool are described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 54-60</figref>. A control system is used in some embodiments, and includes memory and a processing device, such as a microprocessor. In some embodiments the control system is a computer. In some embodiments, the control system stores information about the spacer in memory (such as in a lookup table) along with an identifier of the location of the spacer. In this way the control system is subsequently able to locate the spacer and retrieve the spacer from storage. In some embodiments a robotic arm is used to retrieve a spool and spacer from storage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0242" num="0241">As each spacer is made, the spacer is rolled onto a spool and stored in the multi-spacer storage, such that a plurality of spacers are stored in the multi-spacer storage. Alternatively, spacers are not rolled but rather are substantially straight when stored, such as on a shelf or in an elongated compartment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0243" num="0242">In alternate embodiments, operation <b>4906</b> involves storing elongate strips in multi-spacer storage prior to inserting filler. In this embodiment, the method proceeds by storing only elongate strips of the spacer in multi-spacer storage (operation <b>4906</b>). Then the spacer is formed (operation <b>4902</b>) and allowed to cool (operation <b>4904</b>). For example, a pair of elongate strips can be rolled together on a single spool. The elongate strips are then placed into storage. The elongate strips are subsequently retrieved and filled to assemble the spacer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0244" num="0243"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref> is a flow chart of an example method <b>5000</b> of forming a custom spacer and storing the spacer. Method <b>5000</b> includes operations <b>5002</b>, <b>5004</b>, <b>5006</b>, and <b>5008</b>. Method <b>5000</b> begins with operation <b>5002</b>, during which a spacer is obtained. In this method, the spacer has already been manufactured (such as by performing at least operations <b>4802</b> and <b>4808</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>) and the manufactured spacer is now obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0245" num="0244">Operation <b>5004</b> is next performed, during which the spacer is cut to length. The length is determined in some embodiments by the size of the window with which the spacer will be assembled. Operation <b>5004</b> is performed either manually or automatically. For example, a cutting tool such as a scissors or tin snips are used by a person to cut the spacer to length. As another example, a punch press is used to cut the spacer to length. Other cutting tools or devices are used in other embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0246" num="0245">Operation <b>5006</b> is next performed, during which the cut spacer is rolled in preparation for storage. In some embodiments, the spacer is rolled onto a spool. In some embodiments the spool has a diameter sufficient to prevent the spacer from being bent too far and damaged.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0247" num="0246">Operation <b>5008</b> is next performed, during which the spacer is stored in multi-spacer storage. In some embodiments, the multi-spacer storage is a structure, apparatus, or device that stores spacers in an organized manner. Examples include a shelving unit, a box or set of boxes, a cabinet, a drawer or set of drawers, a rack, conveyor belt, or any other suitable storage unit. An example of a storage rack is described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 54-57</figref>. The multi-spacer storage is a passive structure in some embodiments, but an active structure in other embodiments. For example, an active structure includes motors and drive mechanisms for moving, locating, rearranging, or obtaining a spacer from the multi-spacer storage, in some embodiments. A processing device such as a computer is used to control the multi-spacer storage in some embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0248" num="0247"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref> is a flow chart of an example method <b>5100</b> of retrieving a stored spacer and connecting the stored spacer to sheets to form a sealed unit. Method <b>5100</b> includes operations <b>5102</b>, <b>5104</b>, <b>5106</b>, and <b>5108</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0249" num="0248">Method <b>5100</b> begins with operation <b>5102</b> during which a spacer is identified that is needed for the next sealed unit that is going to be assembled. In some embodiments, spacers are stored in multi-spacer storage in the intended order of manufacture. In such embodiments, operation <b>5102</b> involves identifying the next spacer in the multi-spacer storage. A problem that can arise during the manufacture of window assemblies is that window sheets sometimes do not arrive in the expected order. For example, if a window sheet breaks, cracks, or is found to have some other defect, the window sheet may be removed. If that occurs, the spacer that would have been used for assembly with that window sheet should remain in storage (or be returned to storage) for later use when a replacement sheet has been obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0250" num="0249">As a result, some embodiments operate to identify the next spacer that is needed. In one example, an identifier, such as a number, label, or barcode is placed on the sheet. The sheet is advanced along a conveyor belt. A reader is arranged adjacent the conveyor belt and reads the identifier on the sheet. The reader conveys the information from the identifier to a control system. The control system matches the identifier with an associated spacer stored in the multi-spacer storage to identify the next spacer needed. Alternatively, operation <b>5102</b> is performed manually.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0251" num="0250">Once the next spacer has been identified, operation <b>5104</b> is then performed to locate and obtain the spacer from multi-spacer storage. In some embodiments, operation <b>5104</b> involves locating the next spacer within multi-spacer storage according to a predetermined order.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0252" num="0251">In other embodiments, operation <b>5104</b> is performed by a control system. For example, the control system stores a lookup table in memory. The lookup table includes a list of spacer identifiers and the location of an associated spacer in the multi-spacer storage. In some embodiments the lookup table includes a plurality of rows and columns. In one example, spacer identifiers are arranged in a first column and location identifiers are stored in a second column such that the spacer identifier and the location identifier are associated with each other. The control system uses the lookup table to match the identifier (from operation <b>5102</b>) with the identifier in the lookup table to determine the location of the associated spacer in the multi-spacer storage. In some embodiments, the lookup table includes additional information, such as the characteristics of each spacer stored in multi-spacer storage. In this way, the lookup table can be used to search for a spacer that has one or more desired characteristics. Examples of such characteristics include thickness, width, length, material type, filler type, color, filler thickness, and other characteristics. In some embodiments each characteristic is associated with a separate column of the lookup table.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0253" num="0252">Once the spacer has been located in multi-spacer storage, the spacer is obtained. In some embodiments, a robot or other automated device is used to remove the spacer from multi-spacer storage. Alternatively, the spacer is manually removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0254" num="0253">After the spacer has been obtained from multi-spacer storage, operation <b>5106</b> is next performed to connect the spacer to a first sheet. An example of operation <b>5106</b> is operation <b>4810</b> described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0255" num="0254">With the spacer connected to the first sheet, operation <b>5108</b> is next performed to connect a second sheet to the opposite edge of the spacer to form a sealed unit. An example of operation <b>5108</b> is operation <b>4812</b> described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>. In an alternate embodiment, operations <b>5106</b> and <b>5108</b> are performed simultaneously. Operation <b>5108</b> is not required in all embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0256" num="0255">In alternate embodiments, elongate strips are stored in multi-spacer storage without filler. In such embodiments, the filler is inserted between the elongate strips while the spacer is being connected to one or more window sheets.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0257" num="0256"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref> is a flow chart of an exemplary method <b>5250</b> of forming and connecting a spacer to a first sheet. Method <b>5250</b> includes operations <b>5202</b>, <b>5204</b>, <b>5206</b>, <b>5208</b>, <b>5210</b>, <b>5212</b>, and <b>5214</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0258" num="0257">Method <b>5200</b> begins with operation <b>5202</b>. During operation <b>5202</b> elongate strip material is obtained. In this example, filler has not yet been inserted between elongate strips to form a complete spacer. Rather, the elongate strip material itself is obtained. In some embodiments, the elongate strip material is made of metal or plastic. Other embodiments include other materials. Operation <b>5202</b> is not required in all embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0259" num="0258">Operation <b>5204</b> is then performed, if desired, to form undulations in the elongate strip material. In one example, the elongate strips are passed through a roll-former that forms the undulations in the elongate strip material. The undulations are formed, for example, by bending the elongate strip material into the desired shape. An advantage of some embodiments is increased stability of a resulting spacer. Another advantage of some embodiments is increased flexibility of the elongate strip material and a resulting spacer. Yet another advantage of some embodiments is ease of manufacturing, such as during operation <b>5214</b>, described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0260" num="0259">Operation <b>5206</b> is then performed to cut the elongate strips to length. Cutting is performed by any suitable cutting device, including a manual cutting tool or an automated cutting device. In some embodiments two or more elongate strips are cut simultaneously to form elongate strips having uniform lengths.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0261" num="0260">By performing operation <b>5206</b> after operation <b>5204</b>, the length of the undulating elongate strip is more precisely controlled. However, in other embodiments operation <b>5206</b> is performed at any time before or after operations <b>5202</b>, <b>5204</b>, <b>5208</b>, <b>5210</b>, <b>5212</b>, or <b>5214</b>. If cutting is performed prior to operation <b>5204</b>, the elongate strip is cut longer than the desired final elongate strip length. The reason is that forming undulations in the elongate strip material (operation <b>5204</b>) typically reduces the overall length of the elongate strip. However, in some embodiments the elongate strip material is stretched during operation <b>5204</b> such that the length before and after operation <b>5204</b> is substantially the same.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0262" num="0261">Operation <b>5208</b> is then performed to store elongate strip material in multi-spacer storage. Examples of operation <b>5208</b> are operations <b>4906</b> and <b>5008</b> described herein with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 49 and 50</figref>, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0263" num="0262">After at least one spacer has been stored in multi-spacer storage, operation <b>5210</b> is performed to determine whether a spacer is needed. If it is determined that a spacer is needed at this time, operation <b>5212</b> is performed. If it is determined that a spacer is not needed at this time operation <b>5210</b> is repeated until a spacer is needed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0264" num="0263">In some embodiments, operations <b>5202</b> through <b>5208</b> operate independently of operations <b>5210</b> through <b>5214</b>. In other words, operations <b>5202</b> and <b>5208</b> can, in some embodiments, operate simultaneously with operations <b>5210</b> through <b>5214</b>, when needed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0265" num="0264">Once it is determined in operation <b>5210</b> that a spacer is needed, operation <b>5212</b> is performed to locate and obtain the spacer from multi-spacer storage. This is accomplished, for example, by accessing a lookup table. The spacer is identified in the lookup table as well as the location of the spacer in the multi-spacer storage. The spacer is then obtained from that location in the multi-spacer storage. In another embodiment, operation <b>5212</b> is performed manually, by physically inspecting the multi-spacer storage and selecting an appropriate spacer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0266" num="0265">With the appropriate elongate strip has been located and obtained, operation <b>5214</b> is next performed. During operation <b>5214</b> the elongate strip material is applied to a sheet while a filler is inserted between the elongate strips.

In some embodiments, manufacturing system <b>5300</b> operates to manufacture a spacer <b>106</b> while applying the spacer <b>106</b> to a sheet <b>104</b>. A second sheet <b>102</b> is subsequently applied to form a complete sealed unit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0269" num="0268">Control system <b>5302</b> controls the operation of manufacturing system <b>5300</b>. Examples of suitable control systems include a computer, a microprocessor, central processing units (“CPU”), microcontroller, programmable logic device, field programmable gate array, digital signal processing (“DSP”) device, and the like. Processing devices may be of any general variety such as reduced instruction set computing (RISC) devices, complex instruction set computing devices (“CISC”), or specially designed processing devices such as an application-specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”) device. Typically, control system <b>5302</b> includes memory for storing data and a communication interface for sending and receiving data communication with other devices. Additional communication lines are included between control system <b>5302</b> and the rest of the manufacturing system <b>5300</b> in some embodiments. In some embodiments a communication bus is included for communication within manufacturing system <b>5300</b>. Other embodiments utilize other methods of communication, such as a wireless communication system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0270" num="0269">Manufacturing begins with an elongate strip supply <b>5304</b>. Elongate strip supply <b>5304</b> includes elongate strip material, such as in a rolled form. In some embodiments, a variety of elongate strip materials are provided. Control system <b>5302</b> selects among the available elongate strip materials to choose an elongate strip material appropriate for a particular sealed unit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0271" num="0270">Elongate strip material is then transferred to roll-former <b>5306</b>. Roll-former bends or shapes elongate strip material into a desired form, such as to include an undulating shape. In some embodiments a roll-former is not included and flat elongate strips are used that do not have an undulating shape. In other embodiments, elongate strip supply provides elongate strip material that already contains an undulating shape, such that roll-former is unnecessary.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0272" num="0271">The elongate strip material is next passed to cutting device <b>5308</b>. Cutting device <b>5308</b> cuts the elongate strip material to the desired length for the sealed unit. The completed elongate strip material is then rolled onto a spool with spooler <b>5310</b>, and subsequently stored in multi-spool storage <b>5312</b> with other spools of elongate strip material. An example of a multi-spool storage <b>5312</b> is spool storage rack <b>5400</b>, shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref>.

An example of a sheet identifier <b>5317</b> is a barcode, a printed label, a radio frequency (RF) identification tag, a color coded label, or other identifier. Sheet identification system <b>5314</b> reads sheet identifier <b>5317</b> and sends the resulting data to control system <b>5302</b> to identify sheet <b>104</b>. One example of sheet identification system <b>5314</b> is a barcode reader. Another example of sheet identification system <b>5314</b> is a charge-coupled device (CCD). In some embodiments sheet identification system <b>5314</b> reads digital data encoded by sheet identifier <b>5317</b> and transmits the digital data to control system <b>5302</b>. In other embodiments a digital photograph of sheet identification system <b>5314</b> is taken and the digital photograph is transmitted to control system <b>5302</b>. In another embodiment, sheet identification system <b>5314</b> is a magnetic or radio frequency receiver that receives data from sheet identifier <b>5317</b> identifying sheet <b>104</b>, which sheet identification system <b>5314</b> then transmits to control system <b>5302</b>. Other embodiments include other identifiers <b>5317</b> and other sheet identification systems <b>5314</b>.

Core <b>5802</b> has a generally cylindrical shape and extends through both of sidewalls <b>5804</b> and <b>5806</b>. Core <b>5802</b> provides a cylindrically shaped surface inside spool <b>5406</b> on which spacer material is wound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0292" num="0291">Core <b>5802</b> also extends out from both sides of spool <b>5406</b> to form grips <b>5810</b> and <b>5812</b> (not visible in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref>). Grips <b>5810</b> and <b>5812</b> are used in some embodiments to support spool <b>5406</b>. For example, in some embodiments spool <b>5406</b> is stored in spool storage rack <b>5400</b> by resting grips <b>5810</b> and <b>5812</b> in notches <b>5464</b>. Notches <b>5464</b> support grips <b>5810</b> and <b>5812</b> to hold spool <b>5406</b> in place. Further, in some embodiments an automated spool retrieval mechanism is used to extract a desired spool <b>5406</b> from spool storage rack <b>5400</b>, by reaching into spool storage rack <b>5400</b> and grasping grips <b>5810</b> and <b>5812</b> of the desired spool <b>5406</b>. The spool <b>5406</b> is then retrieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0293" num="0292">In some embodiments core <b>5802</b> is hollow. If desired, a rod can be inserted through core <b>5802</b>.

D30 is typically in a range from about 1 foot (about 0.3 meter) to about 4 feet (about 1.2 meters), and preferably from about 1.5 feet (about 0.5 meter) to about 2.5 feet (about 0.76 meter). D32 is the outer diameter of core <b>5802</b> around outer surface <b>5820</b>. D32 is typically in a range from about 1 inch (about 2.5 centimeters) to about 6 inches (about 15 centimeters), and preferably from about 3 inches (about 7.6 centimeters) to about 5 inches (about 13 centimeters). D32 is large enough to prevent damaging spacer material when the spacer material is wound thereon. D34 is the inner diameter of core <b>5802</b> around inner surface <b>5822</b>. D34 is typically in a range from about 1 inch (about 2.5 centimeters) to about 6 inches (about 15 centimeters), and preferably from about 2 inches (about 5 centimeters) to about 4 inches (about 10 centimeters).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0297" num="0296">Window <b>5902</b> is a cutout region in sidewall <b>5806</b> that allows a user to visually inspect the quantity of spacer material remaining on spool <b>5406</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0300" num="0299">Example dimensions for one embodiment of spool <b>5406</b> are as follows. D36 is the space between an inner surface of sidewall <b>5804</b> and an inner surface of sidewall <b>5806</b>. D36 is at least slightly larger than the width of spacer material to be stored on spool <b>5406</b>. D36 is typically in a range from about 0.2 inches (about 0.5 centimeter) to about 2 inches (about 5 centimeters), and preferably from about 0.3 inches (about 0.76 centimeter) to about 1 inch (about 2.5 centimeters). D38 is the overall width of spool <b>5406</b> across core <b>5802</b>. D38 is typically in a range from about 1 inch (about 2.5 centimeters) to about 6 inches (about 15 centimeters), and preferably from about 2 inches (about 5 centimeters) to about 4 inches (about 10 centimeters).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0301" num="0300">Spool <b>5406</b> is able to store long lengths of spacer material. In some embodiments a backing material is first wound around core <b>5802</b>. The backing material is typically a thin material such as tape. The tape adheres to core <b>5802</b>. An end of the spacer material is connected toward an end of the backing material. The spacer material is prevented from sliding along core <b>5802</b> by the backing material. In some embodiments the backing material has a length of at least about half of the diameter D30 of spool <b>5406</b>. This allows the entire spacer material to be removed from spool <b>5406</b> before the entire backing material disengages from core <b>5802</b>. In another possible embodiment, spacer material is directly connected to core <b>5802</b>, such as by inserting an end of the spacer material into a slot formed through core <b>5802</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0302" num="0301">The length of spacer material that can be stored on spool <b>5406</b> varies depending on the thickness of the spacer material, the diameter D30 of spool <b>5406</b>, and the diameter D32 of core <b>5802</b>. As one example, a spool having an outer diameter of about 2 feet (about 0.6 meter) and a core diameter of about 3 inches (about 7.6 centimeters) will typically be able to hold a length of spacer material in a range from about 600 feet (about 180 meters) to about 1000 feet (about 300 meters) if the spacer has a thickness of about 0.2 inches (about 0.5 centimeter). If only elongate strip material is stored on spool <b>5406</b>, the thickness may be considerably less than 0.2 inches (0.5 centimeter), such that a much greater length of spacer material can be stored on spool <b>5406</b>. Less spacer material can be stored on spool <b>5406</b> if the thickness of the material is larger than 0.2 inches (0.5 centimeter).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0303" num="0302">Returning now to a previously discussed example spacer, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of an example spacer <b>106</b> arranged in a sealed unit <b>100</b>. (This example embodiment was previously discussed with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> herein.) <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref> illustrates how some embodiments provide an improved joint between spacer <b>106</b> and sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0304" num="0303">An example particle <b>6102</b> (such as a gas atom or molecule) is shown. Spacer <b>106</b> blocks a large percentage of mass transfer from occurring between outside atmosphere and the interior space <b>120</b>. Mass transfer is the process by which the random motion of particles (e.g., atoms or molecules) causes a net transfer of mass from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. It is preferable to prevent or reduce the amount of mass transfer to stop particles from the outside atmosphere from penetrating into the interior space <b>120</b>, and similarly to stop desired particles from interior space <b>120</b> from leaking out into the atmosphere. The arrangement of spacer <b>106</b> (and many other embodiments discussed herein) forms a joint with sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> that provides for reduced mass transfer in some embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0305" num="0304">To illustrate this, consider the path A60 that particle <b>6102</b> must take to pass from the outside atmosphere (the starting point in this example) to interior space <b>120</b> in this example. First particle <b>6102</b> must pass through secondary sealant <b>402</b> and into primary sealant <b>302</b>. Particle <b>6102</b> must find its way to the small gap between elongate strip <b>114</b> and surface <b>312</b> of sheet <b>102</b> to enter the region between elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b>. Next, the particle must find its way to the gap between elongate strip <b>110</b> and surface <b>312</b> of sheet <b>102</b>. If all of these steps are taken, the particle may then pass into interior space <b>120</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0306" num="0305">Although path A60 is schematically illustrated as a straight line, the path of particle <b>6102</b> is anything but straight. Rather, particle <b>6102</b> moves randomly through the various regions. Only a few of the unlimited number of random paths are schematically represented by arrows A62, A64, A66, A68, A70, and A72. As suggested by these arrows, the random path of particle <b>6102</b> has a low probability of passing through secondary sealant <b>402</b> and into the gap between elongate strip <b>114</b> and sheet <b>102</b>. If it does, the particle again has a very low probability of advancing to the gap between elongate strip <b>110</b> and sheet <b>102</b>. In fact, once particle <b>6102</b> has entered the region between elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b>, the particle may have an equally likely chance of passing back through the gap between elongate strip <b>114</b> and sheet <b>102</b> as of passing through the gap between elongate strip <b>110</b> and sheet <b>102</b>. Therefore, the joint formed by spacer <b>106</b> with sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> considerably reduces mass transfer between interior space <b>120</b> and the outside atmosphere.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0307" num="0306">Another advantage of some embodiments of spacer <b>106</b> is an improved resistance to strains from movement of sealed unit <b>100</b>, sometimes referred to as pumping stress. When temperature changes occur, the temperature changes can cause sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> to move. For example, sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> may bend, such as moving from a slightly convex shape to a slightly concave shape and back. Further, wind and atmospheric pressure changes apply forces to sheets <b>102</b> and/or <b>104</b> and causes further movement of sealed unit <b>100</b>. Spacer <b>106</b> is configured to form a joint with sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> that has improved performance under such conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0308" num="0307">In some embodiments elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> have an undulating shape. The undulating shape provides a large surface area to which the sealant (e.g., <b>302</b> or <b>304</b>) contact. The large surface area provides a strong joint between the elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> and sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. The large surface area further reduces the stress applied to the sealant, by distributing the force across a larger area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0309" num="0308">Some embodiments of spacer <b>106</b> have the advantage of reduced sealant elongation during movement (e.g., pumping stress) of sealed unit <b>100</b>. Sealant elongation can have a detrimental impact on a sealant, potentially leading to damage to the sealant. In some embodiments, sealant elongation is reduced, providing improved sealant performance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0310" num="0309">In one example, sealants <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> have a thickness that is in a range from about 0.060 inches (about 0.15 centimeter) to about 0.150 inches (about 0.4 centimeter), and preferably in a range from about 0.1 inches (about 0.25 centimeter) to about 0.12 inches (about 0.3 centimeter). Due to the larger thickness of sealants <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> (as compared to, for example, a sealant having a thickness of 0.01 inches (0.025 centimeter)), the percentage of sealant elongation is reduced. If the total elongation of the sealant <b>302</b> or <b>304</b> caused by movement is about 0.02 inches (about 0.05 centimeter), the spacer elongation is in a range from about 13% to about 33%, and preferably from about 15% to about 20%. Thus, the joint provides for reduced sealant elongation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0311" num="0310">A further advantage of some embodiments of spacer <b>106</b> is that elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> are not directly connected and therefore can act independently. For example, when pumping stresses occur, a seal is maintained between both elongate strips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b> independently with sheets <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. Thus, both elongate strips and associated sealants provide improved protection to the sealed interior space <b>120</b> of the sealed unit.</div>
