<heading id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to solid state forms, for example, crystalline forms, of the compound 3-(6-(1-(2,2-difluorobenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)cyclopropanecarboxamido)-3-methylpyridin-2-yl)benzoic acid, pharmaceutical compositions thereof, and methods therewith.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">CFTR is a cAMP/ATP-mediated anion channel that is expressed in a variety of cell types, including absorptive and secretory epithelia cells, where it regulates anion flux across the membrane, as well as the activity of other ion channels and proteins. In epithelia cells, normal functioning of CFTR is critical for the maintenance of electrolyte transport throughout the body, including respiratory and digestive tissue. CFTR is composed of approximately 1480 amino acids that encode a protein made up of a tandem repeat of transmembrane domains, each containing six transmembrane helices and a nucleotide binding domain. The two transmembrane domains are linked by a large, polar, regulatory (R)-domain with multiple phosphorylation sites that regulate channel activity and cellular trafficking.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">The gene encoding CFTR has been identified and sequenced (See, Gregory, R. J., et al. (1990) Nature 347:382-386; Rich, D. P., et al. (1990) Nature 347:358-362), (Riordan, J. R., et al. (1989) Science 245:1066-1073). A defect in this gene causes mutations in CFTR resulting in cystic fibrosis (“CF”), the most common fatal genetic disease in humans. Cystic fibrosis affects approximately one in every 2,500 infants in the United States. Within the general United States population, up to 10 million people carry a single copy of the defective gene without apparent ill effects. In contrast, individuals with two copies of the CF associated gene suffer from the debilitating and fatal effects of CF, including chronic lung disease.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">In patients with cystic fibrosis, mutations in CFTR endogenously expressed in respiratory epithelia lead to reduced apical anion secretion, which causes an imbalance in ion and fluid transport. The resulting decrease in anion transport contributes to enhanced mucus accumulation in the lung and the accompanying microbial infections that ultimately cause death in CF patients. In addition to respiratory disease, CF patients typically suffer from gastrointestinal problems and pancreatic insufficiency that, if left untreated, results in death. In addition, the majority of males with cystic fibrosis are infertile, and fertility is decreased among females with cystic fibrosis. In contrast to the severe effects of two copies of the CF associated gene, individuals with a single copy of the CF associated gene exhibit increased resistance to cholera and to dehydration resulting from diarrhea—perhaps explaining the relatively high frequency of the CF gene within the population.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Sequence analysis of the CFTR gene of CF chromosomes has revealed a variety of disease-causing mutations (Cutting, G. R., et al. (1990) Nature 346:366-369; Dean, M., et al. (1990) Cell 61:863:870; and Kerem, B-S., et al. (1989) Science 245:1073-1080; Kerem, B-S et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:8447-8451). To date, more than 1000 disease-causing mutations in the CF gene have been identified. The most prevalent mutation is a deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 of the CFTR amino acid sequence, and is commonly referred to as ΔF508-CFTR. This mutation occurs in approximately 70 percent of the cases of cystic fibrosis and is associated with a severe disease.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">The deletion of residue 508 in ΔF508-CFTR prevents the nascent protein from folding correctly. This results in the inability of the mutant protein to exit the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and traffic to the plasma membrane. As a result, the number of channels present in the membrane is far less than observed in cells expressing wild-type CFTR. In addition to impaired trafficking, the mutation results in defective channel gating. Together, the reduced number of channels in the membrane and the defective gating lead to reduced anion transport across epithelia, leading to defective ion and fluid transport. (Quinton, P. M. (1990), FASEB J. 4: 2709-2727). Studies have shown, however, that the reduced numbers of ΔF508-CFTR in the membrane are functional, albeit less than wild-type CFTR. (Dalemans et al. (1991), Nature Lond. 354: 526-528; Denning et al., supra; Pasyk and Foskett (1995), J. Cell. Biochem. 270: 12347-50). In addition to ΔF508-CFTR, other disease causing mutations in CFTR that result in defective trafficking, synthesis, and/or channel gating could be up- or down-regulated to alter anion secretion and modify disease progression and/or severity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Although CFTR also transports a variety of molecules, it is clear that the transport of anions represents one element in an important mechanism of transporting ions and water across the epithelium. The other elements include the epithelial Na<sup>+</sup> channel, ENaC, Na<sup>+</sup>/2Cl<sup>−</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> co-transporter, Na<sup>+</sup>—K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump, and the basolateral membrane K<sup>+</sup> channels that are responsible for the uptake of chloride into the cell.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">These elements work together to achieve directional transport across the epithelium via their selective expression and localization within the cell. Chloride absorption takes place by the coordinated activity of ENaC and CFTR present on the apical membrane and the Na<sup>+</sup>—K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump and Cl-channels expressed on the basolateral surface of the cell. Secondary active transport of chloride from the luminal side leads to the accumulation of intracellular chloride, which can then passively leave the cell via Cl<sup>−</sup> channels, resulting in a vectorial transport. Arrangement of Na<sup>+</sup>/2Cl<sup>−</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> co-transporter, Na<sup>+</sup>—K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump, and the basolateral membrane K<sup>+</sup> channels on the basolateral surface and CFTR on the luminal side coordinate the secretion of chloride via CFTR on the luminal side. Because water is probably never actively transported itself, its flow across epithelia depends on tiny transepithelial osmotic gradients generated by the bulk flow of sodium and chloride.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">As discussed above, it is believed that the deletion of residue 508 in ΔF508-CFTR prevents the nascent protein from folding correctly, resulting in the inability of this mutant protein to exit the ER, and traffic to the plasma membrane. As a result, insufficient amounts of the mature protein are present at the plasma membrane and chloride transport within epithelial tissues is significantly reduced. In fact, this cellular phenomenon of defective endoplasmic reticulum (ER) processing of ABC transporters by the ER machinery has been shown to be the underlying basis not only for CF disease, but for a wide range of other isolated and inherited diseases. The two ways that the ER machinery can malfunction are either by loss of coupling to ER export of the proteins leading to degradation or by the ER accumulation of these defective/misfolded proteins [Aridor M, et al., Nature Med., 5(7), pp 745-751 (1999); Shastry, B. S., et al., Neurochem. International, 43, pp 1-7 (2003); Rutishauser, J., et al., Swiss Med Wkly, 132, pp 211-222 (2002); Morello, J P et al., TIPS, 21, pp. 466-469 (2000); Bross P., et al., Human Mut., 14, pp. 186-198 (1999)].</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0149" num="0148">Scheme 1 depicts the preparation of 1-(2,2-difluorobenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)cyclopropanecarbonyl chloride, which is used to make Compound 1 (See Scheme 4). The starting material, 2,2-difluorobenzo[d][1,3]dioxole-5-carboxylic acid, is commercially available from Saltigo (an affiliate of the Lanxess Corporation). Reduction of the carboxylic acid moiety in 2,2-difluorobenzo[d][1,3]dioxole-5-carboxylic acid provides the primary alcohol, which is converted to the corresponding primary alkyl chloride 5-(chloromethyl)-2,2-difluorobenzo[d][1,3]dioxole using thionyl chloride. The alkyl chloride is subsequently converted to the nitrile 2-(2,2-difluorobenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)acetonitrile by displacement using sodium cyanide. Treatment of the nitrile with 1-bromo-2-chloroethane in the presence of base provides 1-(2,2-difluorobenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)cyclopropanecarbonitrile. Conversion of the nitrile to 1-(2,2-difluorobenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)cyclopropanecarboxylic acid under basic conditions, followed by treatment with thionyl chloride, provides the requisite acid chloride.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0150">Scheme 2 provides an alternative synthesis of the requisite acid chloride. The compound 5-bromomethyl-2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxole is coupled with ethyl cyanoacetate in the presence of a palladium catalyst to form the corresponding alpha cyano ethyl ester. Saponification of the ester moiety to the carboxylic acid gives the cyanoethyl compound. Alkylation of the cyanoethyl compound with 1-bromo-2-chloro ethane in the presence of base gives the cyanocyclopropyl compound. Treatment of the cyanocyclopropyl compound with base gives the carboxylate salt, which is converted to the carboxylic acid by treatment with acid. Conversion of the carboxylic acid to the acid chloride is then accomplished using a chlorinating agent such as thionyl chloride or the like.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0159">Other acid salts of Compound 1 may also be used to prepare Compound 1, Form 1, such as, for example, salts derived from other mineral or organic acids. The other salts also result from acid-mediated hydrolysis of the tert-butyl ester precursor of Compound 1 (See Scheme 4). Salts derived from other acids may include, for example, nitric, sulfuric, phosphoric, boric, acetic, benzoic, and malonic. These salt forms of Compound 1 may or may not be soluble, depending upon the solvent used, but lack of solubility does not hinder formation of Compound 1, Form I. The effective amount of time for formation of Compound 1, Form I from a salt of Compound 1 can be any time between 2 and 24 hours or greater. It is recognized that the amount of time needed is inversely proportional to the temperature. That is, the higher the temperature, the less time needed to affect dissociation of acid to form Compound 1, Form I. When the solvent is water, stifling the dispersion for approximately 24 hours at room temperature provides Form I in an approximately 98% yield. If a solution of the salt of Compound 1 is desired for process purposes, an elevated temperature may be used. After stirring the solution for an effective amount of time at the elevated temperature, recrystallization upon cooling provides substantially pure Compound 1, Form I. “Substantially pure” refers to greater than about 90% purity, or greater than about 95% purity, or greater than about 98% purity, or greater than about 99% purity. The temperature selected depends in part on the solvent used and is well within the determination capabilities of one of ordinary skill in the art and is typically between room temperature and about 80° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0160">Alternatively, Compound 1, Form I can be formed directly from the tert-butyl ester precursor of Compound 1 (See Scheme 4) by treatment with an appropriate acid, such as, for example, formic acid, under appropriate reaction conditions to give Compound 1, Form I. For example, the tert-butyl ester is reacted with an appropriate acid, such as formic acid, at 60 to 80° C. for 7 to 9 hours before cooling to ambient temperatures, adding the reaction mixture to water, and reheating to 60 to 80° C. for an effective amount of time. Compound 1, Form 1 is then isolated by filtration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0161">Compound 1, Form I may be further purified by recrystallization from an organic solvent. Examples of organic solvents include, but are not limited to, toluene, cumene, anisol, 1-butanol, isopropyl acetate, butyl acetate, isobutyl acetate, methyl t-butyl ether, methyl isobutyl ketone, and 1-propanol-water mixtures. The temperature may be as described above. For example, Compound 1, Form I is dissolved in 1-butanol at 75° C. until it is completely dissolved. Cooling down the solution to 10° C. at a rate of 0.2° C./min yields crystals of Compound 1, Form I which may be isolated by filtration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0162">As indicated, Compound 1, Form 1 can be used to prepare Compound 1, Solvate Form A. Accordingly, an amount of Compound 1, Form I is slurried in an appropriate solvent at a sufficient concentration for a sufficient time. The slurry is then filtered centrifugally or under vacuum and dried at ambient conditions for sufficient time to yield Compound 1, Solvate Form A.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0163">In some embodiments, about 20 to 40 mg of Compound 1, Form I is slurried in about 400 to 600 μL of an appropriate solvent. In another embodiment, about 25 to 35 mg of Compound 1, Form I is slurried in about 450 to 550 μL of an appropriate solvent. In another embodiment, about 30 mg of Compound 1, Form I is slurried in about 500 μL of an appropriate solvent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0164">In some embodiments, the time that Compound 1, Form I is allowed to slurry with the solvent is between 1 hour and four days. More particularly, the time that Compound 1, Form I is allowed to slurry with the solvent is between 1 and 3 days. More particularly, the time is 2 days.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0165">In some embodiments, the appropriate solvent is selected from an organic solvent of sufficient size to fit the voids in the crystalline lattice of Compound 1. In other embodiments, the solvate is of sufficient size to fit in voids measuring about 100 Å<sup>3</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0167" num="0166">In other embodiments, the solvent is selected from the group consisting of methanol, ethanol, acetone, 2-propanol, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, methyl acetate, 2-butanone, ethyl formate, and 2-methyl tetrahydrofuran.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0167">In other embodiments, a mixture of two or more of these solvents may be used to obtain Compound 1, Solvate Form A. Alternatively, Compound 1, Solvate Form A may be obtained from a mixture comprising one or more of these solvents and water.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0169" num="0168">In some embodiments, the effective amount of time for drying Compound 1, Solvate Form A is 1 to 24 hours. More particularly, the time is 6 to 18 hours. More particularly, the time is about 12 hours.</div>

All sieves are disposable and received a wipe prior to use. Unmicronized Compound 1, Solvate Form A or Compound 1, HCl Salt Form A is added to the jet mill hopper at a controlled feeding rate using compressed nitrogen gas. The gas pressure range is 40-45/45-70 (Venturi/Mill) PSI and the feeding rate range is 0.5-1.6 Kg/Hour. The Compound 1, Solvate Form A or Compound 1, HCl Salt Form A is micronized in the mill through particle-particle and particle-wall collisions and the processed Compound 1, Solvate Form A or Compound 1, HCl Salt Form A is emptied into the micronized product containers. It is believed that one of ordinary skill in the art may also achieve Compound 1, Solvate Form A or Compound 1, HCl Salt Form A with a favorable particle size through pin milling based in part on the conditions described above.</div>

Membrane Potential Optical Methods for Assaying ΔF508-CFTR Modulation Properties of Compounds
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0263" num="0262">The optical membrane potential assay utilized voltage-sensitive FRET sensors described by Gonzalez and Tsien (See, Gonzalez, J. E. and R. Y. Tsien (1995) “Voltage sensing by fluorescence resonance energy transfer in single cells” <i>Biophys J </i>69(4): 1272-80, and Gonzalez, J. E. and R. Y. Tsien (1997) “Improved indicators of cell membrane potential that use fluorescence resonance energy transfer” <i>Chem Biol </i>4(4): 269-77) in combination with instrumentation for measuring fluorescence changes such as the Voltage/Ion Probe Reader (VIPR) (See Gonzalez, J. E., K. Oades, et al. (1999) “Cell-based assays and instrumentation for screening ion-channel targets” <i>Drug Discov Today </i>4(9): 431-439).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0264" num="0263">These voltage sensitive assays are based on the change in fluorescence resonant energy transfer (FRET) between the membrane-soluble, voltage-sensitive dye, DiSBAC<sub>2</sub>(3), and a fluorescent phospholipid, CC2-DMPE, which is attached to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane and acts as a FRET donor. Changes in membrane potential (V<sub>m</sub>) cause the negatively charged DiSBAC<sub>2</sub>(3) to redistribute across the plasma membrane, and the amount of energy transfer from CC2-DMPE changes accordingly. The changes in fluorescence emission were monitored using VIPR™ II, which is an integrated liquid handler and fluorescent detector designed to conduct cell-based screens in 96- or 384-well microtiter plates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0036" num="0000">1. Identification of Correction Compounds</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0265" num="0264">To identify small molecules that correct the trafficking defect associated with ΔF508-CFTR, a single-addition HTS assay format was developed. The cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 16 hours at 37° C. in the presence or absence (negative control) of test compound. As a positive control, cells plated in 384-well plates were incubated for 16 hours at 27° C. to “temperature-correct” ΔF508-CFTR. The cells were subsequently rinsed three times with Krebs Ringers solution and loaded with the voltage-sensitive dyes. To activate ΔF508-CFTR, 10 μM forskolin and the CFTR potentiator, genistein (20 μM), were added along with Cl<sup>−</sup>-free medium to each well. The addition of Cl<sup>−</sup>-free medium promoted Cl<sup>− </sup>efflux in response to ΔF508-CFTR activation, and the resulting membrane depolarization was optically monitored using the FRET-based voltage-sensor dyes.</div>

After 22 seconds, a second addition of CF-free medium containing 2 to 10 μM forskolin was added to activate ΔF508-CFTR.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0045" num="0000">1. Using Chamber Assay</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0268" num="0267">Chamber experiments were performed on polarized epithelial cells expressing ΔF508-CFTR to further characterize the ΔF508-CFTR modulators identified in the optical assays. FRT<sup>ΔF508-CFTR </sup>epithelial cells grown on Costar Snapwell cell culture inserts were mounted in an Ussing chamber (Physiologic Instruments, Inc., San Diego, Calif.), and the monolayers were continuously short-circuited using a Voltage-clamp System (Department of Bioengineering, University of Iowa, Iowa, and, Physiologic Instruments, Inc., San Diego, Calif.). Transepithelial resistance was measured by applying a 2-mV pulse. Under these conditions, the FRT epithelia demonstrated resistances of 4 KΩ/cm<sup>2 </sup>or more. The solutions were maintained at 27° C. and bubbled with air. The electrode offset potential and fluid resistance were corrected using a cell-free insert. Under these conditions, the current reflects the flow of Cl<sup>−</sup> through ΔF508-CFTR expressed in the apical membrane. The I<sub>SC </sub>was digitally acquired using an MP100A-CE interface and AcqKnowledge software (v3.2.6; BIOPAC Systems, Santa Barbara, Calif.).</div>

All experiments were performed with intact monolayers. To fully activate ΔF508-CFTR, forskolin (10 μM) and the PDE inhibitor, IBMX (100 μM), were applied followed by the addition of the CFTR potentiator, genistein (50 μM).</div>

All recordings were acquired at a sampling frequency of 10 kHz and low-pass filtered at 1 kHz. Pipettes had a resistance of 5 to 6 MΩ when filled with the intracellular solution. Under these recording conditions, the calculated reversal potential for Cl<sup>− </sup>(E<sub>Cl</sub>) at room temperature was −28 mV. All recordings had a seal resistance greater than 20 GΩ and a series resistance less than 15 MΩ.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0276" num="0275">To determine the activity of correction compounds for increasing the density of functional ΔF508-CFTR in the plasma membrane, the above-described perforated-patch-recording techniques were used to measure the current density following 24-hour treatment with the correction compounds. To fully activate ΔF508-CFTR, 10 μM forskolin and 20 μM genistein were added to the cells. Under our recording conditions, the current density following 24-hr incubation at 27° C. was higher than that observed following 24-hour incubation at 37° C. These results are consistent with the known effects of low-temperature incubation on the density of ΔF508-CFTR in the plasma membrane. To determine the effects of correction compounds on CFTR current density, the cells were incubated with 10 μM of the test compound for 24 hours at 37° C. and the current density was compared to the 27° C. and 37° C. controls (% activity).

The ΔF508-CFTR was activated after excision, by adding 1 mM Mg-ATP, and 75 nM of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, catalytic subunit (PKA; Promega Corp. Madison, Wis.). After channel activity stabilized, the patch was perifused using a gravity-driven microperfusion system. The inflow was placed adjacent to the patch, resulting in complete solution exchange within 1 to 2 seconds. To maintain ΔF508-CFTR activity during the rapid perifusion, the nonspecific phosphatase inhibitor F<sup>−</sup> (10 mM NaF) was added to the bath solution. Under these recording conditions, channel activity remained constant throughout the duration of the patch recording (up to 60 minutes). Currents produced by positive charge moving from the intra- to extracellular solutions (anions moving in the opposite direction) are shown as positive currents. The pipette potential (V<sub>p</sub>) was maintained at 80 mV.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0282" num="0281">Channel activity was analyzed from membrane patches containing ≦2 active channels. The maximum number of simultaneous openings determined the number of active channels during the course of an experiment. To determine the single-channel current amplitude, the data recorded from 120 seconds of ΔF508-CFTR activity was filtered “off-line” at 100 Hz and then used to construct all-point amplitude histograms that were fitted with multigaussian functions using Bio-Patch Analysis software (Bio-Logic Comp. France). The total microscopic current and open probability (P<sub>o</sub>) were determined from 120 sec of channel activity. The P<sub>o </sub>was determined using the Bio-Patch software or from the relationship P<sub>o</sub>=I/i(N), where I=mean current, i=single-channel current amplitude, and N=number of active channels in patch.</div>
