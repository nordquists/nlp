<div class="description-paragraph">To all lwhom z't may concern.' </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Be it known that I, EVERETT H. WHiTE, a citizen of the United States, residin at St. Paul, in the county of Ramsey and tatev of Minnesota, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Heat-Regulators, of which the following is a specification. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> My invention relates tov heat regulators and has for its object to provide an improved device for making and breaking electric circuits governed by the temperature of theroom in which the device is set, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">the vmaking -and breaking of said circuits operating damper controlling mechanism (not shown)by which the furnace is regulated. In carrying out my invention I employ an expansible chamber or set of chambers filled with ether gas as the thermostatic element,'sinceI have discovered'that the use of ether gas in such an expansible chamber gives a maximum of sensitiveness and force of movement of the circuit-controlling member. The contact making member or pointer is pivotally mounted on the support yfor the thermostatic member, which in turn is pivotally mounted, so that the entire thermostatic member may be oscillated relatively to the contact members. In this manner the thermostatic member is adjusted Aso as to operate to close the circuitsv at any desired temperature. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It is a further object of my invention to provide the ether gas containers in f the form of one or more hollow disk-shaped bodies which are held in planes parallel to the plane of movement of the Contact arm. The expansionmovement of these gas containers is a plied to lever mechanism which translates the motion into a plane perpendicular to theline of movement of the point .of application of force from `.the thermostats, this lever` mechanism `greatly simplitying such movement. i i rllhe full objects and advantages of my invention will appear in connection with the detailed description thereof and` are particularly pointed out in the claims. f In the drawings, illustratin theapplication of my invention in one orm,- </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Figure 1 is a front elevational view oitf my improved thermostat with the'cover removed and some of the parts shown in dotted lines. Fig. 2 is a'longitudinal side sectional view of the same taken substantially through the center. Fig. 3 is a view similar to'Fg. 2 showing .a derent form et case with part of the same cut away. Fig. 4 is a plan view of the same device shown in Fig. 3 with a guard attached to the case. Fig. 5 is a front elevational view of a part of the device shown in Fig. 4. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> My invention comprises a metal back 10 having turned-up edges 11 and 12 to which are attached an ornamental casing or cover 13. The back 10 is of heavier metal than the cover and serves to support the operating parts. APivotally attached to t-he back 10 by a screw 14 is a casting 15 having a bearing shoulder 16 resting upon the surface of back 10. This shoulder allows the casting 15 to oscillate without excess play 'and so holds the parts attached thereto in the proper relation to the other parts of the thermostat. Issuing from the central portion of casting 15 is a lug 17 which termi- ,nate's in two vbosses 18 and 19. Boss 18 is acted upon by heat to'I cause said members to spread apart in the usual manner. At the upper portion of casting 15 are a pair of parallel supports'or lugs 24 and 25 extending out beyond the thermost-atic member 22, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">between which'are pivoted at 28 an L-shaped lever having legs 26 and 27. Leg 26 is arranged to be engaged by a peg 23 secured to the member 22, and leg 27 is free to os cillate betvveen'the 'supports 24 and 25 as the members 21 and 22 spread and come together. Pivotally mounted in the casting 15 and in a screw 29 inserted in the boss 19 is a spindle 30 carrying a pointer 31 and a lever32 at right angles to said pointer fast thereon. Any movement of the members 21 and 22 is communicated through levers 26 and 27 by means of a connecting link 33 'to the arm 32, thus actuating the pointer 31. As the arm 32 is relatively short the motion of the thermostatic device is multiplied so that the pointer 31 makes a substantial sweep for only a few degrees change in temperature. t will be noted that the lower end of link 33 is pivoted to arm 32, while the upper end terminates in a reduced portion 34 which loosely passes through 'the leg 27 and is so engaged by it. This expedient is used only for the facility in assembling '5 2, whih um is itself .pivoeed to eleback the device.. lEointel' '31 is'A returl'iedto the.` </div>

The ccmbined contact members th'us formed are ar- 4 rangedin the arc ofa circle whose center is the pivot 14 and are supported fromscrew 46 by a single angular bracket 48 attached to the back 10. The whole can thus more easily be adjusted and alined. Pointer 3 1, as best shown .in Fig. 2, is formed with a contact head 49 which engages the fixed contact members .as the temperature changes and successively .completes the various circuits Y through them.
