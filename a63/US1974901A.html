<div class="description-paragraph"> Fig. 11 is a similar view with the parts positioned to show the answer to a problem in subtraction. v l </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring in detail to the drawings, therim- (Cl. -2f) proved calculator as there shown includes a casing l5 comprising a base or mounting portion 16 which is shown as being generally rectangular in plan and which has its edge portions downturned to provide a flange l'Z extending entirely about the edge of the base. Mounted on the base 16 is a casing cover member or upper member 18 also generally rectangular in plan and slightly smaller than the base and this upper or cover member 18 has its edge portions downturned providing flanges 19 which at spaced points carry lugs 2) which pass through openings 21 in the base or mounting portion and are then clenched over to secure the base and cover members or portions together in `a manner to provide a hollow casing. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The cover member 18 forms the front or outer wall or the casing 15 and such front wall of the casing is provided with a plurality of windows or openings through which the various parts within the casing may be visible or made eective. While certain of said openings or windows are of the same size and shape each opening or window is given a separate reference numeral in order that the operation of the calculator may be more clearly given in subsequentportions of the description.. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> ,As here disclosed, the Yiront wall of the casing is provided with spaced similar openings or win.- dows 22 and 23 through which are to be shown operating numerals as will later be described. These operating numerals represent the numerals which are to be added, subtracted or multiplied ,as the c ase may be. Intermediate the windows 22 and 23 is a window ,24 through which is to be shown a sign or symbol designating the type of problem to be solved. That is, through the window 24 will be shown as desired either the addition, subtraction or multiplication symbol onsign. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Below the window 24L is a somewhat elongated window or opening 25 through which is to be shown the mathematical symbol representing equals.Y Opposite window 25 and below the window 23 is a window 26 of substantially four times the area of -the window 23 and when the calculator is operated the results or answers to the various problems will be made visible through this window 26 and when the calculator is operated to give only a question and before it is operatedY to give the answer the parts may be arranged to have a question mark displayed through the window 26. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> A window or opening 27 may be provided and through which the word Right or Correct may be shown when the parts are manipulated ser to give the answer to a problem. As here disclosed this window 27 is below the windows 25 and 26 although obviously it may be arranged in some other relation. Toward the edges of the casing the cover is provided with elongated openings 28 and 29 which form guides and through which operating portions or lugs extend for manipulation as will later be more fully set forth. Here, however, it will be noted that spaced slots 30, 31 and 32 enter or communicate with the slot 29 and the function of the slots 30, 31 and 32 will later be described. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Within the casing there is arranged a frame generally designated 33 and including a platelike body portion 34 the upper and lower edge portions of which are inturned providing guide flanges 35. Intermediate its ends, the body portion 34 is lanced and a 4handle-like strip 36i's pressed therefrom providing the said .body portion with a transversely extending slot 37. The outerV end of the handle ormanipulating'portion 36 may be up-turned-as at 38 so as to be easily accessible for manipulation ofthe frame 33. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> VAs disclosed, the frame 33 is of a length equal to the distance between a pair of opposite side flanges 19 of the cover member 18 and when the frame is within the casing it is held against lateral movement by these'iia'nges but may be shifted upwardly and downwardly by the handle portion36. When the frame is in its uppermost position thev upturned end 38 of the handle will preferably abut the outer surface of one of the flanges 19 of the cover member and extend slightly above the same to be easily'accessible. l f In spaced relation to the-slot 27 the frame 33 carries a vertically disposed row of operating numerals 39 which numerals are arranged in consecutive order beginning withone (l) and ending with ten (10). In the drawings the numerals 39 are shown as printed on'a separate sheet or piece 40 which is glued or otherwise secured 'to' the frame. It will be understood that the frame may be made of any suitable material-as sheet metal, Celluloid or the like, and'that the. operating numerals 39 may be Yprinted or otherwise formed directly on or in the frame or that they may be applied'to the'same as shown in the drawings and as above described. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> A slide 41 is mounted in the frame 33 being held in said frame between the body 34 and the flanges 35 thereof and the slide is adapted for movement relative to the frame ina direction longitudinallyv thereof and transversely of the slot 37 therein. In other words, as the frame is manipulated up and down in the casing it carries the slide 41 with 'it and in addition to this movement the slide is adapted for movement relative to the frame. SlideV 41 comprisesA essentially a flat plate-like body portion 42 from one edge of which extends a hand piece 43 the other end of which is upturned as at 44 to function as the upturned portion 38 above described. A chart is disposed on the body portion 42 of the slide and as shown in the drawings this chart is printed on a sheet of paper 45 which is glued or otherwise secured to the slide. An extension of the chart may be'carried on tothe hand vpiece 43 and this extension is designated 46 and is suitably graduated showing the numerals from f2 to 1(5. YIf desired the hand piece 36 of the frame may be similarly graduated. e </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The chart 45 includes an upper row of numerals 47 beginning with l and ending with 10 and below such row are series Vof horizontal and vertical rows of numerals. Considering first the numerals as arranged in vertical rows it will be noted that alternate rows which are designated 48 are arranged below the numerals of the row 47 and that alternate numerals of these rows 48 comprise operating numerals. That is considering the row 48 it will be noted that the first numeral is i and that each alternate numeral of that row is likewise( l to a point substantially at the end of a row. This same lrule holds true in the other rows-48. The alternate vertical rows 49 give the answer or result numbers. Referring to the horizontal rows it is noted that the alternate horizontal rows 50 give the result numbers while the alternate horizontal rows 51 give alternately operating and result numbers. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> When the frame 33 and slide 41 are assembled in the casing, the operating numerals 39 are so arranged that on movement of the frame any desired one of said numerals may be brought opposite the window 22 to be visible therethrough. With one of the numerals 39 opposite the window 22, slide 41 may be shifted to bring one of its operating numerals opposite the window 23. Of course, the operating numerals of the slide, which is brought opposite the window 23, will be in the slot 37 so as to be visible through the window 23 and such numeral of the slide will necessarily, according to the present arrangement, be in a horizontal row in alignment with the selected 'operating numeral of the vertical row 39. The hand pieces 36 vand 43 of the frame and slide respectively are disclosed as operating through side edges or flanges of the casing at right angles to each other and while the slide is being operated, the numerals or graduations on its hand piece 43 may be watched to properly locate the slide so as to show the desired numeral through the window Within the casing 15 and on the upper side of the slotted'portion 34 of the frame 33, there is arranged a plate 52 including a body portion-53 the opposite end edges of which carry upwardly extending guide and finger portions 54 of which one may be doubled back on itself as clearly shown in Fig. 8 whereby to give it additional strength. Plate 52 is cut away as at 55 and 56 whereby the plate includes an intermediate portion or arm 57 from one lateral portion of which extends an arm 58. This plate is additionally cut away as at 59 so that the -plate will never close the window 22 in any of the various positions into which the plate may be moved. In order thatrtherplate will never close the window 23 the upper edge of the arm 58 of the plate is cut away at 60. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The arm 58 above referred to includes an upwardly-eXtending lug 61which serves to close a portion of the window 26 when an answer to-a problem in multiplication is being exposed at said window. notched as at 62 and such notch is presented at various portions of the answer window 26 to eX- pose the answers to problems in addition and subtraction, the portion 63 of the arm serving to cooperate with the lug 61 and close off portions'of the answer window during the time that the answer to a multiplication problem is being given and this portion A63 further serves with the Yremainder of the arm 58 toi-close olf a portion of the answer window when an answer to a vproblem in l addition is being given. l </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> A -series of mathematical signs and symbols together-with any other data desired may be carried by the plate 52 to be exposed through the windows 24, 25 and 27 when the plate-is-manipulated for In its lower portion the arm 58 is that purpose. While such indicia is here shown as carried by a sheet 64 glued or otherwise secured to the plate it will be apparent that the indicia may be printed or otherwise formed directly on or in the plate. On the drawings there are shown two multiplication signs and 66, two addition signs 67 and 68, two subtraction signs 69 and 70, two question marks 71 and 72, six equation signs 73, 74, 75, 76, 77 and 78 and the word Right is shown twice at 79 and 80. The use of these various signs and words will later be fully set forth. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> When the plate 52 is in place in the casing the upstanding lugs or projections 54 of said plate project through the slots 28 and 29 in the front wall of the casing. While both of these lugs may, to a limited extent, be vused as operating lugs or finger pieces, it is preferred to use thelug in the slot 29 as an operating or finger piece and have the lug in the slot 28 function as a guide and fulcrum member. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Assuming the parts to be completely assembled and in position where no problem is presented and where no solution of a problem is being presented the plate 52 will occupy a position where its lugs 54 are disposed in the right hand end portions of the slots 28 and 29 and the windows 24, 25, 26 and 27 in the front wall of the casing will be closed by the arms 57 and 58 of the plate 52 while the windows 22 and 23 will be opened. Assuming now that the problem3 5 is to be solved as suggested in Fig. 1 the frame 33 is adjusted to dispose the operating numeral 3 of the row 39 opposite the window 22 and thereafter the slide 41 is adjusted to dispose the operating numeral 5 of the horizontal row 51 which aligns with the numeral 3 of row 39, opposite the window 23. Next, the plate 52 is moved as far as possible to the left and such movement brings the multiplication symbol 66 opposite the window 24 and brings the question mark 72 into position where it is visible through the lower right hand corner of the window 23. This same movement disposes the equals sign 74 opposite the lower portion of window 25 and leaves the window 27 blank. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> From this it will be seen that through the various windows will be read the problem 3 5=?. To obtain the answer to the problem it is but necessary to shift the lug 54 of plate 52 downwardly into the slot 32 which as above set forth communicates with the slot 29. This rocking movement of plate 52 brings the multiplication sign 65 opposite the window 24 and brings the equals sign 73 opposite the window 25. This same movement carries the question mark away from the window 26 and shifts the arm 58 of plate 52 into position such that the upper right hand corner of the window is exposed to show the number 15 which, of course, is the correct answer to the problem. The operation is the same for solving other problems in multiplication. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Fig. 9 shows the paits set with the addition sign 67 exposed at the window 24, with the question mark 71 exposed at the window 26 and with the equals sign exposed at the window 25. The frame and slide have been adjusted to show at the windows 22 and 23 respectively the numerals 5 and 3 and the problem presented therefore reads 5-{3=?. It will be noted that the operating lug 54 is located in the slot 29 opposite the slot 3l. To get the answer to the problem presented it is but necessary to move said lug upwardly into slot 31 and such action shifts the plate 52 to expose the addition sign 68 at the window 24, the equals sign at the window 25 and the answer at the Window 26. With the parts in this position the answer is' visible through the notch 62 in the arm 58 of plate 52. In addition, the word Right or any other desired word or phrase is exposed in the window 27 and in the particular illustration given, that is for problems in addition, the instance of such word is exposed As will later be apparent this word is also exposed when the answer to a problem in subtraction is given and the word Right at 79 is exposed when the answer to a problem in multiplication is given. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> When a problem in subtraction, as in Fig. l1, is given the frame 33 and slide 4l are adjusted to show the selected operating numerals at the windows 22 and 23 respectively. Next, the lug 54 is used to shift the plate 52 to proper position and said plate is properly positioned when said lug is opposite the slot 30. With the parts in this position, the question mark 7l is visible in the window 26, the minus sign 69 is visible in the window 24 and the equals sign 76 is visible through the window 25. Now when the operating lug 54 is shifted into the slot 30 the question mark will be shifted out of the window 26 and the answer will be exposed through the notch 62 in the arm 58 of the plate. Further, the minus sign 70 will be shown through the window 24 and the equals sign 77 will be shown through the window 25. Therefore, the complete equation including the answer is given. Also, the word Right designated 80 or any other desired word becomes visible through the window 27. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It will be evident the chart 45 can use the numerals 39 and 47 for problems in division with corresponding answers to take the place of either the addition, subtraction or multiplication gures above or it may be added to the chart in addition to these. It is not shown on the drawings as it would merely complicate the showing as it merely requires another set of figures to correspond with the problems of division and merely another slot corresponding to slots 30, 3l and 32 to shift lug 54 into it to get the answer in division. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> From the foregoing description it will be apparent that I have provided a calculator including means whereby desired problems or questions of addition, subtraction, multiplication or division may be shown and whereby on slight manipulation, the answers to said problems may also be shown. In solving a problem or in locating the answer to a problem it is merely necessary to properly locate the plate 52 and this is accomplished by moving the operating lug 54 of said plate into the proper one of the slots 30, 31 and 32. To present the question or problem the frame 33 and the slide 41 must, of course, be adjusted to locate the desired operating numerals in the rear of the windows 22 and 23 respectively and when this has been done, plate 52 is shifted to have its operating lug 54 located opposite the desired slot 30, 31 or 32. With the parts in this position the complete question is clearly presented and the question may, of course, be either of multiplication, addition, subtraction or division. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The device comprises but a few parts each of which may be stamped from sheet metal or other suitable material and the parts may be easily and quickly assembled. With the parts properly assembled in the casing there is no danger of any parts becoming lost, and the parts are so constructed that there is little, if any, likelihood of the device getting out of order. As above suggested, it is not necessary that the parts be made of any particular material and it will, of course, beunderstood that the various numerals, signs, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">words and the like may be printed on or punched into the parts instead of being applied in the manner disclosed. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> lIhe windouT sections of the cover may be equipped with a magnifying glass to facilitate reading of the numbers. </div>
