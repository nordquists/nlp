More particularly, the composite includes a first coating, reflective beads, and a clear coating.

Traffic marking coatings are, for example, applied to roads, parking lots, and school playgrounds, the surfaces of which are typically concrete and asphalt. The resultant traffic markings instruct users and demarcate traffic lanes, parking spaces, and other restricted areas. As the replacement of solvent-borne paints continues in order to minimize air pollution, aqueous traffic marking compositions having a useful combination of dried film properties have been sought. Herein, the terms “traffic marking” and “traffic marking coating” are used interchangeably. <span style="display: none">[0002] </span> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0003" num="0003">One of the most important properties of traffic markings is the level of retroreflectance provided by the markings to enhance nighttime visibility. Retroreflectance in a traffic marking is often provided by dropping or spraying reflective beads, usually glass beads, onto the freshly applied first coating. Such beads are thought to partially sink into the first coating, and partially remain above the surface of the first coating. Light from a vehicle's headlights is thought to strike the portion of the reflective bead protruding above the surface of the first coating, and to be reflected back toward the vehicle. Presently, traffic markings made from aqueous paints consist solely of the aqueous paint and the reflective beads. It is generally required that a traffic marking meet or exceed a minimum level of retroreflectance to be acceptable. While it is generally possible to achieve this minimum level of retroreflectance when the traffic marking is new, rapid diminution of retroreflectance with time is observed. This diminution occurs because the reflective beads tend to dislodge from the surface of the traffic marking as that surface is subjected to wear from, for example, the tires of automobiles and trucks. It is the object of the present invention to increase the durability of traffic markings by providing a new type of traffic marking which is more resistant to loss of reflective beads, and to loss of the retroreflectance they provide, when compared with current traffic markings. <span style="display: none">[0003] </span> </div>

Binder polymers typically have Tg values in the range −10° C. to 70° C., because those having Tg values below −10° C. tend to have poor resistance to dirt pick-up and those having Tg values above 70° C. usually display diminished ability to form films. In certain applications, however, the lower limit for Tg can be even lower than −10° C. For example, the binder polymers used in roof coatings can have glass transition temperatures (Tgs) as low as −40° C. Used herein, “Tg” is an abbreviation for glass transition temperature. The glass transition temperature, Tg, of a polymer is the temperature at which a polymer transitions from a rigid, glassy state at temperatures below Tg to a fluid or rubbery state at temperatures above Tg. The Tg of a polymer is typically measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) using the mid-point in the heat flow versus temperature transition as the Tg value. A typical heating rate for the DSC measurement is 20° C. per minute. <span style="display: none">[0025] </span> </div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0027]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0027" num="0027">It is an important property of the clear coating that a substantial portion of the visible light impinging upon it be able to pass through it without either being absorbed or scattered from its original path. For example, light from the headlights of an approaching automobile may pass through the clear coating of a traffic marking of the present invention until it reaches a reflective bead. The reflective bead then redirects the light backward through the clear coating and toward the eye of the automobile's driver. If a substantial amount of the light is either absorbed or scattered by the clear coating, the traffic marking will not appear bright to the motorist. Measurement of percent visible light transmission is a reliable way to determine the ability of a coating to allow the unimpeded passage of visible light. Percent visible light transmission is determined by comparing the intensity of light incident upon the coating with the intensity of that light once it has traversed the coating. For example, an aqueous coating composition is drawn down onto a glass slide and allowed to dry. A detector and light source are then positioned on opposite sides of the glass slide. The light source is further positioned so that the beam of visible light is oriented exactly perpendicular to the surface of the coating. The detector is set to detect only the light that is scattered by an angle of 2.5 degrees or less. The percent (%) visible light transmission is then calculated as follows:<span style="display: none">[0027] </span> </div>

A preferred method for preparing the binder polymers to be used in the paint and clear coating compositions of the present invention is aqueous emulsion polymerization. Polymers thus prepared are usually stabilized by adding anionic, nonionic, cationic, or amphoteric surfactants, or by the incorporation of anionic or cationic moieties into the polymer itself during synthesis. The emulsion polymerization can be carried out by a number processes such as those described in Blackley, D.

In the non-ionic state (i.e., deprotonated), polyamine interaction with the anionically stabilized emulsion and any other anionic ingredients which may be present in the composition is eliminated. The volatile base must be volatile enough to be released under air drying conditions. During film formation, the volatile base evaporates with the result that the amine moieties of the polyamine functional polymer become protonated to form ammonium moieties which, in turn, interact with the anionic ingredients to destabilize the coating composition and thereby accelerate drying. <span style="display: none">[0047] </span> </div>

The term “polyimine”, used in the context of WO 96/22338, indicates that the polymer was prepared using imine monomers (e.g., ethyleneimine). The resultant polymer contains no imine functionality. Instead, the polymer contains amine functionality as part of the polymer backbone. It is this polyamine functional polymer that is deprotonated in the presence of volatile base. Upon formation of a film from the aqueous coating composition, the volatile base is released, allowing the amine moieties in the polymer backbone to protonate. <span style="display: none">[0048] </span> </div>

The amine-functionalized latexes have a number average molecular weights in the range of 1,000 to 1,000,000 and particle sizes that vary between 20 and 1000 nanometers. These latexes may be in the form of single, or multi-staged particles. The multi-staged particles include at least two mutually incompatible copolymers having any of a wide variety of morphologies, including core/shell, interpenetrating network, and multiple core. The latex polymer may also contain acid-functional moieties. When acid-function moieties are present, the weight ratio of amine-functional moieties to acid-functional moieties is generally at least 3 to 1. Both amine-functional moieties and acid-functional moieties may be incorporated into the same latex particle or into separate latex particles. Amine functional monomers polymerized to prepare amine-functional latex particles are used at a level of at least 2 percent by weight, based on total monomers. Acid functional monomers polymerized to prepare acid-functional latex particles are used at a level that is usually less than 10 percent by weight, based on total monomers. Latex particles are stabilized by surfactants, including anionic and non-ionic emulsifiers. The coating compositions of U.S. Pat. No. 5,922,398 use volatile base (e.g., ammonia) to stabilize the amine-functional moieties of the latex particles against interaction with surfactants during storage and application of films. Once applied, the films lose volatile base by evaporation, the amine-functional particles protonate to become ammonium-functional particles which, in turn, interact with surfactant, causing destabilization of the latex particles and acceleration of drying. <span style="display: none">[0049] </span> </div>

No. 5,824,734 discloses an improved fast drying coating composition particularly adapted for use as a traffic paint. This basic waterborne coating for traffic paint includes an aqueous emulsion containing an acrylic film forming polymer, a stabilizing system for the emulsion which is pH sensitive, and mineral pigment. The acrylic film forming polymer is a hydrophobic acrylate containing polymer. The hydrophobic monomers polymerized to produce the hydrophobic acrylate containing polymer include alkyl esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid having an alkyl ester portion containing between 1 to 12 carbon atoms. The hydrophobic acrylate containing polymer further incorporates from about 0.1 to 5% by weight of a secondary or tertiary amino acrylate and 0.1 to 5% by weight of crosslinkable monomers, such as N-alkylol acrylamides and N-alkylol methacrylamides, both weight percents based on total weight of polymer. The hydrophobic acrylate containing polymer should further contain less than 5 weight percent of hydrophilic monomers, based on total polymer. The aqueous dispersion is typically stabilized by a combination of anionic and non-ionic surfactants, and is pH sensitive. The pH is maintained above 7, preferably by addition of a volatile base like ammonia, until application of the coating onto a surface. Loss of base then effects collapse of the emulsion and the water is exuded from the amide- or amine-functional acrylate containing film forming hydrophobic polymer. <span style="display: none">[0050] </span> </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0051]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0051" num="0051">WO 98/52698 discloses a coating material including a substrate having a surface and a coating thereupon, wherein the coating is prepared by: a) contacting the surface of the substrate with a stable aqueous dispersion that contains a polymer having pendant strong cationic groups, and pendant weak acid groups; or b) contacting the surface of the substrate with a stable aqueous dispersion that contains a first polymer having pendant strong cationic groups, and a stable aqueous dispersion of a second polymer having pendant weak acid groups, the contact of the polymers with the surface being made in any order, or concurrently. When the stable aqueous dispersion contains a polymer having pendant strong cationic groups and pendant weak acid groups (i.e., coating “a” of WO 98/52698), it is a necessary condition that the surface of the substrate is, or is treated to be, sufficiently basic that the stable aqueous dispersion sets in less time than the time required for a latex that only contains pendant strong cation groups, or pendant weak acid groups, to set. The cationic groups are, for example, quaternary ammonium moieties, while the weak acid groups are, for example, carboxylic acid moieties. When coating “a” contacts the basic surface of the substrate, the base removes the proton from the weak acid, producing an anionic species that interacts with the cationic moiety to form crosslinks, destabilize the dispersion, and accelerate drying of the film. Cationic surfactants present in the aqueous dispersion are also rendered inactive by interaction with the anions generated from the weak acid groups. When coating “b” of WO 98/52698 is applied to a substrate, there is no requirement that the substrate be basic because one dispersion is cationically stabilized and the other is anionically stabilized such that, upon mixing, the oppositely charged surfactants interact to inactivate one another. Further, because the weak acid functional latex particles are anionically stabilized in coating “b”, it is possible to adjust the pH of the aqueous dispersion such that the weak acid moieties are deprotonated and available to interact with cationic species upon film formation. The various routes to destabilization are possible contributors to accelerated drying of films. <span style="display: none">[0051] </span> </div>
