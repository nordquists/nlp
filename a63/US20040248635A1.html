<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div html="" itemprop="content"><abstract lang="EN" load-source="patent-office" mxw-id="PA48962424">
<div class="abstract" id="A-0001">The method of entertainment “Russian poker” is based on the popular card game and is intended for gaming halls. The game has more potential and is more absorbing because the player has the opportunity to exchange any amount of cards, insure his game, make bets on bonuses and exchange the dealer's cards. Furthermore, the player's ability to buy a sixth card and receive payment for two combinations evens out the odds for the player and casino. The use of a standard deck of cards in its gaming machines brings the game closer to reality, and allows for the exclusion of a random number generator from the machine's construction, which enhances the player's trust in the reliability of its randomness. </div>
