<li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005"> For some industrial or manufactured products, it may be important or even absolutely vital to make sure that each article that is marketed is identified. In fact, in some cases the manufacturer may need to be able to access information relating to a particular article, for example in order to check whether that article has a best-before date or whether the article is being distributed via those networks in which the manufacturer initially placed it. In this respect, distribution can be organised so that available quantities and pricing are appropriate to a given market but differ, for instance, from the prices set in a different distribution network. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006"> In order to prevent products intended for a distribution channel entering a different channel, it is necessary that each article is fitted with a marking tag that makes it possible to identify the origin or destination as defined by the manufacturer. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007"> Nowadays there are bar code marking devices which nevertheless have the drawback of being relatively easy to counterfeit by using commonly available printing equipment. </div>

<li> <para-num num="[0014]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0015" num="0014"> The invention therefore relates to an article comprising an integrated marking tag on the surface of which patterns are hollowed out, the layout of these patterns being representative of at least one information item. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0015]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0016" num="0015"> According to the invention, the marking tag is embedded in the material that constitutes the article. In addition, it comprises patterns, the depth of which varies from one pattern to another. This depth may assume a plurality of different values that are representative of an additional information item. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0016]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0017" num="0016"> Thus, the marking tag is incorporated into the article to be identified and this prevents removal of the marking tag without partially destroying the area of the article that encloses it. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0017]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0018" num="0017"> In other words, each of the patterns of the marking tag has a depth which can be varied, unlike known systems according to the prior art whereby the depth of each pattern is fixed and has a single predetermined value or a zero value. In contrast, the invention makes it possible to give this depth a multitude of intermediate values depending on the information to be coded. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0018]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0019" num="0018"> The maximum number of information items that can be coded therefore depends not only on the number of patterns that can be produced on a given surface but also on the number of different depth levels which each pattern can have. In other words, coding is performed three dimensionally in accordance with the invention. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0019]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0020" num="0019"> In practice, the patterns may have a matrix-like distribution, typically organised in a square or rectangular shape.

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0020]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0021" num="0020"> It is apparent that the invention significantly improves coding and identification security because these marking tags are virtually tamperproof. In fact, whereas it is apparent that a matrix-type representation can be reproduced by a printing process, it is impossible, using such printing techniques, to simulate the depth of patterns which can be verified by viewing at variable incidence. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0021]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0022" num="0021"> In practice, the marking tag can be made of various materials as long as they are compatible with the material that constitutes the article and its manufacturing processes. In order to fabricate glass-based articles, one might opt for marking tags based on a semiconductor material, quartz or sapphire because these materials are very resistant to the high temperatures generally encountered during glass casting or glass blowing processes. The distinctive patterns are not degraded when the marking tag is integrated into the article made of glass. But if the article has to be made of a thermoplastic polymer, it is possible to use marking tags based on other materials such as metal or other thermosetting materials. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0022]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0023" num="0022"> In cases where marking tags based on a semiconductor material are used, the patterns may be produced in various ways, especially by using anisotropic wet etching with humic acids or dry etching processes, especially Deep Reactive Ionic Etching (DRIE) or any other process that makes it possible to obtain a variable depth level. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0023]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0024" num="0023"> If an anisotropic chemical etching process is used, selecting an appropriate semiconductor substrate with the right crystallographic planes makes it possible to obtain patterns with a defined geometry. In the case of a silicon substrate having a principal plane which is parallel to the crystallographic planes (100), the patterns are formed by truncated pyramids having a height—which is therefore equivalent to the depth of the patterns—, which is adjusted depending on the duration of the etching stage. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0024]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0025" num="0024"> Patterns can also be formed by the stacking of truncated pyramids obtained by a succession of sequenced etching stages. </div>

<li> <para-num num="[0036]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0037" num="0036"> As already stated, the invention relates to a marking tag which makes it possible to identify a very wide variety of different types of products An example of this marking tag is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. This tag (<b>1</b>) is in the form of an element made of a semiconductor material, typically silicon. This tag (<b>1</b>) comprises a plurality of patterns (<b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>) which are produced on its upper surface (<b>5</b>). In the form shown, these patterns (<b>2</b>-<b>4</b>) have a generally square shape and are arranged in a matrix-like layout. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0037]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0038" num="0037"> Nevertheless, the scope of the invention also covers alternative embodiments in which the individual patterns each assume different shapes and may be arranged in any non-matrix like manner. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0038]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0039" num="0038"> In the form shown, each of the patterns (<b>2</b>-<b>4</b>) has a variable depth (h<sub>2</sub>, h<sub>3</sub>, h<sub>4</sub>), these depths (h<sub>2</sub>-h<sub>4</sub>) being capable of assuming different values. In this way, the coding options associated with this marking tag depend not only on the dimensions of the matrix, i.e. the number of patterns, but also on the number of intermediate depth levels which each pattern may have. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0039]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0040" num="0039"> Various methods can be used to obtain such patterns, especially that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In this case, because the substrate used is a silicon substrate with (100) crystallographic orientation, a first mask which makes it possible to define the general shape of the patterns is deposited by photolithography. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0040]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0041" num="0040"> A wet anisotropic etching stage is then performed, typically using KOH. This etching makes it possible to define truncated pyramids because the crystallographic stop planes are the (111) planes. This first etching stage makes it possible to define the first depth level. A second mask which is preserved only in the area of patterns having a depth which must be preserved at this first intermediate value is subsequently deposited. A second KOH etching stage makes it possible to increase the depth of the non-masked patterns (<b>3</b>, <b>4</b>). These additional mask deposition and etching stages are repeated as many times as necessary in order to obtain all the patterns in the desired layout. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0041]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0042" num="0041"> Depending on the initial window of the patterns, etching may extend as far as the junction of the (111) crystallographic planes, as is the case for pattern (<b>4</b>). </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0042]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0043" num="0042"> It is also possible, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 3</figref> <i>a </i>and <b>3</b> <i>b</i>, to use a single etching mask associated with two chemical etching stages. More precisely, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> <i>a</i>, there is an initial chemical etching stage in the presence of a mask (<b>17</b>) which makes it possible to define incipient patterns (<b>18</b>-<b>20</b>), including faces sloping along the (111) planes and flat areas parallel to the (100) planes. Subsequently, the etching mask is removed and, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> <i>b</i>, a second chemical etching stage is performed, typically using KOH. The incipient patterns (<b>18</b>-<b>20</b>) are then etched in accordance with the instructions in the document entitled “<i>Novel micro machine technology for multi level structures of silicon</i>” by Minhang Dao, Xinxin Li, Shaogun Shen and Hong Shen, published in Sensors and Actuators A63 (1997), pages 217 to 221. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0043]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0044" num="0043"> This second etching stage uses the considerable etching selectivity along the (311) planes which exists in the area of the convex crests (<b>21</b>) that are formed in the area of the boundaries of the incipient patterns (<b>18</b>-<b>20</b>). This particular fabrication method therefore makes it possible to form patterns which, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, are stacked truncated pyramids having sloping faces (<b>22</b>) parallel to the (311) planes and also level areas (<b>23</b>) that are parallel to the principal plane (100) of the substrate or even, in a configuration that is not shown, regions defined by the (111) stop planes of the silicon if the etching time is shorter. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0044]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0045" num="0044"> The layout of the various patterns (<b>2</b>-<b>4</b>, <b>12</b>-<b>14</b>) on the surface of the marking tag (<b>1</b>) can be devised to ensure various types of coding, including, in particular, redundant patterns or even patterns that are used to define the reading direction. Certain areas of the marking tag can be assigned to different codes such as a particular identification number or a definition of the product that is intended to carry the marking tag. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0045]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0046" num="0045"> Subsequently, the silicon substrate may undergo various processes intended to facilitate its use or protect it from its external environment. For example, depositing metallisation, oxide or nitride layers may make it possible to improve the reflectiveness of the patterns thus etched. It is also possible to protect the substrate by capping it by means of a soldering or wafer bonding stage. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0046]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0047" num="0046"> Obviously, the patterns described above can be produced using different processes and may also have different geometries when other etching processes are used.

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0048]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0049" num="0048"> Analysis of this image makes it possible to detect any difference in intensity between the sloping faces of the patterns (<b>2</b>-<b>4</b>) and the troughs of the same patterns. The overall contrast of the image of each pattern therefore represents the ratio of the surface area of the troughs of the patterns—viewed at an incidence that is substantially perpendicular—to the surface areas of the sloping faces that are further from an incidence that is substantially zero. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0049]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0050" num="0049"> It should also be noted that the fact that the patterns are three dimensional makes it possible, by moving away from a zero incidence, to obtain different images of opposite sloping faces of a single pattern. By varying this incidence, it is therefore possible to confirm that the pattern is actually three dimensional, thus detecting any attempted counterfeiting using flat images that represent patterns viewed at zero incidence. </div>
