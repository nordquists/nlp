<li> <para-num num="[0001]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an internal-combustion gas lighter having wind-proof, in which ignition and combustion of mixed gas are performed in a lighter body, and more particularly relates to a tightly covered lighter further having waterproof, weatherproof and pressure-proof.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Related Art</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Hitherto, as a piezoelectric ignition gas lighter (so-called piezoelectric lighter) in which a combustion cylinder and the like are incorporated in a lighter body so that ignition and combustion of gas mixed with air are performed in the lighter body, various types of wind-proof gas lighters, so-called internal-combustion gas lighters have been devised.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, such an internal-combustion gas lighter is configured to have an intake port for drawing air by negative pressure caused by ejecting fuel gas from a gas tank with increased flow velocity; a mixing tube accelerating mixing of the fuel gas with air; a diffuser connected to the mixing tube to reduce flow velocity of such mixed gas and diffuse the gas; a combustion cylinder connected to the diffuser for making the gas mixed with air (mixed gas) to be further reduced in velocity and diffused by the diffuser to have a sufficient flow velocity for ignition and combustion; and an ignition unit for igniting a combustible gas in the combustion cylinder, so that ignition and combustion are performed in a lighter body (see JP-A-63-91431 and JP-A-5-106837).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">However, in the internal-combustion gas lighter disclosed in the JP-A63-91431, since a mixed gas created by a jet flow is combusted and ignited as burner, while there is an advantage that it can be used without any difficulty even in a strong wind, there is a difficulty that sand, dust or the like enters into an internal combustion mechanism or a piezoelectric mechanism in the lighter body since a burner port of a windshield is opened comparatively large. In addition, when an ignition operator is pressed down, a side face of the windshield (a side opposed to the ignition operator) is opened large (see JP-A-5-106837).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">Furthermore, an internal-combustion gas lighter is recently requested, which can be used in river, sea, rain, or highland without worrying, that is, suitable for the outdoors.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">The invention was made in the light of such previous difficulty and request, and an object of the invention is to provide a tightly covered lighter which is protected from entering of sand, dust or the like, and has excellent water-proof, weather-proof and pressure-proof despite the internal-combustion gas lighter having excellent wind-proof.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">To solve the previous difficulty and achieve an expected object, a tightly covered lighter of an embodiment of the invention includes a cylindrical lighter body; a gas tank for storing fuel formed in the lighter body; an internal combustion mechanism having a gas ejection nozzle; a valve mechanism for transferring fuel gas from the gas tank to the internal combustion mechanism; an ignition mechanism having an ignition operator for emitting a spark for ignition; a windshield having the internal combustion mechanism assembled therein; and a cover covering a top and/or a bottom of the lighter body in a watertight or airtight manner, wherein a dip is protrusively arranged on the cover or the lighter body.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0010">Preferably, the windshield is formed in a semicylindrical shape halved in a longitudinal direction, and opposed to a semicylindrical ignition operator halved in the same direction, so that both form a cylindrical shape. Moreover, the lighter body is formed in a cylindrical shape, and can be sealed in a watertight manner at topside of the lighter body by a dome-shaped cap covering the ignition operator and the windshield at the top.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0011">Furthermore, preferably, the ignition operator has a finger putting portion formed one step lower than a top face of the windshield, and a guard portion facing a windshield side, which are formed with being integrally connected to each other, and is internally equipped with the ignition mechanism. While a piezoelectric mechanism having a piezoelectric element is preferably used for the ignition mechanism, another type of mechanism such as flint type can be used.</div>
