<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">The most recently discovered mammalian member of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family, VEGF-D, activates the cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3. VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 are expressed on the endothelial cells of blood vessels and lymphatic vessels during embryogenesis. Thereafter, VEGFR-2 is predominantly expressed on blood vessels, whereas VEGFR-3 is predominantly expressed on lymphatic vessels. Both VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 appear to have significant roles in tumor development and spread and in numerous other disease states.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">VEGFR-2 is thought to be a critical molecule for signaling angiogenesis, whereas VEGFR-3 appears to signal primarily for lymphangiogenesis. VEGFR-3 can also be up-regulated on growing blood vessels and participate in angiogenic signaling.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">VEGF-D is synthesized as a prepro-polypeptide and is activated by proteolytic processing by proprotein convertases. In humans, it is the mature proteolytically processed form of VEGF-D that binds predominantly to VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">Angiogenesis is a fundamental process required for normal growth and development of tissues, and involves the proliferation of new capillaries from pre-existing blood vessels. Angiogenesis is not only involved in embryonic development and normal tissue growth, repair, and regeneration, but is also involved in the female reproductive cycle, establishment and maintenance of pregnancy, and in repair of wounds and fractures.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition to angiogenesis which takes place in the normal individual, angiogenic events are involved in a number of pathological processes, notably tumor growth and metastasis, and other conditions in which blood vessel proliferation, especially of the microvascular system, is increased, such as diabetic retinopathy, psoriasis and arthropathies.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">Recent studies have demonstrated the critical role of angiogenesis in tumor development and the formation of metastatic tumor deposits. VEGF-D promoted tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in a mouse model of cancer, facilitating growth of the primary tumor and spread of tumor cells via the lymphatic vessels to lymph nodes. VEGF-D is expressed in a range of prevalent human cancers and has been reported to be a prognostic indicator of lymphatic involvement and poor patient outcome in some tumor types. Accordingly, the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis and VEGF-D has emerged as a promising new anti-cancer therapeutic modality.</div>

Briefly, the cornea is a tissue which normally lacks blood vessels. In certain pathological conditions however, capillaries may extend into the cornea from the pericorneal vascular plexus of the limbus. When the cornea becomes vascularized, it also becomes clouded, resulting in a decline in the patient's visual acuity. Visual loss may become complete if the cornea completely opacitates. A wide variety of disorders can result in corneal neovascularization, including for example, corneal infections (e.g., trachoma, herpes simplex keratitis, leishmaniasis and onchocerciasis), immunological processes (e.g., graft rejection and Stevens-Johnson's syndrome), alkali burns, trauma, inflammation (of any cause), toxic and nutritional deficiency states, and as a complication of wearing contact lenses.</div>

The anti-angiogenic composition may be prepared with a muco-adhesive polymer which binds to cornea. The anti-angiogenic factors or anti-angiogenic compositions may be utilized as an adjunct to conventional steroid therapy. Topical therapy may also be useful prophylactically in corneal lesions which are known to have a high probability of inducing an angiogenic response (such as chemical burns).

The preferred site of injection may vary with the morphology of the individual lesion, but the goal of the administration would be to place the composition at the advancing front of the vasculature (i.e., interspersed between the blood vessels and the normal cornea). In most cases this would involve perilimbic corneal injection to “protect” the cornea from the advancing blood vessels. This method may also be utilized shortly after a corneal insult in order to prophylactically prevent corneal neovascularization. In this situation the material could be injected in the perilimbic cornea interspersed between the corneal lesion and its undesired potential limbic blood supply. Such methods may also be utilized in a similar fashion to prevent capillary invasion of transplanted corneas. In a sustained-release form injections might only be required 2 to 3 times per year.

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0369]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0364" num="0369">Variations were spread throughout the heavy and light chain with 4 distinct variant hot spots (i.e. 5 or more variations at the same position isolated from independent clones) at amino acids 10 (E10K), 20 (V20A), 55 (N55S) and 82 (E82K). One hot spot occurred within a CDR region (N55S); three hot spots were located within FRs of the heavy chain. Multiple variants also carried light chain variations at amino acids 144 (S144G) and 198 (D198G). The variation diversity recovered in the heavy chain was greater than that seen in the light chain. Many of the variants were recovered in various combinations with each other. For example, the E82K variant (originally recovered in clone F61) and the E10K variant (recovered in clone A63) were isolated in combination in clone CK61. Similarly, the D198G variant and the E10K+V20A+N55S variants (recovered in clone DI26) were isolated in combination in clone HX28.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0370]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0365" num="0370">Although the final spectrum of variations isolated with each clone improves the overall binding of the scFv, the contribution or “weight” of individual variations is often difficult to predict and there are often unpredictable cumulative effects. While not wishing to be bound to any particular theory, it appears that CDR variations at hotspots such as N55S most likely contribute to binding by directly influencing the interaction of the scFvs with the targeted epitope on VEGF-D. Framework changes such as the heavy chain variant E82K or the light chain variant S144G probably have a more subtle effect on binding, acting to shift the CDRs relative to the target epitope, or to reposition the heavy and light chains with respect to each other. The Q238R variant did not appear to influence binding affinity to any degree and is possibly a scFv stabilizing, folding or expression change.</div>

This ensured that all IgG molecules were presented to the antigen in an active orientation.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0394]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0391" num="0394">The SPR protocol was slightly modified to compensate for the dimeric nature of the VEGF-D. Ig-1A or IgG variants were analyzed using an anti-human capture kit as described for Anti-human IgG (Fc) capture above, except that 1000 RU of the IgG or IgG variant was captured on the anti-human chip surface. Source 1 VEGF-D was run as the analyte at concentrations of 25 nM, 12.5 nM, 6.25 nM, 3.13 nM, and 1.56 nM. The kinetics generated using this approach are accurate within the experimental parameters set. This standard assay protocol is best suited to studying 1:1 interactions and thus, may not be ideal for analyzing binding between the IgG variants and the VEGF-D dimer. In light of this, Protocol B was also used.</div>

This protocol allowed avidity effects to be controlled by reducing the density of dimeric VEGF-D immobilized on the chip and in effect reduce the bivalent binding properties of the system being analyzed.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0449]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0451" num="0449">Background. The VEGFR-3-Ba/F3 cell line expresses the chimeric receptor consisting of the extracellular domain of VEGFR-3 and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of EpoR. Ba/F3 cells are IL-3 dependent. In the absence of IL-3, the VEGFR-3-Ba/F3 cells survive and proliferate only in the presence of growth factors capable of binding and cross-linking the extracellular domain of mouse VEGFR-3. Thus, this assay is used to assess the ability of the antibodies described herein to neutralize VEGFR-3 activity.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0450]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0452" num="0450">Ba/F3 cells are stably transfected with a chimeric receptor containing the extracellular domain of human VEGFR-3 and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the mouse erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) (Achen et al. 2000 <i>Eur J Biochem </i>267: 2505-2515). The chimeric receptor is made by introducing a BglII restriction enzyme site at the junction of the regions encoding the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the mouse EpoR cDNA using site-directed mutagenesis. Prior to this, a silent mutation is introduced into the EpoR cDNA in a region encoding the cytoplasmic domain of the EpoR to eliminate a naturally occurring BglII site. The fragment of the EpoR cDNA encoding the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, subcloned in plasmid pcDNA1/Amp (Invitrogen), is then ligated at the BglII site with a PCR product, consisting of DNA encoding the entire extracellular domain of human VEGFR-3, to generate a cDNA encoding a fusion protein consisting of the VEGFR-3 extracellular domain and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of EpoR. The DNA fragment encoding the extracellular domain of human VEGFR-3 can be amplified by PCR using primers 5′-TAGAAAGCTTAATCTAGAGCCACCATGCAGCGGGGCG (SEQ ID NO: 32) and 5′-TAGAGGATCCCTCCATGCTGCCCT (SEQ ID NO: 33) and ligated as a HindIII-BamHI fragment into HindIII-BglII sites of the EpoR plasmid construct. The DNA encoding the chimeric receptor is subcloned into the expression vector pEF-BOS and cotransfected into the Ba/F3 cell line with pgk-Neo (a plasmid containing a neomycin resistance gene under the control of the promoter of the mouse phosphoglycerate kinase-1 gene), at a ratio of 20:1. Transfected cells are selected in G418, and a cell line expressing the VEGFR-3-EpoR chimeric receptor (M<sub>r</sub>≈450,000) is identified by immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis with antihuman VEGFR-3 polyclonal antibody (R &amp; D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn., USA). Expression of the chimeric receptor is confirmed by flow cytometry using mAb 9D9 specific for the extracellular domain of human VEGFR-3. The cell line expressing the receptor is designated Ba/F3-VEGFR-3-EpoR.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0451]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0453" num="0451">The chimeric molecule is used because members of the receptor-type tyrosine kinase family signal poorly in hematopoietic cells such as Ba/F3, whereas signaling from the EpoR cytoplasmic domain leads to cell survival and proliferation in the absence of IL-3. Ba/F3-VEGFR-3-EpoR can be rescued with a known VEGFR-3 ligand, for example VEGF-D or VEGF-C, in the absence of IL-3. In contrast, the parental cell line, which does not express VEGFR-3, does not respond to the known VEGFR-3 ligand, indicating that the response of the Ba/F3-VEGFR-3-EpoR cell line to the known ligand is dependent on the chimeric receptor.</div>

Compounds that reduce binding of the known ligand (e.g., mature VEGF-D) to the extracellular domains of the chimeric receptors or the subsequent cross-linking of the extracellular domains will cause cell death in the absence of IL-3, even in the presence of the known ligand.</div>

The resulting media will contain approximately 500 ngmL<sup>−1 </sup>of known ligand for VEGFR-3 and varying concentrations of the candidate compound. Ba/F3-VEGFR-3-EpoR cells are then incubated in the media for 48 h at 37° C. DNA synthesis is quantified by addition of 1 μCi of <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine and further incubation for 4 h prior to harvesting, for example, using an automated cell harvester. Incorporated <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine is measured by β scintillation counting.</div>

Eight IgG antibodies derived from clones F61, HW78, HH69, HH41, HX28, HU75, DI26, AW61 were tested according to Examples 6 and 7 for their ability to block receptor activation by three forms of human VEGF-D (Sources 1, 2 and 3) in the VEGFR-2-Ba/F3 (Example 6) and VEGFR-3-Ba/F3 (Example 7) bioassays. A neutralizing monoclonal antibody and a soluble VEGFR-3 receptor were used as positive controls (not shown).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0456]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0458" num="0456">A fixed amount of the VEGF-D proteins was mixed with different amounts of the antibodies, yielding concentrations of 500 ng/ml for Source 1 and Source 2 VEGF-D, 1250 ng/ml for Source 3 VEGF-D, and 0-36,000 ng/ml for each antibody. Fifty microliters was plated in triplicate in 96-well microtitre plates. The VEGF-D concentrations needed to achieve a measurable proliferation/survival response was determined experimentally for VEGFR-2-Ba/F3 cells and adjusted taking into account the availability of the protein. An equal volume of VEGFR-2-Ba/F3 or VEGFR-3-Ba/F3 cell suspension (400,000 cells/ml) was added (resulting in a total culture volume of 100 μl/well). After two days, 10 μl of a 5 mg/ml MTT in PBS solution were added to each well and after another 2 hours of incubation cells were lysed by adding 100 μl 10% SDS/10 mM HCl solution. After incubation overnight at 37° C. and 2 hours of agitation, the OD (540 nm) was measured with a microtitre plate spectrophotometer.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0457]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0459" num="0457">Results. All eight antibodies inhibited activation of both VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 by all three of the tested VEGF-D proteins. Both Source 1 and Source 2 VEGF-D were inhibited almost to baseline at high antibody concentrations in the VEGFR-2 bioassay. Inhibition of the Source 1 and Source 2 VEGF-D worked best in the VEGFR-3 bioassay. The leading antibody in the VEGFR-3 bioassay was HX28, which came close to the control VEGFR-3 soluble receptor in inhibiting Source 1 and Source 2 VEGF-D. HX28 and DI26 were the best antibodies in inhibiting Source 3 VEGF-D in the VEGFR-3 bioassay. The qualitative results of the VEGFR-3-Ba/F3 bioassay of Example 8 are presented in Table 16. The top three ranked antibodies are the same as those in Tables 12 and 15 of Example 6.</div>
