In particular, the compounds according to the invention are suitable for the therapy or prophylaxis of cancer diseases.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Autotaxin (ATX) is an enzyme which is responsible for the increase in the lysophosphatidic acid level in ascites and plasma (Xu et al. 1995, Clinical Cancer Research Vol. 1, page 1223 and Xu et al. 1995, Biochem. J. Vol-309, page 933). ATX converts lysophatidylcholine (LPC) into lysophosphatidic acid (Tokumura et al. 2002, J. Biol. Chem., Vol 277, page 39436 and Umezu-Gozo et al. 2002, J. Biol. Chem., Vol. 158, page 227) LPA is an intercellular lipid mediator which influences a multiplicity of biological and biochemical processes, such as, for example, smooth muscle contraction, thrombocyte aggregation and apoptosis (Tigyi et al. 2003 Prog. Lipid Res. Vol 42, page. 498 and Mills et al. 2003 Nat. Rev. Cancer Vol. 3, page 582 and Lynch et al. 2001 Prost. Lipid Med. Vol. 64, page 33). In addition, LPA can be found in increased concentrations in plasma and ascites fluid from ovarian cancer patients in the early and late phase. LPA plays a role there in tumour cell proliferation and invasion thereof into neighbouring tissue, which can result in metastasisation (Xu et al. 1995, Clinical Cancer Research Vol. 1, page 1223 and Xu et al. 1995, Biochem. J. Vol-309, page 933). These biological and phatobiological processes are switched on by the activation by LPA of G-protein-coupled receptors (Contos et al. 2000, Mol. Pharm. Vol 58, page. 1188).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">For this reason, it is desirable to lower the LPA level for the treatment of tumour patients. This can be achieved by the inhibition of enzymes which are involved in LPA biosynthesis, such as, for example, autotaxin (ATX, Sano et al. 2002, J. Biol. Chem. Vol. 277, page 21197 and Aoki et al. 2003, J. Biol. Chem. Vol. 277 page 48737). Autotaxin belongs to the enzyme family of the nucleotides pyrophosphatases and phosphodiesterases (Goding et al. 1998, Immunol. Rev. Vol. 161, page 11) and represents an important starting point in antitumour therapy (Mills et al. 2003 Nat. Rev. Cancer Vol. 3, page 582 and Goto eta I. 2004 J. Cell. Biochem. Vol. 92, page 1115) since it is expressed to an increased extent in tumours and causes tumour cell proliferation and invasion into neighbouring tissue, which can result in metastases formation (Nam et al. 2000, Oncogene, Vol. 19 page 241). In addition, autotaxin together with other angiogenetic factors causes blood vessel formation in the course of angiogenesis (Nam et al. 2001, Cancer Res. Vol. 61 page. 6938). Angiogenesis is an important process in tumour growth, which ensures supply of the tumour with nutrients. For this reason, inhibition of angiogenesis is an important starting point in cancer and tumour therapy, with which the tumour can be starved to a certain extent (Folkman, 2007, Nature Reviews Drug Discovery Vol. 6, page 273-286).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, autotaxin controls the migration of T cells into secondary lymphatic organs by means of the conversion of LPC into LPA. Naïve T cells constantly migrate between blood and secondary lymphatic organs, the lymph nodes, in the healthy organism. In order to migrate from the bloodstream into a lymph node, the T cells must overcome specialised blood vessels, so-called high endothelial venules (HEV). Autotaxin is involved in this process. HEV cells secrete autotaxin into the bloodstream. This binds to T cells and converts LPC into LPA on the surface thereof. LPA in turn binds to specific receptors on the surface of the T cells and increases their ability to migrate into lymph nodes. Treatment of T cells with an autotaxin mutant which is enzymatically inactive reduces their ability to migrate into lymph nodes [1]. Treatment of the T cells with the inhibitors developed by us can likewise block migration thereof into lymph nodes.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">During inflammation, T cells can also migrate into other body tissue and drive forward the inflammation reaction there, which can result in organ damage. It has been shown in an animal model that blood vessels in inflamed tissue begin to express autotaxin [2]. It can therefore be assumed that autotaxin is also able to control the migration of T cells into body tissue during an inflammation. Increased autotaxin production is indeed also evident in humans both in inflamed intestinal tissue in the case of chronic inflammatory intestinal diseases [3] and also in affected joints [4] and synovial fibroblasts [5] of arthritis patients. Since the migration of T cells into tissue plays a role in both inflammatory diseases, inhibition of autotaxin may suppress this process and thus have a positive influence on the course of the disease.

Pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms of the compounds are for the most part prepared by conventional methods. If the compound contains a carboxyl group, one of its suitable salts can be formed by reacting the compound with a suitable base to give the corresponding base-addition salt. Such bases are, for example, alkali metal hydroxides, including potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide and lithium hydroxide; alkaline-earth metal hydroxides, such as barium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide; alkali metal alkoxides, for example potassium ethoxide and sodium propoxide; and various organic bases, such as piperidine, diethanolamine and N-methyl-glutamine. The aluminium salts of the compounds are likewise included.

A powder mixture is prepared by mixing the compound comminuted in a suitable manner with a diluent or a base, as described above, and optionally with a binder, such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, an alginate, gelatine or polyvinylpyrrolidone, a dissolution retardant, such as, for example, paraffin, an absorption accelerator, such as, for example, a quaternary salt, and/or an absorbant, such as, for example, bentonite, kaolin or dicalcium phosphate. The powder mixture can be granulated by wetting it with a binder, such as, for example, syrup, starch paste, acadia mucilage or solutions of cellulose or polymer materials and pressing it through a sieve. As an alternative to granulation, the powder mixture can be run through a tabletting machine, giving lumps of non-uniform shape, which are broken up to form granules. The granules can be lubricated by addition of stearic acid, a stearate salt, talc or mineral oil in order to prevent sticking to the tablet casting moulds. The lubricated mixture is then pressed to give tablets. The compounds according to the invention can also be combined with a free-flowing inert excipient and then pressed directly to give tablets without carrying out the granulation or dry-pressing steps.

<li> <para-num num="[0337]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0261" num="0337">The autotaxin activity is measured indirectly using Amplex Red reagent. Amplex Red is measured here as fluorogenic indicator for the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>formed. In detail, autotaxin converts the substrate lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) into phosphocholine and lysophosphatidylic acid (LPA). After this reaction, the phosphocholine is reacted with alkaline phosphatase to give inorganic phosphate and choline. In the next step, choline is oxidised by choline oxidase to give betaine, with formation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>reacts with Amplex Red reagent in the presence of peroxidase (horseradish peroxidase) in a 1:1 stoichiometry and forms the highly fluorescent resorufin. The fluorescence is measured in a reaction-dependent kinetic mode in order that fluorescent signals from possible other fluorescent substances which are not involved in the reaction can be corrected out.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0063">Test Procedure</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0338]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0262" num="0338">3 μl of a standard solution or of the test substances (substances with the name A(n)) in individual concentrations dissolved in 20 mM Hepes pH 7.2 with a maximum of 11% of DMSO are pre-incubated together with 20 μl (19 ng) of highly purified recombinant autotaxin in test buffer in a black microtitre plate provided with 384 wells at 22° C. for 30 min. The reaction is then initiated by addition of 10 μl of L-α-lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), where the final concentration of LPC is 75 μM. The mixture is incubated at 37° C. for 90 min. After the incubation, Amplex Red reagent, peroxidase (horseradish peroxidase) and choline oxidase is added, and the fluorescence is immediately measured at 612 nm with excitation of 485 nm in a “Tecan Ultra multimode” reader. The activity of autotaxin is calculated indirectly via detection of the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>formed.</div>
