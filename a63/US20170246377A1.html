<li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Apheresis is a procedure in which individual blood components can be separated and collected from whole blood temporarily withdrawn from a subject. Typically, whole blood is withdrawn through a needle inserted into a vein of the subjects arm and into a cell separator, such as a centrifugal bowl. Once the whole blood is separated into its various components, one or more of the components can be removed from the centrifugal bowl. The remaining components can be returned to the subject along with optional compensation fluid to make up for the volume of the removed component. The process of drawing and returning continues until the quantity of the desired component has been collected, at which point the process is stopped. A central feature of apheresis systems is that the processed but unwanted components are returned to the donor. Separated blood components may include, for example, a high density component such as red blood cells, an intermediate density component such as platelets or white blood cells, and a lower density component such as plasma</div>

Additionally, various embodiments of the present invention reduce the vibration and noise seen in some prior art separation devices. For example, embodiments of the present invention may include one or more vibration reduction members. Details of illustrative embodiments are discussed below.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0026]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, and as mentioned above, an apheresis system <b>10</b>, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention, withdraws whole blood from a subject through a venous access device <b>24</b> using a withdraw pump P<b>1</b>. The venous access device <b>24</b> can be any number of devices capable of accessing a subject's veins including, but not limited to a phlebotomy needle. As the system <b>10</b> withdraws the whole blood from the subject, the blood passes through a draw/return line <b>28</b> and enters a blood component separation device <b>11</b>, such as a Latham type centrifuge. The blood component separation device <b>11</b> separates the whole blood into its constituent components (e.g., red blood cells, white blood cell, plasma, and platelets). Although a Latham type centrifuge is mentioned above, other types of separation chambers and devices may be used, such as, without limitation, an integral blow-molded centrifuge bowl, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,983,156 and 4,943,273, which are hereby incorporated by reference.</div>

To that end, the system <b>10</b> may include an anticoagulant line <b>32</b> fluidly connected to an anticoagulant source <b>16</b> (e.g., a bag of anticoagulant) at one end, and the venous-access device <b>24</b> (or the draw/return line <b>28</b> via a y-connector <b>30</b>) at the other end. An anti-coagulant pump P<b>3</b>, through which the anticoagulant line <b>32</b> passes, may control the flow of anticoagulant within the anti-coagulant line <b>32</b> and the amount of anticoagulant introduced into the whole blood. Although the anticoagulant can be added to the whole blood at any point, it is preferred that the anticoagulant be introduced as close as possible to the venous-access device <b>24</b>.</div>

Additionally, the anticoagulant line <b>32</b> may include an air detector D<b>3</b> that detects the presence of air within the anticoagulant. The presence of air bubbles within any of the system <b>10</b> lines can be problematic for the operation the system <b>10</b> and may also be harmful to the subject if the air bubbles enter the blood stream. Therefore, the air detector D<b>3</b> may be connected to an interlock that stops the flow within the anticoagulant line <b>32</b> in the event that an air bubble is detected (e.g., by stopping the anticoagulant pump P<b>3</b> or closing a valve on the anticoagulant line <b>32</b>), thereby preventing the air bubbles from entering the subject.</div>

For example, the blood component separation device <b>11</b> may separate the whole blood into a first, second, third, and, perhaps, fourth blood component. More specifically, the blood component separation device <b>150</b> can separate the whole blood into plasma, platelets, red blood cells, and, perhaps, white blood cells.</div>

The rotatable bowl may include a neck portion <b>110</b> coupled to the rotary seal <b>74</b>, and a body portion <b>120</b> that defines the interior volume of the separation device (e.g, the interior volume of the rotatable bowl <b>12</b>). The bowl <b>12</b> (e.g., the body portion <b>120</b>) may have a frustoconical shape.

In particular, as the bowl <b>12</b> rotates, centrifugal forces separate the anticoagulated whole blood admitted into the bottom of the bowl into red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC), platelets and plasma. The number of rotations of the bowl <b>12</b> can be selected, for example, within a range of 4,000 to 6,000 rpm, and is typically 4,800 rpm. The blood is separated into different fractions in accordance with the component densities. The higher density component, i.e., RBC <b>60</b>, is forced to the outer wall <b>70</b> of the bowl <b>12</b> while the lower density plasma <b>66</b> lies nearer the core <b>72</b>. A buffy coat <b>61</b> is formed between the plasma <b>66</b> and the RBC <b>60</b>. The buffy coat <b>61</b> is made up of an inner layer of platelets <b>64</b>, a transitional layer <b>68</b> of platelets and WBC and an outer layer of WBC <b>62</b>. The plasma <b>66</b> is the component closest to the outlet port from the separation region and is the first fluid component displaced from the bowl <b>12</b> via the outlet port PT<b>2</b> as additional anticoagulated whole blood enters the bowl <b>12</b> through the inlet port PT<b>1</b>.</div>

The optical sensor <b>21</b> monitors each layer of the blood components as they gradually and coaxially advance toward the core <b>72</b> from the outer wall <b>70</b> of the bowl <b>12</b>. The optical sensor <b>21</b> may be mounted in a position at which it can detect the buffy coat reaching a particular radius, and the steps of drawing the whole blood from the subject/donor and introducing the whole blood into the bowl <b>12</b> may be terminated in response to the detection.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0034]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0035" num="0034">Once the blood component separation device <b>11</b> has separated the blood into the various components, one or more of the components can be removed from the blood component separation device <b>11</b>. For instance, the plasma may be removed to a plasma bag <b>18</b> through line <b>37</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) or a waste bag (not shown). Alternatively, the plasma may be removed to a plasma reservoir (not shown) located on the draw/return line <b>28</b>, or the white blood cells (WBC) may be removed to one or more white blood cell bags <b>22</b> via line <b>35</b>. Some embodiments of the system <b>10</b> may include a weight sensor <b>33</b> that measures the amount plasma collected. Although not shown, the platelet bag <b>20</b> and the white blood cell bag <b>22</b> may include similar weight sensors. The removed plasma may be later reintroduced into the blood component separation device <b>11</b> via line <b>40</b> and recirculation pump P<b>2</b> at an increasing rate to extract and send the platelets to a platelet bag <b>20</b> via line <b>39</b>.

In particular, the line sensor <b>14</b> consists of an LED which emits light through the blood components leaving the bowl <b>12</b> and a photo detector which receives the light after it passes through the components. The amount of light received by the photo detector is correlated to the density of the fluid passing through the line. For example, if plasma is exiting the bowl <b>12</b>, the line sensor <b>14</b> will be able to detect when the plasma exiting the bowl <b>12</b> becomes cloudy with platelets (e.g., the fluid existing the bowl <b>12</b> is changing from plasma to platelets). The system <b>10</b> may then use this information to either stop the removal of blood components from the bowl <b>12</b> or redirect the flow by, for example, closing valve V<b>2</b> and opening valve V<b>3</b>.</div>

Alternatively, if the system <b>11</b> is so equipped, the system may return the components to the subject via a dedicated return line. Like the anticoagulant line <b>32</b> and the draw/return line <b>28</b>, the dedicated return line may also have a dedicated return pump that controls the direction, rate, and duration of the fluid flow within the return line. In such embodiments, the return line also fluidly connects to the venous-access device <b>24</b>, preferably at a point between the return pump and the venous-access device <b>24</b>. Additionally, in such embodiments, the system <b>10</b> will also have a dedicated draw line and draw pump. In some embodiments, the system <b>10</b> may include an interlock that stops the withdrawal of whole blood from the subject when the system is returning the first blood component to the subject.</div>

As the centrifuge bowl <b>12</b> rotates, the friction between the contact surfaces of the rings <b>112</b>/<b>114</b> may prevent the rings <b>112</b>/<b>114</b> from sliding smoothly against one another. In such cases, the sliding surface of one ring (e.g., the carbon ring <b>112</b>) may repeatedly stick and slip against the surface of the other ring (e.g., the ceramics ring <b>114</b>).

When the vibration reaches the body portion <b>120</b>, the vibrational and acoustic characteristics of the body portion <b>120</b> cause it to emit an audible noise. As one would expect, the audible noise may be disruptive to the subject and operator.

The ribs <b>140</b> stiffen the neck portion of the bowl <b>12</b> and effectively increase the natural vibration frequency of the neck portion <b>110</b> without also increasing the natural vibration frequency of the body portion <b>120</b>.</div>

By shifting the natural frequency of the neck portion <b>110</b>, the amplitude of the vibrations within the neck portion <b>110</b> will decrease because there will no longer be resonance (e.g., the vibrations caused by the “stick and slip” phenomenon will no longer be at the natural vibratation/resonance frequency of the neck portion <b>110</b>).</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0048]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0049" num="0048">It is important to note that care must be taken to balance the benefits of the increased strength and rigidity provided by the vibration reduction members (e.g., the ribs <b>140</b>/<b>150</b> and/or the thickened area <b>160</b>) against the additional weight that the vibration reduction members add to the centrifuge bowl <b>12</b>. In particular, as the weight of the centrifuge bowl <b>12</b> increases, the natural vibration frequency of the body portion <b>120</b> may change. As the natural vibration frequency of the body portion <b>120</b> changes, the vibration/noise reduction benefits of vibration reduction members (e.g., the increased strength and rigidity of the neck portion) may be diminished. For example, if the natural vibrational frequency of the body portion <b>120</b> is altered such that it coincides with frequency of the reduced vibrations propagated to the body portion <b>120</b> (e.g., the vibrations are at the new resonance frequency of the body portion <b>120</b>), the body portion <b>120</b> may then still vibrate significantly and emit an audible noise. Therefore, the thickness of the ribs members <b>140</b>/<b>150</b> and the thickened areas <b>160</b> on the neck portion <b>110</b> must be such that they do not increase the weight of the centrifuge device enough to significantly alter/increase the natural vibrational frequency of the body portion <b>120</b>.</div>
