<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0002">In 1995, Professor Chou, who is currently at Princeton University, and others developed a novel technology called nanoimprint lithography (Patent Document 1). Nanoimprint lithography is a technology in which a mold having any pattern is contacted with a base material on which a resin film is formed, and the resin film is pressed while applying an external stimulation such as heat or light to form an intended pattern on the cured resin film. Nanoimprint lithography has the advantage of allowing nanoscale processing simply and inexpensively, compared to conventional photolithography and the like in the manufacture of semiconductor devices.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0003">Thus, since nanoimprint lithography is expected to be applied to the manufacture of semiconductor devices, optical devices, displays, storage media, biochips, and the like, instead of the photolithography technique, various reports have been made regarding curable compositions for photonanoimprint lithography used for nanoimprint lithography (Patent Documents 2 and 3).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0004">In photonanoimprint lithography, a roll-to-roll method has been developed as a method for mass-producing a pattern-transferred film with high efficiency. A mainstream roll-to-roll method conventionally proposed in photonanoimprint lithography is a method that uses a flexible film as a base material, and uses, as a material to be used for nanoimprint lithography (hereinafter abbreviated as an “imprint material”), a solventless-type material to which no solvent is added to avoid changes in pattern dimensions.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0008">As described above, a solventless-type material is used as a conventionally proposed imprint material. However, such an imprint material may not establish favorable adhesion between the film after imprinting and the base material film. Moreover, in a product such as a solid-state imaging device, a solar cell, an LED device, or a display, scratch resistance may be required for a projection-and-recess shape produced as an optical member inside or on the surface of the product. Furthermore, when the projection-and-recess shape is adopted on the surface of the above-described product, contamination on the surface may be removed under high load with a tissue, a cloth, or the like. In this case, a collapse of projections in the projection-and-recess shape must be prevented. However, although various imprint materials have been disclosed, no specific studies or reports have been made regarding a material that has sufficient adhesion to a film base material, and is excellent in scratch resistance and surface wiping resistance, i.e., the above-described collapse of projections does not occur when the surface is wiped under high load.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0009">The present invention has been made in view of the above-described circumstances, and a problem to be solved by the present invention is to provide an imprint material that forms a film having sufficient adhesion to a film base material and excellent scratch resistance, and having surface wiping resistance under high load, when the imprint material is used to form a resin film.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0007">Means for Solving the Problem</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0013" num="0010">As a result of diligent study to solve the above-described problem, the inventors of the present invention used, as an imprint material, a material containing a predetermined compound having a polymerizable group at an end, a compound having a propylene oxide unit and/or an ethylene oxide unit and having a polymerizable group at an end, a predetermined (meth)acrylamide compound, a compound having a predetermined ethylene oxide unit and having a polymerizable group at an end, and a photopolymerization initiator, thereby making the following findings, and completing the present invention. That is, there is excellent adhesion between a film having a projection-and-recess shape transferred thereon and a base material; even when the surface of the film having the projection-and-recess shape transferred thereon is subjected to a steel wool scratch test, it generates almost no scratches; and even when the surface of the film having the projection-and-recess shape transferred thereon is wiped under high load, a collapse of projections on the projection-and-recess shape does not occur.</div>

On the other hand, the results shown in Table 4 confirmed that the cured coating films obtained using the imprint materials prepared in Comparative Examples 1 to 3, 6 and 7 generated many scratches after the steel wool scratch test, and lacked adhesion to the TAC film. Furthermore, in the cured coating films obtained using the imprint materials prepared in Comparative Examples 4 and 5, a collapse of projections occurred when the surface having the projection-and-recess shape transferred thereon was scrubbed under high load, and haze was generated. The foregoing shows that the cured coating films obtained using the imprint materials of the present invention have excellent adhesion to the substrate, scratch resistance, and excellent wiping resistance.</div>
