</li> <heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Organs such as lung, kidney, liver, pancreas and skin can be characterized by, among other things, the presence of epithelia made of organ-specific epithelial cells. Often, epithelial cells are defined by one or more specific functions of each such organ. Specific functions may include, for example, gas exchange in the lung, filtration in the kidney, detoxification and conjugation in the liver, endocrine (e.g., insulin) production in the pancreatic islet cells or protection against hazardous conditions in the environment by the skin.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Epithelial cells may be directly attached to each other by cell-cell junctions, where cytoskeletal filaments are anchored, to form epithelia. Often, epithelia are anchored to other tissue on one side (i.e., the basal side) and generally are free of such attachment on their opposite side (i.e., the apical side). A basal lamina (or basement membrane) lies at the interface with underlying tissue, mediating the attachment. For certain tissues, the apical side of an epithelium generally is exposed to the environment. Access to the apical membrane of an epithelial cell is useful for various biological function studies, e.g., the interaction between infectious agents such as viruses and the epithelial cells.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">An air-liquid interface (ALI) culture is an in vitro method currently used for creating an apical-basal polarized epithelial tissue model. Generally, epithelial cells are plated on a porous support in cell culture medium and allow to grow to confluence. The culture medium is then removed from the top side of the porous plastic support to expose the cells to air, which induces the cells to form apical-basal polarized epithelium. The side that is exposed to air becomes the apical side, and the side that is attached to the porous support becomes the basal side. Epithelial cell ALI culture can be a useful in vitro tool for a variety of studies, e.g., safety profile of compound exposure, infectivity of viruses, trans-epithelium drug delivery, and other cellular functions such as water and solute transport across an apical-basal polarized epithelium. A long in vitro maturation/differentiation process (generally a few weeks to over 1 month), a dependence on porous membrane inserts (e.g., 6-, 12-, 24- or 96-well) format, and a lack of suitable methods for cryopreserving mature ALI cultures, however, pose significant challenges for employing ALI culture in high-throughput assays to satisfy increasing demands for a physiologically-relevant assay model.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">For certain applications, organoid culture protocols may be used, which can support the formation of apical-basal polarized epithelium in culture. Generally, individual epithelial cells are inoculated into thick extracellular matrix (e.g., Matrigel™), and cultured in medium to form epithelial organoids. The organoids typically are hollow enclosures lined by epithelial cells with the apical side facing inwards (away from the extracellular matrix), and the basal side connected to the extracellular matrix. This format precludes access to the apical side of the cells without penetrating the organoids. Retrieving organoids out of Matrigel™ can be difficult and often depends on the use of a protease, and cryopreservation of organoids is not commonly practiced.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0032]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0034" num="0032">Provided herein are epithelial cell spheroids and methods of producing epithelial cell spheroids. Epithelial cell spheroids provided herein, and epithelial cell spheroids produced by the methods described herein, may serve as apical-basal polarized epithelial tissue models, and may be useful, for example, for certain in vitro tissue studies and some medical applications. Generally, an epithelial cell spheroid provided herein comprises epithelial cells oriented such that the basal side of each epithelial cell faces the inside of the spheroid and the apical side of each epithelial cell faces the outside of the spheroid. Such spheroids may be referred to herein as apical side outward-oriented (ASO) epithelial spheroids.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0007">Epithelial Cells</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0033]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0035" num="0033">Provided herein are spheroids comprising epithelial cells (i.e., epithelial cell spheroids) and methods of producing epithelial cell spheroids. Methods of producing cell spheroids may comprise forming cellular aggregates and/or forming cell-substrate bodies. Accordingly, cell spheroids, cellular aggregates and/or cell-substrate bodies may comprise epithelial cells. An epithelial cell, or epithelium, typically refers to a cell or cells that line hollow organs, as well as those that make up glands and the outer surface of the body. Epithelial cells can comprise squamous epithelial cells, columnar epithelial cells, adenomatous epithelial cells or transitional epithelial cells. Epithelial cells can be arranged in single layers or can be arranged in multiple layers, depending on the organ and location.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0034]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0036" num="0034">Epithelial cells may have cell polarity. For example, certain epithelial cells have an apical-basal polarity. Such cells may comprise an apical membrane on one side and a basal membrane on an opposite side. Such cells also may comprise a lateral membrane. Generally, epithelial cells having an apical-basal polarity comprise an apical membrane on one side and a basal membrane on an opposite side, and an apical membrane located between the apical membrane and the basal membrane.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0035]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0037" num="0035">The basal side of an epithelial cell typically is anchored to other tissue. A basement membrane (or basal lamina) lies at the interface with underlying tissue, mediating the attachment. A basement membrane generally is a thin (e.g., about 100-nm) extracellular matrix (ECM) that contains a meshwork of proteins such as laminins, collagen IV, proteoglycans and nidogen. In certain instances, cell-matrix anchoring junctions tether the basal surface of an epithelial cell to the basement membrane. Cell-matrix anchoring junctions may include hemidesmosomes and actin-linked cell-matrix junctions. Hemidesmosomes generally anchor intermediate filaments in an epithelial cell to extracellular matrix (ECM). Actin-linked cell-matrix junctions generally anchor actin filaments in an epithelial cell to ECM. In certain instances, cells can interact with a basement membrane by binding basement membrane components through cell surface integrin receptors. These interactions allow the basement membrane to provide epithelia with survival, proliferation and differentiation signals, as well as directional cues to establish polarity. An epithelial cell may interact with the extracellular matrix (ECM) through integrin receptors. Cell-matrix interactions typically are involved in creating epithelial cell polarity (see e.g., Lee et al. 2014 J. Cell Sci. 127:3217-3225). The orientation of epithelial polarity typically requires extrinsic signals, which often originate within the ECM. Basal and lateral membranes share certain common protein markers which include, for example, Lethal Giant Larvae (Lgl), Discs Large (Dig), and Scribble (Scrib).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0036]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0038" num="0036">Epithelial cells having an apical-basal polarity generally are free of attachment on the apical side. For certain tissues, the apical side of an epithelial cell is exposed to the environment (e.g., apical side of an airway cell is exposed to inhaled air; apical side of an intestinal cell is exposed to ingested food and liquid). In certain instances, the apical side of an epithelial cell is exposed to the interior or lumen of a tubule or organ (e.g., interior of a renal tubule). For certain epithelial cells, apical membrane is characterized by the presence of cilia and/or microvilli. Cilia generally are found on ciliated epithelial cells, such as epithelial cells in the lungs. Cilia may move by waving rhythmically (e.g., to move debris and/or mucus out). Microvilli generally are found in tissues/organs specialized for absorption, such as the digestive tract or kidneys. Microvilli function by increasing the surface area of the cell membrane, thus allowing for more materials to be absorbed into the cell at a quicker rate. For example, microvilli are found in the small intestine and increase the surface area for nutrient absorption. Protein markers for apical membrane may include, for example, Cdc42, atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), Par6, Par3/Bazooka/ASIP, Crumbs, Stardust, and protein at tight junctions (PATJ).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0037]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0039" num="0037">Epithelial cells may be directly attached to each other at their lateral membranes by cell-cell junctions, where cytoskeletal filaments are anchored, to form epithelia. Cell-cell junctions may include, for example, tight junctions, cell-cell anchoring junctions (e.g., adherens junctions, desmosomes), and channel forming junctions (e.g., gap junctions). Tight junctions generally are parts of cell membranes joined together to seal gaps between epithelial cells and form an impermeable or substantially impermeable barrier to fluid; adherens junctions generally connect actin filament bundles in one cell with that in the next cell; desmosomes generally connect intermediate filaments in one cell to those in the next cell; and gap junctions allow passage of molecules (e.g., small water-soluble molecules) from cell to cell. In the most apical portion of the cell, the relative positions of the junctions are the same or similar in most vertebrate epithelia. A tight junction typically occupies the most apical position, followed by an adherens junction (adhesion belt) and then by a parallel row of desmosomes. Gap junctions and additional desmosomes generally are less regularly organized.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0038]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0040" num="0038">In some embodiments, epithelial cells form tight junctions under certain culture conditions. For example, epithelial cells may form tight junctions under aggregation conditions described herein, under substrate attachment conditions described herein, and/or under spheroid inducing conditions described herein. Formation of tight junctions may be visualized, for example, by immunofluorescence staining of tight junction proteins (e.g., ZO-1). In some embodiments, epithelial cells can be induced to form tight junctions under aggregation conditions.

In some instances, cellular spheroids may be used for protein expression (e.g., proteins secreted from the apical side of epithelial cells). In some instances, epithelial cells in a cellular spheroid can be genetically modified to express a protein of interest (e.g., a therapeutic protein; a secreted protein). In some instances, an epithelial cell or group of cells can be genetically modified and then induced to form a cellular spheroid under spheroid-inducing culture conditions described herein. Such genetic modification of the cells would be designed to, for example, insert a transgene (e.g., a disease-modifying transgene) that codes for a particular protein. A protein expressed by a transgene may act as a functional version of a missing or a defective protein, or may act as a suppressor or inhibitor of genes or other proteins. Cellular spheroids comprising cells expressing a particular protein can then be placed in a subsequent environment, for example, such as an autologous implant or a non-autologous implant into a subject, such that the cells will produce the protein in vivo. For example, cellular spheroids comprising cells expressing a protein can be placed in a subsequent environment, such as alginate encapsulation, which can protect the spheroids from being attacked by immune cells and used as a non-autologous implant into a subject, such that the cells will produce the protein in vivo.</div>

For example, cellular spheroids may be assayed for generating a response profile. A response profile typically is a collection of one or more data points that can indicate the likelihood that a particular treatment will produce a desired response, for example in normal or abnormal epithelial cells. A response to a therapeutic agent may include, for example, cell death (e.g., by necrosis, toxicity, apoptosis, and the like), and/or a reduction of growth rate for the cells. Methods to assess a response to a therapeutic agent include, for example, determining a dose response curve, a cell survival curve, a therapeutic index and the like. For example, nasal or trachea epithelial cells may be isolated from a subject carrying mutation(s) in the CFTR gene, and the spheroid-inducing culture conditions herein may be utilized to obtain cellular spheroids for further analysis, such as, for example, assays for generating a response profile to therapeutic agents such as drugs, antibodies, RNAi and antisense nucleic acids, and/or gene therapy regimes.</div>

Airway epithelial cells may be induced to form cellular spheroids under spheroid-inducing culture conditions described herein.

Primary cells may be isolated, for example, from a single needle biopsy, from a tissue biopsy, from a plucked hair, from body fluids like urine or body-cavity fluids, from the circulation of a subject, and the like. After isolation, cellular material may be washed (e.g., with saline and/or a PBS solution). Cellular material may be treated with an enzymatic solution such as, for example, collagenase, dispase and/or trypsin, to promote dissociation of cells from the tissue matrix. Dispase, for example, may be used to dissociate epithelium from underlying tissue. An intact epithelium may then be treated with trypsin or collagenase, for example. Such digestion steps often result in a slurry containing dissociated cells and tissue matrix. The slurry can then be centrifuged with sufficient force to separate the cells from the remainder of the slurry. A cell pellet may then be removed and washed with buffer and/or saline and/or cell culture medium. The centrifuging and washing can be repeated any number of times. After a final washing, cells can then be washed with any suitable cell culture medium. In certain instances, digestion and washing steps may not be performed if the cells are sufficiently separated from the underlying tissue upon isolation (e.g., for cells isolated from circulation or using needle biopsy).

In some embodiments, a method herein does not comprise inhibiting the activity of Rho kinase (e.g., Rho-associated protein kinase) in cultured epithelial cells. Rho kinase (e.g., Rho-associated protein kinase) belongs to the Rho GTPase family of proteins, which includes Rho, Rac1 and Cdc42 kinases. An effector molecule of Rho is ROCK, which is a serine/threonine kinase that binds to the GTP-bound form of Rho. The catalytic kinase domain of ROCK, which comprises conserved motifs characteristic of serine/threonine kinases, is found at the N-terminus. ROCK proteins also have a central coiled-coil domain, which includes a Rho-binding domain (RBD). The C-terminus contains a pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain with an internal cysteine-rich domain. The coiled-coil domain is thought to interact with other alpha helical proteins. The RBD, located within the coiled-coil domain, interacts with activated Rho GTPases, including RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC. The PH domain is thought to interact with lipid mediators such as arachidonic acid and sphingosylphosphorylcholine, and may play a role in protein localization. Interaction of the PH domain and RBD with the kinase domain results in an auto-inhibitory loop. In addition, the kinase domain is involved in binding to RhoE, which is a negative regulator of ROCK activity.</div>

The amino acid sequences of human ROCK1 and human ROCK2 can be found at UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) Accession Number Q13464 and 075116, respectively. The nucleotide sequences of human ROCK1 and ROCK2 can be found at GenBank Accession Number NM_005406.2 and NM_004850, respectively.

For example, ROCK2 is more prevalent in brain and skeletal muscle, while ROCK1 is more abundant in liver, testes and kidney. Both isoforms are expressed in vascular smooth muscle and heart. In the resting state, both ROCK1 and ROCK2 are primarily cytosolic, but are translocated to the membrane upon Rho activation. Rho-dependent ROCK activation is highly cell-type dependent, and ROCK activity is regulated by several different mechanisms including changes in contractility, cell permeability, migration and proliferation to apoptosis. Several ROCK substrates have been identified (see e.g., Hu and Lee, Expert Opin. Ther. Targets 9:715-736 (2005); Loirand et al, Cir. Res. 98:322-334 (2006); and Riento and Ridley, Nat. Rev. Mol.

The activity, function or expression may be completely suppressed (i.e., no activity, function or expression); or the activity, function or expression may be lower in treated versus untreated cells. In some embodiments, inhibiting the activity of Rho kinase (e.g., Rho-associated protein kinase) involves blocking an upstream effector of a ROCK1 and/or ROCK2 pathway, for example GTP-bound Rho, such that ROCK1 and/or ROCK2 are not activated or its activity is reduced compared to untreated cells. Other upstream effectors include but are not limited to, integrins, growth factor receptors, including but not limited to, TGF-beta and EGFR, cadherins, G protein coupled receptors and the like.

Myosin II (e.g., non-muscle myosin II (NM II)) is a member of a family of ATP-dependent motor proteins and plays a role in muscle contraction and other motility processes (e.g., actin-based motility). Non-muscle myosin II (NM II) is an actin-binding protein that has actin cross-linking and contractile properties and is regulated by the phosphorylation of its light and heavy chains. Owing to its position downstream of convergent signaling pathways, non-muscle myosin II (NM II) is involved in the control of cell adhesion, cell migration and tissue architecture. In higher eukaryotes, non-muscle myosin II is activated by phosphorylation of its regulatory light chain (MLC) at Ser19/Thr18. MLC phosphorylation controls both the assembly of the actomyosin contractile apparatus and its contractility. Two groups of enzymes generally control MLC phosphorylation. One group includes kinases that phosphorylate MLC (MLC kinases), promoting activity, and the other is a phosphatase that dephosphorylates MLC, inhibiting activity. Several kinases can phosphorylate MLC at Ser19/Thr18 in vitro and, in some cases, in vivo. These include, for example, MLCK, ROCK, PAK (p21-activated kinase), citron kinase, ILK (integrin-linked kinase), MRCK (myotonic dystrophyprotein kinase-related, cdc42-binding kinase) and DAPKs (death-associated protein kinases including ZIPK). The major myosin phosphatase present in smooth and non-muscle cells includes three subunits: a large subunit of w 130 kDa (referred to as the myosin phosphatase targeting subunit MYPT1 (also called M130/133, M110 or MBS)), a catalytic subunit of 38 kDa (the 6 isoform of type 1 protein phosphatase, PP1c) and a small subunit of 20 kDa. Rho-associate protein kinase (ROCK) can activate myosin II by inhibiting MYPT1 and by directly phosphorylating MLC. PAK1 can activate myosin II through the phosphorylation of atypical protein kinase C (aPKC).</div>

It was reported that submersion in medium creates a hypoxic environment that represses the differentiation of multiciliated cells (see e.g., Gerovac et al., Submersion and Hypoxia Inhibit Ciliated Cell Differentiation in a Notch-Dependent Manner; Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. (2014) 51(4):516-25). However, airway epithelial cells did grow into mucociliary lineages under submersion conditions in the presence of A 83-01 and Y-27632. Specifically, airway epithelial cells formed a continuous epithelium sheet in submersion in the presence of both A 83-01 and Y-27632 (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Normal human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC; passage 11 (P11), population doubling (PD)-30) were seeded on top of 25% Matrigel™ (BD Biosciences) in 24-well plate and cultured with different media.

The epithelium sheet formed by airway epithelial cells under submersion conditions continued to survive in PneumaCult™-ALI with 1 μM A83-01 and 5 μM Y-27632 (P+A+Y) for over 2 months (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Multiciliated cells could be found in the continuous airway epithelium sheet, with the apical side faced up (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, panel B).
