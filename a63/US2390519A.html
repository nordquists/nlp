<div class="description-paragraph">Patented Dec. 11, 1945 PREPARATION OF ALKYLENE CYANOHYDRINS lHarold S. Davis and Bryan C. Redmon, Riverside, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Conn., asslgnors to Amer'can Cyanamid Company, New York, N. Y., a corporation of Maine Application February 16, 1939, Serial No. 256,676 </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">13 Claims. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The present invention relates to a method of making alkylene cyanohydrins from the correspending alkylene oxide and hydrocyanic acid, in </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">the liquid phase. l </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The reaction using ethylene oxide as a typical starting material may be written asfollows: </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Inasmueh as the boiling point, at atmospheric pressure, of ethylene oxide is 10.7 C., that of HCN is 26 C., and that of vethylene cyanohydrin is 220 C., and since the operating temperatures are much above the boiling point of the reactants, it is, therefore, necessary to allow the reaction to proceed in closed systems under pressure due to the high vapor pressures of the initial reactants at the operating temperatures. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The prior art indicates that the reaction is a slow one. Erlenmeyer (Liebigs Annalen 191,261, (1878)) reports a yield at 25 C. in closed tubes after eight days, but a good yield at 50 to 60 C. after four days. No further definition as to yields is mentioned by this experimenter. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The principal object of the present invention, therefore, is to discover ways and means for reacting the alkylene oxides and hydrocyanic acid so that commercial yields are obtainable in simple `apparatus in much shorter periods of time. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Using ethylene oxide as an example, simply because the prior art literature deals with this reactant in the preparation of ethylene `cyanohydrin and because of its cheapness and availability, it has now been determined that at higher temperatures than those heretofore described, a spontaneous, rapid and highly exothermic reaction occurs with HCN to form ethylene cyanohydrin in good yields if equi-molecular mixtures of the reactants `are heated under pressure to withinan activation temperature range in which the reaction starts spontaneously. Cnce started, the reaction has been observed to proceed under its own power at a velocity depending principally upon the extent of they dilution of the reactants in certain solvents. When the reaction is spontaneously under way, it is no longer necessary to supply heat to the system unless the reaction has been `caused t-o proceed very slowly. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The heat oi' reaction has been calculated from the known heats of formation .oi HCN and ethylene oxide and from an estimated value for ethylene cyanohydrin. The heat of reaction so calculated was found to be between +40,000 and +50,000 calories per mol of liquid ethylene cyanohydrin formed from liquid reactants. 'This corresponds to from 550 to 700 calories per gram. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> If no diluent is present and no heat lost to the container or surroundings, the heat of reaction will raise the reaction product to a point substantially in the neighborhood of 1000" C. above the activation temperature with a corresponding pressure increase. It has been found that such high temperatures very seriously impair the yields due to destruction of the product and possibly of the initial reactants through pyrolysis and polymerization. It is, therefore, a matter of the utmost importance to avoid excessive temperature rises during the reaction. This may be accomplished by controlling the reaction velocity so that suicient time is permitted for heat dissipatien, carrying out the reaction in an apparatus designed to conduct the heat away quickly and efficiently or dissolving the reactants in a suitable solvent which decreases the reaction velocity and assists ln heat dispersion, or combinations of the above. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is, of course, equally disadvantageous to allow 4 the temperature of the reaction to fall much below the activation range since this either stops the reaction completely or slows up its velocity undesirably. Therefore, a temperature somewhat above the minimum activation temperature should be maintained as closely as possible. While the exact value of these tempel atures will depend upon the conditions of the reaction and the design of the apparatus, in general it may be said that the activation temperature lies between thelimits of 90 C. and 150 C. and, consequently, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">- in temperature and pressure. It may be generally said that solvents of which a mixture of aiphenyl oxideand diphenyl with a boiling pOnt of substantially 250 C. to 260 C., and ethylene glycol are typical have not.been found to be of value. Solvents of the polar type, however, such as water, ethylene cyanohydrin and the liquid reaction product of a. previous run, have a very marked effect in rendering the velocity of the reaction controllable. Water, however, has the disadvan- 'tage of promoting the corrosion of steel by HCN where the reaction is carried out in apparatus including that material. However, the use oi the more resistant alloy steels under these circumstances will be desirable in view of the cheapness of this diluent. </div>

The use of ordinary or commercial alkylene yanohydrins in this manner 5 98% product and contained some HCN polymer as evidenced by its yellow color. It would seem, therefore, that even the small amount of polymer present in the commercial HCN used renders the reaction more controllable. Compare runs 3 and 4 for this eiect. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In run 2, it is concluded that the absence of a diluent caused loss of control after the reaction was initiated andthe apparatus exploded. </div>

<div class="description-paragraph">In Table I above, it is to be noted that With the parent that the most rapid reactions, giving rise to higher temperatures, give lower yields than the slower reactions. This phenomenon may be ascribed to the destruction of the product at Y higher temperaturesJ which is coniirmed by the large amounts of polymer and undistillable substances left on distilling the product. In general, the activation temperatures decrease withV increasing concentrations in glass, but in steel this eilect is not generally noticeable. It seems probable that the presence of iron lowers the activation temperatures in al1 cases since one rea action in glass showed a decrease of 18 C. (128 to" 110 C.) in the activation temperature when the reaction was carried out in the presence of iron wires. A decrease in activation temperature is also always accompanied by a decrease in the highest temperature and pressure attained in the reaction, so that iron may be said .to have a. </div>

<div class="description-paragraph">- tards it. This leads to the 4conclusion that the presence of CN- ion is believed to be necessary if the reaction is to proceed. The existence of this ion is indicated in the presence of bases and water. The absence of CN ion in the presence of acids, due to the repression or ionization of HCN may explain the negative eilect of acids. and the removal oi.' CN- ions due to formation oi complex ions of copper and CN- may explain the negative eiect of metallic copper. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The foregoing data. also show that the best yields yet attained with cyanohydrin as diluent were 80% and these were obtained in 20-25% solutions. These concentrations were optimum where no particular attempt was made to dissipate the heat of reaction from the apparatus. A concentration of 25%, therefore, may be exceeded where means jare provided to abstract rapidly the reaction heat. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Runs were carried out to investigate the eilect of recycling, using the reaction product from each run as a solvent for the next run without any intermediate treatment. In `two series of such runs, 20% solutions were reacted in a steel bomb. Three and two cycles were lrun so that the percentage composition of the mixtures was) substantially the same. The following data were It is apparent from an inspection of Table V that some substance present in the product exerts a marked effect in lowering the activation temperature. Hence, the maximum temperatures and pressures attained are decreased in reactions when the product i'rom one run is used withoutturther treatment as the solvent for the next run. Such conditions would be encountered in recycling. It should also be pointed out that in each successive run or cycle the reaction velocity becomes more rapid (about 100% faster each cycle) althoush the temperatures and pres- 'sures are lower. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The following pertinent facts concerning the reaction may be outlined: </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 1. The reaction is spontaneous and exothermic when the reactants are heated to a suitable activation temperature, that is, above 00 0. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 2. Once started. the reaction will proceed rapidly, depending upon dilution and it without heat dissipation, the temperature may rise above C. which is undesirable. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 3. Where the concentration oi' reactants is between 15% and 5,0%. in a suitable diluent. the reaction proceeds smoothly with sood yields. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">4. The entire desirable temperature range over which the reaction takes place is controllable by choice of reactant dilution and/or heat dissipation. </div>
