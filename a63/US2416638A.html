<div class="description-paragraph"> The outer end of shaft 10 for rotating valve 64 is supported in a plate ||1 which is secured by bolts to the cover ||8 of the gear case |64 and is also secured to the cap 9| on the hydraulic brake casing. Adjustable 'shoes ||i1a are provided for 'guiding the inner faces of chain IIIv adjacent the sprocket ||2.` Shoes ||8 are also III into the notches ||5 in arms ||3. An arm |2I|`is pivoted to the back of plate |I1, carries a roller I2| which engages a disk |22 which is fixed tothe shaft 10 and is engaged by a torsion spring |23 to press the roller I2| on arm |20 into notches |24 in disk |22 to prevent overthrow of the shaft 10 and arms ||3 when the studs |I4 pass out of the notches ||5 in arms ||3. The movement imparted to shaft 10 during a full cycle of movement of the arms 3 is sufficient to rotate theA ring valve 64 to completely cut off communication between exhaust ports 8| in the stationary valve member 63 and the pipe 61 and lock the liuid in the cylinders. Chain |0I, sprocket |02, pinion |06 and gear |08 exemplify speed-reducing gearing, operable from the drum shaft 24, for intermittently and automatically operating the ringvalve 64 for causinga gradual increase of the torque pressure in the hydraulic cylinders 46 produced by the pistons 4,1 in rotative succession, as the load descends, and to cut off the exhaust of fluid, when the load has dropped to, the predetermined point at which it is to vbe stopped. The outlet port 66in ring-,valve 64 terminates in a constricted portion 66, for more gradually cutting off the discharge of fluid, as the load nears the point Where it is to be stopped by the full closure of port 82, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> During the operation of the drum 25 in the direction necessary for lifting thel load, the rotor and the pistons carried thereby will be rotated in the reverse direction from that in which i `the drum is rotated when the load is dropped and automatic braking occurs, the rotor of the hydraulic brake mechanism will be driven inthe reverse direction with the drum, and no braking is desired. This reversalof the rotor will reverse i the circulation of fluid through ducts 8| and 11. Provision is-made for preventing the braking of the rotor by this reversed circulation. For this purpose, the fluid which is discharged from the cylinders into one of the ducts 11 in the stationary valve member 63 is by-passed from said ducts into one of the ducts 8 I through which fluid is drawn into the cylinders, by means of a loop of pipe |26. The ends of pipe |26 are connected to -the outer end ofthe valve housing 6|-communi- 6 catively with said ducts11. and 8|, respectively A check valve |28 is includedin the pipe=|26to prevent this by-pass of the iiuid during the'operation of the drum and'brake mechanism in lowering the load. lDuring this reverse operation of the rotor of the4 hydraulic brake mechanism, .the fluid will be freely circulated from the/cylinders via` ports .11, pipe |26 inA which check Avalve |28is included, a duct 8| .to the cylinders in rotative successionfso. that there will be no torque pressure in thebrakemechanism and it will be automatically. ineffective for braking during lifting operations of the drum, until the valve A64 is automatically rotated into its open` position to .permit the exhaust of fluid from cylinder 46.l </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The operation of the hydraulic braking mechanism will be as follows: Assuming the load .carried by the hoisting block 30 to have been raised, the cable will be wound on the drum 25. When the load is to be dropped, the current to the magnetic clutch 32, 33 will be cut oi and the drum 25 and the rotor of the hydraulic brake mechanism vwill be free to bedriven by the gravitation ofthev load on the block 30., The rotor-body of the, hydraulic brake mechanism willbe rotated in the direction of the arrow indicated in Fig. 5. gThe centrifugal force on the pistons 41 will tend to move them outwardly in the cylinders 46` and the rollers 54 will engage the eccentric tracks 55 on ring 50. The outward movement of the pistons will draw iiuidinto the cylinders in rotative succession through the-ports 48 in the .valve sleeve 42. During the inward movements of the pistons 41 in the cylinders 46 by the eccentricftracks 55, Vthe fluid in the cylinders will be forced outwardly therefrom `in rotative succession through ports 48 in the valve-sleeve 42 to produce a torque pressure in the cylinders against the pistons. When the ring valve r64 is in the position illustrated in Fig. 9, the maximum volume of hydraulic fluid will be drawn into cylinders 46 in rotative succession from the reservoir 58 via intake pipe 60, duct 65 in ring-valve 64, ducts 18, 11Jand 19, and the ports 48 in valve sleeve ,42, and an` equalvolume of fluid will be discharged from the cylinders in rotative succession by the inward movement of pistons 41 into the reservoir 58 via ports 48 in valve sleeve 42, ducts 82, 8| and 82a in stationary valve mem- 50 ber 63, ports 66 in valve 64, and pipe 61. The hydraulic brake mechanism will then produce no substantialbraking effect upon the drum and its load. This condition will continue until ringvalve 64 commencesto close to produce torque pressure in the cylinders 46 and against the pistons 41 and retard the sliding movement of the pistons and rotation of the rotor by the eccentric tracks 55. vWhen the chain which is continuously driven from the drum shaft 24, has been operated to move studs ||4, which are rcarried by said chain,into the recesses ||5 .in the outer ends of arms I3, thecontinued movement of Said studs around sprocket ||2 on shaft 10 will impart movement to said shaft andoperate the pinion 69 to rotate gear 1| on the valve-ring 64 to progressively close the duct 82a in stationary `valve member 63, and restrict the exhaust of iiuid from the cylinders, via ports 48'in valve sleeve 42, ducts 82, 8| and 82a in stationary valve member 63, duct 66, and pipe 61 to the reservoir .48. As port 82 is progressively closed by the valve-ring 64, the torque pressure inthe cylinders will be progressively increased until the exhaust of fluid is completely out off, 'and thenthe -75 duid-in ther cylinders in-which .the pistons have ment oi the fpistonsand. </div>
