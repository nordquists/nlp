<div class="description-paragraph">12 Claims: (Cl; 38'59) This invention relatesigenerally toeironingmachines and 'more particularly. to an ironing machine clutch assembly; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Ironers now in common use include a stationary shoe provided'with' heating elements and a rotatable roll mounted for controlled movement into and out of operatrve engagement with the shoe. For home use, the ironer must 'be capable of performingthe usual ironing operations, namely, pressing and ordinary ironing. An in-and-w out-ironing-operation is. also desirable under certaincir: cumstances. In pressing, the roll is maintained in anon: rotating positionagainstthe shoe for the required press? ing'periodr Inironing, the rollis moved against the shoe with-the roll rotating "and the material to be ironed is An in-and-out iron.- </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">tainswhich cannot be continuously moved"between the roll'and the shoe by-rotation of the roll'bec'ause ofithe bulk of-therufiles; The ironeriis thushoperatedin an in-andout-'ironing operation so that the roll automatically -moves backand forth against the shoe and rotates when against the shoe.- This invention provides'a clutch'assembly for an-ironer. which is capable of automatically" and selectively providing the above ironing operations; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Anobje'ct ofthis invention, therefore, is to provide an improved ironer clutch assembly. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> A-further object of this inventionis-to provide a clutch assembly'which includes,-as an integral part thereof, an actuating trigger so that the assembly can be checked for functional defects prior -to its assembly in the ironer. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Another object of this invention is to'provide' a clutch assembly having parts which'are efiicientlycastfrom powdered metal. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> A further object of this'inventionis to provide an ironing machine clutch assembly which is readily assembled in an ironing machine for adapting-the machine'for the desired ironing operations:- </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Another object of'this' invention is to provide a clutch assembly which is adapted to be installed'in either a single or a: double knee control ironing machine. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Yet another object of -this invention is to provide 'an ironing machine clutch assembly which is relatively simpleT-inconstruction, economical to produce andeflicient in operation in providing the desired ironing operations. </div>

<div class="description-paragraph"> Withreferenceto the drawing, the clutch assembly of this invention, indicated generally at 20, isvillustrated-in Fig. 2'inassembly relation with an ironing machine 21'. As best appears in Fig. 1, the machine 21 includes a main frame, only the table portion 22 of whichis illustrated, and a stationary shoe 23 provided with internal heating elements,*not shown, supported at what'will hereinafter be referred to as the front or operator side 24of the table 22..- Arranged centrally on the table 22fattherear side 26'thereof, is a housing 27, which rotatablysupportsza tube 28 (Fig; 2) extended lengthwise of the'table 22. At its ends, the tube 28 carriesa pair ofupwardly and for;- Wardly inclined arms 29 and 31 provided intermediate'their ends with bearings 32 and 33 which rotatablysupport stub shafts 34' and 3'yrespectively, carried byopposite endstof the ironer roll 37. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> An .electricmotor 38 (Fig.2) on one side of the housing 27 acts through a first gear train 39 to drive a gear 41 in housing 27, which in turn acts: throughxa selectively operable clutch mechanism 42 to drive a second gear train 43 connected to a shaft 44 extended axially ofethe tube'28. The shaft 44in turn drives a third gear train 46 located in the arm 31 and operable to drive the stub shaft 36 'fo'r rotating the roll 37! As best appears in Fig. 3, the gear 41idriven byathe motor operated gear train 39 is provided with a hub extena sion 4-7 and is rotatably supported on a shaft 48 carriedbyi the housing 27. Rotatably supportedon the'shaft 48t'at a position adjacent the' hub extension 47 -is anin regular shape body member 49 (Figs.,3 and 12) fornthe clutch assembly 20. Keyed to an end portion 51 of .the clutch body 49 remote from the hub extension .47 is a cam member 52 which cooperates with a .follower roller 53 (Fig. 7) to raise and lower a leaf spring arm 54 extended rearwardly from the tube 28. On rotation of the cam. 52 to a position in'which the enlarged portion 50' thereof engages the'follower 53, the arrn=54 acts to rotate the tube 28 in a counterclockwise direction as viewed in Fig. 7 to move the roll 37 downwardly into operative engagement with the shoe 23. Similarly, when the cam 52 is moved to a position in which the roller 53 is on the cam reduced portion 55, the arm 54 is lowered to rotate the tube 28 to provide for an upward movement of the roll 37 to an up position spaced from the shoe 23 and illustrated in Fig. l. The follower 53 is maintained in rolling engagement with the cam 52 by an encircling strap (not shown). </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The clutch assembly is operable to provide for move-- ment of the cam 52, by the driving gear 41, to a first stop position in which the reduced portion 55 of the cam engages the follower 53, a second stop position in which the enlarged portion 58 of the cam engages the follower, and to provide for continuous rotation of the cam. The assembly 20 includes the clutch body 49 which is of a generally tubular shape, having an axial bore 56 through which the shaft 48 extends. On its outer surface, the clutch body 49 (Fig. 12) is of a substantially stepped formation having the successively enlarged sections 57, 58 and 59 arranged inwardly of the reduced end portion 51, with the portion 59 being at the end 6012 of the body 49 adjacent the hub extension 47. At diametrically opposite portions thereof, the body 49 is provided with a pair of longitudinally extended channels 61 of a depth to extend through the sections 57, 58 and 59. Slideably positioned within the channels 61 are a pair of key elements 62 and 63, each of which is provided at its opposite ends with lateral projections 64 and 66 which, for convenience of description, will hereinafter be referred to as the head and tail key portions, respectively. The keys 62 and 63 are of a length (Figs. 3 and 6) such that when positioned in the channels 61 with the head portions 64 positioned outwardly of and adjacent to the inner ends of the channels 61, the tail portions 66 are within the opposite ends of the channels 61. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Positioned about the .body section 57 is a cam ring 67, integrally formed with a radially extended leg 68, having a lower half portion 69 corresponding substantially to the width of the body section 57. The upper half portion 71 is of a reduced width and constitutes slightly more than one-half of the ring 67 for a purpose to appear later. At one juncture of the portions 69 and 71, the cam ring 67 has a sharply inclined portion 72. At the other juncture of the portions 69 and 71, the ring 67 is provided with a gradually inclined cam surface 73. As will more clearly appear hereinafter, the cam ring portion 69 constitutes a cam means which acts to maintain the key heads 64 outwardly of the channels 61. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Rotatably mounted on the body section 58 is a trigger ring 74 (Fig. 12) of a width to extend about the cam ring 67 and provided with a first relatively deep peripherally extended cutout portion 76 through which the leg 68 extends. tend in opposite directions from the cutout 76, with one cutout terminating in an inclined surface 78 and the other in a straight surface 79 hereinafter referred to as the drop off surface. At diametrically opposite portions, substantially opposite the surfaces 78 and 79, the trigger ring 74 is provided with a pair of outwardly extended ears and 78. Each ear includes a. pair of rounded converged portions positioned on vertically opposite sides of an enlarged slot 88 which is undercut relative to the ear portions 75. A retainer disc is arranged on the body portion 51 against the section 57 to maintain the rings 67 and 74 on the body 49. A disc 98 has a pair of notches positioned opposite the channels 61. A sleeve on the portion 51 maintains the cam 52 and the disc 90 in a fixed spaced relation, with the cam 52 being press fit on the body portion 51 to maintain the disc 90 in a fixed position. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The leg 68 on the cam ring 67 extends upwardly through the cutout trigger ring portion 76 and is held in a A pair of narrower cutout portions 77 exfixed upright position by a first plate member 81 extended transversely of the ring 67 and secured by a bolt 82 to a portion of the housing 27 (Figs. 3, 5 and 6). A second plate 83 arranged above the plate 81 and similarly held in a fixed position by the bolt 82 carries a yoke shape spring plate 84 having a pair of curved leg portions 86 and 88 extended partially about the shaft 48 for the clutch assembly 20. The combined length of the legs 86 and 88 (Fig. 5) is such that the head 64 of one or the other of the keys 62 and 63 is always engaged by the plate 84 durirv rotation of the clutch assembly. Also, the terminal end 87 of the longer leg 88 is outwardly curved to provide for the gradual engagement thereof with a key 62 or 63 moving under the terminal end 87 for engagement with the leg 88. The plate 84 acts, therefore, to continuously urge one or the other of the keys 62 or 63 to a position projected outwardly of the end 60b of the clutch body 49. Whether a key is free to move in its channel 61 to such a projected position or not depends on the position of the trigger ring 74, as will more clearly appear hereinafter. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> As illustrated in Fig. 7, in the double knee control ironer a projection 91 on the upper end of a control rod 92 supported for vertical movement in a boss 93 on the housing 27, is positioned within the slot 80 in the ear 65 on one side of the trigger ring 74. The lower end of the rod 92 is connected through a link 94 to a knee pad (not shown) positioned beneath the ironer table 22 for convenient knee actuation by the ironer operator. A spring 96 extended between a portion 97 of the housing 27 and a retainer disc 98 on the link 94 normally maintains the trigger ring 74 in the position shown in Figs. 7 and 11. In this position (Fig. 11), the trigger ring 74 acts to hold the key 63 in a retracted position against the pressure of the spring plate 84 and the ring cut out portion 76 is arranged so that the end 89 thereof is positioned adjacent the cam ring leg 68. The half portion 69 of the cam ring 67 maintains the key 62 in a retracted position. For convenience of description, it is hereinafter assumed that the key 63 is adjacent the spring leg 88 and the key 62 adjacent the spring leg 86 in the up position of the roll 37 and vice versa in the down position of the roll 37 against the shoe 23. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> On movement by the operator of the knee pad for the control rod 92, the rod 92 is moved upwardly against the action of the spring 96 to rotate the trigger ring 74 in a clockwise direction as viewed in Fig. 7 to the position of the trigger ring shown in Fig. 10, in which the opposite end 99 of the cut out portion 76 is adjacent the cam ring leg 68. The shape of the ear 65 to provide the two rounded converging portions 75 facilitates such movement of the control rod 92 without any binding of the car 65 on the rod projection 91. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In the Fig. 10 position of the trigger ring 74, the drop off surface 79 has been moved behind or to one side of the key 63 so that the key 63 is opposite one cutout ring portion 77 and is thus free to move inwardly of its channel 61 to a projected position received in a notch 101 in the hub extension 47 for the driving gear 41. As a result, a driving connection is effected between the driving gear 41 and the cam 52, so that the cam 52 is rotated to move the ironer roll 37 relative to the stationary shoe 23. As long as the trigger ring 74 is maintained in this position illustrated in Fig. 10, every time a key 62 or 63 travels off the trigger ring 74- at the drop off surface 79, the leg 88 of the spring plate 84 acts to move the key into a cutout portion 77 of the trigger ring 74 to a position projected outwardly of the clutch body 49. Concurrently, the other key 62 or 63 is moved by the cam surface 73 on the cam ring 67 to a retracted position in its channel 61. This key is then maintained in a retracted position by the wide portions of the rings 67 and 74 until such key travels past the drop off surface 79. As prev ously described, the wide portions of the rings are of a size such that they are effective to engage only one of :azemreoe therkeys at one time. -Aseatresult,aas longeasrtheroperator maintains the trigger =ring "74 in the .Fig. :lOiposition, a drivinglconnectionfor the cam '52 is'provided. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When the operator releases the knee pad, the spring96 provides for a return of the control Irod 92 .to its-"down wardly movedyposition. illustrated in s Fig. '7 and aa conser-quent movement of the .triggerring 74in a counterclockwise direction to aposition in which the ring 74:iSIC- turnedto the., position'illustratedinFig. 11. In this-"position, the ring '74 operates to maintain a key 62 .or'r63 in a retracted position'after travel of the key off the wide ring portions. As aresult, both "keys 62 and aremaintained in retracted positions by the rings-.67 and r74.so thatthe rotation of-the cam "52-and the -1roll 37 is stopped. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">IIn this connection, assumethat-the cam 52 is inaposition.in whichthelowsideSS is against the follower '53 so that .the roll-37 is in an up positionspacedifrom-the .shoe .23 .as :shown .in .Fig. -1. When the operatorrmoves -'the control .rod 92 .upwardly and .quickly releases the .rod '92, by actuationofthe correspondingknee pad, the 'key .63 is moved'by'the spring plate leg .88 to-a projected pos'i'tionin which .the tail portion 66 thereof. is received Iin'a notch101'in the hub 47 to provide. forrotation of the clutch'body 49 in a .counterclockwise direction as viewed in Figs. 5 and'12 to a positionrin which theen- "ga'gedkey is move'dto a retracte'd position .by the cam surface73. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Asbest appears inFig. 12, thetinner sideso'f the. key heads '64arelformed'with angula'rly related surfaces- 60. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">These surfaces 60 are related-to the cam surface '73 on "the'camfring 67 such thata key "head '64 engages the "cam'surface 73! only ;at the juncture 60a of the surfaces "'60. During 'travelidf a key hea'd64 on the surface 73 whenthejuncture 60a reaches a 'pull out point interengagementof the key'63 with the'hub 47, the "rings "67 'an'd 74 actto prevent the key '62 frorhbein'g moved to a 'position' engagedwith the hub 47,"sinceon releaseofthe "control rod92 the trigger ring 74 is 'moved by-the'rod 92 'in" the direction ofrotation of the body 49. The key i62 does not reach the drop off surface '79' before the 'key a63're'achesthe pull out point on the cam surface73. 'As :a 'result,'the cam 52rotates only'180" to apoitionin which the high side 50 thereof engages the 'follower' 53 'so'zth'at Lthe Jroll'37 is moved against the shoe 23. To </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">:returntthe roll 37 "to an upposition, it is only necessary lorrepeat the above step 'of tripping the control rod 92. The engagement of the key 62With the hub 47 then ;provides .for'another 180 rotation'of the'ca-mt52. The arrangement of the end 105 of 'thespring plate 1eg 86 (Pig. 5) vadjacent:the-key 63 in-the down position of the .roll 37 positively prevents .any tendency of the cam 52 to rotate in an opposite direction under the-action of the .lfollower 53 (Fig. 7) to maintain the roller 37 against the .shoe 23. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It'is seen, therefore,that actuation of the control lever 92, which is located on one'side ofthe trigger'ring '74, controls the movement 'of'the roll 37 relative tothe -"shoe 23. A second control lever104 (Figs. 3,'4 a'nd '7) mounted on the opposite side of the "trigger ring 74'is operable to actuate'the clutch mechanism '42 (Fig.2) and .thus control rotation of theroll 37. </div>

<div class="description-paragraph"> In "the operation' of the double knee control 'irfo'ner '(Fig.7), assume that the ironer is in the inoperative'positio'n illustrated in Fig. 1 in which the roll isspace'd 'from 'the shoe 23. "In this position oflroll 37, the "arm :54 maintains the controllrod 104in'a d-epressed'p'ositionrin whi'ch the clutch gear 106 is disengagedirom'the driving gear "41 so Ithat'lthe troll 37 .is :not rotating. Assume Lfurthe'r 'ithat an ordinary ironing operation :is desired. .The operator exerts pressure on the knee ipad corre sponding to the control rod 92 to move the trigger :ring 74 from *.the': position shown in Fig. .11 \tothe position shown invFig. 10. This knee pressure is'then quickly :released to provide fora quick return, under'the action of the :spring '96, :of the trigger ring 74 toiits Fig. -11 :positi'o-n. :As previously described, .in response to such move'ment offthe -trigger ring 74, the-carn52 rotates to:a position :in which'the arm :54 is operated to move the roll 37 against the shoe 23. The arm 54 also releases the control rod 104 so that the spring 129 therefor moves the ironing operation is completed, the operator again actuates and quickly releases the knee pad corresponding to the control rod 92 so that the cam again rotates through an angle of 180 to return the roll 37 to its initial nonrotating position spaced from the shoe 23. In an ordinary ironing operation, no pressure is exerted on the knee pad corresponding to the control rod 104 since rotation of the roll 37 is desired and pressure on such knee pad is operable only to stop rotation of the roll 37. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Assume next that a pressing operation is desired. The knee pad for the control rod 104 is pressed to prevent rotation of the roll 37 and pressure on this knee pad is continuously maintained so that no driving force is pro vided for the roll 37. The material to be pressed is then placed against the shoe 23 and the other knee pad is pressed and quickly released, as described above, so that the roll 37 is moved against the shoe 23. When the roll 37 has been in this stationary position against the shoe 23 for the desired pressing period, the knee pad corresponding to the control rod 92 is again actuated to provide for a return movement of the roll to a position spaced from the shoe. This procedure is repeated until the desired pressing operation has been completed. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> When an in-and-out ironing operation is desired, for ironing rufiles on a curtain or the like, rotation of the roll 37 when against the shoe 23 is desired so the knee pad corresponding to the control rod 104 is never ac tuated. The operator exerts pressure on the knee pad corresponding to the control rod 92 so that the trigger ring 74 is moved to its position shown in Fig. 10. This pressure is maintained so that the cam 52 continues to rotate, with first one key 63 and then the other key 62 being moved to a projected position engaged with the hub extension 47. The roll 37 is thus continuously moved toward and away from the shoe 23. Concurrently with this roll movement, the rufiled material is manually adjusted by the operator during the times the roll 37 is spaced from the shoe 23 until the ironing operation has been completed, at which time the knee pad corresponding to the control rod 92 is manipulated to return the roll 37 to its initial up position. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> One of the main advantages of the clutch assembly 20 of this invention is that in addition to providing the desired operation of an ironer having a double knee control, the assembly 20 is also adapted for use in a single knee control ironer. As illustrated in Fig. 9, a pin 133, secured to and extended radially of a single upright control rod 132 corresponding to the control rod 104 illustrated in Fig. 7, is extended to a position within the slot 80 for the ear 70 on the trigger ring 74. The control rod 132 (Figs. 13, 14 and 15) has a recess 131 formed with a surface 134 inclined downwardly and inwardly of the control rod 132 for coaction with the end 127 of the clutch mechanism control bar 118. When the end 127 of the bar 118 projects fully into the recess 131 (Fig. 13), the clutch mechanism 42 is engaged, as previously described, and when the end 127 is moved outwardly of the recess 131 (Figs. 14 and 15), the clutch mechanism 42 is disengaged. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The control rod 132 is normally biased to an upper position (Fig. 13) by a spring (not shown) and is operable by a knee pad, which is also not shown, arranged beneath the table 22. In this position of the control rod 132, hereinafter referred to as an ironing position, the keys 62 and 63 are in retracted positions so that no drive is provided for the cam 52. In other words, if the cam 52 8 is in a position in which the roll 37 is rotating and is against the shoe 23, this position of the roll is maintained with the control rod 132 in the position illustrated in Fig; 13. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> On actuation of the knee pad, the control rod 132 is movable downwardly to an intermediate or press position in which the end 127 of the clutch actuating bar 118 is moved by the inclined recess surface 134 outwardly of the recess 131 a distance providing for a disengagement of the clutch mechanism 42. Such movement of the control rod 132 moves the pin 133 downwardly to in turn provide for a clockwise rotation of the trigger ring 74, as viewed in Figs. 13 and 14. However, such movement of the trigger ring 74 does not affect the position of the roll 37 since the drop off surface 79 remains ahead of the key 62 and the trigger ring 74 maintains the key 62 in a retracted position. The press position of the control rod 132 corresponds to a position to which the rod 132 is depressed by the arm 54 each time the roll 37 is moved to its up position by rotation of the cam 52 to a position in which the low side 50 thereof engages the follower 53. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> On actuation of the knee pad to further move the rod 132 in a downward direction to a lower position, hereinafter described as the trip position, the end 127 of the bar 118 is moved entirely out of the recess 131. Such movement of the bar 118, however, has no effect on the roll 37 since the clutch mechanism 42 is maintained in a disengaged position so that the roll 37 does not rotate. On the other hand, the trigger ring is further rotated in a clockwise direction to a position (Fig. 15) in which the drop off surface 79 is behind the key 62, so that the key 62, under the action of the spring leg 88, is moved to an extended position to provide for rotation of the cam 52. If the knee pad is then quickly released, the cam 52 rotates 180 to change the position of the roll 37 relative to the shoe 23. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In the operation of an ironer having a single knee control rod 132, assume that the roll 37 is in an up position spaced from the shoe 23. In this position of the roll 37, the arm 54 maintains the control rod 132 in a press position (Fig. 14) in which the clutch actuating bar 118 disengages the clutch mechanism 42. Also, in this position of the roll, the key 63 is in the position illustrated for the key 62 in Fig. 14. Assume further that an ordinary ironing operation is desired. The knee pad for the control rod 132 is actuated to move the rod 132 downwardly to the trip position (Fig. 15) in which the key 63 is moved inwardly to an engaged position with the hub 47 to provide for rotation of the cam 52. The knee pad is then quickly released to provide for return of the rod 132 to the ironing position and limit rotation of the cam 52 to 180. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The roll 37 is thus moved against the shoe 23 and rotated since the end 127 of the bar 118 is within the recess 131. When the ironing operation is to be terminated, the control rod 132 is again moved to its trip position (Fig. 15) and released to provide for the return of the roll 37 to its non-rotating up position. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> If a pressing operation is desired, the control rod 132 is first moved to its trip position (Fig. 15 and then released for movement only to the intermediate press position. For this manipulation of the control rod 132, the trigger ring 74 is actuated to provide for a 180 rotation of the cam 52 to move the roll 37 against the shoe 23. However, the bar 118 is maintained in a position out of the recess 131 (Fig. 14) so that no rotation of the roll 37 is provided. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It can thus be seen that the clutch assembly 20 is readily assembled with a single knee control rod 132 to provide for ironer operation in response to movement of the rod 132 between three predetermined positions. With the single knee control rod 132 the ironer is capable of the usual ironing and pressing operations. An </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 9 in-and-out ironing operation-cannot be accomplished with the single knee control rod 132. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> From the above description, it is seen that this invention provides an ironing machine clutch assembly 20 which is readily operable in conjunction with the clutch mechanism 42 which controls rotation of the roll 37 to provide the desired ironing operations. The cam and trigger rings 67 and 74, respectively, are readily and aceurately cast of powdered metal within the required tolerance limits to thus eliminate the precise machining operations normally required in the construction of clutch assemblies. Furthermore, by virtue of the movement of the rings 67 and 74 in planes perpendicular to the plane of the shaft 48, the tolerance buildups of the elements extended longitudinally of the shaft 48 are not enlarged by the tolerances permitted on the rings 67 and 74. As a result, greater tolerance latitude is permitted in the construction of the parts on the shaft 48. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> By virtue of the unit construction of the assembly 2b, as it appears in Figs. 6 and 8 in assembly with the gear 41, the assembly 20 is readily checked for proper operation prior to its assembly in an ironing machine, thus eliminating the necessity for removing a defective clutch assembly 20 from a finished machine. Further, since the trigger ring 74 is initially formed with the two oppositely extended ears 65 and 70, it is readily assembled in either a double knee control machine (Fig. 7) or a single knee control machine (Fig. 9). </div>
