<div class="description-paragraph">meet'all of the above requirements and is adapted for use with a partition or wall formed from panels.- It is, therefore, an object of this invention to disclose a structural beam used inthe construction of panel type partitions. It is va 'further object of this vinvention to disclose a structural beam ywhich isadjustable to variationsin the panel thickness. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> l Still another object of thisl invention is a structural l ;.beam which is a severablexftwo. p iece unit having one4 piece orcolumn which can be erectedas a panel stop and locator before installation vof the second or locking section. A further'r object is to disclose a structural beam for t g Suse with partitions which can be erected withoutthe use A- still'further object of this invention is todisclose a structural beam which covers minor damages that may occur to the edges of the panels. </div>

The structural beam 10 is .anchored into position by an anchor assembly such as 60 (FIG. 3). The columnsll and 12 are adapted to position, support and, in effect, j oin togetherthe side edges .of panels such as 13 and.13a. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">`[ Referring specifically to FIG. l, the structural beam assembly is designated generally as 10. The structural beam assembly 410 is composed of separable columns 11 and 12, normally aluminum extrusions. </div>

<div class="description-paragraph">thereto. times that of the inward extensions. The inward extenportion of legs 31and 32 to fit telescopically between legs When columns 11 and 12 are telescopically intertted, they offer a flush surfaceto the edges of panels 13 and'13a due to the. fact that legs 31 and 32 are offset Flanges 33 and 3 4 are secured tothe respective offset legs 3l'and 32. The flanges 33 and 34 yare disposed transversely orv normally with respect to the legs 31 and 32, extending-both inwardly and Joutwardly with respect The outward extensionsv are approximately four sions of the flanges in combination with the cross tie 35 and portions of legs 31 and 32 together form a channel l30 for purposes hereinafter to be described. 33 has a finished surface which is presented to the viewer The flange and an oppositesurface which contains an undercut keyway 39..the purpose of which will be explained hereinafter.

The ribs 36 and 37 are spaced l apart a sufficient distance to allow the narrow dimension l of a rectangular nut 16 to pass therebetween.- The purpose of the ribs 36 and 37 is to act as a stop means for the nut 16. The nut 16 is passed through the space between the ribs36 and 37 widthwise and rotated, making the greater dimension of the-nut 16 assume a crosswise position with respect to the ribs. The length of the nut is Such that the ribs win limit its rotation. Thereafter, j </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">the ribs act as stop members, preventing the withdrawal of the nut 16. Thus, when a fastener 15 is inserted through the aperture 59 in ferrule 28, and a nut 16 v threaded'thereupon is passed widthwise between the ribs 36 and'37, turning of the fastener 15 will cause the nut j to assume acrosswise position andthe columns v11 and 12 can be drawn into telescoping relationship. </div>
