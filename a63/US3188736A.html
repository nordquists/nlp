<div class="description-paragraph"> At its forward enlarged end, the spindle 27 is provided with a rectangular structure 31 defining a generally rectangular central opening 32 that limits the lateral range of adjustment of presettable tool spindles adjustably carried by the head structure 31. As shown in FIGS. l andV 2, a plurality of tool spindles, such aspthe spindle 34, are respectively journalled at the inner ends of laterally extending spindle holders or support arms 36 to 45, inclusive. The three spindle holders 45, 36 and 37 extend laterally inward through a clamping mechanism generally ydefined by a slot 47 formed toward the lower portion of the rectangular supporting structure 31. In a similar manner, the spindle holders 38, 39 extend laterally through anexpansible clamping slot 4S; spindle holders 40, 41 and 42 extend laterally Vupward through a clamping slot 49; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Y 4 tionship to the spindle head 27 With the spindles positioned as represented in FIG.`1, the head 27 may be moved horizontally to drill a symmetrical pattern of holes as determined by the laterally adjusted position of the spindle holders. The selected fhome positions of the spindle represented in FIG. l corresponds to the spacing of tool storage sockets 59 formedin an empty tool storage magazine section 60. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Each of the storage sockets S9 in the storage magazine section 60 comprises a horizontally bored opening disposed in axial parallelism with-a corresponding one of the tool spindles, whenever the spindles are yclamped in Y home position within the spindle head structure 31. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Each of the storage'sockets is provided with a resilient detent mechanism adapted to resiliently engage a tool deposited therein. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">' As'sliown in FIG. 1,`the tool storage sockets 59 presented by the empty vmagazine section 60 are horizontally valigned Ywith corresponding, separate tool grips or tool changers 62 carried in horizontally spaced relationship by a multiple tool changing mechanism 63. Both the storageY sockets 59 as well as the tool change grips 62 i are arranged in -two (2) ltiers or rows, with five of them and, spindle holders 43 and 44 extend laterally through a clamping slot 50. In all cases, lthe slots 48, 49 and 50j in .eachrow. The multiple tool change mechanism 63 is slidably supported for longitudinal movement by horizontallydisposed way surfaces 64 and 65 'formed on the upper face of a'l'ongitudinally extending base lor frame 67. Thus, the toolchange mechanism A63 is longitudinally movable .along the way 64, 65 fromthe position in alignment with the empty storage section 60 into a position in correspondingly spaced aligned relationship to the head structure 31, with the spindles clamped in home positions. p </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> To accomplish this, a hydraulic'piston 69 carried by the baseV 67 is provided with .a reciprocable piston rod 70 se'curedat its opposite end tol they base of the tool change mechanism 63. Selective operation of the piston Y 69 ,effects movement of the tool change mechanism 63 from clamped engagement withy the spindley supporting holders 36 to 45 respectively. After the spindle holders have been unclamped, the tool spindles carriedv thereby may be Vrepositioned within the rectangular opening 32 for drilling a diiferent, predetermined pattern of holes. As </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">soon as the spindles, such ,as the spindle V34, have beenv from its solid line position indicated at A in FIG. 1 to a tool change position indicated by the phantom lines at B. Whenever the spindle head isoperated to effect a multiple machining operation, the tool change mechanism 63 is retained in the Aposition in a manner that aworkpiece (not shown) may be moved into the B position for a required multiple machining operation. Thu`s,`the tool fchange mechanism V63 isrmoved to the A position out of the vworking area directly in frontof the tool spindle headl 27 during machining operations. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">head 27 along the ways 22 and 23, it will be readily apparent that actuation of the feed drivingmotor28 is operative toV eifect corresponding bodily movement of the tool spindles for effecting Va multiple machining operation. During a machining'operation, as shown in FIGS.V1 and 3, a spindle drive motor 54- is operatively connected toV drive Y a variable speed. transmission mechanismVV (not shown), the latter in turn beingconnected to drive a common output shaft 55. The common drive shaft ing frame 31. The variablemspeed transmission may be ofy any well-known type, and, as is well known in the art, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">` In somevinstances it may bey advantageous to advance workpieces successively along the Iways. 64 `and 65 into the operating station :directly in front of the spindle head 27.

<div class="description-paragraph"> As illustrated in'FIG.`l,the tool spindles have all been laterally moved to their respective home positions and the respective spindle holders 36 to 45, inclusive, Vurged into clamping engagement with the spindle head structure 31 to facilitate an interchange of tools withan indexable tool storage magazine 53 carried in spaced apartV relain FIGS. 1 and A11. VInV addition to .the empty tool storage section 60, Vseven Vother tool storage sections are secured in identical spaced apart relationship to the upper face ofthe 'octagonal plate 77. Each of these storage sectionsis provided with separate sets of ten tool storage sockets, such as t-he socket in storage section 81. As </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">ywill hereinafter be more fully explained, power operable means are connected to effect selective indexable advancement of the support VVplate 77 for positioning a selected oneY of theV storage sections in a position for effecting a tool interchange. Alatch mechanism is provided to retain the selected storage magazine section in proper Valignment with the tool change mechanism 63. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> As shown in FIGS. 1, 4 `and 5, the' tool change mechanism 63 comprises essentially a supporting base 86 that isslidably carried by the ways 64'and 65 `for selective longitudinal movement. The base 86,y in turn, is pro-V vided with spaced apart upwardly extending sides presenting ways that slidably engage laterally extending, complementary ways 88 and S9 integrally formed with ya transversely movable tool change support 90. A hydraulic cylinder 92 secured to the tool change support base S6 by means of a bracket 93 is provided with a reciprocable piston rod 94 threadedly engaging the transversely movable tool change support 90. Selective actuation of the cylinder 92 operates to advance the tool change support 9d from its retracted position, shown in FIGS. l and 5, either to a forward position relative to one of the storage magazine sections, or the tool spindles carried by the spindle head 27. In FIG. 4, the movable tool change support 90 is represented as being moved forwardly relative to its base 86 in a manner that the individual tool change grip 62 are in encompassing relationship to the tools respectively carried by the tool spindles. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> To effect an interchange of complete sets of tools between the tool spindles carried yby the head 27 and the storage magazine 58, the tool spindles are initially moved from their previously preset positions -to the home position illustrated in FIG. l. At this moment, an empty storage section, such as 60, carried by the magazine 58 is in front of the tool change mechanism 63. Likewise, at this moment, rotational movement of the spindles is stopped and the tool change support 9i? is in retracted position relative to the movable tool change support base Se which is retained in parked position as indicated at A With these conditions existing, .the hydraulic cylinder 69 is actuated to effect bodily longitudinal movement of the tool change mechanism 63 along the ways 64 and 65 into a position in which the tool grips 62 are aligned with corresponding ones of `the tool spindles. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">- Next, the cylinder 92 is actuated Ito advance the movable support 9@ relative to the base 86 -in a manner that the individual tool grips d2 encompass the tools carried by the corresponding spindles. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> As shown in FIG. 4, the movable tool change support 9@ is represented as being advanced to a position in which the upper tier of tive individual tool change grips 62 encompass the corresponding tools carried by the upper tier of tool spindles. It will be -apparent that the lower tier ot' tive individual tool grips likewise are positioned yto encompass the tools carried by the lower tier of tool spindles. As will hereinafter be more fully explained, the individual tool grips are then actuated to release corresponding tools from the tool spindles and securely clamp the individual tools during the simultaneous tool interchange. After this, the cylinder 92 is again actuated to retract the movable support 90 and individual tool grpis d2 for withdrawing the tools from the spindles. As Soon as the movable support 9tl`is fully retracted, `the cylinder 69, FIG. 1, is again actuated to eiect bodily movement of the tool change mechanism 63 to the A position. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Next, cylinder 92 is actuated to urge the support 9@ outwardly for effecting simultaneous insertion of the tools f now carried by the grip 62 into the sockets 59 presented by the empty magazine seotion di). With the original set of tool-s now deposited in the storage section 60, the movaule support 90 is again retracted, and the support plate 7'7 indexed to position the next selected set of tools in ront of the retracted tool grips. As soon as this occurs, the support 90 is advanced to secure the selected set of tools, after which it is again retracted to withdraw the tools from the storage section, and the entire tool change mechanism 63 moved longitudinally to the B position. Cylinder 92 is again actuated to effect movement of the tool change support 90 in a manner that the selected set of tools are inserted and secured in the now empty tool spindles. After this, the support 90 is again retracted, 4and the entire tool change mechanism 63 returned to the parked position A, with the individual tool grips aligned with the empty storage sockets of the empty storage section. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> As will hereinafter be more fully explained, a control circuit is operatively connected to effect the proper sequential operation of the tool change mechanism 63 in coordinated relationship with the individual tool grips 62, and the tool storage magazine 5S. A principal advantage ot this invention is the fact that once the tool spindles have been moved to home position, complete sets of tools can be interchanged automatically in preparation for the next multiple machining operation. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> During a multiple machining operation, each of the tten tool spindles is rotatably driven by the spindle drive motor 54, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 3, irrespective of the laterally adjusted position of each spindle relative to the rectangular head structure 31. lnasmuch as the drive .to all ot :the tool spindles is identical, only the driving connection to the spindle 34 will be described in detail. As shown in FIG. 3, the spindle 34 is rotatably journalled in sleeve bearings 97 and 93 respectively carried Within concentrically disposed bored openings formed toward the inner end of the spindle support arm 36. A ilanged shoulder formed toward the tool carrying end of the spindle 34 is seated against an antifriction thrust bearing W. At its opposite end, a pair of lock nuts 102 engage a threaded portion of the spindle 34 to retain i-t in its rotatable operating position relative to the support arm 3o. The extreme inner end of the spindle 34 is of reduced diameter and is pinned :to a connector 163 connected by means of a universal joint to one end 104 of a telescoping power transmitting shaft 105. On the opposite end of the telescoping shaft llS is connected by means of a universal joint 106 to a stub shaft 107 journalled in a power distributor lilla. The power distributor ti is provided with gearing (not shown) connected to be driven by the input drive shaft 55 and operable in well known manner to transmit driving pow-er to a plurality of stub shafts, such as the rotatable stub shaft 107, respectively connected to drive all of the tool spindles. The telescoping shaft M5 comprises a splined shaft 105A having slidable meshing engagement with an internally splined tubular sleeve MdB. Thus, irrespective of the laterally adjusted position of the spindle support arm 36 relative to the supporting fram-e 3l, the telescoping shaft tlS is operatively connected to transmit driving power to the tool spindle 34. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> At its forward end, the tool spindle 34 is provided with an expansible tool receiving collet 112 having axial slots (not shown) to provide resilient jaws, and a circular socket 113 adapted to receive the circular shank of a toolholder lil-f. The toolhclder 1M may be of any wellknown type. As represented in 3, the toolholder 11d is provided with a tapered bored opening adapted to receive the complementary tapered shank of a metal cutting tool 2.15. Prior to insertion in either the sockets presented by the tool storage magazine 58, FIG. l, or one or another of the tool spindles, a tool is mounted for subsequent use in a tool'nolder, such as the toolholdcr Sift-fr in FIG. 3. Thus, during a tool change, both the toolholder il@ and tool carried thereby are interchanged between the storage magazine and a tool spindle. Lt is, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">understood, however, that this invention is not limited to interchanging toolholders. It is merely necessary that a tool to be interchanged be provided with a shank adapted to be removably inserted into the circular Socket 113 presented by the spring collet H2. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> To retain a tool in the spindle 34, there is provided an axially slidable clamp ring 127, FG. 3. Movement of the clamp ring lll axially along the tapered shank of the collet to its outermost position, as shown in FIG. 3, effects inward movement of the resiliently expansible collet jaws into tight gripping engagement with the periphery of the toolholder M4. Prior to removal of a tool and its associated toolholder, the fric-tion ring 11.17V </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">an adjusting collar,118 threaded on the outer endof the tool spindle 34. Movement of the clamp ring into abutting engagement with the adju-sting collar 118 permits arranged to carry axially'movable spindle support clamps 125 and 126 respectively. The clamp 125 constitutes a stationary or pivotr clamp, and the clamp 126 constitutes a laterally movable clamp. The axially movable clamp elements 125 and 126 operate bothto clamp the spindle support arm 36 in selective laterally adjusted position, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">and when released, to engage the slot 130 for guiding the support arm 36 for subsequent repositioning of the IJtool spindle`34. To accomplish this, the pivot clamp element 125 is carried for only ,axial movement and the movable clamp 126 is carried for both axial movement and bodily lateral movement. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The pivotr clamp 125 is provided at one end with a flanged head 127 carried for axial movement within a complementary rece-ss 128 formed in the outer transverse web 121. As shown in FIGS. 2 and'3, the circular shank of the pivot clamp 125 extends through a longitudinally extending slot 130 formed in the spindle support arm 36. The pivot clamp 125 extends through a circularbored opening 131 formed in the transverse web 120 in concentric relationship rto the recess 128 formed in the web 121. Concentric disks comprising a Belleville springr132 encircle the leftward end ofthe pivot clamp 125 between a thrust washer 133 anda thrust washer 134 secured to the leftward end of the pivot clamp 125 by means of a cap screw 135. The pivot clamp cap screw 135 is axially aligned with a clamp release piston rod 138 carried by a cylinder 139, the latter being secured to an inner Vside wall of the spindle headY 27. Y, f </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Whenever the support arm 36 is xedly clamped to the spindle head, the cylinder 1-39 is deactuatedV and the pivot clamp :125 urged leftwardly by means of the force exerted by the Belleville spring 132. As this occurs, the anged end 127 of the pivot clamp 125 is urged inwardly into clamping engagement with the outer faces Vof the slotted support arm 36, the inner Vfaces of which are then urged into abutting clamping engagement with theV way surface 141 presented by .theV transverse web 120. clamp 125is released by activatingthe Vhydraulic cylinder 139, thereby effec-ting outward movement of the piston rod 138 to compress the Belleville springs 1-32 between the thrust washers `133 and 134. Thereupon, the flanged Ihead 127 off-the pivot clamp 1125 is moved slightly in an axial direction to permit lateral movement ofthe spindle support arm 36, providing clamp 126 is also released. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">`At one end, lthe movable clamp element 126 is pro- 8. clamp element 125 in a manner to engage the slot 130 formed in the supportarm 36. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">, In a similar manner, the outer periphery of the spacer sleeve 151 engages a slot 154 formed in -ajbodily movable bridge clamp 160. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> As schematically shown in FIG. 9, the bridge clamp 160 is provided with iianged ends respectively engaged by Belleville springs 163 and 164. The Belleville springs are lseated at Vtheir opposite ends against the side face of the transverse web 120 integrally formed with the rectangular spindle head supporting structure 31. 'I'he movable clamp 126' lfor the' central spindle .support arm 36, extends through 4broth :the slot 154 formed in the bridge clamp `160 and the slot I153 formed in the transverse column web 120, as well as ythe slot 152* presented by the floating clamp 165. Likewise, the spacer sleeve 149 carried by the central portion of the movable clamp element 126 engages the slot I113i) formed in the movable spindle support arm 36. As'shown in FIGQS, the flanged shoulder of the spacer sleeve 147 directly engages a slot presented by a slotted way strip V166 secured directlytoa side face of the oating clamp 165.Y A-s shown 'infF1G. '3, the slot' presented by way strip 166 is slightly narrower in width than the slot 152 presented by the loating clamp 165 in a manner Ithat the anged shoulders of the spacer sleeve 147 directly engage the surfaceof therk slotted clamp'way strip 166. Whenever thev spindle support arm 36 is retained in clamping engagement with the spindle'head structure 31, the springs 1'63and 164","FIG..9,` urge' the bridge clamp 166 in a direction to effect corresponding axial'movement of the movable clamp "element 126 bringing the flanged shoulders of the spacer sleeve 147 into clamping Vengagemen-t with-the slotted way strip 166. As this occurs, the entire floating clamp 165 is moved in a direction to force the support .arm 36 into tight clamping engagement with the way surface 141 presented by the transverse web 120. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> To release the clamp element 126 for permitting lateral adjustment of the spindle support arm 36, there are pro- Vvided a pair "of spaced apart clamp release cylinders v170 and 171, shown in FIG'. 9; Selective actuation of the Y cylinders 170-and'171` eiects movement of pistons 172 The pivot Y and 1713 which operate to urge -pistonrods 174 and 175 ina direction to compress Belleville springs n164 and 163. </div>

The opposite end of the spacer sleeve 149 abuts the inner race ofa bearing 1F50, which is retained in engagement with one end of a tubular spacer sleeve 151. :By means of this arrangement, the louter races of the :antifriction bearings 148 and 150 are retained in guiding engagement with transverse slots l152 and 153 respectively formed in aV oating clamp 165 and the transverse web 120.

<div class="description-paragraph">VThe spindle Vsupport arm 45 is clamped to the supporting head 31 at a second spaced position along its length by means of a stationary pivot clamp 187 responsive to a vBelleville spring 188. lFor compressing the Belleville Spring 188to release the stationary pivot clamp 1'87, there is provided an associated hydraulic cylinder 189. Both the stationary pivot clamp 187 and the movable pivot clamp y178 are disposed to engage a guide slot 19d formed in the movable support arm 15, as shown in FIG. 2. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> As shown in FIG. 2 and schematically represented in FIG. 9, each of the spindle support arms 45, 56 and 37 are provided with a stationary pivot clamp and a laterally movable pivot clamp. In order to eiiect selective lateral adjustment of one or another of these spindle support arms, it is necessary to simultaneously release both the stationary pivot clamp and the associated laterally movable pivot clamp. As this is done, it will be apparent that one or another of the spindles may be moved laterally with respect to the rectangular opening 32 represented by the :supporting structure 31. The distance of lateral spindle movement is determined by the length of the guiding slot in the arm and the spaced apart stationary and movable pivot clamps. For example, in the event both clamps 125, 126, FIG. 2, are released, the spindle 34 may be moved radially inward until the stationary pivot clamp 125 engages the outer end of the associated guiding slot 131i. As this is done, the spindle 54 may be moved in an arcuate path with the stationary pivot clamp 125 constituting the pivot axis, irrespective of the position of the pivot clamp 125 along the guiding slot 13b. During arcuate movement of the spindle 3d about a. pivot axis determined by the stationary pivot clamp 125, it will be readily apparent that the movable guide clamp 126 is moved laterally with respect to the guide slots 153, 152 formed in the transverse web 129 and the tloating clamp 165. After the spindle 34 has been laterally repositioned within the rectangular opening 32, both the stationary pivot clamp 125 and movable guide clamp 126 are reengaged to xedly clamp the tool spindle 34 in its next selected position. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> As shown in FIG. 2, the spindle support arms 35 to ed, inclusive, are respectively provided with guide slots each y of which is engaged by a stationary pivot clamp and a laterally movable pivot clamp. Separate bridge clamps (not shown) are respectively provided to actuate the movable clamps associated with spindle support arms 33 and 39; for spindle support arms 40, 41 and d2; and, for spindle support arms 43 and 44. The arrangement for clamping and releasing the spindle support arms S to 44, inclusive, is identical to the clamping and clamp actuating structure fully described with respect to the spindle support arms 45, 36 and 37. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> As shown in FIG. 2, the spindle support arms 36 to 45 inclusive are laterally adjusted and clamped to position the associated tool spindles as may be required for a particular multiple machining operation. Prior to initiating a multiple tool change, it is necessary that the support arms 36 to 45 inclusive be repositioned in a manner that the tool spindles are returned to their home positions as :shown in FG. l. As hereinbefore explained, the tool spindles in home position correspond to the spacing of the empty tool storage sockets 59 and the tool storage section 66 as well as the bodily retracted tool grips, such as 62 carried by the multiple tool change mechanism 63. To return the spindle support arms from the position shown in FIG. 2 to the home positions indicated in FIG. 1, the stationary pivot clamps and movable pivot clamps respectively associated therewith are released. After this, the spindles are bodily moved in a lateral direction to home position and the pivot clamps are reengaged to retain the tool spindles in that position for a subsequent tool changing operation. Positioning of the tool spindles in home position may be accomplished by means of a template (not shown). Likewise, a return movement or the tool spindles to home position may be etected by operation of a spindle positioning mechanism such as that disclosed in copending patent application Serial No. 66,067 entitled Automatic Multiple Spindle Machine Tool, led October 3l, 1960, by Wallace E. Brainard. In either case, the multiple tool spindles are xedly clamped to the spindle supporting structure 31, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">and the spindle head 27 is retracted in response to motor 23 to establish the conditions necessary for subsequent tool interchange. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> During a tool interchange, as hereinbefore explained with reference to FIGS. 1 and 5, the hydraulic cylinder 69 is operative to ellect bodily movement of the entire tool change mechanism 63 along the ways 64 and 65. Thus, the cylinder 69 is operative to position the tool change mechanism either in the A position in front of one or another of the tool storage magazine sections, or in the B position directly in front of the spindle head 27. The smaller cylinder 92 operates to effect transverse movement of the movable multiple tool change support 99. During transverse movement of the .support 90, the cylinder 92 is likewise operative to position the ten individual tool changers or grips, such as the tool changer 62, into proper position for clamping or releasing a tool carried thereby. inasmuch as the ten individual tool change grips function in an identical manner, it is deemed necessary to describe the operation of only one of them in detail. As shown in FIG. 5, the tool change grip 62 is actuated by a hydraulic piston 194 slidably carried within a sleeve cylinder 195 secured Within an enlarged bored opening 192 in the movable tool change support 9d. The piston 194 is integrally formed toward the central portion of an actuating piston rod 196 supported for selective axial movement within 'spaced apart, tubular centering sleves 197 and 198. The centering sleeve 197 is carried for a limited axial movement within a bored opening 199 that is slightly smaller in diameter than the concentrically formed bored opening 192 supporting the stationary sleeve cylinder 195. The centering sleeve 19S is carried for limited axial movement within a tubular spacer sleeve 206 that is retained rightwardly of the sleeve cylinder 195 in the enlarged bored opening 102 by means of a bracket 202 lixedly secured to the front face of the tool change support 91B. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> By means of this arrangement, it will be apparent that the piston 194i and actuating piston rod 196 are carried for selective movement to one of three operating positions. With pressure duid admitted via hydraulic line 2114, the piston 194 is moved leftwardly as shown in FIG. 5. Whenever line 294 is connected to exhaust and pressure fluid transmitted via line 295, the piston 194 is moved rightwardly in abutting engagement with the end of the centering sleeve 198. To center the piston 194 within its cooperating cylinder 195, both lines 204 and 205 are connected to exhaust and pressure iluid simultaneously admitted to hydraulic lines 206 and 297. As this occurs, the inner ends of both centering sleeves 197 and 19S are moved into abutting engagement with the inwardly extending opposite ends of the sleeve cylinder 195 in a manner to forceably retain the piston 194 in its centered position. The actuating piston 194 is disposed to cooperate with the hydraulic cylinder 92 in a manner to actuate the tool change grip 62 during a tool changing operation. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> ln addition to limiting the extent of axial movement of the sleeve 198, the bracket 2G12 secured to the front face of the movable tool change support S6 constitutes the principal support for the tool change grip 62. To this end, the bracket 2192 is integrally formed with a forwardly extending tubular support sleeve 211. At its forward end, the tubular support sleeve 211 is provided with a portion of reduced thickness, having three spaced apart axial slots to form three arcuate cam latches 212, 213 and 21d as shown in FIGS. 6 and 7B. The outer ends of the cam latches 212, 213 and 214 are resiliently movable in a radial direction. Three actuating cam levers 216, 217 and 213 are carried for pivotable movement within the three spaced apart slots formed toward the forward end of the tubular support 211 between the arcuate cam latches 212, 213 and 214,. Toward their rearward ends, the cam levers 216, 217 and 21S are pivotably carried by pins 219, 221D and 221 secured at the opposite sides of the 1 1` respective slots to enlarge portions"216a, 2171i and'218a of the support sleeve 211. As shown in FIGS. 7A and 7B, the forward outer ends ofthe cam levers are carried for radial movement with respect to their axes determined by pins 219, 220 and 221. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> To effect inward clamping movement of the carri latches 212, 213 and 214, transversely extending actuating pins 223, 224 and 225 are secured to the central portions of the cam levers. It will .be apparent that inward pivotable movement of the outer end of cam lever 216 urges the actuating pin 223 into engagement with the arcuate cam latches 213 and 214 to urge these'latches inwardly at an appropriate time during the tool change cycle. To'eifect the appropriate clamping and unclamping movements of the cam latches, the cam levers 216, 217 and 218 are forceably actuated in synchronism by means of an actuating sleeve 228 slidably supported for a limited axial movement by the stationary inner support'sleeve 211. VToward its rearward end, as shown in FIGS. 5 and 7C, the actuating sleeve 228 is secured to the outer'end of the axiallyk movable piston rod 196 by means of a pin 229. The pin 229 extends through axially extending, diametrically opposed slots 239 and 231 respectively formed in the peripheral wall of the inner support sleeve 211. To support the actuating sleeve 228 for concentric Vaxial movement, a sleeve bearing 234 is iixedly securedto the inner central peripheral wall of the sleeve to slidably engage the central stationary support sleeve 211. It will bek apparent'that movement of the piston 194 from its retracted leftward position shown in FIG. 6 to its neutral or rightward forward position will effect a corresponding movement of the actuating sleeve 228. During rightward movement of the actuating sleeve 228, a protective bellows 239Y interconnected between the bracket 202 and sleeve 228 to constitute a protective enclosure is expanded. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Inasmuch' as the support sleeve 211 is immovably secured to the front face of the tool change support 86, v </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">selective movement of 'the actuating-sleeve 228 operates to effect therrequired simultaneous pivotable movement of the actuating cam levers 216, 217 and 218.V VTo accomplish this, the cam leversV are respectively providedrwith radially extending cam arms 236, V237 and 238'which, in turn, are4 respectively disposed to engage peripherally spaced, axially extending slots 241, 242 aud243a formedV in the' outer actuating sleeve 228. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Y VASince'the piston 194 is movable to three distinctpositions with respect to its cooperating sleeve cylinder 195, the actuating Ysleeve 228 secured to the piston rod 196 is likewise movable to three different positions. Depending upon the selected axial position of the sleeve 228, the cam levers 216, 217 and'218 are likewise movable to one of three positions due to'the coaction of the radialV camA arms carried thereby with the slots 241,' 242 and 243 of the sleeve. l f l l As will hereinafter'be, more fully described with reference to FIGS. 8A to 8H inclusive, the cam Vlevers 216, 217 and-218 operate to release and engage the clamp ring 117 of the spindle'collet '112 at appropriate times during a tool changeV cycle. In addition, the cam levers operate to release or engage a tool change collet 247l in coordinatedrelationship with theractuation of the spindle collet 112. The tool change collet 247 comprises four arcuately formed tool securing jaws 250, 251, 252 and 2,53 respec-V tively carriedn for resiliently expansible movement by the forward end of a collet support sleeve 254. K </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Two` sleeve bearings 255 and V256 `ixedly Ysecured in spaced relationship to an enlarged bored opening 257 within 'the stationary support sleeve` 211 support the tubular collet sleeve 254 for limited axial movement. A spring 260 seated at one end against acentering plug 261 securedr within the stationary'sleeve 211 engages with its opposite end a angedcentering plug 262 secured within the leftward end ofthe collet sleeve 256. Thus, the tool 12 being limited by'engagement'of the flanged Vplug 262 with the end face of the sleeve bearing255. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> As represented in FIG. 6, the tool change support and' stationary support sleeve 211 secured thereto are being moved'rightwardly toward the spindle collet 112 under control of the hydraulic cylinder 92. During this period of travel, the piston 194, FIG. 5, is urged to its central neutral position by sleeves 197 and 198 to maintain the cam leversin neutral position for engaging the outer face of the collet release ring 117, as shown in FIG. 6. As dynamically represented in FIG. 6, the four jaws of the tool change collet 247 have resiliently snapped into engagement'with the forward end of the toolholder Vand the cam levers have begun to engage the spindle collet clamp ring 117. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">' Initially, during forward movement of the support 90 from its fully retracted position, as the tool change grip 62 approaches the spindle collet 112, the tool change collet 247 is brought into engagement with the outer end of the toolholder 1,14. Continued movement of the tool change grip 62 is response to operation of the hydraulic cylinder 92, effects a movement of the individualjaws 251i, 251,252 and 253 intoV complete engagement with the forward end of the toolholder 114. Engagement of the tool change collet with the forward end of the toolholder V114 is a resilient snap action, during which the individual tool change collet jaws 250, 251, 252 and 253 expand radially outward andthen forward to engage an annular latching groove 267 `formed toward the forward outer end of the toolholder 114. During the interval in whichV engagement is taking piace, the outer actuating sleeve 228 is retained in its neutral position by the piston 194 ina manner to constrain the cam levers 216, 217 and 218 against outward pivotable movement to be in the neutral position shown in FIG. 6. Thus, the extreme outer ends of the cam levers are actually brought into engagement withthe front face of the axially movable spindle collet `clampring 117 which is represented as retainingrthe expansible jaws of the spindle collet 112 in clamped engagement with the toolholder 114. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Continued rightward movement of the tool grip 62 fromV the position shown in FIG. 6 in response to cylinder 92, effects axial releasing'movement of the clamp ring 117 in a rightward direction, this movement being limited by the adjusting nut 118 threaded on the outer end of the tool spindle 34. As this movement occurs, the cam latches 212, 213 and 214'are moved forwardly into engagement withannular grooves 27th, 271 presented by y the tool changer collet jaws 25th, 251, 252 and 253. The </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">annular grooves presented by the tool change collet jaws are engaged bygcorresponding annular locking cams presented by the Vcoacting camvr latches. Only the grooves 27@ and 271' of the collet jaws 251i'V and 253 are shown in FIG. 6. f A </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">' It will beapparent that rightward movement of the tool grip 62 iis limited by engagement of the ends of cam levers'2`16, 217 and 218 with the rightwardly displaced collet clamp ring 117, movement of which is limited by the adjusting nut 118 asshown inHFIGaSB'. AsV the cam leversV 216, 217 and 218 areV moved to their-limit of rightwardrmo'vement for actuating/the clamp ring 117 to disengage the Vcollet 112, the outer actuating sleeve y228 is retained in its neutral positionas hereinbefore explained. Thus, thel cam levers are likewise retained in a neutral position as represented by the lever'p21`6in FIG; 6. This is necessary to permit the resilient engagement Yof the cam Vlatches 212, 213 and 214HV into engagement with the annular grooves 27@ and 271 respectively, presented by the tool'change collet jaws. Inasmuch as the tool ,change collet is already engaging the toolholder 114, as this l occurs, the sleeve Vbearing 2557`is moved rightwardly out change collet 247 andv supporting sleeve 256 therefor are normally urged in an outward direction,Y this movement of engagement with the now stationary liganged centering plug262. "i 'Y Y Y As soon as the clamp ring 1177is moved to the released positionV represented in FIG. 8B, pressure to the main cylinder 22 is released to preclude frictional resistance during inward radial movement of the outer ends of the cam levers 216, 217 and 218. To retain the jaws of the tool changer collet clamped, the piston 194, FIG. 5, is urged rightwardly in a manner that the axial slots presented by the actuating sleeve 223 urge the cam levers 216, 217 and 213 radially inward, as shown in FIG. 8C. As this occurs, the transverse pins 223, 224 and 225 carried by the cam levers are urged inwardly to maintain the cam latches 212, 213 and 214 in their inner latched positions under pressure. During the tool interchange, hydraulic pressure is maintained to continuously urge the piston 194 in a rightward direction, thereby securely clamping the jaws of the tool change collet 247 into locking engagement with the toolholder 114. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> inasmuch as the spindle release ring 117 is now positioned to release the spindle collet 112 and the tool change collet 247 is positively clamped to the toolholder 114, operation of the cylinder 92 is reversed to effect ibodily withdrawal of the toolholder 114 from the spindle 34. Thus, during a tool interchange, all of the tools respectively carried by the spindles 34 to 45, inclusive, FG. 1, are simultaneously withdrawn by retracting movement of the movable tool change support 9d. After complete withdrawal, the hydraulic cylinder 69 is actuated to move the tool change mechanism 63 from the B to the A position in front of the empty storage magazine 69. Thereupon, with the changer support base' 86 latched in this position the hydraulic cylinder 92 is again actuated to efect forward movement or the support 94) together with the individual tool grips 62 for inserting the withdrawn tools into the empty storage sockets 59. During insertion, the piston 194 is maintained in its rightw-ard position and the respective toolholders are positively clamped in each of the tool grips 62. To positively retain the toolholders `in the storage sockets, a plurality of spring biased detent plungers, such as 221 and 222 in FIG. 12A, are radially disposed about each of the storage sockets 59 in the storage magazine section 6h. Detents 2811 and 222 are carried for radial slidable movement and are normally urged inwardly by means of ysprings 283 and 264 abutting with their opposite ends threaded plugs 265 and 236. The springs 283 and 234 are disposed to urge the detent plungers 281 and 232 inwardly with a force greater than that of the unclamped resiliently movable jaws of the tool change collet 247. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Upon insertion of the toolholder 114 into the empty storage socket 59, the detent plungers 281 and 282 are forced outwardly to permit insertion of the toolholder. As soon as the toolholder 26 is fully seated within the socket, the detent plungers are urged inwardly to engage an annular detent groove 239 vformed toward the rearward portion of the toolholder. Thereupon, the piston 194 is returned from its rightward to its neutral posi- `tion to permit return movement of the cam levers 216, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">217 and 218 to neutral position. Movement of the cam levers radially outward to neutral position removes the clamping pressure exerted against the cam latches 212, 213 and 214 which are then free for subsequent radially outward movement from the annular grooves presented 'by the collet jaws 251), 251, 252 and 253, inclusive. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Hydraulic cylinder 92, FIG. l, is then actuated to retract .the multiple tool change support 61 together with the individual grips 62 to the position shown in FIG. l. initially, upon retracting movement of the support 9d, the individual cam latches move radially and axially out of engagement with the annular grooves formed in the respective jaws of the 4tool change collet 247. With the cam latches unsnapped from engagement with the collet jaws, axial retracting movement continues although the collet 247 momentarily is retained in engagement with the annular detent groove 267 in the toolholder 114. As soon as the flanged plug 262, FIG. 5, is engaged by the sleeve bearing 255 secured within the retracting tubular support sleeve 211, the collet jaws are moved radially and axially out of engagement with the annular detent groove 267 as shown in FIG. 12A. Since the resilient pressure exerted by magazine section springs 283 and 2d4 is greater than that presented by the resilient jaws of the now unclamped tool change collet 247, the toolholder 114 remains seated in the storage socket 59. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> With the previously used tools now gripped within the storage sockets 59, the movable support is fully retracted and the storage magazine indexed to present the next selected set of tools, to the empty tool changer collets 247. The support 9i) and tool grips 62 are then again actuated by coordinated operation of cylinder 92 and piston 194 to grip the next set of tools in the changer collets 247. After the new set of tools is positively clamped in the tool changer collets 247, the cylinder 92 is again actuated to withdraw the new set of tools to the retracted position. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> With the next selected set of tools in the fully retracted changer support 90, the base 86 is again unlatched from the supporting frame 67 and bodily displaced to the B position in alignment with the empty tool spindles. Initially, upon arrival in the B position, the changer Ibase 36 is latched to the supporting frame 67 and the movable support 90 again urged inwardly in response to operation of the hydraulic cylinder 92. During this interval, the small pistons 194 respec- 'tively associated with the individual grips 62 are maintained in their rightward positions in a manner to positively lock each of the tools in its associated individual tool change grip 612. At this moment, therefore, the tool changer collet support tube 254 is iixedly locked in a leftwardly displaced position with respect to the left end face of the sleeve bearing 255. This is due to the fact the cam latches 212, 213 and 214 are respectively retained in locking engagement with the annular grooves presented by the collet jaws 250, 251, 252 and 253 by means of the actuating pins carried by the inwardly urged cam levers 216, 217 and 218 as shown in FIG. 8C. As there indicated, the lianged centering plug 262 is maintained in a like leftwardly displaced position relative to the sleeve bearing 255 in opposition to the spring 260. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> As soon as the toolholder 1114 is fully seated within the spindle collet 112, FIG. 8B, the actuating sleeve 228 is urged to fully retracted position by corresponding leftward reftracting movement of the piston 194, FIG. 5. Thereupon, the cam levers 216, 217 and 218 are pivoted radially outward as a prerequisite to electing reengagement of the collet clamp ring 117. Immediately prior to leftward movement of piston 194, FIG. 5, the inward actuating pressure fromy cylinder 92 is momentarily interrupted. The interruption of pressure to cylinder 92, FIG. 5, prevents trictional engagement between the outer ends of cam levers 216, 217 and 21S with the front face of the spindle collet clamp ring 1117 during radial outward movement of the cam levers. Thus, with pressure to the cylinder 92 momentarily interrupted, leftward retracting movement of piston 194, FIG. 5, effects immediate radial outward movement of the outer ends of the cam levers 216, 217 and 218. As soon as the levers have moved outwardly to the position indicated in FIG. 8D, inward pressure to cylinder 92 is reestablished to effect additional yforward movement of the support sleeve 211 for advancing the cam levers 216, 217 and 21S to the positions represented in FIG. 8E. As there shown, a cam notch 295 formed in the inner face of the earn lever 216 is positioned radially outward with respect to the side faces of the spindle collet clamp ring 117. Although not shown in the diagrammatic views in FIGS. 8A to SH, inclusive, the actuating cam levers 217 and 218 are provided with identically spaced cam notches, and cooperate with the cam notch 295 of cam lever 216 in a manner simultaneously to engage the spindle collet clamp ring 117. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">the additional rightward forward ladvancement of the central support vsleeve 211, therefore, the'respective camV latches 212, 213 and 214 integrally formed therewith are likewise moved forwardly out of engagement with the annular grooves presented by the tool change collet jaws. During `this intervaLhcWever, lthe spring 260 is further compressed to resiliently maintain the Ytoolholdet- 114 yfullyfseated'within the spindle collet 112. Thus, even though the tool changer collet 247 is now in.unclamped position, with respect to the toolholder 114, it continues to function to retain Vthe tool holder in proper position. The spr-ing 260 `and tool Ichange ,collet 247 cooperate to maintain the toolholder in its proper position during the subsequent Vreengagement of the tool spindle clamp ring 117. n. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> To accomplish this, the piston 194 is moved to its neutralV position in alignment with the cylinder sleeve 195, FIG. 5, to effect a corresponding movement of the actuating sleeve 228. As this occurs, thevinner periphery of the forward end of the actuating sleeve 228 isV moved rightwardlyVt-o simultaneously urge the three cam levers 216, 217 and 218 inwardly. Thereupon, the cam notches presented by the three cam levers 216, 217 and 21S are moved into engagement with the spindle collet clamp ring 117. This condition is diagrammatically illustrated in FIG. 8F, in which the cam notch 295 presented by the actuating lever 216 is moved into engagement `with one portion of the spindle'colletclamp ring 117. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> As soon as this occurs, the cylinder 92, FIG. 5, is actuated to effect outward retracting movement in a manner that the inwardly constrained cam levers operate to effect corresponding left-ward clamping movement Vof the ring 1,17 into engagement with the tapered shank of the spindle collet 1-12. TheV jaws' otv thefspindlev collet 1-12 are then forced inwardly into tightl clamping er1- gagement with the periphery of the toolholder 114, as shown in FIG. 8G. During reengagement of the clamp ring 117, the piston 194 is maintained in'its neutral position to maintain the actuating sleeve 228 in the 'positions represented in FIGS. 8F and 8G. With the three cam levers 216,217 and 218 thus constrained in their neutral radially spaced positions, the three actuating pins 223, 224 and V2-25 are spaced radiallyY outward with respect tothe resiliently'expansible cam latches, 212, 213 and 214.

Leftwardmovement ofthe actuating sleevel 228 with respect to the stationary support sleeve 211, in turn, effects radially outward pivotable movement of the cam levers 216, 217 .and 218 tor moving the cam notches radially out of engagement with the clamp ring 1-17. With the .cam levers disengaged from the clamp ring 117, as shown in FIG. 8H, it will be apparent that the resiliently expansible jaws of the tool change collet 247 are still maintained in engagement with the annular groove 267 presented by the toolholder 114. Inasmuch .as the toolholder 114 is now fully clamped within the contracted spindle collet 112FIG. 8H, the jaws of the tool change collet 247are now free to expand radially upon the'subsequent reapplication of retracting pressure to the mainV cylinder r92. Thus, with lthe cam levers 216, 217 and 2118 pivoted radially outward, the cylinder 92 is reactivated to eect complete retracting movement of the tool change support 90 to its position represented in FIG. 5 upon the base S6. During retracting movement of the support 90, theiindividual tool change grips, such as the grip 62, are moved out of engagement with the respective ftools and toolholders now clamped in the respective spindle collets. l </div>

<div class="description-paragraph"> A control valve 322 is operatively connected to contro movement of the piston 316 for effecting retracting or reengaging movement of the shot .bolt 314. Energization of a valve solenoid 323 effects rightward movement of a valve spool 324 to interconnect the 4main pressure supply line 396 via a valve spool cannelure 325 to a branch supply line 326. A flow of fluid under pressure from branch line 326 effects rightward movement of the piston 316 to retract the shot bolt 314, with pressure fluid being exhausted via a branch line 323 connected via valve spool groove 329 to the main exhaust line 310. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 'For effecting movement of the shot bolt 314 into engagement with an indexing notch, as shown in FIG. 9, a solenoid 331 is energized to effect movement of the valve spool k324 to its leftward position. Leftward movement of the valve spool 324 interconnects the pressure supply line 306 directly to the branch line 328 for effecting leftward inward movement of the piston 316. At the same time, fiuid is exhausted from the opposite side ofthe piston 316 by branch line 326 which is then connected via a valve spool groove to the main exhaust line 310. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Whenevel the shot bolt 314 is moved rightwardiy to retracted position, the tool change support base 36 is longitudinally movable along the main `frame ways 64 and 65 by operation of the hydraulic cyl-inder 69. The longitudinally movable support base 86 is connected to a piston rod 7 under control of a piston 333 movable within the cylinder 69 in response to a control valve 334. After the shot bolt 314 is disengaged from the indexing notch 312, the base 86 is movable to the B position by energizing a solenoid 336 associated with the control valve 334. Ener- -gization of the solenoid 336 effects rightward movement of a valve spool 337 in opposition to a centering spring 338. With the valve spool 337 in rightward position, the pressure supply line 396 is connected via a valve spool cannelure 341 to a branch line 342 to effect upward movement of the piston 333 for moving the support base 86 from the A to the B position. At the same time, the control cylinder 69 is connected via a branch line 343, a valve spool groove 344 of the rightwardly moved valve spool 337 to the main exhaust line 310. Movement of the tool change support base 86 longitudinally effects corresponding movement of an actuating dog 347 fixedly secured thereto into position to activate a sequence limit switch 348. The limit switch 343 is fixedly secured to the rnain supporting frame 67 in spaced relationship to a limit switch 349 secured to the frame. The limit switches 343 and 349 are spaced apart a distance corresponding to the spacing of the indexing notches 312 and 313 presented by the supporting frame 67. Upon arrival of the base 86 in the A position, the limit switch 348 is activated to effect deenergization of the control valve solenoid 336 permitting return movement of the valve spool 337 to the central neutral position represented in FIG. 9. Whenever the solenoid 336 and a solenoid 351 of the valve 334 are deenergized, the valve spool 337 is centered between the spring 338 and a spring 352 in well known manner. Movement of the valve spool 337 to its resiliently centered neutral position, as shown in FIG. 9, effects a connection of both branch lines 342 and 343 -to the main exhaust line 319.

<div class="description-paragraph">. 312 or 313. Thus, reengagement of the shot bolt 314 with one of the index notches effects final precise longitudinal movement of the tool change mechanism 63, FIG. 1, in either of the preselected positions. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For moving the tool change support base S6 longitudinally toward the B position, solenoid 351 is energized to effect leftward movement of the valve spool 337 in opposition to the centering spring 352. The leftward movement of the valve spool 337 effects a connection between the pressure supply line 366 and a valve spool groove 334 to the branch supply lines 343. Hydraulic fluid under pressure from branch supply lines 343 effects downward movement of the piston 333 to its position indicated in FIG. 9, with fluid being exhausted from the cylinder 69 via branch line 342 and a valve spool groove 35S to the main exhaust line 310. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> For effecting transverse movement of the tool change support member 90, relative to its supporting base 86, there is provided a control valve 358. As shown in FIG. 9, a valve spool 359 of control valve 358 is maintained in a central neutral position between centering springs 360 and 361 to interconnect the main exhaust line 310 via a valve spool groove 362 to branch lines 364 and 365 respectively. At their opposite ends, the branch lines 364 and 365 are connected to the opposite ends of the cylinder 92 and at the opposite sides of a piston 366 carried by the cylinder. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> For indicating the transverse position of the multiple changer support 90, three trip dogs 369, 3"/'0 and 371 secured thereto are respectively disposed to coact with limit switches 373, 374 and 375 secured to the base 86. For effecting movement of the changer support to its rearward fully retracted position, a solenoid 377 is energized to effect leftward movement of the valve spool 359 in opposition to the spring 360. Leftward movement of the valve spool 359 effects a connection of the main pressure supply line 306 via a valve spool cannelure 378 to the branch line 365 connected at its opposite end to effect leftward -retracting movement 4of the piston 366. Upon movement of the changer support 96 to its fully retracted position, the dog 369 secured thereto actuates the limit switch 373. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> As will hereinafter be more fully explained, a pressure switch 379, although activated, performs no function during full retracting movement of the changer support 90, The pressure switch 379 is disposed to be operative only during a limited retraoting movement of the changer suppont90 for reengaging the spindle clam-p ring 117, FIGS. 3 and 6. During either complete or limited retracting movement of the piston 366, uid is exhausted from the cylinder 92 via a branch line 364 connected via valve spool groove 380 of the leftwardly positioned Valve spool 359 to the main exhaust line 310. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> During forward or rightward movement of the changer support 90, t-he piston 366 is urged rightwardly to one of two different positions corresponding generally to the slightly difference in spacing between switches 374 and 375 relative to their associated actuating dogs 370 and 371. The extent of forward movement of the changer support 90 depends upon the panticular step -in the tool interchange sequence. In either case, this movement is effected by energizing a solenoid 383 to effect rightward movement of the valve spool 359 in opposition to the spring 361. Energization of the solenoid 383 operates to effect a connection of the pressure supply line 306 via a valve spool groove 384 to the branch supply line 364 connected to effect righ-tward movement of a piston 366 and corresponding movement of t-he changer support 90. At the same time, fluid is exhausted from the opposite side of the piston 366 via the branch line 365 yand a valve spool groove 385 connected to the exhaust line 319. Depending upon the step in the multiple tool interchange, the solenoid 383 is deenergized to stop rightward pressure via the branch line 364 upon activation of the limit switch 374 by the dog 370, or a slightly later activation of the limit switch 375 by the dog 371. In either case, deenergization `of the solenoid 383 permits resiliently biased return movement of the valve spool 359 to its neutral position thereby connecting the main exhaust line 310 via the common valve spool groove 362 to both of the branch 19 supply lines 364 and 365. As this occurs, a rightward 'or forward pressure to the piston 366 is stopped and movement of the multiple toolV change support 90 in a forward direction 4is likewise stopped. </div>
