<div class="description-paragraph">United States arent O "a 3,464,358 PUMP DRIVEN BY AN ELECTRIC MOTOR Carl Eric Gottfrid Lind, Partille, Sweden, assignor to Aktiebolaget Svenska Precisionsverktyg, Planiavagen Nacka, Sweden, a corporation of Sweden Filed Aug. 17, 1967, Ser. No. 661,411 Claims priority, application Sweden, Aug. 23, 1966, 11,336/ 66 Int. Cl. F04b 49/02; F04d 1 5 00; E03b 5 00 U.S. Cl. S-25 10 Claims ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE A pump housing has a motor disposed centrally within it, a ow chamber surrounding the motor, and an electrode chamber partitioned olf from the flow chamber but communicating through a tube at its bottom with the ilow chamber. An impeller mounted on the bottom end of the motor shaft drives liquid upwardly out of the ilow chamber and through an outlet at the top of the housing. Mounted in the electrode chamber are electrodes. When the electrically conductive liquid being pumped reaches the electrodes a circuit is closed to start the motor. The electrode chamber is closed at its top so that air is trapped in the top of this chamber by the liquid therein. An air outlet valve maintains the liquid level in the electrode chamber when the pump is operating, but vents the electrode chamber when the liquid level in the ow chamber drops to a predetermined level. The air pocket provides space in which the electrodes are kept dry adjacent the terminals which connect them with the motor. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> This invention relates to pumps driven by an electric motor. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> More particularly this invention relates to pumps driven by an electric motor and destined for pumping of electrically conductive liquid, such as contaminated water, for example, and provided with electrodes in an electric circuit which also includes the control coil of a contactor or similar member in the starting circuit of the electric motor, said electrodes being disposed so as, when liquid is present between them, to close the control circuit and thereby to energize the contactor to start the motor and, when the liquid level falls below the electrodes, to interrupt the control circuit and thereby also to release the contactor for stopping of the motor. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In a construction known in the prior art the electrodes a-re located horizontally in front of one another within a chamber. The one electrode is attached to the pump casing by means of a threaded connection, and it is possible by screwing in this electrode towards the opposed iixed electrode to bring about a short-circuit e.g. a direct current passage through the electrodes without passage through the liquid (water) in the electrode chamber, which can be desirable in some cases. This construction has, however, the following drawbacks. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> (a) By repeated screwing in and out of said electrode the screw threads after some time will have too much play so that air will penetrate into the electrode chamber whereby the liquid level in the chamber will be lowered and unintentional `stopping of the pump motor be caused. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> (b) The electrodes have little extension only in the vertical direction for which reason they will easily become wetted by splashes from the liquid present in the chamber. The wet surface forms a current bridge to the wall of the chamber which results in that the pump motor will not be stopped in spite of the electrode chamber having been drained of liquid, and </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 3,464,358 Patented Sept. 2, 1969 (c) The electrodes are difficult to reach for effective survey and cleaning. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> One main object of the present invention is to remove the drawbacks mentioned above. According to one characteristic feature of the invention the pump is provided with a bottom-open chamber which is closed at the top and provided with one or several substantially vertical electrodes, said electrode chamber in addition having an air outlet located so as to cause an air cushion to be formed above the air outlet and the liquid level in the electrode chamber, part of at least one of the electrodes extending through said air cushion. Due to this air cushion located above the liquid level in the electrode chamber and vertically passed by the electrodes and effectively sealed, most suitably by means of a stopper, the electrodes above the liquid level are kept dry and thus no current bridge can be formed here. No sealing problems exist, since it is easy to seal the stopper which is of cylindrical shape by means of a common O-ring against the bore in the electrode chamber into which it has been inserted. The stopper with the electrodes is easy to remove for inspection and cleaning of the latter. The electrodes have great dimension in the vertical direction and can be provided with a long electrical insulating layer which eliminates the risk of short-circuiting due to a current bridge through a Wet surface layer. Only the lowermost ends of the electrodes need to be uncovered which ends therefore easily and at low expense can be covered with a noble metal, such as platinum, for example. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> According to a valuable embodiment of the invention the stopper is provided with a short-circuiting contact for by-passing or shunting of the electrodes. Suitably contact pins are provided in the wall of the electrode chamber and the stopper is partially rotatable so that one of the contact pins is brought to electrically conductive connection with the short-circuiting contact. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> According to another preferred embodiment of the invention two vertical electrodes of different length are attached to the stopper, the shorter electrode being adapted to act as starting electrode and the longer electrode as holding electrode for keeping the circuit through the control coil of the contactor closed through the liquid, even if the liquid level is slightly below the lower end of the shorter or starting electrode. In this way smooth and undisturbed starting of the pump motor is ensured. Splashes to and fro of the liquid in the electrode chamber will thus not disturb the progress of the starting operation, since the holding electrode which during the starting operation continuously with its lower end dips into the liquid in the electrode chamber, makes sure that the control coil of the contactor will be supplied with current and thus keep the contactor closed. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In order to prevent the electrodes in the chamber from becoming soiled by the liquid drawn up by the pump, the air outlet from the chamber is according to the invention provided with a valve having an annular seat enclosed by a sleeve-shaped membrane which is adapted by the action of positive pressure prevailing in the pump chamber to encase the annular seat in a sealing manner. A valve of this type will seal the air outlet when the pump begins to operate so that contaminated liquid cannot penetrate into the electrode chamber through the air outlet, but will open immediately when the pump ceases to feed liquid. The most important purpose of the valve is to maintain the liquid in the electrode chamber at the required high level until the liquid level outside of the pump has been lowered suiciently to allow air to penetrate into the electrode chamber at the lower end thereof, so that the liquid in said chamber is forced to drain off. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Further objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description considered in connection with the accompanying drawings which form part of this specification and of which: </div>

<div class="description-paragraph"> FIG. 8 is a similar section through a valve constructed according to another embodiment, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> FIG. 9 is a lateral view of the valve connected to the carrying handle of the pump, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 10 shows a wiring diagram, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> FIG. 11 is a longitudinal section through an electrode chamber made according to another embodiment of the invention. t </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The pump shown in the drawings comprises an outer casing '1, an inner casing 2, an annular ow channel 3 located therebetween and an upper part 4 closing the outer casing at the top thereof and provided with a dis charge socket 5 for the pumped liquid. The inner casing 2 housing an electric motor 6 is closed at its ends by means of caps 7 and 8. Disposed at the lower end of shaft 9 of the electric motor 6 is a pump wheel 10, which rotates within an inlet chamber 12 for the liquid, said chamber being provided with inlet openings 11. A chamber 13 is by means of partition walls 14 delimited from the annular ow channel 3. The chamber 13 communicates with the inlet chamber 12 through a tube 15. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Introduced into a vertical bore in the upper part of the chamber 13 is a cylindrical stopper 17 made of some electrically non-conductive material, suitably plastic. The stopper 17 which is rotatably arranged within the bore 16 is in an air-tight manner sealed against the wall of the bore by means of O-ring 18. Two vertical electrodes 20, 21 of diierent lengths have their laterally projecting ends 19 iixed in the stopper 17, each of said electrodes being encased by a layer or a sleeve 22 and 23, respectively, of electrically non-conductive material in such a manner that only the lower ends 24 and 25, respectively, are uncovered. These ends are suitably covered with noble metal, such as platinum, for example. The partition wall 14 is passed by two conductors 26, 27 carrying each a contact pin 28 and 29, respectively on their outer ends. The conductors 26, 27 and the contact pins 28, 29 are each embedded in a sleeve 30 made of rubber or other electrically insulating, elastic material so that the Contact pins 28, 29, at their free ends engage notch 31. A sleeveshaped short-crcuiting pin 32 having a ball detent 33 at one end passes diametrically through the stopper 17. Said ball is pressed by means of a coiled spring 34 a distance out of the sleeve 32, but is prevented from leaving said sleeve entirely due to a collar-shaped, inwardly projecting annular ange 35 formed at the adjacent end of the sleeve. The opposite end of the sleeve is shaped into a head 36. By means of a screw-driver or a similar tool (not shown) insertible into a transverse tool recess 37 (FIG. 4) formed in the head 38 of the stopper 17, said stopper can be rotated from the position shown in FIG. 5 in which the electrode 20 is in contact with the pin 28 and the electrode 21 in contact with the pin 29, into the position shown in FIG. y6, where the pin 29 through the sleeve 32 is in short-circuit with the pump casing 1, which is connected to ground. The head 38 is enclosed by a hood 39 of some suitable elastic or re- 4 silient material, such as rubber or soft plastic, for example. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> A tube or vent 4t) opens according to FIG. 1 into the upper end portion of the electrode chamber 13 and is placed through a valve 41 in communication with the atmospheric air above the pump. According to the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the valve 41 is With its upper end connected to a hollow carrying handle 42 of the pump which handle is provided with holes 43 for escape of air. As in shown in FIG. 7 in a larger scale, the tube 40 is at its upper end connected to a Valve body 44 having an upper axial through-flow passage 45, two laterally directed channels 46 and 47 and an intermediate channel 48 extending in the longitudinal direction of the body 44. The valve body 44 is enclosed by a cylindrical membrane 49 made of rubber or some other resilient and suitably acidaproof material. A seat `50 is formed around the outer end of the channel 47. The valve is disposed in the channel 3 so that the membrane 49 is exposed to actuation by the working pressure prevailing in said channel. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> When the pump under operation is immersed into the liquid to be pumped the liquid rises in the electrode chamber 13 up to the lower mouth of the tube 40. An air cushion 51 is thus formed in the upper end portion of the electrode chamber 13 so that the upper ends of the electrically insulating layers 22, 23 of the electrodes will not become wet. When the chamber 13 as described above is lled with liquid, except for the air cushion 51, the air driven upwards by the level 52 of the upwardly penetrating liquid is forced to escape through the air outlet formed by the tube 40 and the valve 41. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> FIG. 8 shows another embodiment of the air outlet valve 41. In this embodiment the valve body 44 is provided with two peripheral grooves 53, 54 encased by the sleeve-shaped membrane 49. Several axial channels 55 extending outwardly to the one end of the valve body open into the groove 53, and several other channels 56 extending to the opposed end of the valve body open into the groove 54, said opposed end being covered by a hood 57 in such a manner that a channel 58 providing a connection with the ambient air is formed. p </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> FIG. 3 shows how this valve 41 is inserted in the upper part 4 of the pump casing in such a manner that the membrane 49 becomes exposed to actuation by the working pressure in the ow channel 3 for the liquid run up by the pump. When the pump is not in operation or the pump wheel 10 rotates but does not draw up any liquid, the passage through the channels 55 and the grooves 53, 54 and the channels 56 and 58 is open, whereas when working pressure prevails in the flow channel 3, the membrane 49' is pressed against the wall 59 formed between the grooves 53 and 54 and serving as a seat, whereby the valve is closed and the connection between the electrode chamber 13 and the ambient air is interrupted. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> FIG. 9 illustrates the connection of the valve 41' to the carrying handle 42. The axial channels 56 communicate through a recess 60 formed in one securing ange 61 of the carrying handle, a channel 62 formed in a socket A63 of said ange on which socket one end of the carrying handle 42 has been pushed, -with the holes 43 formed in the wall of the tubular handle 42. By this arrangement coarser dirt particles are prevented from penetrating near to the valve 41', on the operation of which they otherwise could have a disturbing eifect. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Referring now to the electric wire diagram shown in FIG. 10 the shorter electrode 20 serving as the starting electrode is diagrammatically represented in the lower right hand portion of the diagram and below said electrode the longer electrode 21 serving as holding electrode is shown. Also the wall 14 of the electrode chamber 13 has been represented. The chamber wall 14-or as the wire diagram shows an electrode 64 insulated from said wall-is through a conductor 65 connected to .an intermediate terminal 66 on the secondary side of a transformer 68 which on its primary side 69 is connected to two phases 70, 71 of a three-phase power supply. The transformer 68 is suitably dimensioned so that at the intermediate terminal 66 a voltage of about 6 volts can be tapped Whereas at point 72 a Voltage of about 28 volts can be tapped. The electrode 20 is connected through a resistor 73 to the base 74 of a transistor 75, when stopper 17 is positioned as shown in FIG. 5. The emitter 76 of this latter is through another resistor 77 connected to the O-terminal 78 of the transformer whereas the collector 79 of said transistor is connected through a diode 80 and thir'd resistor 81 and the control coil 82 of the contactor or operating switch 83 of the pump motor 6 to the terminal 72 of the transformer. The holding electrode 21 is connected in parallel to the starting electrode 20 through .a switch 84 mechanically connected with the armature of the coil 82. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The described device operates in the following manner: </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> When the liquid within the electrode chamber 13 rises to such a level as to cover the electrodes 20l and 64 current is supplied from the terminal 66 through the liquid present in the space between these two electrodes and through the resistor 73 to the base 74 of the transistor 75 which is caused to open or conduct. The whole secondary voltage of 28 volts from the transformer 68 is then impressed on the control coil 82, which thereby is caused to attract or close the contactor 83. The pump motor 6 is started. By the starting operation a pressure will be produced in the pump which results in a wave motion of the liquid level within the electrode chamber 13. It may then occur that the current circuit over the electrodes 20 and 64 is interrupted. Such current interruption would normally deenergize the control coil 82 and instantaneously interrupt the supply of current to the motor 6. As, however, the switch 84 is closed simultaneously with the closing of the contactor and since the electrode 21, which according to FIG. 10 is the longer one, continuously is immersed in the liquid Within the electrode chamber, there is still voltage applied from the terminal 66 to the base 74 of transistor 75 which thus remains open. Thus, due to the holder contact 21 a smooth start of the motor 6 is obtained. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> According to the wiring diagram of FIG. l0 a condenser 85 is connected in parallel within the control coil 82 and thus serves for equalisation of the voltage. If desired, the resistor 77 can be short-circuited over the points 86 and 87. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The valve, which under operation seals the air outlet 40 and thereby retains the liquid at `a predetermined level within the electrode chamber until the liquid level outside the pump has been lowered so much that air can penetrate through the lower end of the tube 15, permits the use of relatively short electrodes 20, 21, which with their lower ends are located high above the pump chamber and the pump wheel 10 rotating therein. The lower ends of the electrodes thus .are not exposed to actuation or wear by solid particles entrained by the liquid. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The invention includes also such an embodiment as is shown in FIG. ll and according to which no valve is provided in the air outlet 40'. In this case it is necessary, as is evident from FIG. 11, to form the holding electrode 21 very long. It must extend vertically through practically the entire electrode chamber. According to this embodiment, the electrode chamber is constituted by a tube 88, which at its top is closed by means of a stopper 17' of electrically non-conductive material. The two electrodes 20, 21 are attached to the stopper 17' in the manner indicated above. The stopper may also be provided with a short-circuiting contact which is rotatable with stopper 17 into various positions to permit operation of the pump without automatic stop. Due to the location of the electrodes on a removable stopper both said electrodes and the electrode chamber can be cleaned, surveyed and adjusted when required. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Instead of equipping the electrode chamber 13 with a holding electrode the electric coupling may be provided with a delay device so that the control coil 82 remains energized even if due to splashing motions of the liquid level in the electrode chamber short current interruptions may occur between the electrodes or, if only one single electrode is used, between said electrode land the pump casing. </div>
