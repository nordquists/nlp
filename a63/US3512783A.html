<div class="description-paragraph">PRACTICE PUTTING DEVICE Filed April 25, 1968 INVENTOR. R 0b er/ E Anderson United States Patent 3,512,783 PRACTICE PUTTTNG DEVICE Robert F. Anderson, 3613--13th St., Menominee, Mich. 49858 Filed Apr. 25, 1968, Ser. No. 724,122 Int. Cl. A63]: 57/00 U5. Cl. 273177 8 Claims ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE A golf practice putting device including vertically spaced apart plate-like members having opposed projections on their peripheral edges. A support connecting the platelike members is so constructed that when a putted golf ball engages the projections, the plate-like members are sprung apart and permit the ball to enter and be trapped therebetween. When the support is made from a material such as metal, projections can be stamped or punched therefrom to form a rearwardly positioned upwardly extending flag simulating member and a ball stopping member positioned between the plate-like members. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Background of the invention This invention relates to a device for use in practicing golf and more particularly is concerned with a practice putting device. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It is a principal object of the present invention to provide a novel device suitable for use in practicing putting a golf ball either indoors or outdoors. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It is another object of the present invention to provide a unitized putting device for stopping and holding a golf ball and from which the ball readily can be retrieved. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> These and other objects and advantages of the present invention readily will become apparent from the detailed description presented hereinafter when read in conjunction with the appended drawing. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Brief description of the drawing FIG. 1 is a top view of one embodiment of the golf practice putting device of the present invention. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> FIG. 2 is a sectional view taken along line 2-2 of FIG. 1. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> FIG. 3 is a side elevation of the embodiment shown in FIG. 1. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Summary of the invention In general, the golf practice putting device of the present invention, hereinafter at times referred to by the term putting cup, comprises two spaced apart platelike members each fitted with at least one raised projection adjacent the outer boundary and extending at least a part of the distance around the periphery of the plate. Each plate-like member is attached on one side to the opposite side of a support means such that the plates are in substantially spaced apart parallel relation one above the other with the raised projections facing one another. The support means is of a size and configuration such that the plate-like members are held in a spaced apart relationship such that the distance between the projections of the top and bottom plates is slightly less, usually from about to about inch, than the diameter of a golf ball. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Description of a preferred embodiment One preferred embodiment of the putting cup of the present invention is shown in the figures of the drawing. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">' This embodiment comprises a circular bottom plate a and a circular top plate 1%, usually identical in shape and size. Each of the plates is connected to a substantially shaped support member 12. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Each of the plates 10a and 10b is a flat circular mem ber having a diameter usually ranging from about 4 to about 6 inches. Each plate 10a and 10b has a tapered shoulder 14 sloping inwardly and upwardly from its edge 16 for a short distance, ordinarily from about A to abopt inch, usually about /2 inch. This shoulder 14 rises to a maximum height of about of an inch, usually from about A to about inch, from the plane of the flat plate 10a or 10b. This tapered shoulder 14 drops sharply from its point of maximum height down to the original plane of the plate 10a or 10b. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In the embodiment depicted in the figures, the shoulder 14 extends from about 300 to about 330 around the plate 10a or 1011. The remaining portion 18 of the plate 10a or 10b is flat and in the original plane of the member. It is to be understood that this shoulder could extend completely around the plate 10a or 10b, if desired. Alternatively, this shoulder 14 could extend some lesser angle around the plate 10a or 1012. Further, it is apparent that this shoulder 14 need not be continuous but could be a series of spaced apart tapered projections. For operability, it is only necessary that the ball be held within the area bounded by the shoulder 14. Therefore, if a series of spaced apart shoulder members are employed, these must be of a length and sufiiciently close together so as to not permit a golf ball to freely pass therebetween. Projections which taper gradually from the outer edge of the plates 10a and 1% offer the additional advantage over straight vertical projections in that the tapered members serve as an approach for the ball to enter the inner cup" portion while partially slowing down the ball. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Plate 10a, the bottom plate of the assembly, is fastened with its tapered shoulder 14 facing upward to one leg 20 of support member 12. This support 12 is of a width such that it fits within the fiat portion 18 of plate 10a. Conveniently, plate 10a is rigidly attached to leg 20 by means of rivets 22 inserted through the leg 20 and plate 10a near its edge 16. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In the depicted preferred embodiment, the upper plate 10b is positioned in a mirror image relationship above bottom plate 10a and fastened to the remaining outwardly projecting leg 24 of support 12. As shown, the plate 1% is also attached to the support leg 24 by means of rivet assemblies 22. The leg 24 of support 12 ends in a substantially vertically downwardly extending portion 26 positioned intermediate the edge 16 and center of the top plate 10b of the assembled putting cup. The end portion 26 of leg 24 during use serves to stop a ball hit into the device. If desired, this vertical projection could be an upwardly extending portion fabricated into the end of the other leg 20 of support 12. Alternatively, both leg 20 and leg 24 can terminate in such projections. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Centered in the vertical back portion 28 of support 12 is an upwardly projecting aiming member or flag 30. This can be of any design or configuration. Conveniently, with a metal support 12, for example, this member 30 can be stamped or punched directly from the back portion 28 of the support 12 and then be bent upwards into a predetermined position. Alternatively, this aiming member can be separately fabricated and then attached to the support 12 by rivets, screws, bolts and taps, adhesive, spot welding or other conventional joining means. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Support 12 usually is fabricated from a ferrous metal, aluminum or other metal in wrought or cast form or molded plastic and preferably is of a resilient, springy material which provides a slight spring action. This assures that as a ball strikes the initial shoulder 14 of each of plates 10a and 10b of the assembly the plates can spring or be pushed apart under the force applied by the moving ball. As the ball clears the maximum rise of the projections 14, and enters onto the flat interior of cup surface of the assembly, the spring tension of support 12 will force the plates 10a and 10b back into their original predetermined position. This spring action also serves to help slow down a ball as it hits the putting device thereby aiding in holding the ball therein. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> As shown, the unit is prepared using circular plates. Conveniently, to aid a golfer in perfecting or improving his putting aim, these can be of approximately the same size or only slightly larger than the diameter of an actual golf cup on a putting green. If desired, however, it is to be understood that these can be of any other desired geometric shape, for example, square, rectangular, hexagonal, octagonal, elliptical, etc. Preferably, as indicated hereinbefore, the plates are circular. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Usually the plates are fabricated from thin sheets of a lightmetal such as aluminum, magnesium, aluminum alloys, magnesium alloys, sheet steel and the like. Other structural materials can be used including, for example, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">rigid plastics, Masonite hardboard, wood and the like. Thin metal plates and plastic disks are particularly suitable for use in the present practice putting device since these materials lend themselves to ready fabrication by casting, stamping and the like forming operations. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The support member can be of other design or construction than shown. This can be a single or multiple post like support means fastened to the edge of the plates. Preferably, because of the spring action and ease of fabrication of the assembly plus the stopping action provided by the depicted embodiment, this design ordinarily is employed. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The plates can be fastened to the support by any of a variety of mechanical, frictional or adhesive fastening means as known to one skilled in the art. Rivets, as shown, as well as spot welding, bolt and tap assemblies, adhesives, frictional clamps and the like are illustrative of typical means to bond or hold the plates to the support means. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In use, the present practice putting device is positioned on a smooth surface, for example a carpet, short grass, packed sand or the like media which may be encountered on a putting green or which simulate a putting green surface. A golf ball is hit toward the device, usually with a putter, from any desired distance by a person practicing putting. If the putt is accurate and the ball passes between the shoulders of the plates, it is held by the cup. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Various modifications can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope thereof for it is understood that I limit myself only as defined in the appended claims. </div>
