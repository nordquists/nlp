Marlo Atl0rney-Holcombe, Wetherill &amp; Brisebois ABSTRACT: The disclosure is concerned with apparatus for providing driving practice for golfers. The apparatus has a tripod frame in the form of a substantially inverted V-shaped yoke the arms of the V forming two legs of the tripod. The third leg of the tripod is pivoted to the top of the yoke and extends beyond the plane of the yoke as a supporting arm from which a golf ball is suspended at the end of a cord. The lower end of each leg includes a bushing through which a spike may be inserted to anchor the frame to the ground. An L-shaped spike is used to anchor the third leg in position and the laterally extending part of this spike includes another bushing through which another ground anchoring spike may be inserted in nonparallel relation to the L-shaped spike. The ball supporting cord is secured to the supporting arm through a bushing of low friction material having an outer concave end face. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">APPARATUS FOR PRACTISING GOLF This invention relates to apparatus for providing driving practice for golfers and, in accordance with the invention, such apparatus comprises a tripod frame in the form of a substantially inverted V-shaped yoke the arms of the V forming two legs of the tripod, and a third leg which is coupled to the top of the yoke and extends beyond the plane of the yoke as a supporting arm from which a golf ball is suspended at the end of a cord. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Preferably, the end of the arm curves forwardly and downwardly and is provided at its outward extremity with a bush, made ofa low friction material such as Tufnol, through which the cord passes. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> If the coupling between the third leg and the yoke is a pivotal coupling the third leg can be swung into or adjacent and parallel to the plane of the yoke to reduce the overall dimensions, for storage and packing. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The frame may be arranged to be rigidly fixed to the ground by means of integral bushes through which spikes can be driven into the ground. There should be at least one of these bushes at the bottom of each of the three legs of the tripod. The spikes may be secured in the bushes by, for example, screw-threaded studs carrying wing nuts which screw through the walls of the bushes to clamp the spikes in the bushes. In order to secure at least the third leg of the tripod more rigidly in the ground, a double fixing can be provided by arranging for a spike which passes into the ground through a bush at the bottom of one leg to be L-shaped, with a further bush at the free end of the laterally extending arm of the L through which a further spike can be driven into the ground in a direction not parallel to that in which the first spike is driven into the ground. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> One example of apparatus constructed in accordance with the present invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in which: </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> FIG. 1 is a perspective view of the apparatus open for use; and, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 2 is a side elevation of the apparatus folded for storage. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The tripod frame is formed by an inverted V-shaped plastic coated tubular steel yoke having legs 3 and 4 and a plastic coated tubular steel leg 5 which is pivotally connected to the top of the yoke by means of a bolt and wing nut 6 which extends through a bracket 7 embracing the arm 5. The pivot allows the apparatus to fold to the FIG. 2 position. The upper endof the leg 5 forms the supporting arm which is curved over and provided with a transverse tubular portion 8 through which a Tufnol bush 9 passes and is secured in position by means of a push-on spring washer !0. The head of the bush 9 has a frustoconical concave face which provides a fairlead for a cord 11 which extends through the bush and is secured by a self-knot 12 at the back of the bush. A golf ball 13 is suspended from the lower end of the cord 11. The height of the ball can be adjusted by remaking the knot 12. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The lower ends ofthe legs 3 and 4 of the yoke are rigidly interconnected by means ofa brace 14 welded to the lower ends of the legs. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Welded to the lower ends of the'legs 3, 4 and 5 are bushes 15 provided with clamping studs with rigid wing nuts 16. The apparatus is arranged to be secured to the ground in the open position of FIG. 1 by means of spikes driven through the bushes l5 and clamped in position by means of the studs and nuts 16. One such spike 17 is illustrated in FIG. 1 extending through the bush 15 attached to the bottom of the leg 5. In order to provide additional security for the fixing in the ground, a further bush 18 may be welded to the end ofa bent arm 19 of the spike 17, the bush 18 having its axis nonparallel to that of the main part of the spike l7 and hence to that of the corresponding bush 15. A further spike 20 may then be driven into the ground through the bush l8 and secured by means of a further stud and wing nut 16. The two spikes 17 and 20 then together prevent the withdrawal of the end of the arm 5 on the grrmiltd parallel to the axis ofeither one of the two spikes. </div>
