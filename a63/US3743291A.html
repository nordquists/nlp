Field of the Invention This invention relates to the game art and more particularly to a game arrangement of the type simulating the game of volleyball. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">2. Description of the Prior Art Many type of toy and game arrangements utilized in the past have incorporated provisions for manual operation of structure to strike a ball and move the ball over a ball playing surface wherein the ball moves either in preselected paths or in random paths and, generally, after the manual operation moves by gravity forces. Typical of such prior art toys and games arrangements operable by one player are the conventional pin ball type of games. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Other types of prior art game arrangements of the same class have incorporated structure for allowing opposing players to strike a ball by manual operation of preselected structure thereby moving the ball from one playing area to another. However, there has generally not been provided a manually operated game arrangement of the type simulating the game of volleyball which may be played by anywheres from two to, for example, six players on each side. Such a game arrangement, of course, should closely simulate the real game of volleyball. That is, there should be provisions for independent manual operation of structure for driving the ball from one side of the ball playing surface to the other, there should be manually operable structure for serving the ball from one service area into the opposite playing area and there should also be provisions for structure simulating a net which divides the playing surface into the first and second playing areas, over which the ball must pass to move from the first playing area of the ball playing surface to the second playing area of the ball playing surface. Preferably, the structure for moving the ball from one playing area to the other, including the service structure, should be independently manually operable so that, for example, the game arrangement may be played in accordance with, as close as possible, the accepted rules governing the actual game of volleyball. As is known, the most important of these rules provides for service from regions outside the playing area proper, allow only a maximum of three hits of the ball while the ball is in one of the playing areas before it must be driven into the other playing area and the ball cannot be hit by the same player twice in a row. </div>

The actuator portion 206 also has a gripping member 266 extending through an aperture 268 in the intermediate plate 25 in regions external the ball playing volume 63 defined by the transparent cover 68 and the ball playing surface 48 of the intermediate plate 25. An. aperture 210 is also provided in the portion 86' of the transparent cover means 66 and the gripping member 266 extends t'herethrough to allow manual gripping thereof for movement in the direction indicated by the arrow 212 against compressing a spring means 214. When the actuator portion 261) of the first ball service means 190 is moved as far in the direction of the arrow 212 as desired it is released and the compressed energy of the spring means 214 moves the actuator portion 260 in the direction indicated by the arrow 216 until the ball engaging member 262 strikes a ball 112, indicated on FIG. 8 in dotted lines. The ball moves out of the first ball service 114 and, due to centrifugal force, generally stays against the arcuate ball guide wall 60 until it drops into the second playing area 66 where it may be struck by manual operation of one or more of the second plurality of ball strike means of the second ball playing means 92. 1f the bal1 continues around the arcuate guide wall 511 until it enters the second ball service area 84 intermediate the second intermediate wall 60 and the arcuate guide wall 611 adjacent the second end 54 thereof, it may be considered out of bounds and the player operating the second ball service means 192 then serves the ball and operates the structure in a manner similar to that described above. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Referring to FIG. 1, if the ball is missed by the players operating the first ball playing means 90 or second ball playing means 92 when the ball is in the first playing area 66 or second playing area 68, respectively, the ball moves until it is stopped by either the first ball return wall 70 or second ball return wall 74 and then is directed into the ball return portion 64. Apertures 220 and 222 are provided in the transparent coverplate 86 of the transparent cover means 88 above the ball return portion 64 and the ball may be removed therefrom and inserted in apertures 224 or 226 in the transparent coverplate 86 that are adjacent the ball engaging portions of the first ball service means 190 and second ball service means 192, respectively. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> If desired, a plurality of bumper means 226 may be dependent from the inner surface 85 of the transparent coverplate 86 of the transparent cover means 88 and one of the bumper means 226 may be intermediate each adjacent pair of the first plurality of ball strike means of the first ball playing means 90 and the second plurality of ball strike means of the second ball playing means 92. The bumper means 226 extend a preselected distance towards the ball playing surface 48 and engage the ball 112 when it passes thereby. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Since gravity is utilized to move the ball after it has been struck by the ball service means or the ball playing means in the preferred embodiment of the invention, as shown for example in FIG. 2, a support member 230 may be provided to support the ball transfer passageway 60 at a vertical elevation above the ball return portion 64. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> This concludes the description of the preferred embodiments of the present invention. From the above it can be seen that there has been provided a manually operable game arrangement that closely simulates the true game of volleyball in both manner of play and in rules that may be applied thereto. For example, after a successful service into either the first or second ball playing areas 66 or 68 the rules may require that the ball be struck no more than three times by the first or second ball playing means 90 and 92, respectively, and also, for example, that it may not be struck by any one of the plurality of ball strike means twice in a row. The divider wall 56 simulates the net in the true game of volleyball and the ball service areas 82 and 84 simulate the areas from which the ball is served in the true game of volleyball. The preferred embodiments of the invention has six ball strike means in each ball playing means 90 and 92. It will be appreciated that more or less than six may be included as desired. Further, the first and second ball service means 190 and 192, respectively, may be mounted on an external surface of a plate in a manner similar to that shown for the mounting of the ball strike means 152 in FIG. 7. The preselected spacing of the plurality of ball strike means in each of the first ball playing means 90 and second ball playing means 92 is such that, if desired, up to six people may play on each side, one operating each of the ball strike means. Similarly, two additional players, making a total of seven on each side, can be utilized to operate the ball service means 190 and 192. However, it will be appreciated that one person on each side may operate the plurality of ball strike means in each of the first ball playing means 90 and second ball playing means 92 as well as the first ball service means 190 and second ball service means 192. Therefore, the game may be quite successfully played by anywheres from two to fourteen players. </div>
