<div class="description-paragraph"> DI! U 3 1 NECK EXERCISING DEVICE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of my invention is to provide a neckexercising device that is in the shape of a hat that can be strapped to the head of the wearer. The hat has a brim which supports a circular track in which a ball is free to roll. The person can tilt the head and neck to cause the ball to travel around the endless track. The continuous movement of the head and neck must be done in a controlled manner in order to keep the ball rolling around the track while preventing the ball from accidentally jumping out of the track. The controlled movement of the head and neck will exercise and strengthen theneck muscles. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. I is a top plan view of the. hat and illustrates the circular track with a ball, representing the earth, being free to roll along the track. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> FIG. 2 is a side perspective view of the device shown strapped to the head of a person using the device. The </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">dotted lines indicate the variouspositions of the head and hat necessary for causing the ball to travel along the circular track. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> FIG. 3 is an enlarged transverse section taken through the hat along the line 3-3 of FIG. 1. The endless circular track is supported by the hat brim and the ball in the track is shown in section. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> FIG. 4 is a side elevation of FIG. 3 where the hat has been rotated 90 about its vertical axis in order to illustrate the two strap portions that depend-from the crown of the hat and these can be buckled together under the chin of the wearer for holding the hat in place on the head. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 5 is a section through a modified form of the device and illustrates a pair of endless tracks arranged in a concentric manner and supported by the hat brim. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In carrying out my invention I provide a neck exercising device in the form of a hat indicated generally at A and having a crown 1 and a brim 2. The brim may be of any desired diameter and it has an upturned flange 3 at its outer edge. If desired, the crown l of the hat A may be provided with a row of ventilation openings 4 that are preferably -arranged nearthe brim 2 and will permit air to circulate near the persons head when the hat is worn. A pair of straps B1 and B2 hang downwardly from the edge of the crown and are provided with the usual buckle for securing the straps under the chin of the wearer for holding the hat in place on the head as shown in FIG. 2. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A novel feature of the invention lies in the provision of a circular track C that extends around the crown l of the hat A and is preferably supported by legs 5 that are secured to the upper surface of the hat brim 2, see especially FIG. 3. The endless track is U-shaped in cross section and it receives a ball D that is free to roll around the track as the hat is tilted into different angular positions. FIG. 2 shows by dotted lines how the wearer of the hat A can sway his head so as to tilt the hat for propelling the ball D along the track. It requires a certain amount of dexterity for the person to move his head for keeping the ball rolling along the track without accidentally causing the ball to jump out of the track. However, if this should happen, the ball D would roll to the edge of the hat brim and be prevented from rolling off from the brim by the circular flange 3, see the dotted position of the ball D on the brim 2 in FIG. 2, where the ball has rolled against the flange 3. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The ball D may represent the planet earth as indicated in FIG. 2, and it is possible to provide data on the upper surface of the hat brim 2 to indicate the names and orbits of the other planets in the solar system, as well as giving the distance in miles these different planets are spaced from the sun, which might be represented by the crown l of the hat A. For-example, in FIG. 1 the orbits of the planets Venus and Mercury are shown lying within the circular track C which represents the orbit for the earth whichis the ball D. Next is the orbit of Mars followed by that of Jupiter. then Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and'Pluto. If a child uses the device to exercise his neck muscles, he can also learn the names of these different planets in the solar system as well as the tremendous distances they are removed from the sun. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> As already inferred, the main purpose for the device is to cause the wearer of the hat to exercise his neck muscles by causing the ball D to roll along the track C. A game could be played between two or more children oradults, each one wearing the device and seeing how long he can keep the ball D rolling in the track C without jumpingout. The winner would of course be the one that keeps the ball rolling in the circular track for the longest period of time. The rotary motion of the head and neck in-keeping the ball moving along the track is beneficial to the person having a neck problem or having stiffness of the neck muscles. The device is therefore more than a toy. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> A modified form of the invention is illustrated in the sectional view of FIG. 5. In this Figure the hat brim 2 supports not only the circular track C, but also another circular track E that is concentric with the endless track C. Another ball, not shown, and similar to the ball D would travel in the endless track E. In this case the person wearing the hat would'have to keep the two balls in the two'tracks moving along the tracks without jumping out. Any number of concentric tracks could thus be provided. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It is possible to make the brim 2 smaller in diameter and omit the data on top of the brim that indicates the different planets in the solar system and the number of miles they are removed from the sun. The invention can be used as a therapeutic as well as an amusement device by anyone. </div>
