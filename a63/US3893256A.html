<div class="description-paragraph">[5 7 ABSTRACT The disclosure relates to a flying toy which permits realistic control of a toy airplane, doll or the like wherein the toy is suspended from a sleeve or bearing through which pass a pair of filaments which are fixed together on a wall or the like at one end and are hand held at their other end. By moving apart the filaments and holding the filaments at a level below that at which they are attached to the wall, the toy can be made to travel uphill along the filaments. The forward nose of the toy may weighted whereby, upon the cessation of upward movement, the nose turns around due to the weight therein for subsequent downward travel along the filaments as they are again brought together. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A second feature of the disclosure is the use of plastic monofilaments which display low friction and allow operation using a sleeve, tube or wire loop and makes the use of rollers or pulleys unnecessary. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">12 Claims, 12 Drawing Figures TETI-IERED FLYING TOY This invention relates to a flying toy capable of simple and realistic control and, more specifically, to a flying toy capable of upward movement by means of a pair of monofilaments, the toy, if desired, also being capable of automatic rotation of 180 when upward movement thereof substantially ceases. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The concept of providing a toy aircraft or the like having a pair of strings passing therethrough which strings are attached at one end to a wall at a level higher than the position of the toy operator wherein separation of the strings by the operator causes the top aircraft to travel uphill along the strings has been known in the prior art as exemplified by US. Pat. No. 1,676,989. Toy aircraft of this type lack realism because they are capable of travelling up and down the strings in only one direction, that is, the nose of the aircraft is always facing upward or downward. Furthermore, the use of normal string or the like does not provide good slippage, thereby requiring that the angle for descent be large to prevent the aircraft from stopping due to friction between the string and sleeve, or alternatively requiring rollers to overcome the above noted prior art problem. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Briefly, in accordance with the present invention, the above noted problems of the prior art are overcome and there is provided a flying toy which is capable of realistic control in both the ascending and descending states. This is accomplished by utilizing monofilament strings passing through the sleeve which substantially diminish friction between strings and bearing. In addition, a weight can be positioned in the forward nose of the flying toy, the toy being capable of rotating 180 with respect to the sleeve whereby, when the forward velocity of the toy is sufficiently diminished, the turning movement due to the weight in the toy nose causes the toy to rotate by 180 whereby the toy can now descent in a forward position. If desired, a rudder-type device can be used to aid in prevention of rotation during toy movement, though this is not essential. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a flying toy which permits realistic control. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It is a further object of this invention to provide an inexpensive and simple flying toy capable of realistic control. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It is another object of this invention to provide a flying toy riding along a pair of plastic monofilament strings to obviate the requirement of pulleys or rollers. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The above objects and still further objects of the invention will become immediately apparent to those skilled in the art after consideration of the following preferred embodiments thereof, which are provided by way of example and not by way of limitation, wherein: </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> FIG. 1 is a view of elevation of a first embodiment of a flying toy in accordance with the present invention in the ascending state; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 2 is a view as in FIG. 1 but in the descending state; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> FIG. 3 is a view as in FIG. 2 wherein the rate of descent is decreased by moving the monofilament strings apart; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> FIG. 4 is a view of FIG. 3 with the distance from wall to operator shortened for landing; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> FIG. 5 is an enlarged view of the sleeve or bearing on the toy with monofilament strings separated for toy ascent; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> FIG. 6 is a view as in FIG. 5 with strings together for toy descent; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> FIG. 7 is a view as in FIG. 6 with strings separated to decrease rate of descent; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 8 is a front view of the sleeve mechanism; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> FIG. 9 is a cross-sectional side view of a toy aircraft according to the present invention; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> FIG. 10 is a cross-sectional a portion of view of the aircraft of FIG. 9; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> FIG. I1 is a view as in FIG. I wherein the aircraft has been replaced by a doll; and </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> FIG. 12 is a view as in FIG. 2 wherein the aircraft has been replaced by a parachutist attempting to land in a target. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Referring now to FIG. I, there is shown an operator 1 holding a pair of taut monofilament strings 3 and 5 in his hands, the strings passing through a sleeve 7 of a turning mechanism 9. The strings are attached to a wall 11 by means of a hook or the like 13, the hook being preferably positioned above the head of the operator 1. It should be understood that a single string can be used in place of strings 3 and 5, the single string being secured at its midpoint to the hook 13. Handles l5 and 17 are affixed to the strings 3 and 5 respectively for grasping by the hands of the operator 1. The aircraft 19 is secured to the turning mechanism 9, the aircraft and turning mechanism travelling up hill due to separation of the strings 3 and 5. This is shown in greater detail in FIG. 5. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Referring now to FIG. 2, the aircraft is shown during descent with the aircraft having rotated for reasons as will be explained in detail hereinbelow. It can be seen that strings 3 and 5 have been brought together to allow the aircraft 19 to travel down hill due to gravity and due to the reduced friction between strings and sleeve 7 due to the use of monofilament strings. This operation is shown in greater detail in FIG. 6. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Referring now to FIG. 3, there is shown the same operation as in FIG. 2. However, the rate of descent of the aircraft 19 is controlled by slight separation of the strings 3 and 5, the strings being allowed to converge at a predetermined rate as determined by the operator. This operation is shown in greater detail in FIG. 7. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Referring now to FIG. 4, it can be seen that the strings 3 and 5 are no longer taut as they were in the prior FIGURES. This is accomplished by having the operator I move forward. Forward movement of the operator combined with judicious operation of strings 3 and 5 will allow for a proper landing on the ground of aircraft 19. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Referring now to FIG. 8, the turning mechanism 9 is shown in detail. The mechanism 9 includes a sleeve or bearing portion 7 having a shaft 21 secured thereto and to a stop 23 at its other end. The operation of the turning mechanism is described with respect to FIGS. 9 and 10. It can be seen that the turning mechanism 9 has the shaft 21 passing through the top surface of the fuselage 25 of the aircraft 19, the stop 23 which is a flange on the shaft 21 being rotatable between ribs 27 and 29 on which ribs the stop abuts. This allows 180 movement to the stop and correspondingly to the shaft 21 and sleeve 7. A weight 31 is secured in the nose or forward end of the aircraft 19 which is positioned to tend to turn the aircraft counterclockwise due to the force of gravity as shown in FIGS. 9 and 10. The turning force is purposely small so that air currents against the tail section or rudder 33 during aircraft ascent will counterbalance the turning force from the weight 31. However, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">as the rate of aircraft ascent diminishes near the end of the uphill run, the airstream acting on the rudder becomes insufi'icient to counterbalance the rotational force due to weight 31, thereby allowing the aircraft to rotate l80 whereby the toy rotates causing ribs 27 and 29 to rotate whereby rib 27 is then positioned against stop 23 as shown in FIGS. 9 and 10. The aircraft is now ready for descent as shown in FIGS. 2 and 4. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Referring now to FIG. ll, there is shown a toy as in FIG. 1 except that the aircraft has been replaced by a doll 35. The interior of the doll will have the same turning structure as shown in FIGS. 8 to 10. The ruddertype element is not necessary since turning can take place without it, if desired. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Referring now to FIG. 12, there is shown a toy as in FIG. 3 except that the aircraft has been replaced by a parachutist 37. There is also shown a target 39 whereby the parachutist 37 can be made to land in the target by judicious operation of the toy as described above with respect to H65. 2 to 4. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Though the invention has been described with respect to specific preferred embodiments thereof. amny variations and modifications will immediately become apparent to those skilled in the art. lt is therefore the intention that the appended claims be interpreted as broadly as possible in view of the prior art to include all such variations and modifications. </div>
