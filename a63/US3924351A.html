<div class="description-paragraph"> KISSING DOLL HAVING AIR ACTUATED SOUNDER WHICH SOUNDS AFTER BUILDING PREDETERMINED PRESSURE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates generally to a doll and more particularly to a doll which will produce a realistic kiss including sound and lip movement. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Dolls which simulate babies or other human figures have always intrigued children. lnnumerable attempts have been made to add more lifelike characteristics and actions to these dolls. l-Ieretofore, one of the most difficult and complicated of attributes to simulate in dolls has been the kiss. Extremely complicated mechanisms are known which simulate the lip movements and kissing sound within dolls, but their complication has provided a high cost for the dolls. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is the primary object of this invention to provide a kissing doll in which the realistic kiss comprises a lifelike kissing sound accompanied by and coordinated with life-life movement of the lips and checks of the doll. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> A further object is to provide such a doll which is sturdy and durable while simple in operation and economical to produce. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The invention contemplates a kissing doll comprising a torso, arms, legs and a head, with sound producing means and puckering means mounted in said torso and head for simulating the sound and puckering action associated with a kiss. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The sound producing means includes bellows means for receiving and expelling air. The bellows means includes a squeezable body portion connected to a closable, flexible neck portion defining a passageway between the interior and exterior of said body portion whereby the air in said body portion is pressurized when said body portion is squeezed and said neck portion is closed, and a stop cock means associated with the neck portion which is selectively movable between a normally closed position and a normally open position, whereby pressurized air is expelled from said bellows means through the passageway when the stop cock means moves from its closed to its open positions, thereby producing a simulated kissing sound. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The puckering means includes an actuating means associated with a pair of lips and a pair of cheeks formed in a flexible facial portion of the head, whereby said actuating means provides outward puckering movement of the lips relative to their normal position and inward movement of the cheeks relative to their normal position simultaneously with the kissing sound. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a perspective view of the doll of the present invention, with its eyes closed and its lips in normal position; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> FIG. 2 is a perspective view similar to FIG. 1, showing the doll with its eyes open and its lips puckered for a kiss; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> FIG. 3 is a partial vertical section, on an enlarged scale, taken generally along the line 33 of FIG. 2; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> FIG. 4 is a partial vertical section taken generally along the line 44 of FIG. 3; and </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> FIG. 5 is an exploded perspective view, on an enlarged scale, of the elements of the sound producing mechanism of the invention. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Turning to FIGS. 14, the doll, generally designated 10, of the present invention includes a hollow torso 12, having arms 14, legs 16 and a hollow head 18 formed integrally therewith. The head is provided with simulated life-like facial features including closable eyes 20, a nose 22, cheeks 24 and a pair of lips 26, formed in a yieldable portion of the head 18. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The torso 12 is formed of flexible material, such as rubber or the like, which can be depressed by hand manipulation. Sound producing means, generally designated 30, (FIGS. 3, 4 and 5) are mounted inside the hollow torso 12 for simulating a sound associated with the human kiss. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The sound producing means includes a pivotally supported front member, generally designated 34, a pivotally supported rear member, generally designated 38, bellows means, generally designated 40, and stop cock means, generally designated 42. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The front member 34 includes a semi-tubular section 44 and a hemi-spheroid lower portion 46. A half disc shaped rib 48 is formed in the tubular section 44. The front member 34 also includes two ears or tabs 50 formed at the uppermost end thereof for pivotal support. The tabs 50 each have a hole 52 adaptable for receiving a pin 54. An additional pair of ears or tabs 58 are provided on member 34 at approximately the junction between the semi-tubular section 44 and the hemispheroidal section 46. The tabs 58 also include aligned holes 60. A generally horizontally, forwardly directed tab 62 and two upwardly directed connecting arms 64 are provided on the member 34 as part of the lip moving and eye closing means to be described in greater detail hereinafter. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The rear member 38 includes a generally flat bar section which is provided with two tabs 72 intermediate its ends, and a raised or thickened portion 74 in proximity to its lowermost end. A journal boss 76 is provided on the front of member 38. The journal 76 includes a hole 80 through which the rear member 38 is pivotally. connected to the front member 34 by means of the pin 54. The uppermost end of the rear member 38 includes a generally horizontally and frontwardly directed tab 82 which is provided with an upwardly directed pin 84. The pin 84 supports a small wire 86 which is an element in the puckering means to be described in greater detail hereinafter. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> A balloon or bellows means is formed in the shape of a squeezable body or resilient bulb 90 which is open at its uppermost end and connected to a more flexible neck portion 92. The neck portion 92 provides an air passageway between the interior and exterior of the bellows means 90. The stop cock means 42 is associated with the neck portion 92 and allows for the selective escapement of air from the bulb portion 90. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> More particularly, the stop cock means 42 includes a rotatable element having two ears 98 each of which is provided with a hole 100. The rotatable element is mounted on the tabs 58 of the front member 34 by means of a pin 102. The rotatable element is generally U-shaped and includes two generally downwardly directed ears 104. A cross bar portion 106 of the rotatable element supports a flexible gasket 108 (FIG. 5). </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The bellows means 90 and the neck portion 92 are cradled in the hemi-spheroidal section 46 and semitubular section 44, respectively, of the front member 34. The pivotal stop cock member is mounted on the front member 34 and is biased by a rubberband 110 toward a position which pinches the neck portion 92 closed between the gasket 108 and the rib 48. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The assembled sound producing means 30 is mounted within the hollow torso 12 in an orientation such that the hemi-spheroidal section 46 contacts the inside wall of the stomach area of the torso and the rear member 38 contacts the inside wall of the back area of the torso. Thus, when pressure is applied to the stomach and back portions of the doll, the thickened portion 74 of the rear member 38 will contact the bellows means 90. With further movement of the front member 34 and the rear member 38 towards one another the air within the bellows means 90 becomes pressurized. With continued movement of the front member 34 and the rear member 38 toward one another, the tabs 72 on the rear member 38 contact the ears 104 on the rotatable stop cock element and cause it to rotate about the pin 102 against the biasing force of the rubberband 110. This opening movement of the stop cock means 42 allows the pressurized air within the bellows means 90 to rapidly escape through the neck portion 92 and produces a simulated kissing sound due to vibrations of the neck portion caused by the passage of air therethrough. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> A one-way check valve 1 12 is mounted in the lowermost portion of the bellows means 90 and allows air to reenter the bellows means 90 after the actuation pressure is terminated and the stop cock 42 has been closed. Thus, the kissing sound is produced and the bellows means refilled merely by the single pinching action of the user on the stomach and back portion of the dolls torso. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> A puckering and dimpling means, generally designated 120 (FIGS. 4 and 5), is provided to simulate the life-like lip and cheek movements of a human kiss. The puckering and dimpling means 120 is associated with the front and rear members 34 and 38. As the sound producing means 30 is operated, the tab 62 on the front member 34 contacts the inside wall 122 of the head 18 behind the lips 26 and causes them to stretch and move outward relative to their normal, unstretched position as the front member 34 rotates about the pin 54. In addition, the ends of the wire 86 are attached to studs 126 provided on the inside walls of the cheeks such that as the rear member 38 rotates about the pin 54, the cheeks 24 will be moved slightly inwardly from their normal position, adding to the life-likeness of the kissing action. Thus, the doll l0 simulates the lip and cheek movements in a timed relation with the production of a sound associated with the human kiss. I </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In addition to the sound producing, puckering and dimpling means, there is provided an additional means, generally designated 130, for closing and opening of the dolls eyes. The eye closing and opening means 130 includes the two connecting arms 64 mounted on the top of the front member 34. The connecting arms 64, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">as seen in FIGS. 4 and 5, are flat and directed vertically upwardly from the sound producing means 30 and terminate in transverse plate portions 643. The transverse plate portions 64a of the connecting arms 64 are engageable with the rear ends of reciprocal rods 132 which are directed generally horizontally and forwardly toward the eyes 20. The eyes are received in the sockets 134 in the head 18 in normal fashion. The eyes 20 are of conventional design, including eyeballs which are pivotally mounted on horizontal side-to-side axes. As the rods 132 are pushed from the rear, the rods act on the eyeballs above their pivot axes and cause the eyeballs to rotate in a forward-downward direction to close the same, with eyelids and/or eye lashes formed thereon. As the front member 34 and the rear member 38 are pinched towards each other, the plate portions 64a of the connecting arms 64 push the rods 132 forwardly in the direction of arrow A (FIG. 3) which causes the eyes to rotate to a closed position. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Thus, as seen in FIG. 1, as the stomach portion of the torso is depressed relative to the back of the doll, the dolls eyes 20 will close, the lips will pucker and the cheeks will be depressed, all as a kissing sound is produced. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The foregoing detailed description has been given for clearness of understanding only and no unnecessary limitations should be understood therefrom as some modifications will be obvious to those skilled in the art. </div>
