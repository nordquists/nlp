<h2>Description</h2>
<div html="" itemprop="content"><div class="description" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office" mxw-id="PDES65373007">
<div class="description-paragraph">This is a continuation of application Ser. No. 941,921 filed Sept. 13, 1978, abandoned, which is in turn a division of application Ser. No. 816,700, filed July 18, 1977, now U.S. Pat. No.4,134,753 granted Jan. 16, 1979.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates to compounds of the general formula ##STR2## in which R<sub>1</sub> is halogen, (C<sub>1</sub> -C<sub>4</sub>)-alkyl, NO<sub>2</sub> or CN, R<sub>2</sub> is NO<sub>2</sub>, CN or CF<sub>3</sub>, n is 1 to 3, m is 0 to 2, X is O or S, R<sub>3</sub> is (C<sub>1</sub> -C<sub>4</sub>)-alkyl, R<sub>4</sub> is OH, (C<sub>1</sub> -C<sub>8</sub>)-alkoxy which may be substituted by halogen, (C<sub>1</sub> -C<sub>2</sub>)-alkoxy and/or hydroxyl, or is (C<sub>1</sub> -C<sub>6</sub>)-alkylthio, (C<sub>3</sub> -C<sub>6</sub>)-alkenyloxy, (C<sub>3</sub> -C<sub>6</sub>)-alkinyloxy, (C<sub>5</sub> -C<sub>8</sub>)-cycloalkyloxy, (C<sub>5</sub> -C<sub>8</sub>)-cycloalkenyloxy, amino, hydrazino, (C<sub>1</sub> -C<sub>4</sub>)-alkylamino, di-(C<sub>1</sub> -C<sub>4</sub>)-alkylamino, phenylamino, phenoxy or phenylthio (in which the phenyl radical may also be substituted by halogen, CF<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>3</sub>, OH and/or (C<sub>1</sub> -C<sub>2</sub>)-alkoxycarbonyl), or denotes the --OCat. group, where Cat. is the cation of an inorganic or organic base.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Preferred meanings of the radicals are: R<sub>1</sub> =halogen, especially Cl or Br; R<sub>2</sub> =NO<sub>2</sub> ; R<sub>3</sub> =CH<sub>3</sub> ; R<sub>4</sub> =(C<sub>3</sub> -C<sub>8</sub>)-alkoxy, which may be substituted, especially monosubstituted or disubstituted, by halogen and/or (C<sub>1</sub> -C<sub>2</sub>)-alkoxy, or R<sub>4</sub> =NH<sub>2</sub>, OH or OCat., with Cat preferably denoting an alkali metal cation, for example Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup>, ammonium or the cation of an organic base, such as, for example, dimethylamine or ethanolamine. n is preferably 1 or 2 and m is preferably 0 or 1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The compounds according to the invention can be manufactured by reacting phenoxyphenols of the formula ##STR3## if appropriate in the presence of an acid-binding agent, or reacting corresponding phenolates, with carboxylic acicd derivatives of the formula ##STR4## wherein X represents halogen, and converting the compounds of the formula (I) thus obtained, if desired, into other functional derivatives of the formula (I) by esterification, saponification, salt formation, trans-esterification or amidation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the formula (III), X preferably denotes chlorine or bromine. Accordingly, the starting materials used are above all 2-bromopropionic acid, 2-chloropropionic acid and their derivatives.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The reaction is advantageously carried out in an organic solvent. The solvents used are advantageously ketones, such as acetone or diethyl ketone, carboxylic acid amides, such as dimethylformamide, sulfoxides, such as dimethylsulfoxide, or aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene or toluene. If free phenols of the formula (II) are used as starting materials, the reaction is carried out in the presence of an alkaline compound in order to bind the hydrogen halide liberated, such as, for example, potassium carbonate or a tertiary organic base, for example triethylamine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">After completion of the reaction, the hydrogen halide salt formed is removed by filtration or treatment with water and, after subsequently removing the organic solvent, if appropriate, the ester formed, or other derivatives of the carboxylic acid obtained, are isolated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The derivatives thus obtained can be purified in accordance with customary processes, for example by distillation or by recrystallisation from organic solvents, which solvents may be mixed with water.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The various functional derivatives of the formula (I) can be converted into one another in a manner which is in itself known. For example, carboxylic acid esters obtained can be saponified with alkali, in which case it is advantageous to use aqueous alkali metal hydroxide solutions in the presence of lower alcohols, and to warm the mixture. The alkaline solution is finally acidified, whereupon the free acids separate out in a crystalline or oily form.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The free acids of the formula (I) obtained by saponification or by preparation from free halogenopropionic acids (R<sub>4</sub> =OH) can subsequently be converted into other esters in the usual manner. This is best done in the presence of catalytic amounts of an acid, such as sulfuric acid, toluenesulfonic acid or hydrochloric acid, or in the presence of other acid catalysts. Amongst the latter, Lewis acids, such as boron trifluoride, or acid ion exchangers, should be mentioned.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is also possible to use, for the esterification, the acid chlorides which are easily accessible, for example by reacting the carboxylic acids of the formula (I) with inorganic acid chlorides, for example thionyl chloride, and which, with the said alcohols, give the corresponding esters.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further derivatives of the formula (I) are obtained by reacting the acid chlorides or esters with amines or anilines.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The starting materials of the formula (II) are obtained, for example, by first preparing the corresponding diphenyl ethers from substituted phenols and chloroanisoles and then converting these by an ether scission, in a manner which is in itself known, into the desired phenoxyphenols.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The substances according to the invention exhibit, in the pre-emergence process and in the post-emergence process, a good herbicidal action against a number of dicotyledonous weeds which represent economically important problems in a great diversity of agricultural regions of the earth. In particular, they successfully combat species which are difficult to combat, such as cleavers (Galium) and Ipomoea, which are important harmful plants in the European climatic zone, on the one hand, and the sub-tropical/tropical culture regions, on the other hand, in addition to combating numerous other species of weeds. The compounds according to the invention are distinguished by being particularly well tolerated in monocotyledonous crops, such as wheat, barley, rice, sorghum and maize, but are also selectively active in some dicotyledonous crops such as soy beans, groundnuts and the like. In the said cultures, no damage whatsoever is observed even at concentrations of 2.5 kg/ha. Under advantageous conditions such as, for example, in water rice cultures, monocotyledonous weeds are also combated successfully in monocotyledonous crop plants, examples of such weeds being perennial sedges (Eleocharis) or annual plants such as Echinochloa and annual species of sedge.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The compounds can therefore be used for the manufacture of herbicidal agents, which contain 2-95% of the active compounds of the formula (I). These agents can be employed as emulsifiable concentrates, wettable powders, sprayable solutions, dusting agents and granules, in the form of the customary preparations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Wettable powders are formulations which are uniformly dispersible in water and which, in addition to the active compound, also contain diluents or inert materials, wetting agents, for example, polyoxyethylated alkylphenols, polyoxyethylated oleylamines or stearylamines, alkylsulfonates or alkylphenylsulfonates and dispersing agents, for example sodium ligninsulfonates, sodium 2,2'-dinaphthylmethane-6,6'-disulfonate or the sodium salt of oleyl-methyl-taurine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Emulsifiable concentrates are obtained by dissolving the active compound in an organic solvent, for example butanol, cyclohexanone, dimethylformamide, xylene or even higher-boiling aromatics, and adding a non-ionic wetting agent (emulsifier), for example a polyoxyethylated alkylphenol or a polyoxyethylated oleylamine or stearylamine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Dusting agents are obtained by grinding the active compound with finely divided solids, for example talc, natural clays, such as kaolin, bentonite, pyrophillite or diatomaceous earth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Sprayable solutions, such as are extensively marketed in aerosol cans, contain the active compound dissolved in an organic solvent, in addition to, for example, a mixture of fluorochlorohydrocarbons as the propellant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Granules can be manufactured either by spraying the active compound onto adsorbent, granular inert material or by applying active compound concentrates by means of adhesives, for example polyvinyl alcohol, sodium polyacrylate or even mineral oils, onto the surfaces of carriers, such as sand, kaolinites or granular inert material. Suitable active compounds can also be manufactured by the customary methods of manufacture of fertilizer granules, if desired using a mixture with fertilizers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the case of herbicidal agents, the concentrations of the active compounds in the commercial formulations can vary. In wettable powders, the active compound concentration varies, for example, between about 10% and 95%, and the remainder consists of the abovementioned formulation additives. In the case of emulsifiable concentrates, the active compound concentration is about 10% to 80%. Dust formulations contain in most cases 5-20% of active compound, and sprayable solutions about 2-20%. In the case of granules, the active compound content in part depends on whether the active compound is in a liquid or solid form and what granulating auxiliaries, fillers and the like are used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For use, the commercial concentrates are, if appropriate, diluted in the usual manner, for example by means of water in the case of wettable powders and emulsifiable concentrates. Formulations in the form of dusts and granules, and sprayable solutions are not diluted further, with additional inert materials, before use. The amount required to be used varies with the external conditions such as temperature, humidity and the likes. The amount can vary within wide limits, for example between 0.1 and 10.0 kg/ha of active substance but is preferably between 0.3 and 5 kg/ha.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The active compounds according to the invention can be combined with other herbicides and soil insecticides.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Another form of using the active compounds in question is to mix it with fertilizers, whereby combined fertilizing and herbicidal agents are obtained.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">To test the soil action, the compounds claimed were sprayed, in the pre-emergence method, onto pots in which various species of weeds had been sown beforehand. After application of the substances, the pots were set up in a greenhouse and the herbicidal action on the test plants was rated repeatedly. The final evaluation was made 4 weeks after treatment and gave the results shown in Table I.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The following were used as comparative agents ##STR29##</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The result of the treatment was determined, as also in the subsequent examples, by rating in accordance with the BOLLE scheme (Nachr.blatt des Dt. Pflanzenschutzdienstes 16, 1964, 92-94).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">To test the leaf action, the compounds were sprayed onto already emerged weeds, about 8-15 cm in height, which had been grown in pots. Thereafter, the herbicidal action in a greenhouse was rated, again at intervals of 3 weeks. This showed, as presented in Table II, that the activity against virtually all the harmful weeds tested was superior to that of the comparative substances. Species of weeds which are particularly difficult to combat, such as chrysanthemum, Ipomoea and others, were dealt with substantially more effectively.</div>
