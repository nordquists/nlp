<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">(1) Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This invention relates to a novel infrared absorbent for absorbing near infrared rays having a wavelength of 700-1500 nm or far infrared rays and also relates to an infrared absorbing material using the infrared absorbent such as an optical filter and an optical information recording medium.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(2) Description of the Prior Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Examples of applications of metal complexes to the infrared absorbent can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,588,216; 3,663,089; 3,850,502; 3,875,199; 3,979,583; 4,062,867; 4,152,332; and 4,335,952; Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 3452/71 and 7454/77; and Japanese Patent Application (OPI) Nos. 31748/74, 135886/76, 25060/79 and 21458/82.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">However, the infrared absorbent of metal complexes as disclosed in the above references mostly has an absorption maximum at a long wavelength of 850 nm or more. Further, to prepare the metal complexes having an absorption maximum at 800 nm or less, it was required to employ an expensive metal such as platinum, and it was difficult to produce the metal complex industrially.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, conventional infrared absorbents of organic dyestuffs were not sufficient in light and heat fastness in general, and thus most of them were not satisfactory in practical use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Heretofore, various applications of an infrared absorbing material capable of selectively absorbing rays of a far infrared light or a near infrared light having a wavelength of 700-1500 nm has been proposed. The following is five examples of conventional primary applications of the infrared absorbing material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(1) Safelight filter for infrared-sensitive materials:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Recently, there have been developed many silver halide light sensitive materials (which will be hereinafter referring to as "light sensitive materials") which are sensitive to rays of a far infrared light or a near infrared light having a wavelength of 700 nm or more. That is, light sensitive materials are made to have an infrared sensitivity irrespective of distinction of black and white photographs or color photographs including a normal-type, instant-type and thermal developed-type photographs, so as to be useful for an artificial color photograph for resource search or to be exposable with a light emission diode capable of emitting a light in an infrared area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Conventionally, a safelight filter for a panchromatic photosensitive material has been used as such infrared-sensitive materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(2) Control of growth of plants:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It has been long known that a so-called morphogenesis with regard to growth and differentiation of plants such as germination of seed, extension of stem, development of leaf, budding of flower and formation of tuber is influenced by a light, and it has been studied as a photomorphogenesis. It is also known that a red light having a wavelength of about 660 nm and a red light having a wavelength of about 720-730 nm antagonistically function to each other, and therefore time of flowering or earing, extent of growth or yield of fruits can be varied by changing a proportion of both the lights. Such a study has been made by controlling a spectral energy distribution of a light with use of a light source lamp and a filter in combination. Therefore, it was difficult to carry out a test in a large-scale green house or farm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">If a plastic film capable of selectively absorbing rays having a wavelength of 700 nm or more is obtainable, it will be possible to control a spectral energy distribution of a light to adapt the above-mentioned principle to an actual product cite, thereby providing a great progress and profit to an equipped agriculture. For example, it is expected that earing time may be delayed or growth may be controlled by covering plants with a near-infrared absorbing film at a specific time to cut-off light having a wavelength of 700 nm or more. (See "Chemical Control of Plants", Katsumi Ineda, Vol. 6, No. 1 (1971))</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(3) Cut-off of heat radiation:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Among solar radient energy rays of a near infrared and an infrared area having wavelength of 800 nm or more is absorbed by an object and converted to a thermal energy. In addition, a large part of its energy distribution is converged at a near infrared area having a wavelength of 800-2000 nm. Accordingly, a film capable of selectively absorbing rays of a near infrared light is remarkably effective for cut-off of a solar energy, and its is possible to suppress an increase in temperature in a room admitting visible light. Such a film may be adapted to a window of a house, office, store, automobile and airplane, etc. as well as gardening green house. In particular, as to the green house, a temperature control is very important, and if temperature is excessively elevated, plants will be greatly damaged to finally result in withering. Accordingly, when the near infrared absorbing film is used, the temperature control may be rendered easy, and a new technique such as retarded cultivation in summer may be developed. A conventional heat radiation cutting-off material includes a thin metallic layer deposited on a surface of a plastic film or an inorganic compound, e.g., FeO dispersed in a glass.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(4) Cut filter of infrared rays noxious to tissues of human eyes:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Infrared rays contained in sun light or in light radiated in welding have a harmful influence to tissues of human eyes. One of the primary applications of the infrared cut filter is an application to spectacles for protecting the human eyes from rays of light containing such harmful infrared rays, e.g., sunglasses and protecting glasses in welding.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(5) Infrared cut filter for semiconductor light receiving element:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In another field where development of this kind of infrared absorbing plastics is most intensitively desired, the infrared absorbing plastics are adapted to an infrared cut filter for a photosensor to make the spectral sensitivity of a semiconductor light receiving element such as silicon photo diode (which will be hereinafter referred to as SPD) approach to a relative spectral sensitivity curve.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Presently, SPD is mainly used as a light receiving element of a photosensor used in an automatic exposure meter for a camera or the like. FIG. 2 shows a graph of the relative spectral sensitivity curve and that of a relative value of an output of SPD to each wavelength.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In order to use SPD for an exposure meter, it is required to cut-off a light in an infrared area which is not sensitive to human eyes and to make the spectral sensitivity curve of SPD shown in FIG. 2 approach to the relative spectral sensitivity curve. Particularly, as an output of SPD is large to the light having a wavelength of 700-1100 nm, and the eyes are insensitive to such a light, this is one of factors of malfunction of the exposure meter. Therefore, if it is possible to use an infrared absorbing plastic film suppressing an absorption of a visible light area, while permitting an absorption of an infrared light area in the entire range of 700-1100 nm, light transmittance in a visible area may be increased and an output of SPD may be also increased. Thus, it will be possible to apparently remarkably improve a performance of the exposure meter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Conventionally, this kind of photosensor has been practically used by mounting an infrared cut filter made of glass containing an inorganic infrared absorbent to a front surface of SPD.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(6) Infrared cut-off filter for color solid pick-up element:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Recently, the combination of a color solid pick-up element and a micro color filter has been widely used for a camera for video tape recorder or the like. A photoconductive film and a solid pick-up element used for a usual pick-up tube are sensitive even in a wavelength area of 700 nm or more. Therefore, in order to separate a visible light having a wavelength of 400-700 nm, it is necessary to cut off near infrared rays of 700 nm or more. To this end, a near-infrared cut-off optical filter material has been conventionally used by forming a multi-layer interference film of inorganic materials on the surface of a lens by a vacuum evaporation process, but, differences between lenses are large. Then, if it is possible to form an infrared cut-off layer on a color separation filter layer by a lamination process or an on-wafer process, a satisfactory color reproduction may be expected without being influenced by the lens differences.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this connection, it has been intensively desired to develop an infrared cut-off filter material to be incorporated in such a color pick-up tube and a color solid pick-up device using CCD (charge coupled device) and MOSFET (insulated gate type field effect device).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(7) Heat converter of visible and infrared rays:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The infrared absorbing material as a reaction acceleraor can be added to a thermodrying or thermosetting composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(8) Application to optical information recording medium for laser beam writing:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Conventionally, there are many known optical recording mediums for laser beam writing. The optical recording medium is typically formed by depositing a metal, metalloid or non-metal on a substrate by evaporation, or by depositing a dye by evaporation or coating the same on the substrate. Such application to a laser beam recording/reading medium is, for example, described in Japanese Patent Application (OPI) No. 11090/82.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">However, with respect to the above-mentioned applications, the conventional infrared absorbing materials as used had the following shortcomings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The safelight filter for the panchromic photosensitive material in the afore-mentioned applications (1) permits a green light having a high luminosity factor to be partially transmitted, and also permits a large quantity of infrared light to be transmitted to cause fogging. For this reason, such a safelight filter has not been able to achieve its object for infrared-senstive materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the applications (3), the metallic layer deposited plastic film or the FeO dispersed glass functions to intensively absorb not only infrared light but also visible light to cause reduction in inside luminance. For this reason, such as plasic film or glass is not suitable for agricultural uses because of lack of an absolute quantity of sunshine. Especially, the filter material for growth control of plants in the applications (2) is required to selectively absorb a light having a wavelength of 700-750 nm, and therefore the metallic layer deposited film is quite unsuitable for such an object.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Furthermore, in the applications (5), the infrared cut filter using the infrared absorbent containing an inorganic substance is relatively fast to heat and light, but light transmittance in a visible area is low. To cope with this, a sensitivity of SPD was intended to be increased. However, an increase in the sensitivity of SPD results in an increase in leak current to cause a malfunction of the photosensor, resulting in a big problem in reliability. Additionally, since the infrared cut filter contains an inorganic substance, there is a lack in flexibility in production of a photosensor and a difficulty in improving a production process. Further, the infrared cut filter containing an inorganic substance causes a high production cost to result in a great increase in cost of the photosensor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Furthermore, in the applications (8), the optical information recording medium prepared by depositing metal, etc. by vapor deposition had a defect in its productivity and was inferior in oxidation resistance and hydrolysis resistance of a recording layer. On the other hand, many of the optical information recording mediums prepared by coating or evaporations-depositing dyes did not have an absorption in a wavelength area of a semiconductor laser beam as used. Further even if the recording medium had an absorption in the wavelength area, weather resistance was not satisfactory. These optical information recording mediums were also not satisfactory in such that they had low sensitivity to a semiconductor laser beam and low stability.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">A substituent as represented by R<sup>1</sup> to R<sup>4</sup> in formulae [I]-[VI] influences a wavelength of light absorption maximum of the complex, and when an electron donating property of the substituent becomes larger, or the number of an electron donating substituent is increased, the absorption maximum tends to shift to a larger wavelength side. Further, the type of the counter anion has large influence on solubility of the complex. In the case that the counter anion is a halogen atom, PF<sub>6</sub> <sup>-</sup>, BF<sub>4</sub> <sup>-</sup>, AlF<sub>6</sub> <sup>3-</sup>, SbF<sub>6</sub> <sup>2-</sup>  or SiF<sub>6</sub> <sup>2-</sup>, it acts to enhance solubility to water in general. On the other hand, B(ph)<sub>4</sub> <sup>-</sup>  and alkylbenzene sulfonate anion act to enhance solubility to an organic solvent or organic binder. A lipophilic nucleus substituent of the ligand also improves solubility to an organic solvent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The compounds as employed in the present invention may include a compound containing an anionic substituent in the aromatic ring of the complexes in the above-mentioned formulae. An example of such a compound is represented by the following formula. ##STR18##</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the following, there will be described the preparation of the infrared ray absorbing material of the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The infrared absorbent of the present invention may be used by allowing the compounds represented by the general formulae [I]-[VI] to be contained in a suitable binder or be coated on a suitable support. The binder may be any organic and inorganic materials capable of exhibiting an infrared absorbing property, which materials may be high polymer materials such as plastics or inorganic materials such as glass, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The binder is preferably capable of forming a film which is superior in transparency and mechanical property. Examples of such a film forming binder may include polyesters such as typically polyethylene terephthalate, cellulose esters such as cellulose acetate, cellulose triacetate and cellulose acetate butylate, polyolefins such as polypropylene, polyvinyl compounds such as polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate copolymer, and polystyrene, acrylic addition polymers such as polymethyl methacrylate, polycarbonates such as polycarbonic acid ester, phenol resin, urethane resin or gelatin as a known hydrophilic binder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As one of methods of forming a film by adding the compounds of formulae [I]-[VI] to the above-mentioned plastic materials or incorporating the same with the plastic materials, the compounds of formulae [I]-[VI] is incorporated in the plastics before preparing the film. Namely, the compounds of formulae [I]-[VI] are mixed with a polymer powder or pellet together with various additives, and are molten to extrude the mixture by a T-die process or a tubular film process, or make the mixture into a film by calendering thereby to give a film containing the compounds as uniformly dispersed. In case of preparing the film from a polymer solution by a casting method, the compounds of the formulae [I]-[VI] may be contained in the polymer solution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a second method, an infrared absorbing layer may be formed by applying a polymer or dispersion containing the compounds of formulae [I]-[VI] onto a surface of various plastic films or glass plates as prepared by a suitable method. A binder polymer used for a coating liquid is selected from materials having a good solubility of the compounds of formulae [I]-[VI] and a superior adhesiveness to the plastic film or glass plate as a support. For example, a suitable one of these materials may be polymethyl methacrylate, cellulose acetate butylate, or polycarbonate. Optionally, a suitable undercoat may be preliminarily formed on the support film for purpose of improving adhesiveness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a third method, a filter may be formed in a frame of a light window of an element to be isolated from infrared rays with use of a polymer prepared by mixing the compounds of the formulae [I]-[VI] with a polymerizable monomer and adding a suitable polymerization initiator to polymerize the mixture with heat or light. In this method, the element may be entirely enclosed by plastics as prepared from ethylene unsaturated polymerizable monomer or addition polymerizable composition such as epoxy resin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a fourth method, the compounds of formulae [I]-[VI] may be deposited by evaporation on a suitable support. In this method a suitable film forming binder layer as a protective layer may be formed on the deposited layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A method of utilizing the near-infrared absorbent of the present invention for a color solid image pick-up element is as follows:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(1) A plurality of stripe or mosaic color separation filter layers having predetermined spectral characteristics are formed, and then the near-infrared absorbent is incorporated in a surface protective layer to be formed on the filter layers, or the absorbent is deposited on the surface protective layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(2) The near-infrared absorbent of the present invention in combination with a visible light absorbing dyestuff may be incorporated in the color separation filter layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(3) The near-infrared absorbent may be incorporated in a transparent intermediate layer or a surface smooth layer provided in a multi-layer color separation filter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">An optical filter obtained by combining the infrared absorbent of the present invention with a suitable binder is especially effective when it is used in combination with color separation filters as described in Japanese patent application (OPI) Nos. 58107/82, 9317/84 and 30509/84.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In preparing an infrared absorbing material with use of the infrared absorbent of the present invention, two or more of the compounds represented by general formulae [I]-[VI] may be used in combination. Further, a known near-infrared absorbent of organic or metal complex substance may be used in combination. Particularly, when an absorbent having an absorption maximum different from that of the absorbent of the invention is used in combination, a range of absorption wavelength may be widened.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is effective to add an ultraviolet absorbent to the infrared absorbent in the infrared absorbing material for purpose of improving a light fastness. Examples of the ultraviolet absorbent may include substituted or unsubstituted benzoates such as resorsin monobenzoate and methyl salicylate, cinnamates such as 2-oxy-3-methoxy cinnamate, benzophenones such as 2,4-dioxy-benzophenone, α,β-unsaturated ketones such as 2,4-dibenzal acetone, coumarins such as 5,7-dioxy-coumarin, carbostyrils such as 1,4-dimethyl-7-oxycarbostyril, or azoles such as 2-phenyl benzoimidazole and 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)benzotriazole.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In case of a film prepared by a coating method in combination of the infrared absorbent of the invention with a suitable binder, a thin plastic film may be attached or coated on a surface of the coating layer for purposes of protection or providing anti-stick quality. For example, a laminated film may be obtained by laminating a polyvinyl chloride film having a thickness of 0.05 mm on the coating layer and heat-bonding the whole at 120°-140° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In preparing the optical filter material from the infrared absorbent of the present invention, 0.1-50 parts by weight, preferably 0.5-10 parts by weight of the compounds of formulae [I]-[VI] are contained in 100 parts by weight of the binder. An optical filter is obtained by working and treating the optical filter material so as to have a sufficient degree of transmittance in a wavelength range where infrared rays are to be cut-off. Accordingly, it is necessary to adjust a content of the compounds with respect to the binder and a thickness of the filter, so as to obtain a transmittance of 10% or less, preferably 2.0% or less, and more preferably 0.1% or less in the wavelength range of 900 nm or more at the trough of a transmittance curve. Although a practical thickness of the filter is in the range of 0.002 mm to 0.5 mm, it is possible to employ any filters having a thickness out of the abover range according to applications.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the following, there will be described for applications of the infrared absorbent of the present invention to the optical information recording medium.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Although the optical recording medium of the present invention is basically constituted of a substrate and a recording layer, it may have an undercoating layer on the substrate and a protective layer on the recording layer, optionally.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The substrate employable in the present invention is selected from appropriate known materials which are transparent relative to a laser beam to be used. Typical examples of the substrate may include glass and plastics such as polyacrylate, polycarbonate, polysulfonate and polyimide. A shape of the substrate may be disc-, card-, sheet- or roll film-like, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The glass or plastic substrate may have a guide channel to render the tracking easy during recording. Further, the glass or plastic substrate may be provided with an undercoating layer of plastic binder, inorganic oxide or inorganic sulfide. The undercoating layer has a heat conductivity preferably lower than that of the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The recording layer in the present invention may be classified to a layer prepared singly from α-diimine metal complex as represented by the formulae [I]-[VI], or in combination with other materials, and a layer formed of a reflective layer and a light absorbing layer containing the α-diimine metal complex. The recording layer prepared singly from the α-diimine metal complex or in combination with other materials may be formed according to various processes such as coating of a solution of the α-diimine metal complex in a solvent on the substrate, deposition of the solution on the substrate by evaporation, coating of a mixture of the metal complex with a resin solution, coating of a mixed solution of the complex with other dyes, or coating of a solution of the complex and other dye in a resin solution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Examples of the resin to be used may include PVA, PVP, polyvinylbutylal, polycarbonate, nitrocellulose, polyvinylformal, methylvinylether, maleic anhydride copolymer or styrene-butadiene copolymer. A weight ratio of the α-diimine metal complex represented by the formulae [I]-[VI] to the resin is preferably 0.01 or more. Other dyes, which have an absorption in a wavelength area other than that of a semiconductor laser beam, such as triarylmethane, metallocyanine, cyanine, azo or anthraquinone dyes are preferable because recording by He-Ne laser as well as the semiconductor laser is possible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the present invention, one or more recording layers are formed. A film thickness of the recording layer is normally 0.01-1 μm, preferably 0.08-0.8 μm. In case of reflective reading, the film thickness is most preferably odd number times as thick as 1/4 of a wavelength of laser beam to be used for reading.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the case that the reflective layer for semiconductor laser or He-Ne laser is formed, either of the following methods may be employed. That is, the reflective layer is formed on the substrate, and then the recording layer prepared singly from the α-diimine complex of the formulae [I]-[VI] or in combination with other materials is formed on the reflective layer by the aforementioned processes. In another way, the recording layer is formed on the substrate, and then the reflective layer is formed on the recording layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The reflective layer may be formed by sputtering method, ion plating method or the following method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For example, a metal salt or metal complex is dissolved in a water-soluble resin (PVP or PVA, etc.), and a reducing agent is added to the solution. Then, the solution is coated onto the substrate, and is dried with heat at 50°-150° C., preferably 60°-100° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A weight ratio of the metal salt or metal complex to the resin is 0.1-10, preferably 0.5-1.5. In this case, a film thickness of the recording layer is suitably such that the metal particle reflective layer has a thickness of 0.01-0.1 μm and the light absorbing layer has a thickness of 0.01-1 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Examples of the metal salt or metal complex to be used may include silver nitrate, potassium silver cyanide, potassium gold cyanide, silver amine complex, silver cyan complex, gold salt and gold cyan complex. Examples of the reducing agent to be used may include formaline, tartaric acid, tartrate, hypophosphite, boron sodium hydride, and dimethyl amine boran. The reducing agent may be used in an amount of 0.2-10 mol., preferably 0.5-4 mol. per 1 mol. of the metal salt or metal complex.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the optical recording medium of the present invention, recording of information is carried out by irradiating a spot-like high energy beam such as laser beam through the substrate onto the recording layer, or from the opposite side of the substrate onto the recording layer thereby to convert the light absorbed in the recording layer to heat, and form a pit in the recording layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, reading of information is carried out by irradiating a laser beam onto the recording layer with a low output energy not greater than a threshold energy used for recording to detect information by a change in reflection quantity of light between the pit portion and the other portion where the pit is not formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The infrared absorbent of the present invention has an absorption maximum at a wavelength of 700-900 nm and has a good fastness to heat and light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Among the infrared absorbents of the present invention, an infrared absorbent comprising the metal complex represented by general formula [I] has a high transmittance of visible light. On the other hand, an infrared absorbent comprising at least one of the metal complex represented by general formulae [II]-[VI] has an absorption maximum at a wavelength of about 700-800 nm and simultaneously has high absorptivity of visible light single without being combined with other absorbents. Then, the latter infrared absorbent is utilized preferably to such applications as safelight filter for visible rays- and infrared rays-sensitive material and heat converter of visible and infrared rays.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The infrared absorbent of the present invention is a metal complex which may be easily produced by low cost raw materials such as salts of iron, cobalt or nickel, and it may be formed into an infrared absorbing material which is cost reducing and has a superior fastness to heat and light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, according to the infrared absorbent of the present invention, it is possible to adjust solubility of the absorbent to a solvent by suitably selecting and combining the ligand and the counter ion in the infrared absorbent of organic metal complex. Accordingly, various binders may be widely utilized in preparing the infrared absorbing material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The infrared absorbent of the present invention may be applied for example, to an absorbing material for simultaneously absorbing visible rays and infrared rays, to safelight filter for infrared-sensitive material, or to infrared absorbing coating material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The optical information recording medium using the infrared absorbent of the present invention has a high sensitivity, weather resistance, hydrolysis resistance and stability, and is not deteriorated in recording characteristics and reproducing characteristics after storage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The optical recording medium of the present invention can be applied to both a write-once type and an erasable-reusable type. In the case that a change occurring in the recording medium is permanent in dependence upon an output of semiconductor laser beam applied to the recording medium, damping factor of an optical system or recording speed, the recording medium is of the write-once type. On the other hand, in the case that the metal complex according to the present invention is used in combination especially with tellurium, its salt or its oxide to reversibly recover a change in transmittance or reflectance, the recording medium is of the erasable-reusable type.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Moreover, the infrared absorbent of the present invention is variously applicable including the optical filter and the optical information recording medium according to its infrared absorbing characteristics. For example, when the infrared absorbent is added to an ink jet printer ink as described in Japanese patent application (OPI) No. 135568/81, a reading efficiency by visible or near-infrared rays may be improved. The composition according to the present invention has such a property as of converting visible and near-infrared rays as absorbed to heat, and therefore it may be utilized as a visible and infrared rays/heat exchanger. Typical examples of such an exchanger are as follows:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(1) The composition is added to a laser heat sensitive recording material as described in Japanese patent application (OPI) Nos. 14095/82 and 14096/82 and an infrared laser is irradiated to the composition to generate heat, thereby enhancing a mixed coloring reaction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(2) The composition may be contained in a regist material as described in Japanese patent application (OPI) No. 40256/82 which material may change solubility by a thermal function due to a laser beam.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(3) The composition may be contained in a thermodrying or thermosetting composition as described in Japanese patent application (OPI) No. 143242/81 to accelerate a reaction.</div>
