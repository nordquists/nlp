<div class="description-paragraph">The isothiazole derivative represented by the formula (I) is produced according to the reaction formulae described below. ##STR3## wherein R<sup>1</sup>, R<sup>2</sup> and Z are as defined above, R represents an alkyl group and X represents a halogen atom.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A compound (II), a starting material, is alkynylated with an alkynyl halide at room temperature to 100° C. in the presence of a base (e.g. potassium carbonate, sodium methoxide) to obtain a compound (IIa). The compound (IIa) is then iodinated at 0° C. to 20° C. to synthesize a compound (Ia), which is then oxidized with a peracid (e.g. hydrogen peroxide) at room temperature to 100° C. to obtain a sulfoxide or sulfone (Ib). The sulfone (Ib) is substituted with an alcohol, thiol or amine at 0° C. to room temperature in the presence of a base to obtain a compound (Ic). This substitution may be carried out before iodination of the alkynyl group. That is, the compound (IIb) obtained by the oxidation of the compound (IIa) is substituted with an alcohol, thiol or amine to obtain a compound (IIc), and then the compound (Ic) can be synthesized by iodination of the compound (IIc). Similarly, compounds having an iodoalkynyloxyalkylthio group, etc. at the 5-position can also be synthesized. For example, a compound (IId), a starting material, is reacted in the presence of a base to obtain a compound (IIe), which is then iodinated to obtain a compound (Id). Also, a compound (III), a starting material, is successively and stepwise reacted with an alkyl halide and alkynyl halide to obtain a compound (IIIa), which is then iodinated to obtain a compound (Ie). The compounds (II) and (III), a material, can be synthesized by the methods described in the literatures [J.O.C., 28, 2163 (1962); J.O.C., 29, 665 (1965)], respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In every reaction, any solvent may be used if it is a solvent which does not disturb the reaction. For example, there are given ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, cyclohexanone, etc.; ethers such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, dimethoxyethane, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, monoglyme, diglyme, etc.; esters such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, etc.; halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloroethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, tetrachloroethane.; aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, chlorobenzene, nitrobenzene, toluene, etc.; nitriles such as acetonitrile, etc.; dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide, water and mixed solvents obtained by combination of these solvents. When a two-phase reaction is carried out with the mixed solvent, phase transfer catalysts such as triethylbenzylammonium chloride, trioctylmethylammonium chloride, etc. can also be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present compound is useful as fungicides and/or bactericides for use in agriculture, industry and medical treatment.

<div class="description-paragraph">As deflocculating agents for suspension preparations, there can also be used auxiliaries such as for example naphthalenesulfonic acid condensates, phosphates and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Defoaming agents, for example silicone oil, etc., can also be added.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When the present compound is used as agricultural and horticultural fungicides, the proper amount of the active ingredient varies with various factors such as for example object of use, target crops, condition of growth of crops, tendency of outbreak of diseases, weather, environmental conditions, preparation forms, how, where and when the fungicides are used, and the like. However, the amount thereof is selected from the range of 0.1 g to 1 kg/10 ares.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The blending ratio of the active ingredient can be increased or decreased as need arises. When the active ingredient is formulated into dusts or granules, its blending ratio is usually 0.5 to 20%, and when it is formulated into emulsifiable concentrates, suspension formulations or wettable powders, its blending ratio is usually 0.1 to 90%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The agricultural and horticultural fungicide containing the present compound as an active ingredient may also be used in mixture with other agricultural and horticultural fungicides with the object of decreasing the amount of the medicine in order to extend the range of target diseases to be controlled and to make longer a period during which the fungicides can be used for controlling. The agricultural and horticultural fungicides containing the present compound as an active ingredient shows a remarkable fungicidal effect on the foregoing diseases doing damage to crops in paddy field, crops in upland field, fruit trees, vegetables, other crops, flowers and ornamental plants, etc. Therefore, at a time when outbreak of the diseases is forecast, by just timely applying the fungicide to water in paddy field, soil in upland field and foliage of fruit trees, vegetables, other crops and flowers and ornamental plants before outbreak of the diseases or at a point when the outbreak has been confirmed, the agricultural and horticultural fungicide of the present invention exhibits an expected effect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The industrial fungicide and/or bactericide containing the present compound as an active ingredient can be used in wood products such as plywood, products made of wood, particle boards, fiber boards and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When the present compound is used for wood preservatives, it is applied to wood by means such as surface treatment, pressure injection and vacuum injection. The surface treatment is carried out by applying the present compound to wood part as it is or in dilution with water by coating, spraying, dipping and the like. Alternatively, by adding the present compound to a plywood adhesive and applying the adhesive, particularly, to building materials, the present compound can be used as a controlling agent for wood-rotting fungi.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The medicine used in the treatment varies with the kind of preparations, when, where and how the preparation is used, kind of wood-rotting fungi, degree of damage, etc. Usually, however, it will suffice to apply the medicine containing the active ingredient in an amount of 0.1 to 40 g per 1 m<sup>2</sup> of wood part.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When the present compound is used as wood preservatives, it may be used in mixture with other wood preservatives, insecticides, acaricides, termiticides, fungicides and/or bactericides or synergists with the object of decreasing the content of the active ingredient of the present invention or extending the effect of the active ingredient. The wood preservative used includes for example 3-iodo-2-propynylbutylcarbamate, 3-iodopropargyl, zinc naphthenate, etc., and the termiticides used includes chlorpyrifos, phoxim, fenitrothion, permethrin, cypermethrin, fenvalerate and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present compound is also useful as antimycotic agents useful to disinfect the hands and feet of man and animals and treat mycotic infection. For example, these antimycotic agents can be used to treat local mycotic infection, mucosa infection and general mycotic infection caused by Trichophyton, Candida, Aspergillus and the like. The present compound is used alone, or, before use, it is mixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier or diluent to prepare a composition, which is then formulated into preparations having a form suitable for oral or parenteral administration such as for example liquid formulations, tablets, suppositories, emulsions, ointments, creams, lotions, poultices and the like. If necessary, these preparations may contain auxiliaries, stabilizers, wetting agents or emulsifiers, buffer solutions and other commonly used additives. The amount of the compound administered varies with symptom, age, body weight, administration form, etc. In the case of general treatment, however, the amount is usually 0.05 to 100 mg, preferably 0.5 to 50 mg/1 kg of body weight/day/one adult, and this amount can be taken in one dose or several doses. In the case of local treatment, an optimum concentration of the active ingredient is 0.001% to 5%, preferably 0.1 to 2%.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">The following fungi were cultured in agar media, respectively, and mycelial disks on the media were stamped out together with the agar using a cork borer of 4 mm in diameter. The resulting mycelial disks on agar were used as an inoculum. Each test compound of 50 ppm was added to a malt extract agar medium and added in parts to Petri dishes. The above prepared inoculum was put on the Petri dishes and cultured at 28° C.±2° C. Two to ten days after inoculation, the diameter of the mycelial disk of each fungus was measured, and the mycelium growth-inhibitory rate was obtained according to the following equation. ##EQU1##</div>
