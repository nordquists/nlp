<h2>Description</h2>
<div html="" itemprop="content"><div class="description" lang="EN" load-source="patent-office" mxw-id="PDES67113102">
<div class="description-paragraph">The invention relates to ribo-nucleoside analogues in which the 2'-OH group is etherified by hydroxyethyl or fluoroalkyl groups, to a process for the preparation thereof, to oligonucleotides comprising those nucleosides and to the use of the nucleosides for the preparation of oligonucleotides having identical or different nucleoside units in the molecule.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Nucleosides and oligonucleotides, both as anti-viral active ingredients and because of their ability to interact with nucleic acids ("anti-sense" oligonucleotides) and the biological activity associated therewith, have attracted a great deal of interest; see, for example, Uhlmann, E., Peyman, A., Chemical Reviews 90:543-584 (1990). In order to provide nucleosides having new properties or to improve the interaction of anti-sense oligonucleotides with natural nucleic acids and to improve their stability towards nucleases, the sugar residues of nucleosides (or of the nucleotide units in oligonucleotides), or the inter-nucleotide phosphate bond in oligonucleotides have been modified in a wide variety of ways; see, for example, Marquez, V. E., Lim, M. I., Medicinal Research Reviews 6:1-40 (1986), Helene, C., Toulme, J. J., Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1049:99-125 (1990), Englisch, U., Gauss, D. H., Angewandte Chemie 103:629-646 (1991), Matteucci, M. D., Bischofberger, N., Annual Reports in Medicinal Chemistry 26:87-296 (1991). In Cook, P. D., Anti-Cancer Drug Design 6:585-607 (1991) and WO 91/06556, nucleosides that have been modified at the 2'-OH group of the sugar are described. The described modifications result in increased nuclease-resistance; the longer the alkyl radical becomes, the higher becomes the nuclease-resistance. With short alkyl radicals such as methyl, ethyl or propyl, a slight increase in binding affinity is observed while with longer chains the binding affinity falls off drastically. Nucleosides having hydroxyethyl or fluoroalkyl groups as side-chains of the 2'-OH group have never been incorporated in oligonucleotides until now. Surprisingly, the modifications according to the invention increase the binding affinity for complementary RNA in comparison with unsubstituted alkyl chains of the same length. This result was not to be expected on the basis of the published data. Analogously to the 2'-OH-modified oligoribonucleotides, the compounds according to the invention are similarly distinguished by a marked nuclease-resistance. In addition, oligonucleotides that comprise the nucleosides according to the invention show increased cellular uptake and consequently have improved bio-availability and activity in vivo.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">Y is a nucleotide bridge group,</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">U, V and W are each independently identical or different radicals of natural or synthetic nucleosides and at least one of the radicals U, V and/or W is a radical of formula VI ##STR11## and B and R<sub>3</sub> are as defined for the compounds of formula I, including the preferred definitions and examples.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A preferred bridge group Y is the group --P(O)O.sup.⊖ -- which occurs in natural oligonucleotides. Examples of other bridge groups are --P(O)S.sup.⊖ --, --P(S)S<sup>--</sup> --, --P(O)R<sub>16</sub> --, P(O)NR<sub>17</sub> R<sub>18</sub> and --CH<sub>2</sub> -- wherein R<sub>16</sub> is H or C<sub>1</sub> -C<sub>6</sub> alkyl and R<sub>17</sub> and R<sub>18</sub> each independently of the other have the definition of R<sub>16</sub>. In formula V, x is preferably a number from 0 to 100, more preferably a number from 1 to 50 and most preferably a number from 3 to 29. The radicals of formula VI may be bonded terminally or in the nucleotide sequence, it being possible for all or several, for example from 2 to 5, of the radicals of formula VI to follow one another, or for the radicals of formula VI to be bonded between radicals of natural or synthetic nucleosides, or for there to be mixed forms of those distributions in the nucleotide sequence.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A most especially preferred form comprises oligonucleotides of formula V wherein x is a number from 2 to 50, preferably from 2 to 30, Y is the group --P(O)O.sup.⊖ --, U, V and W are each independently identical or different radicals of a natural nucleoside and at least one of the radicals U, V and W corresponds to formula VI. Suitable natural nucleosides are adenosine, cytidine, guanosine, uridine, 2-aminoadenine, 5-methylcytosine, 2'-deoxyadenosine, 2'-deoxycytidine, 2'-deoxyguanosine and thymidine. Natural nucleoside bases to be mentioned are especially adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine and uracil. The radicals of formula VI may be bonded terminally or in the nucleotide sequence, it being possible for all or several, for example from 2 to 5, identical or different radicals of formula VI to follow one another, or for identical or different radicals of formula VI to be bonded between radicals of natural nucleosides, or for there to be mixed forms of those distributions in the nucleotide sequence. In another preferred form of oligonucleotides of formula V, all of the radicals U, V and W correspond to identical or different radicals of formula VI. x is preferably a number from 3 to 29 and preferably a total of from 1 to 12 radicals of formula VI is present.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The oligonucleotides of the invention can be prepared in a manner known per se by various methods in DNA synthesizers that may or may not be automated and that can be purchased together with instructions on procedure. In the case of the bridge group --P(O)O.sup.⊕ --, for example, it is possible to use the phosphorus triester method, the phosphite triester method or the H-phosphonate method which are familiar to one skilled in the art. The procedure adopted in the case of the phosphite triester method may, for example, comprise reacting the nucleosides of formula I wherein R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub> are each H with a protecting group reagent, for example 4,4'-dimethoxytriphenylmethyl chloride, to form a nucleoside of formula F ##STR12## and binding the compound of formula F to a solid support, for example Controlled Pore Glass (CPG), that contains long-chained alkylamino groups, by means of a "linker", for example succinic anhydride. In a separate process, the hydroxy group of the compound of formula F is derivatised, for example to a phosphorus amidite using R'OP N(isopropyl)<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>)!<sub>2</sub>, to form a compound of formula G ##STR13## wherein R' is, for example, β-cyanoethyl.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">After removal of the protecting group, such as, for example, the DMT group, of the material bound to the support, coupling to the compound of formula F is carried out with --N(iso-C<sub>3</sub> H<sub>7</sub>)<sub>2</sub> being removed, any free hydroxy groups present are blocked (capped) and the resulting phosphite is then oxidised to the phosphate. After de-protecting the dimer, the reaction cycle is repeated with a compound of formula G until an oligomer having the desired number of monomer units has been synthesized, and the product is detached from the support. In this manner, oligonucleotides are obtained in which all of the radicals U, V and W according to formula V consist of radicals of formula VI. It is also possible to prepare in this manner oligonucleotides having any desired monomer units in any desired sequence depending upon which synthetic and natural nucleoside units and nucleoside units according to the invention are used in the individual reaction cycles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The compounds according to the invention of formula I wherein R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub> are each H have antiviral and antiproliferative properties and can accordingly be used as medicaments. Furthermore, the oligonucelotides according to the invention exhibit a high stability towards degradation by nucleases. Especially surprising is their excellent pairing with complementary nucleic acid strands, especially of the RNA type. In addition, they exhibit an unexpectedly high cellular uptake. The oligonucleotides according to the invention are therefore especially suitable for anti-sense technology, that is to say, for inhibiting the expression of undesired protein products by binding to suitable complementary nucleotide sequences of mRNA (EP 266 099, WO 87/07300 and WO 89/08146). They can be used for the treatment of infections and diseases, for example by blocking the expression of bioactive proteins at the nucleic acid stage (for example oncogenes). The oligonucleotides according to the invention are also suitable as diagnostic agents and can be used as gene probes for the detection of viral infections or of genetic diseases by selective interaction at the single-stranded or double-stranded nucleic acids stage. In particular--owing to the increased stability towards nucleases--their use for diagnostic purposes is possible not only in vitro but also in vivo (for example tissue samples, blood plasma and blood serum). Such possible applications are described, for example, in WO 91/06556.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The invention further relates to the use of the oligonucleotides according to the invention as diagnostic agents for the detection of viral infections or genetic diseases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The invention also relates to the nucleosides according to the invention of the formula I and to the oligonucleotides of formula V for use in a therapeutic method for the treatment of diseases in warm-blooded animals, including man, by inactivation of the nucleotide sequences in the body. The daily dose in the case of administration to warm-blooded animals weighing approximately 70 kg may be, for example, from 0.01 to 1000 mg. Administration is effected parenterally, for example intravenously or intraperitoneally, preferably in the form of pharmaceutical compositions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The invention further relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising an effective amount of a nucleoside of formula I or of an oligonucleotide of formula V, on its own or together with other active ingredients, a pharmaceutical carrier, preferably in a significant amount, and, where appropriate, excipients.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The pharmacologically effective nucleosides and oligonucleotides according to the invention can be used in the form of parenterally administrable compositions or in the form of infusion solutions. Such solutions are preferably isotonic aqueous solutions or suspensions which, for example in the case of lyophilised compositions that contain the active ingredient on its own or together with a carrier, for example mannitol, can be prepared before use. The pharmaceutical compositions may be sterilised and/or may comprise excipients, for example preservatives, stabilisers, wetting agents and/or emulsifiers, solubilisers, salts for regulating the osmotic pressure and/or buffers. The pharmaceutical compositions, which, if desired, may comprise other pharmacologically active substances, such as antibiotics, are prepared in a manner known per se, for example by means of conventional dissolving or lyophilising processes, and comprise approximately from 0.1% to 90%, especially from approximately 0.5% to approximately 30%, for example from 1% to 5%, active ingredient(s).</div>
