<div class="description-paragraph">3. State of the Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a degenerative brain disorder characterized clinically by progressive loss of memory, cognition, reasoning, judgment and emotional stability that gradually leads to profound mental deterioration and ultimately death. AD is a very common cause of progressive mental failure (dementia) in aged humans and is believed to represent the fourth most common medical cause of death in the United States. AD has been observed in races and ethnic groups worldwide and presents a major present and future public health problem. The disease is currently estimated to affect about two to three million individuals in the United States alone. AD is at present incurable. No treatment that effectively prevents AD or reverses its symptoms and course is currently known.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The brains of individuals with AD exhibit characteristic lesions termed senile (or amyloid) plaques, amyloid angiopathy (amyloid deposits in blood vessels) and neurofibrillary tangles. Large numbers of these lesions, particularly amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, are generally found in several areas of the human brain important for memory and cognitive function in patients with AD. Smaller numbers of these lesions in a more restrictive anatomical distribution are also found in the brains of most aged humans who do not have clinical AD. Amyloid plaques and amyloid angiopathy also characterize the brains of individuals with Trisomy 21 (Down's Syndrome) and Hereditary Cerebral Hemorrhage with Amyloidosis of the Dutch Type (HCHWA-D). At present, a definitive diagnosis of AD usually requires observing the aforementioned lesions in the brain tissue of patients who have died with the disease or, rarely, in small biopsied samples of brain tissue taken during an invasive neurosurgical procedure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The principal chemical constituent of the amyloid plaques and vascular amyloid deposits (amyloid angiopathy) characteristic of AD and the other disorders mentioned above is an approximately 4.2 kilodalton (kD) protein of about 39-43 amino acids designated the β-amyloid peptide (βAP) or sometimes Aβ, AβP or β/A4. β-Amyloid peptide was first purified and a partial amino acid sequence was provided by Glenner, et al.<sup>1</sup> The isolation procedure and the sequence data for the first 28 amino acids are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,666,829<sup>2</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Molecular biological and protein chemical analyses have shown that the β-amyloid peptide is a small fragment of a much larger precursor protein (APP), that is normally produced by cells in many tissues of various animals, including humans. Knowledge of the structure of the gene encoding the APP has demonstrated that β-amyloid peptide arises as a peptide fragment that is cleaved from APP by protease enzyme(s). The precise biochemical mechanism by which the β-amyloid peptide fragment is cleaved from APP and subsequently deposited as amyloid plaques in the cerebral tissue and in the walls of the cerebral and meningeal blood vessels is currently unknown.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Several lines of evidence indicate that progressive cerebral deposition of β-amyloid peptide plays a seminal role in the pathogenesis of AD and can precede cognitive symptoms by years or decades. See, for example, Selkoe<sup>3</sup>. The most important line of evidence is the discovery that missense DNA mutations at amino acid 717 of the 770-amino acid isoform of APP can be found in affected members but not unaffected members of several families with a genetically determined (familial) form of AD (Goate, et al.<sup>4</sup> ; Chartier Harlan, et al.<sup>5</sup> ; and Murrell, et al.<sup>6</sup>) and is referred to as the Swedish variant. A double mutation changing lysine<sup>595</sup> -methionine<sup>596</sup> to asparagine<sup>595</sup> -leucine<sup>596</sup> (with reference to the 695 isoform) found in a Swedish family was reported in 1992 (Mullan, et al.<sup>7</sup>). Genetic linkage analyses have demonstrated that these mutations, as well as certain other mutations in the APP gene, are the specific molecular cause of AD in the affected members of such families. In addition, a mutation at amino acid 693 of the 770-amino acid isoform of APP has been identified as the cause of the β-amyloid peptide deposition disease, HCHWA-D, and a change from alanine to glycine at amino acid 692 appears to cause a phenotype that resembles AD is some patients but HCHWA-D in others. The discovery of these and other mutations in APP in genetically based cases of AD prove that alteration of APP and subsequent deposition of its β-amyloid peptide fragment can cause AD.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Despite the progress which has been made in understanding the underlying mechanisms of AD and other β-amyloid peptide related diseases, there remains a need to develop methods and compositions for treatment of the disease(s). Ideally, the treatment methods would advantageously be based on drugs which are capable of inhibiting β-amyloid peptide release and/or its synthesis in vivo.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">"Pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to pharmaceutically acceptable salts of a compound of Formula I which salts are derived from a variety of organic and inorganic counter ions well known in the art and include, by way of example only, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, ammonium, tetraalkylammonium, and the like; and when the molecule contains a basic functionality, salts of organic or inorganic acids, such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, tartrate, mesylate, acetate, maleate, oxalate and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Compound Preparation</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The compounds of formula I are readily prepared via several divergent synthetic routes with the particular route selected relative to the ease of compound preparation, commercial availability of starting materials, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A first synthetic method involves conventional coupling of an acid derivative with a primary amine of an esterified amino acid as shown in reaction (1) below: ##STR8## wherein R<sup>1</sup>, R<sup>2</sup>, X' and X" are as defined above, and R' is preferably hydrogen or an alkyl group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Reaction (1) merely involves coupling of a suitable acid derivative 1 with the primary amine of amino acid/amino acid ester 2 under conditions which provide for the N-acetyl derivative 3. This reaction is conventionally conducted for peptide synthesis and synthetic methods used therein can also be employed to prepare the N-acetyl amino acid/amino acid esters 3. For example, well known coupling reagents such as carbodiimides with or without the use of well known additives such as N-hydroxysuccinimide, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, etc. can be used to facilitate coupling. The reaction is conventionally conducted in an inert aprotic diluent such as dimethylformamide, dichloromethane, chloroform, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Alternatively, in a preferred embodiment, the acid halide of compound 1 can be employed in reaction (1) and, when so employed, it is typically employed in the presence of a suitable base to scavenge the acid generated during the reaction. Suitable bases include, by way of example, triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, N-methylmorpholine and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Reaction (1) is preferably conducted at from about 0° C. to about 60° C. until reaction completion which typically occurs within 1 to about 24 hours. Upon reaction completion, N-acetyl amino acid/amino acid ester 3 is recovered by conventional methods including precipitation, chromatography, filtration and the like or, alternatively in the case of the ester, is hydrolyzed to the corresponding carboxylic acid without purification and/or isolation other than conventional work-up (e.g., aqueous extraction, etc.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">If an N-acetyl amino acid ester is formed, it is typically converted to the corresponding acid prior to coupling with an amine HNR<sup>3</sup> R<sup>3'</sup>. Coupling is accomplished using well known peptide coupling chemistry with well known coupling reagents such as carbodiimides with or without the use of well known additives such as N-hydroxysuccinimide, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, etc. which can be used to facilitate coupling. The reaction is conventionally conducted in an inert aprotic polar diluent such as dimethylformamide, dichloromethane, chloroform, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran and the like. Alternatively, the ester group of 3 can, in some cases, be converted directly into an amide group via conventional ester/amide exchange reactions which are well known in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In reaction (1), each of the reagents (acetic acid derivative 1 and amino acid/amino acid ester 2) are well known in the art with a plurality of each being commercially available.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Alternatively, the compounds of formula I can be prepared by first forming the amino acid amide then N'-acetylating these esters. That is to say that the amine HNR<sup>3</sup> R<sup>3'</sup>  is coupled to the N'-blocked amino acid BlockNHCHR<sup>2</sup> COOH via conventional coupling conditions to provide for the N'-blocked amino acid amide BlockNHCHR<sup>2</sup> C(O)NR<sup>3</sup> R<sup>3'</sup>. The blocking group is then removed via conventional conditions to provide for the free amine which is then N'-acetylated in the manner described above to provide for the compounds of formula I.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">After coupling and N'-acetylation (in whatever order) is complete, the resulting amides can be derivatized via conventional chemistry to provide for derivatives of the synthesized compounds. For example, reactive functionality which is blocked on either R<sup>2</sup> and/or R<sup>3</sup> groups can be deblocked and then derivatized. For example, a Boc-protected amino group on R<sup>2</sup> (e.g., lysine side chain) can be deblocked after synthesis and the amino group acylated or otherwised derivatized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The compounds described herein can also be prepared by use of polymer supported forms of carbodiimide peptide coupling reagents. A polymer supported form of EDC, for example, has been described (Tetrahedron Letters, 34(48), 7685 (1993))<sup>10</sup>. Additionally, a new carbodiimide coupling reagent, PEPC, and its corresponding polymer supported forms have been discovered and are very useful for the preparation of the compounds of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Polymers suitable for use in making a polymer supported coupling reagent are either commercially available or may be prepared by methods well known to the artisan skilled in the polymer arts. A suitable polymer must possess pendant sidechains bearing moieties reactive with the terminal amine of the carbodiimide. Such reactive moieties include chloro, bromo, iodo and methanesulfonyl. Preferably, the reactive moiety is a chloromethyl group. Additionally, the polymer's backbone must be inert to both the carbodiimide and reaction conditions under which the ultimate polymer bound coupling reagents will be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Certain hydroxymethylated resins may be converted into chloromethylated resins useful for the preparation of polymer supported coupling reagents. Examples of these hydroxylated resins include the 4-hydroxymethyl-phenylacetamidomethyl resin (Pam Resin) and 4-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol resin (Wang Resin) available from Advanced Chemtech of Louisville, Ky., USA (see Advanced Chemtech 1993-1994 catalog, page 115). The hydroxymethyl groups of these resins may be converted into the desired chloromethyl groups by any of a number of methods well known to the skilled artisan.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Preferred resins are the chloromethylated styrene/divinylbenzene resins because of their ready commercial availability. As the name suggests, these resins are already chloromethylated and require no chemical modification prior to use. These resins are commercially known as Merrifield's resins and are available from Aldrich Chemical Company of Milwaukee, Wis., USA (see Aldrich 1994-1995 catalog, page 899). Methods for the preparation of PEPC and its polymer supported forms are outlined in the following scheme. ##STR9##</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Such methods are described more fully in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 60/019,790 filed Jun. 14, 1996 which application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Briefly, PEPC is prepared by first reacting ethyl isocyanate with 1-(3-aminopropyl)pyrrolidine. The resulting urea is treated with 4-toluenesulfonyl chloride to provide PEPC. The polymer supported form is prepared by reaction of PEPC with an appropriate resin under standard conditions to give the desired reagent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The carboxylic acid coupling reactions employing these reagents are performed at about ambient temperature to about 45° C., for from about 3 to 120 hours. Typically, the product may be isolated by washing the reaction with CHCl<sub>3</sub> and concentrating the remaining organics under reduced pressure. As discussed supra, isolation of products from reactions where a polymer bound reagent has been used is greatly simplified, requiring only filtration of the reaction mixture and then concentration of the filtrate under reduced pressure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Still other methods for the preparation of esters are provided in the examples below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In these synthetic methods, the starting materials can contain a chiral center (e.g., L-alanine) and, when a racemic starting material is employed, the resulting product is a mixture of R,S enatiomers. Alternatively, a chiral isomer of the starting material can be employed and, if the reaction protocol employed does not racemized this starting material, a chiral product is obtained. Such reaction protocols can involve inversion of the chiral center during synthesis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated, the products of this invention are a mixture of R,S enatiomers. Preferably, however, when a chiral product is desired, the chiral product corresponds to the L-amino acid derivative. Alternatively, chiral products can be obtained via purification techniques which separates enatiomers from an R,S mixture to provide for one or the other stereoisomer. Such techniques are well known in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Pharmaceutical Formulations</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When employed as pharmaceuticals, the compounds of formula I are usually administered in the form of pharmaceutical compositions. These compounds can be administered by a variety of routes including oral, rectal, transdermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, and intranasal. These compounds are effective as both injectable and oral compositions. Such compositions are prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical art and comprise at least one active compound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions which contain, as the active ingredient, one or more of the compounds of formula I above associated with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. In making the compositions of this invention, the active ingredient is usually mixed with an excipient, diluted by an excipient or enclosed within such a carrier which can be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper or other container. When the excipient serves as a diluent, it can be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid material, which acts as a vehicle, carrier or medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols (as a solid or in a liquid medium), ointments containing, for example, up to 10% by weight of the active compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions, and sterile packaged powders.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In preparing a formulation, it may be necessary to mill the active compound to provide the appropriate particle size prior to combining with the other ingredients. If the active compound is substantially insoluble, it ordinarily is milled to a particle size of less than 200 mesh. If the active compound is substantially water soluble, the particle size is normally adjusted by milling to provide a substantially uniform distribution in the formulation, e.g., about 40 mesh.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Some examples of suitable excipients include lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, sterile water, syrup, and methyl cellulose. The formulations can additionally include: lubricating agents such as talc, magnesium stearate, and mineral oil; wetting agents; emulsifying and suspending agents; preserving agents such as methyl- and propylhydroxy-benzoates; sweetening agents; and flavoring agents. The compositions of the invention can be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient by employing procedures known in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The compositions are preferably formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage containing from about 5 to about 100 mg, more usually about 10 to about 30 mg, of the active ingredient. The term "unit dosage forms" refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient. Preferably, the compound of formula I above is employed at no more than about 20 weight percent of the pharmaceutical composition, more preferably no more than about 15 weight percent, with the balance being pharmaceutically inert carrier(s).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The active compound is effective over a wide dosage range and is generally administered in a pharmaceutically effective amount. It will be understood, however, that the amount of the compound actually administered will be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical excipient to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention. When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from, for example, 0.1 to about 500 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The tablets or pills of the present invention may be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permit the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol, and cellulose acetate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The liquid forms in which the novel compositions of the present invention may be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include aqueous solutions, suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and suspensions in pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof, and powders. The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as described supra. Preferably the compositions are administered by the oral or nasal respiratory route for local or systemic effect. Compositions in preferably pharmaceutically acceptable solvents may be nebulized by use of inert gases.

<div class="description-paragraph">Another preferred formulation employed in the methods of the present invention employs transdermal delivery devices. ("patches"). Such transdermal patches may be used to provide continuous or discontinuous infusion of the compounds of the present invention in controlled amounts. The construction and use of transdermal patches for the delivery of pharmaceutical agents is well known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,023,252, issued Jun. 11, 1991, herein incorporated by reference. Such patches may be constructed for continuous, pulsatile, or on demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Frequently, it will be desirable or necessary to introduce the pharmaceutical composition to the brain, either directly or indirectly. Direct techniques usually involve placement of a drug delivery catheter into the host's ventricular system to bypass the blood-brain barrier. One such implantable delivery system used for the transport of biological factors to specific anatomical regions of the body is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,011,472 which is herein incorporated by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Indirect techniques, which are generally preferred, usually involve formulating the compositions to provide for drug latentiation by the conversion of hydrophilic drugs into lipid-soluble drugs. Latentiation is generally achieved through blocking of the hydroxy, carbonyl, sulfate, and primary amine groups present on the drug to render the drug more lipid soluble and amenable to transportation across the blood-brain barrier. Alternatively, the delivery of hydrophilic drugs may be enhanced by intra-arterial infusion of hypertonic solutions which can transiently open the blood-brain barrier.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">Utility</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are useful in inhibiting β-amyloid peptide release and/or its synthesis, and, accordingly, have utility in treating Alzheimer's disease in mammals including humans.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As noted above, the compounds described herein are suitable for use in a variety of drug delivery systems described above. Additionally, in order to enhance the in vivo serum half-life of the administered compound, the compounds may be encapsulated, introduced into the lumen of liposomes, prepared as a colloid, or other conventional techniques may be employed which provide an extended serum half-life of the compounds. A variety of methods are available for preparing liposomes, as described in, e.g., Szoka, et al., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,235,871, 4,501,728 and 4,837,028 each of which is incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The amount of compound administered to the patient will vary depending upon what is being administered, the purpose of the administration, such as prophylaxis or therapy, the state of the patient, the manner of administration, and the like. In therapeutic applications, compositions are administered to a patient already suffering from AD in an amount sufficient to at least partially arrest further onset of the symptoms of the disease and its complications. An amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as "therapeutically effective dose." Amounts effective for this use will depend on the judgment of the attending clinician depending upon factors such as the degree or severity of AD in the patient, the age, weight and general condition of the patient, and the like. Preferably, for use as therapeutics, the compounds described herein are administered at dosages ranging from about 1 to about 500 mg/kg/day.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In prophylactic applications, compositions are administered to a patient at risk of developing AD (determined for example by genetic screening or familial trait) in an amount sufficient to inhibit the onset of symptoms of the disease. An amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as "prophylactically effective dose." Amounts effective for this use will depend on the judgment of the attending clinician depending upon factors such as the age, weight and general condition of the patient, and the like. Preferably, for use as prophylactics, the compounds described herein are administered at dosages ranging from about 1 to about 500 mg/kg/day.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As noted above, the compounds administered to a patient are in the form of pharmaceutical compositions described above. These compositions may be sterilized by conventional sterilization techniques, or may be sterile filtered. The resulting aqueous solutions may be packaged for use as is, or lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous carrier prior to administration. The pH of the compound preparations typically will be between 3 and 11, more preferably from 5 to 9 and most preferably from 7 and 8. It will be understood that use of certain of the foregoing excipients, carriers, or stabilizers will result in the formation of pharmaceutical salts.</div>

<heading>GENERAL PROCEDURE D'</heading>
<heading>Ester Hydrolysis to the Free Acid</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Ester hydrolysis to the free acid was conducted by conventional methods. Below are two examples of such conventional de-esterification methods.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">To the ester in a 1:1 mixture of CH<sub>3</sub> OH/H<sub>2</sub> O was added 2-5 equivalents of K<sub>2</sub> CO<sub>3</sub>. The mixture was heated to about 50° C. for about 0.5 to 1.5 hours until tlc showed complete reaction. The reaction was cooled to room temperature and the methanol was removed at reduced pressure. The pH of the remaining aqueous solution was adjusted to about 2, and ethyl acetate was added to extract the product. The organic phase was then washed with saturated aqueous NaCl and dried over MgSO<sub>4</sub>. The solution was stripped free of solvent at reduced pressure to yield the product.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The amino acid ester was dissolved in dioxane/water (4:1) to which was added LiOH (˜2 eq.) that was dissolved in water such that the total solvent after addition was about 2:1 dioxane:water.

The residue was diluted with EtOAc, the layers were separated and the aqueous layer acidified to pH 2. The aqueous layer was back extracted with EtOAc, the combined organics were dried over Na<sub>2</sub> SO<sub>4</sub> and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure after filtration. The residue was purified by conventional methods (e.g., recrystallization).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The following exemplifies this later example.

To the resulting solution was added about 1.1 eq. of the appropriate amino acid ester and triethylamine (1.1 eq. in methylene chloride). The system was stiffed at room temperature for 2 hours and then the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate, washed with 1N HCl followed by 1N NaOH. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous soldium sulfate, filtered and the solvent removed under reduced pressure to provide for the desired product.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">Specifically, the appropriate amino ester free base (0.0346 mmols) and substituted phenylacetic acid (0.069 mmols) were dissolved in 2.0 mL CHCl<sub>3</sub> (EtOH free), treated with 150 mg of P-EPC (0.87 meq./g) and the reaction was mixed for 4 days at 23° C. The reaction was filtered through a plug of cotton, rinsed with 2.0 mL of CHCl<sub>3</sub> and the filtrate evaporated under a stream of nitrogen. The purity of each sample was determined by <sup>1</sup> H NMR and ranged from 50% to &gt;95%. Between 8.0 and 15.0 mg of final product was obtained from each reaction and was tested without additional purification.</div>

<heading>Synthesis of Amino Acid Esters from the Corresponding N-BOC Amino Acid</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">A. Esterification of the Acid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The N-BOC amino acid was dissolved in dioxane and treated with an excess of alcohol (˜1.5 eq.) and catalytic DMAP (100 mg) at 0° C. Stirring was continued until reaction completion whereupon the product was recovered by conventional methods.</div>

<heading>GENERAL PROCEDURE K'</heading>
<heading>Methyl ester formation from amino acids</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The amino acid (amino acid or amino acid hydrochloride) is suspended in methanol and chilled to 0° C. HCl gas is bubbled through this solution for 5 minutes. The reaction is allowed to warm to room temperature then stirred for 4 hours. The solvents are then removed at reduced pressure to afford the desired amino acid methyl ester hydrochloride. This product is usually used without further purification.</div>

<heading>Synthesis of free and polymer bound PEPC</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">N-ethyl-N'-3-(1-pyrrolidinvl)propylurea</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">To a solution of 27.7 g (0.39 mol) ethyl isocyanate in 250 mL chloroform was added 50 g (0.39 mol) 3-(1-pyrrolidinyl)propylamine dropwise with cooling. Once the addition was complete, the cooling bath was removed and the reaction mixture stirred at room temperature for 4 hours. The reaction mixture was then concentrated under reduced pressure to give 74.5 g (96.4%) of the desired urea as a clear oil.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">1-(3-(1-pyrrolidinyl)propyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide (P-EPC)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">To a solution of 31.0 g (0.156 mol) N-ethyl-N'-3-(1-pyrrolidinyl)propylurea in 500 mL dichloromethane was added 62.6 g (0.62 mol) triethylamine and the solution was cooled to 0° C. To this solution were then added 59.17 g (0.31 mol) 4-toluenesulfonyl chloride in 400 mL dichloromethane dropwise at such a rate as to maintain the reaction at 0-5° C. After the addition was complete, the reaction mixture was warmed to room temperature and then heated to reflux for 4 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was washed with saturated aqueous potassium carbonate (3×150 mL). The aqueous phases were combined and extracted with dichloromethane. All organic phases were combined and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resultant orange slurry was suspended in 250 mL diethyl ether and the solution decanted off from the solid. The slurry/decantation process was repeated 3 more times. The ether solutions were combined and concentrated under reduced pressure to give 18.9 g (67%) of the desired product as a crude orange oil. A portion of the oil was distilled under vacuum to give a colorless oil distilling at 78-82° C. (0.4 mm Hg).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Preparation of a polymer supported form of 1-(3-(1-pyrrolidinyl)propyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide (P-EPC)</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">The nitrile was added to a mixture of 40 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid and 50 mL H<sub>2</sub> O and heated to reflux for 48 hours, cooled to room temperature and stirred for 48 hours. The reaction was diluted into 1 L of crushed ice, warmed to room temperature and extracted with 2×200 mL of dichloromethane and 2×200 mL of ethylacetate. Both sets of organics were combined and washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO<sub>3</sub>. The NaHCO<sub>3</sub> fractions were combined and acidified to pH 1 with 3N HCl. The white solid was too fine to filter and was extracted out with 2×200 mL of dichloromethane. The combined organics were dried with Na<sub>2</sub> SO<sub>4</sub> and the solvents removed at reduced presure to yield crude 3,5-dichlorophenylacetic acid as a white solid.

<heading>Cellular Screen for the Detection of Inhibitors of β-Amyloid Production</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Numerous compounds of formula I above were assayed for their ability to inhibit β-amyloid production in a cell line possessing the Swedish mutation. This screening assay employed cells (K293=human kidney cell line) which were stably transfected with the gene for amyloid precursor protein 751 (APP751) containing the double mutation Lys<sub>651</sub> Met<sub>652</sub> to Asn<sub>651</sub> leu<sub>652</sub> (APP751 numbering) in the manner described in International Patent Application Publication No. 94/10569<sup>8</sup> and Citron et al. <sup>12</sup>. This mutation is commonly called the Swedish mutation and the cells, designated as "293 751 SWE", were plated in Corning 96-well plates at 1.5-2.5×10<sup>4</sup> cells per well in Dulbecco's minimal essential media plus 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell number is important in order to achieve β-amyloid ELISA results within the linear range of the assay (˜0.2 to 2.5 ng per mL).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Following overnight incubation at 37° C. in an incubator equilibrated with 10% carbon dioxide, media were removed and replaced with 200 μL of a compound of formula I (drug) containing media per well for a two hour pretreatment period and cells were incubated as above. Drug stocks were prepared in 100% dimethylsulfoxide such that at the final drug concentration used in the treatment, the concentration of dimethylsulfoxide did not exceed 0.5% and, in fact, usually equaled 0.1%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">At the end of the pretreatment period, the media were again removed and replaced with fresh drug containing media as above and cells were incubated for an additional two hours. After treatment, plates were centrifuged in a Beckman GPR at 1200 rpm for five minutes at room temperature to pellet cellular debris from the conditioned media. From each well, 100 μL of conditioned media or appropriate dilutions thereof were transferred into an ELISA plate precoated with antibody 266<sup>14</sup> against amino acids 13-28 of β-amyloid peptide as described in International Patent Application Publication No. 94/10569<sup>8</sup> and stored at 4° C. overnight. An ELISA assay employing labelled antibody 6C6<sup>14</sup> against amino acids 1-16 of β-amyloid peptide was run the next day to measure the amount of β-amyloid peptide produced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Cytotoxic effects of the compounds were measured by a modification of the method of Hansen, et al.<sup>3</sup>. To the cells remaining in the tissue culture plate was added 25 μL of a 3,(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) stock solution (5 mg/mL) to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL. Cells were incubated at 37° C. for one hour, and cellular activity was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of MTT lysis buffer (20% w/v sodium dodecylsulfate in 50% dimethylformamide, pH 4.7). Complete extraction was achieved by overnight shaking at room temperature. The difference in the OD<sub>562nm</sub> and the OD<sub>650nm</sub> was measured in a Molecular Device's UV<sub>max</sub> microplate reader as an indicator of the cellular viability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The results of the β-amyloid peptide ELISA were fit to a standard curve and expressed as ng/mL β-amyloid peptide. In order to normalize for cytotoxicity, these results were divided by the MTT results and expressed as a percentage of the results from a drug free control. All results are the mean and standard deviation of at least six replicate assays.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The test compounds were assayed for β-amyloid peptide production inhibition activity in cells using this assay. The results of this assay demonstrate that, each of the compounds within this invention tested reduced β-amyloid peptide production by at least 30% as compared to control.</div>

<heading>In Vivo Suppression of β-Amyloid Release and/or Synthesis</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">This example illustrates how the compounds of this invention could be tested for in vivo suppression of β-amyloid release and/or synthesis. For these experiments, 3 to 4 month old PDAPP mice are used [Games et al., (1995) Nature 373:523-527]. Depending upon which compound is being tested, the compound is usually formulated at either 5 or 10 mg/ml. Because of the low solubility factors of the compounds, they may be formulated with various vehicles, such as corn oil (Safeway, South San Francisco, Calif.); 10% EtOH in corn oil (Safeway); 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (Research Biochemicals International, Natick Mass.); and carboxy-methyl-cellulose (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis Mo.). Specifically, for example 141 the vehicle was carboxy-methyl-cellulose (Sigma).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The mice are dosed subcutaneously with a 26 gauge needle and 3 hours later the animals are euthanized via CO<sub>2</sub> narcosis and blood is taken by cardiac puncture using a 1 cc 25G 5/8" tuberculin syringe/needle coated with solution of 0.5 M EDTA, pH 8.0. The blood is placed in a Becton-Dickinson vacutainer tube containing EDTA and spun down for 15 minutes at 1500 xg at 5° C. The brains of the mice are then removed and the cortex and hippocampus are dissected out and placed on ice.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">1. Brain Assay</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">To prepare hippocampal and cortical tissue for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) each brain region is homogenized in 10 volumes of ice cold guanidine buffer (5.0 M guanidine-HCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) using a Kontes motorized pestle (Fisher, Pittsburgh Pa.). The homogenates are gently rocked on a rotating platform for three to four hours at room temperature and stored at -20° C. prior to quantitation of β-amyloid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The brain homogenates are diluted 1:10 with ice-cold casein buffer [0.25% casein, phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 0.05% sodium azide, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 10 μg/ml leupeptin], thereby reducing the final concentration of guanidine to 0.5 M, before centrifugation at 16,000 xg for 20 minutes at 4° C. The β-amyloid standards (1-40 or 1-42 amino acids) were prepared such that the final composition equaled 0.5 M guanidine in the presence of 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The total β-amyloid sandwich ELISA, quantitating both β-amyloid (aa 1-40) and β-amyloid (aa 1-42) consists of two monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to β-amyloid. The capture antibody, 266<sup>14</sup>, is specific to amino acids 13-28 of β-amyloid. The antibody 3D6<sup>15</sup>, which is specific to amino acids 1-5 of β-amyloid, is biotinylated and served as the reporter antibody in the assay. The 3D6 biotinylation procedure employs the manufacturer's (Pierce, Rockford Ill.) protocol for NHS-biotin labeling of immunoglobulins except that 100 mM sodium bicarbonate, pH 8.5 buffer is used. The 3D6 antibody does not recognize secreted amyloid precursor protein (APP) or full-length APP but detects only β-amyloid species with an amino terminal aspartic acid. The assay has a lower limit of sensitivity of ˜50 pg/ml (11 pM) and shows no cross-reactivity to the endogenous murine β-amyloid peptide at concentrations up to 1 ng/ml.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The configuration of the sandwich ELISA quantitating the level of β-amyloid (aa 1-42) employs the mAb 21F12<sup>15</sup> (which recognizes amino acids 33-42 of β-amyloid) as the capture antibody. Biotinylated 3D6 is also the reporter antibody in this assay which has a lower limit of sensitivity of ˜125 pg/ml (28 pM).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The 266 and 21F12 capture mAbs are coated at 10 μg/ml into 96 well immunoassay plates (Costar, Cambidge Mass.) overnight at room temperature. The plates are then aspirated and blocked with 0.25% human serum albumin in PBS buffer for at least 1 hour at room temperature, then stored desiccated at 4° C. until use. The plates are rehydrated with wash buffer (Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20) prior to use. The samples and standards are added to the plates and incubated overnight at 4° C. The plates are washed &gt;3 times with wash buffer between each step of the assay. The biotinylated 3D6, diluted to 0.5 μg/ml in casein incubation buffer (0.25% casein, PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4) is incubated in the well for 1 hour at room temperature. Avidin-HRP (Vector, Burlingame Calif.) diluted 1:4000 in casein incubation buffer is added to the wells for 1 hour at room temperature. The colorimetric substrate, Slow TMB-ELISA (Pierce, Cambridge Mass.), is added and allowed to react for 15 minutes, after which the enzymatic reaction is stopped with addition of 2 N H<sub>2</sub> SO<sub>4</sub>. Reaction product is quantified using a Molecular Devices Vmax (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park Calif.) measuring the difference in absorbance at 450 nm and 650 nm.</div>
