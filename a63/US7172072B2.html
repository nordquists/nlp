<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments will be shown by way of example in the drawings and will be described in detail herein. It should be understood, however, that the invention is not intended to be limited to the particular forms disclosed. Rather, the invention is to cover all modifications, equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</div>
<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">Turning to the drawings, and initially to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref> <i>a–g</i>, there is shown a plate <b>100</b> having multiple compartments according to one embodiment of the present invention. The plate <b>100</b> is constructed of paper, plastic, or other suitable material for holding food. The depicted plate <b>100</b> includes a main compartment <b>102</b> and two additional compartments, also referred to as wells <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>, disposed along an outer periphery <b>108</b> of the main compartment of the plate <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">The main compartment <b>102</b> includes a bottom wall <b>110</b> and a side wall <b>112</b> that extends around the bottom wall <b>110</b> and is generally circular in shape, but it can take on a variety of shapes (e.g., rectangular, hexagonal, square, octagonal, triangular) and sizes according to alternatives of the present invention. As is perhaps seen best in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> <i>h</i>, the edges of the side wall <b>112</b> intersect the bottom wall <b>110</b> in a rounded fashion to form a rounded edge <b>114</b>. The side wall <b>112</b> upwardly and outwardly extends from the bottom wall <b>110</b>. At a top end of the side wall <b>112</b>, the side wall <b>112</b> curves outwardly away from the main compartment <b>100</b> and forms a flange <b>120</b> around the main compartment <b>100</b>. There is a rounded transition <b>122</b> between the flange <b>120</b> and the side wall <b>112</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">When the plate <b>100</b> is used for containing foods, the main compartment is typically used for holding food such as the main dish and sides and the wells <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> are often used to hold condiments. For example, where the main dish and sides include chicken nuggets and French fried potatoes, the condiment wells <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> may be used to hold barbecue sauce and ketchup. Alternatively, the wells <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> may hold other side dishes such as, for example, potato salad, fruit salad, coleslaw, raisins, cheese cubes, applesauce, or a combination thereof. Of course, there are a myriad of ways in which a user may choose to use the main compartments <b>100</b> and the wells <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> beyond the afore-described examples.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">Disposed at one end of the circular main compartment <b>112</b> are two generally lobular-shaped wells <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> The condiment wells are disposed in close proximity relative to one another in the illustrated embodiments—the midpoints of the two wells <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> are located around the periphery of the main compartment <b>102</b> such that an angle between the midpoints of the wells measured from a midpoint of the main compartment is less than about 90°. The condiment wells <b>106</b>, <b>106</b> can, however, be disposed in a variety of positions in an alternative embodiment of the present invention as is later discussed in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref> <i>a–e</i>. For example, in other alternative embodiments, the midpoints of the two wells <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> are located around the periphery of the main compartment <b>102</b> such that an angle between the midpoints of the wells measured from a midpoint of the main compartment is less than about 180°. In the embodiment depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref> <i>a–h</i>, the condiment wells <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> are somewhat rounded in shaped. Like the main compartment <b>102</b>, the condiment wells <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> includes bottom walls <b>130</b> <i>a</i>, <b>130</b> <i>b </i>and sloped side walls <b>132</b> <i>a</i>, <b>132</b> <i>b</i>. The flange <b>120</b> that extends around the main compartment <b>102</b> continues around the condiment wells <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>. A narrower flange <b>136</b> connects the condiment wells <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> to the main compartment <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref> <i>b </i>and <b>1</b> <i>h</i>, the flange <b>120</b> forms an outer periphery of the plate <b>100</b>. The outer periphery of the plate <b>100</b> comprises an arcuate segment <b>140</b> and lobular segments <b>142</b>. The arcuate segment <b>140</b> forms the outer periphery of the main compartment <b>102</b> except for the potions of the outer periphery of the main compartment <b>120</b> adjacent the wells <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>. The lobular segments <b>142</b> of the outer periphery of the plate <b>100</b> form the outer periphery of the wells <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">The dimensions of the various components of the plate <b>100</b> will now be described according to one embodiment of the present invention. The bottom wall <b>110</b> is generally circular in shape and has a diameter D<sub>1 </sub>of approximately 5⅞ inch according to one embodiment of the present invention. In the illustrated embodiment, the end of the side wall <b>112</b> intersecting the bottom wall <b>110</b> and the side wall <b>112</b> of the main compartment intersect, forming a rounded edge <b>114</b> have a radius of curvature R<sub>1 </sub>of approximately ⅜ inch. The side wall <b>112</b> upwardly and outwardly extends from the bottom wall <b>110</b> at an angle of approximately 26° relative to the vertical. The side wall <b>112</b> curves outward away from the main compartment <b>102</b> until it is horizontal, forming a flange <b>120</b> around the main compartment <b>102</b>. The rounded transition <b>122</b> between the flange <b>120</b> and the side wall <b>112</b> has a radius of curvature R<sub>2 </sub>of about ⅛ inch. The diameter D<sub>2 </sub>of the main compartment <b>102</b> between rounded transitions <b>122</b> on opposite sides of the main compartment <b>102</b> is about 6⅝ inches. The flange <b>120</b> has a width W<sub>1 </sub>of about 7/16 inch, which results in an overall diameter D<sub>3 </sub>of the main compartment <b>102</b> with flanges of approximately 7 15/32 inches. The height H of the plate, measured from the bottom wall <b>110</b> to the flange <b>120</b>, is approximately ⅝ inch.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref> <i>c </i>and <b>1</b> <i>d</i>, the plate <b>100</b> has a length L<sub>1 </sub>from the edge of the flange <b>120</b> disposed around the condiment wells <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> to the edge of the flange around the main compartment <b>102</b> of approximately 8⅞ inches. The length of the plate <b>100</b> at its maximum dimension L<sub>2</sub>—from the edge of the flange around one of the compartment <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> to the edge of the flange <b>120</b> disposed around the main compartment <b>102</b>—is approximately 9 5/16 inches.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">Addressing now the condiment wells <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, each compartment has a length L<sub>3 </sub>of approximately 2 27/32 inch and a width W<sub>2 </sub>of about 1¾ inch. The embodiment of a plate having the dimensions as described results in a main compartment having a volume of approximately 10 fluid ounces and condiment wells <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> having a capacity of about 1 fluid ounce each.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">Turning now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref> <i>a–i</i>, there are shown a plurality of plates <b>201</b>–<b>209</b>, similar to plate <b>100</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref> <i>a–i</i>, having a main compartment <b>210</b> and two wells <b>212</b> <i>a</i>, <b>212</b> <i>b</i>. The plates <b>201</b>–<b>209</b> collectively correspond to a common theme. According to the illustrated embodiment of the present invention, the common theme is an animal theme: plate <b>201</b> has an alligator depicted thereon; plate <b>202</b> has a frog depicted thereon; plate <b>203</b> has a bumblebee depicted thereon; plate <b>204</b> has a fish depicted thereon; plate <b>205</b> has a whale depicted thereon; plate <b>206</b> has a monkey theme depicted thereon; plate <b>207</b> has a bunny rabbit depicted thereon; plate <b>208</b> has a turtle depicted thereon; and plate <b>209</b> has a bird depicted thereon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">The animal depiction on each plate comprises a primary attribute that is depicted in the plate's main compartment <b>210</b> and two secondary attributes that are depicted in the wells <b>212</b>. For example, referring to the plate <b>201</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> <i>a</i>, the alligator has a primary attribute of an alligator face <b>220</b> (including snout, nose, and mouth) depicted in the main compartment <b>210</b> and the secondary attributes of eyes <b>222</b> depicted in the wells <b>212</b> <i>a,b</i>. Likewise, the frog of plate <b>202</b> has the primary attribute of a mouth <b>224</b> depicted in the main compartment <b>210</b> and the secondary attributes of eyes <b>226</b> depicted in the wells <b>212</b> <i>a,b</i>. The bumblebee of plate <b>203</b> has the primary attribute of a face and body <b>228</b> depicted in the main compartment <b>210</b> and the secondary attributes of wings <b>230</b> depicted in the wells <b>212</b> <i>a,b</i>. The fish of plate <b>204</b> has the primary attribute of a head and body <b>232</b> depicted in the plate compartment <b>210</b> and the secondary attributes of tail fins <b>234</b> depicted in the wells <b>212</b> <i>a,b</i>. The whale of plate <b>205</b> includes the primary attribute of a head and body <b>236</b> depicted in the main compartment <b>210</b> and the secondary attributes of tail fins <b>238</b> depicted in the wells <b>212</b> <i>a,b</i>. The monkey of plate <b>206</b> includes the primary attribute of a head and face <b>240</b> depicted in the main compartment <b>210</b> and the secondary attributes of ears <b>242</b> depicted in the wells <b>212</b> <i>a,b</i>. The bunny rabbit of plate <b>207</b> includes the primary attribute of a face and head <b>244</b> depicted in the main compartment <b>210</b> and the secondary attributes of ears <b>246</b> depicted in the wells <b>212</b> <i>a,b</i>. The turtle of plate <b>208</b> includes the primary attribute of a face and body <b>248</b> depicted in the main compartment <b>210</b> and the secondary attributes of feet <b>250</b> depicted in the wells <b>212</b> <i>a,b</i>. The bird of plate <b>210</b> includes the primary attribute of a face and beak <b>252</b> depicted in the main compartment <b>210</b> and the secondary attributes of feet or claws <b>254</b> depicted in the wells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">According to various embodiments of the present invention, the wells <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> of the plate <b>100</b> are positioned relative to the main compartment <b>100</b> to match the depiction on the plates. In the embodiments described above wherein the depiction on the plates is an animal depiction, the wells <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> are positioned relative to the main compartment <b>102</b> so as to depict the secondary attribute at a position relative to the primary attribute as those features are commonly seen in the particular animal. Referring to plate <b>207</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> <i>g</i>, for example, the wells <b>212</b> <i>a,b </i>are positioned relative to the main compartment <b>210</b> so that the ears <b>246</b> (depicted in the wells <b>212</b> <i>a,b</i>) are positioned on top of the head <b>255</b> (depicted in the main compartment <b>210</b>), which is how a bunny rabbit is commonly seen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">The animal depictions discussed above represent only a few of the many animal depictions that can be disposed in the main compartment <b>102</b> and the wells <b>104</b>,<b>106</b> of the plate <b>100</b> in various embodiments of the present invention. Other animal depictions include dog, elephant, goldfish, harp seal, koala, lion, mouse, owl, pig, parrot, sheep, owl, tiger, duck, cow, dinosaur, fox, hippo, ladybug, lizard, octopus, panda, bear, rhino, snail, cardinal, eagle, leopard, otter, penguin, raccoon, seagull, walrus, and zebra depictions. Further, each of the above discussed depictions can be used in connection with various colors to create additional themes. For example, with the fish depiction of plate <b>204</b>, the fish is colored blue to create a blue fish depiction and is colored green to create a green fish depiction. In another example, the normally white or black stripes of a zebra are colored a variety of different colors for a plurality of zebra depictions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">The plates can take on other, non-animal themes according to various alternative embodiments of the present invention, such as sports themes, celebrity themes, etc. In sports themed plates, the main compartment may depict various sporting goods, such as a football or basketball, and the wells may depict some other aspect of the sporting good, such as exaggerated laces for a football or one of the panels being kicked off of the soccer ball. Other sports themes include the logos of various sports leagues, team players, team logos, team mascots, team jerseys, etc. In celebrity themed plates, the main compartment may depict a caricature of a celebrity and the wells may depict a feature of that celebrity, such as big ears or eyes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">Turning now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there is shown an exploded view of a stack <b>300</b> of plates <b>201</b>–<b>208</b> and <b>302</b> having wells <b>212</b> <i>a,b </i>and <b>304</b> <i>a,b</i>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, there is shown an alternative embodiment of a compartment plate <b>500</b>. The plate <b>500</b>, which is similar to the plate <b>100</b> described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, includes a main compartment <b>502</b> and two wells <b>504</b> <i>a,b </i>disposed along the outer periphery of the main compartment <b>502</b>. A perforated line <b>506</b> is scored into the bottom wall <b>508</b> of each compartment <b>504</b> <i>a,b</i>. The perforated lines <b>506</b> enable a user of the plate <b>500</b>, often a child, to remove the bottom walls <b>508</b> of the wells <b>504</b> <i>a,b </i>so that the plate can be used as a mask—preferably prior to coming into contact with food. The nature of the plates <b>500</b>, including the shape and the animal depictions thereon, lend to the use of the plate by children as a mask. The perforations <b>506</b> obviate the need for a cutting instrument such as a knife or a pair of scissors; thus, reducing the risk of injury to a child desiring to convert the plate <b>500</b> to a mask. The perforations <b>506</b> should not be too deep, causing the wells <b>504</b> <i>a,b </i>to be porous to liquids.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">Additional perforations <b>510</b> are optionally disposed in the flanges <b>512</b> surrounding the main compartment <b>502</b> on opposite sides of the main compartment <b>502</b>. Apertures formed by removal of the sections of the flange <b>512</b> circumnavigated by the perforations <b>510</b> receive ends of pieces of string for securing the plate <b>500</b> (being used as a mask) to a child's face. Alternatively, rubber bands or elastic strips can be used to hold the plate <b>500</b> on a child's head. Alternatively still, the plate <b>500</b> is fastened to stick such as a dowel rod or flat stick, which can be grasp by a hand and held up to a child's face.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">As discussed above, the shape of the plate and location of the wells can take on a variety of forms according to alternative embodiments of the present invention. The shape of the plate and location of the wells can vary for different themes to be depicted on the plates in various alternative embodiments of the present invention. In addition to the alternative themes for depiction on plates mentioned above, the following are additional themes that may be depicted on plates having, wells in alternative embodiments of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">According to various alternative embodiments of the present invention, the following themes are depicted on plates having wells similar to the plate <b>100</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref> <i>a–h</i>: baby animals; various tropical fish; various birds; various dinosaur designs; animals in costumes indicative of various holidays such as Halloween or Christmas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">In other alternative embodiments of the present invention, the compartment plates take the form of a main compartment that is generally circular in shape and a single triangular-shaped well. An example of themes that are depicted on a plate having such features include various witch faces wherein the circular main compartment depicts a witch's face and the triangular-shaped well depicts the witch's hat. Other themes that can be depicted on this plate include various clown themes, various ice cream cone themes, and various birthday themes which may include animal or human faces depicted in the main compartment and birthday hats depicted in the triangular-shaped well.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">Another alternative embodiment includes a generally rectangular three-compartment plate having various state themes, including a state license plate depicted in a main compartment and other state related information (e.g., pictures of the state bird, tree, flower, state capital, state landmarks, etc.) depicted in the wells. Another alternative embodiment includes a generally round plate with scalloped sidewalls and a well in the center with various flower themes depicted on the plate. In another alternative embodiment of the present invention, the body of a butterfly is depicted in a generally oblong central compartment and two wing-shaped compartments depict the butterfly's wings. In yet another alternative embodiment, the compartment plate takes the shape of a traditional tombstone (e.g., rectangular with a semi-circular-shaped end) and has various Halloween related-themes depicted therein. Finally, in still other alternative embodiments of the present invention, compartment plates of most any shape can include “truth or dare question” themes, various cartoon themes, zodiac themes, “spelling bee” themes, or foreign language phrase themes. Additionally, trivia or education trivia questions and answers can be printed on each plate wherein the questions and answers correspond to the particular theme depicted on the plate. For example, on a compartment plate having an alligator depicted therein, messages regarding an alligator's diet, to which regions alligators are indigenous, etc. can be printed on a plate according to an alternative embodiment of the present invention. In still other alternative embodiments, various characters associated with a societal holiday are depicted on plates in holiday themed plates. For example, Mr. and Mrs. Claus are depicted on Christmas themed plates, or Pilgrims and Native Americans are depicted on Thanksgiving themed plates, or various hearts, flowers, cherubs, including Cupid, and Valentine's-day-type messages are depicted on Valentine's Day themed plates. In still other alternative embodiments, various characters or depictions are associated with a seasonal theme such as different colored leafs for autumn, various beach scenes or outdoor themes for summer, snowflake and snowmen themes for winter, flower themes for spring, and so on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">The manufacturing and packaging of the compartment plates, such as the animal-themed compartment plates having animal depictions thereon shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref> <i>a</i>-<b>3</b>, will be described. In various alternative embodiments of the present invention, a particular theme can consist of any practical number of associated depictions on the plates. For example, in one embodiment of the present invention, there are fifty animal depictions to be disposed on plates. The number depictions per theme, however, can exceed the number of plates commonly stacked and packaged for retail sale. A package of stacked plates for retail sale is made up of twenty-four plates, for example. Thus, in embodiments where there are fifty or more animal designs for depiction on the plates, but only twenty-four plates are being sold together at a time, not all of the depicted animal designs can be placed in one package of stacked plates. In this discussion, twenty-four plates is used as an example of the number of plates per package. In other embodiments, any practical number of plates can be stacked and packaged during manufacturing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">It is desirable to have widespread dissemination of different animal depictions in the marketplace. Towards this end, it is preferable for each package to include a variety of different themes. Placing a plurality of different animal plates per package leads to an increased chance of exposure of all the animal depictions to consumers. A competing factor, on the other hand, is that it is difficult and expensive for each package of twenty-four plates to comprise a random sampling of the fifty or more possible animal depictions. Further, various market factors influence the number depictions per package. For example, as mentioned, variety in the marketplace is desirable. However, parents have indicated a preference that the various depictions be repeated twice per package so that children are not competing over a particular animal depiction. There is a balance to be struck between the preference of including a good distribution of plates per package and the cost associated with having no repeat animal plates per package.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">Due to various manufacturing and cost constraints, all of the various plates having animal depictions thereon are not necessarily manufactured simultaneously, but can be done by increasing production capacity. Further manufacturing constraints lend to certain theme plates being manufactured together. For example, plates having similar color schemes are printed together on a web of paperboard prior to being formed as plates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">Turning now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> <i>a</i>, there is shown manufacturing system <b>600</b> for making compartment plates having an animal depiction thereon corresponding to a common animal theme While the ensuing discussion refers to the animal designs depicted on the compartment plates of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref> <i>a–h</i>, the manufacturing and packaging method of the present invention is also applicable to containers (e.g., cups, bowls, etc.) having other depictions disposed thereon according to a common theme. The manufacturing method of the present invention is applicable to other themed items such as dining utensils, place-mats, or straws having a common theme. According to one embodiment of the present invention, prior to forming the plates, each of the animal depictions is printed on paperboard with four different colored inks. Those animal depictions that are printed using the same four colors of ink are manufactured together, while those plates having animals depictions printed with a different four color combination are separately manufactured. As an example, the animal designs depicted on the plates are printed using one of three different sets of four colors: (1) green, pink, yellow, and black; (2) orange, pink, brown, and black; and (3) yellow, red, blue, and black. Additionally, layering of the four ink colors in each of the three sets creates additional colors, for example: the pink and yellow inks of the first four ink set are combined to create a shade of orange; similarly, the red and yellow inks of the third ink set are combined to create a shade of orange; and the blue and yellow inks of the third ink set are combined to create a shade of green. Additionally, the black ink of each of the three four-ink-sets is halftoned to create various shades of gray as is known in the printing art. Alternatively, more than or less than four different ink colors can be used in printing each of the animal depictions. Using less colors, however, limits the color dynamic of the depictions and using more colors adds to the cost.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">To create the compartment plates having animal designs depicted thereon, a roll of material <b>602</b>, such as paperboard, is unrolled and a web of paper <b>604</b> is fed in the direction of the arrow past a printing system including four printing cylinders <b>606</b> <i>a</i>, <b>606</b> <i>b</i>, <b>606</b> <i>c</i>, and <b>606</b> <i>d </i>that apply green, pink, yellow, and black, respectively, to the web of paper <b>604</b>. Each printing cylinder <b>606</b> includes a sixteen cell, four by four array, print plate attached to its outer surface. Put another way, each printing cylinder is four cells wide and includes four cells around its circumference. Each cell <b>608</b> of the print plate prints one animal depiction on the web of paper <b>604</b>. The animal depictions do not repeat on a print plate according to one embodiment of the present invention. Because the cells are laid out on the print plate in a 4×4 array, each rotation of the printing cylinder <b>606</b> prints a set of sixteen animal depictions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">Referring also to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> <i>b</i>, each print cell <b>608</b> on each printing cylinder <b>606</b> prints a different animal depiction A<b>1</b>–D<b>4</b> on the web <b>604</b> of paperboard as it is advanced in the direction of the arrow. The first printing cylinder <b>606</b> <i>a </i>applies green ink to the web <b>604</b> in the appropriate portions of each cell <b>608</b> to print the animal depiction in that cell <b>608</b>. For example, where the cell <b>608</b> in the first row and first column of the print plate is to print an alligator design, the first printing cylinder <b>606</b> <i>a </i>applies green ink to the web <b>604</b> of paperboard to print the alligator design A<b>1</b>. The second printing cylinder <b>606</b> <i>b </i>then applies some pink ink to the web <b>604</b> of paperboard in appropriate places to correspond to the mouth and nasal passages of the alligator design A<b>1</b>. The third cylinder <b>606</b> <i>c </i>does not apply any yellow ink to the web <b>604</b> of paperboard at the area of the alligator design A<b>1</b> because, according to one embodiment of the present invention, the alligator design does not call for any yellow ink. Finally, the forth cylinder <b>606</b> <i>d </i>applies black ink to the web <b>604</b> to outline certain features of the alligator depiction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">The web <b>604</b> of paperboard having the animal depictions A<b>1</b>–D<b>4</b> printed thereon is advanced, one row at a time, into the die <b>620</b> which includes four tools for forming the plates—one for each lane A–D. The die <b>620</b> then stamps or presses the web <b>604</b> of paperboard into the three-dimensional plates. Press forming plates from a web of paperboard is known in the art and press forming out of paperboard is described in further detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,129,874 and 5,904,643, each of which is incorporated herein in its entirety. Plates A<b>3</b>–D<b>3</b> are formed and have just exited the die <b>620</b>, plates A<b>2</b>–D<b>2</b> are being formed, and plates A<b>1</b>–D<b>1</b> are next in line to enter the die <b>620</b>. After being formed, the plates are maintained in their respective columns A, B, C, and D, also referred to as lanes, as the plates A<b>1</b>–D<b>4</b> are fed into the stacking mechanism <b>630</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">Referring also to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> <i>c</i>, the stacking mechanism <b>630</b> stacks plates from each column, or lane, into stacks <b>632</b> <i>a</i>, <b>632</b> <i>b</i>, <b>632</b> <i>c</i>, and <b>632</b> <i>d </i>of twelve (12) plates. Thus, each stack of twelve plates in lane A includes three sets of plates A<b>1</b>–A<b>4</b>. Put another way, each stack includes four different animal depictions A<b>1</b>–A<b>4</b> that are repeated three times. Although the present invention has been described thus far in connection with specific parameters given as examples, the various parameters, such as number of inks used in printing each animal depiction, the number of cells on the printing plates of the printing cylinders, the number of tools in the die, and the number of plates stacked by the stacking mechanism, can be varied in alternative embodiments of the present invention. Plates manufactured by press forming are typically press formed from dies being two (2) to seven (7) tools wide. Any practical number of plates are stacked by the stacking mechanism. And any practical number of printing cylinders apply different colored inks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">In other alternative embodiments of the present invention, each of the stacks of plates output by the stacking mechanism <b>630</b> consist of only six (6) plates per stack and all the lanes A–D are combined to form a stack of twenty-four (24) plates for packaging. A stack in lane A, for example, would include plates A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b>, A<b>3</b>, A<b>4</b>, A<b>1</b>, and A<b>2</b> and the subsequent stack in lane A would include plates A<b>3</b>, A<b>4</b>, A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b>, A<b>3</b>, and A<b>4</b>. Applicants believe that combining two different lanes of stacks of twelve (12) plates to form stacks of twenty-four (24) plates for packaging achieves the desired distribution of many different animal depictions on the plates in the market place in an efficient manner. Further, as is described below, there are other measures to further ensure that many different plates having different animal depictions are distributed in the market place at a given time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">Each stack of plates is conveyed along its respective lane A–D to a packaging center <b>640</b>. In the packaging center, stacks of twenty-four (24) plates are automatically (via automated manufacturing machinery) or manually formed and shrink-wrapped with clear plastic, allowing for a visualization of the plates contained therein. Prior to packing with transparent plastic at the packaging centers <b>640</b>, the operator(s) assembling the packaged stacks <b>642</b> output packages of twenty-four plates for each possible commination of the twelve plate stacks from the four lanes A–D—A&amp;B, A&amp;C, A&amp;D, B&amp;C, B&amp;D, C&amp;D—at near uniform levels to the extent possible with a manual operation. The operators also switch-up which lane's plates are at the top of a stack of twenty-four plates for packing. For example, first an operator may combine lanes B and C so that the stack of twelve plates from lane B is at the top of the stack. And the next time the operator combines lanes B and C, the operator places the stack of twelve plates from lane C on top of those from lane B. Put another way, one combination of lanes B and C may have plate B<b>1</b> at the top plate in the stack of twenty-four plates for packaging and the next combination of these lanes has plate C<b>1</b> on the top. In other embodiments, the operator of the packaging center intentionally rotates which of the animal depictions in the twelve plate stacks from the four lanes are on top of the stack. Thus, any of the four animal depictions per lane A–D may appear at the top of a stack of twenty-four plates to be packaged lending to the appearance of an increased variety in the marketplace because the packages that are placed on a retailer's shelf have varying a animal depiction at the front of a stack of plates in a package. Alternatively still, which row of on the printing cylinders is printed first can be varied. For example, in one manufacturing run the printing cylinders <b>606</b> are initially rotated so that plates A<b>3</b>, A<b>4</b>, A<b>1</b>, and A<b>2</b> are printed in that order. Alternatively still, because the packages of animal themed plates are disposed in cases such that they are standing upright as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> according to one embodiment of the present invention, the operator may intentionally chose as a top plate in the stack of plates to be packaged a plate having an animal depiction with a wells-up orientation. For example, the Alligator depiction of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> <i>a </i>has a wells-up orientation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">Another factor adding to the overall variety of plates within a package <b>642</b> is that plates do become damaged during the manufacturing process. For example, plates are damaged are they are conveyed along lanes A–D, printing errors render plates undesirable, plates are torn or otherwise incorrectly processed by the die, or a combination of these events can occur. When a damaged plate A<b>1</b>–D<b>4</b> is conveyed to the packaging center <b>640</b>, the operator discards that plate and inserts an undamaged plate. The animal depiction on the inserted plate does not necessarily correspond to the animal depiction on the discarded, damaged plate or even to any of the plates A<b>1</b>–D<b>4</b> currently being run on the manufacturing system <b>600</b>. Rather, the inserted plate can be any one of animal depictions in the theme From the packaging center, the plates are conveyed along a conveyor <b>644</b> to a case assembling center (not shown). While plates are damaged during manufacturing, such occurrences do not happen in regular, predictable intervals that the occurrences can be relied on in an of itself for variety.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067">In various alternative embodiments of the present invention, a plurality of manufacturing systems <b>600</b> (e.g., the three manufacturing lines) run in parallel, each outputting packages of twenty-four plates from their respective packaging centers <b>640</b> onto respective conveyors <b>644</b> to a common case assembling center. In the illustrated example, each manufacturing systems <b>600</b> manufactures sixteen plates having sixteen different animal depictions as described above In embodiments wherein the total collection of animal depictions comprises forty-five depictions, for example, three different manufacturing system <b>600</b> are set-up to output sixteen different plates each in parallel. The extra plate print cell <b>608</b> on the print plates of the printing cylinders <b>606</b> of each system <b>600</b> is either left blank or is used to create duplicate plates of more popular animal depictions. For example, 42 animals are produced once and three animals are produced twice for every one rotation of the cylinders (i.e., three animals depictions are printed twice). Each of the three different manufacturing systems <b>600</b> in the present example output six different groupings of packaged plates from their packaging centers—combined stacks from lanes A&amp;B, A&amp;C, A&amp;D, B&amp;C, B&amp;D, C&amp;D for each system <b>600</b> as discussed above. Because the six different combinations are different from lane to lane, there are a maximum of eighteen different plate packaging combinations produced when three manufacturing systems <b>600</b> are implemented. Again, additional variety is implemented by varying which lane's stacks are stack on top in the packaged stack, by the operator's replacement of damaged plates, by the operators intentional rotation of the top plate of a package, or a combination thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068">In another embodiment of the present invention, each print plate on the printing cylinders is five cells wide and is four cells around resulting in the printing of twenty different animals per rotation of the printing cylinder in five different lanes and a die that is five tools wide for forming the plates. A single stack of twelve plates output from the stacking mechanism is selected from one of the five lanes A–E and combined with another stack of twelve plates from a different one of the five lanes A–E to form a stack of twenty-four (24) plates for packaging. Thus, there are a maximum often (10) different plate combinations per package: combinations of lanes A and B, lanes A and C, lanes A and D, lanes A and E, lanes B and C, lanes B and D, lanes B and E, lanes C and D, lanes C and E, and lanes D and E. One of these combinations results in a maximum of eight (8) different animal plates per package. In other embodiments wherein the die and printing cylinder are five plates wide, for example, there are a maximum of ten different plate stack combinations possible when combining two lanes. According to one embodiment of the present invention, an operator of the packaging center manually combines the plate stacks <b>632</b> <i>a–d </i>from each of the lanes A–D to form the stacks of packaged stack <b>642</b> of twenty-four plates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, from the packaging centers of the three manufacturing systems <b>600</b>, the packaged stacks <b>642</b> are conveyed along conveyors <b>644</b> to a case assembling center (not shown) wherein the packages <b>642</b> of twenty-four plates are combined into a case <b>700</b>. As discussed above, eighteen different packaged plate stacks, at a maximum when each manufacturing system <b>600</b> is four lanes wide, are conveyed to the case assembly center. According to the illustrated embodiment, a case of plates comprises ten packages <b>710</b>–<b>719</b>. The case includes a bottom tray <b>702</b> for holding packaged plate stacks <b>710</b>–<b>719</b> and a cover <b>704</b> for protecting the plates during shipping and for facilitating the stacking the cases <b>700</b> stackable upon one another. The tray <b>702</b> and cover <b>704</b> define a covering structure useful for sending sets of plate packages into retail distribution. The cover of the case <b>700</b> is removable from the tray <b>702</b>, which is designed to be placed on a retail's shelf. The tray <b>702</b> holds the packages <b>710</b>–<b>719</b> in a standing fashion so that the faces of the animal depictions on the plates are readily seen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0070">The operator of the case assembling center selects from the eighteen different packages of themed plates to fill the cases <b>700</b>. Because there are eighteen different packages to put into a case <b>700</b>, but only ten spaces in each case, cases formed one after one another do not include the same packages of plates. The operator selects a first group of ten packages to fill a first cases and a second group of packages to fill a second case. For example, where the eighteen different packages are conveyed to the case assembly center in serial fashion, a first case may include package combinations one through ten of eighteen and the second case may include package combinations eleven through eighteen of eighteen and then one through two of eighteen. Thus, many of the cases assembled at the case assembling center are unique from one another. The complete collection of all forty-five animal themes, for example, would be represented in every two cases where each of the eighteen different package combinations are conveyed to the case assembling center in serial fashion. And an identical combination of packages in a case would be repeated every ten cases in that situation. However, further contributing to the uniqueness among cases, the plate packages output by the manufacturing systems <b>600</b> are not necessarily distributed to the case assembling center in a uniform fashion. Rather, it is more likely in a somewhat manual operation, as has been described, that packages from each of the manufacturing systems <b>600</b> are not uniformly conveyed to the case assembling center. Again, additional variety is implemented by varying which lane's stacks are stacked on top in the packaged stack and by the operator's replacement of damaged plates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, plates are manufactured using a plurality of different manufacturing systems <b>600</b> that feed plates into a single packaging center. Each stacking mechanism <b>630</b> of the plurality of manufacturing systems <b>600</b> output four lanes A–D of stacked plates—twelve plates per stack. The stacks of twelve plates are conveyed along the respect plurality of lanes A–D to a packaging center where an operator selects plates from two of the lanes to assembly the stacks of twenty-four plates for packing. If there are three different manufacturing system operating, the operator selects from twelve different lanes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0072">In yet another embodiment of the present invention, six different manufacturing systems <b>600</b> or manufacturing lines are implemented for producing compartment plates having a common theme from three different print plates, wherein each manufacturing system has its own packing center and wherein pairs of manufacturing systems share a case assembling center. The first pair of manufacturing systems may produce plates from a first and second print plate, the second pair of manufacturing system may produce plates from a first and third print plate, and the third pair of manufacturing systems may produce plates from a second and third print plate. Because each pair of manufacturing systems share a case assembling center, each cases includes plates from a maximum of two different print plates. The cases from each of the three case assembling centers are commingled in one or more pallet assembling areas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0073">The trays <b>702</b> of several cases <b>700</b> are stackable for display one top of one another and side-by-side. Due to the varied animal depictions appearing at the front of the each of the cases, enhanced customer recognition of the variety of animal depictions within the animal theme is achieved. In other alternative embodiments of the present invention, one or more cases <b>700</b> of packaged themed plates are shipped in a “display shipper” that servers as a stand for displaying the plates in a retail location. Cases <b>700</b> are stacked side-by-side and upon each other in the display shipper. Additionally, the display shipper may include other similarly themed items such as cups, bowls, utensils, plate-mats, etc. that all bare the common animal theme.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0074">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a pallet <b>800</b> of cases <b>802</b> of packaged plates is shown. The cases <b>802</b> are stacked upon a shipping pallet <b>804</b>, such as a wooden or cardboard shipping pallet. According to the illustrated embodiment, the pallet <b>800</b> includes 60 cases of plates stacked thereon—four cases wide by three cases deep by five cases high. Thus, 14,400 plates form a single pallet. The cases <b>802</b> are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> stacked and lined up end-to-end Alternatively, the cases may be stacked in staggered fashion. Typically, the plates are shipped to high-volume retailers on pallets. Alternatively, a plurality of cases (e.g., sixty) are stacked upon each other and packaged in a unitized fashion without the use of a pallet. The distribution variety of the plates into the cases also translates into a distribution variety among the stack cases on or not on the pallets.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0075">In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, a unique “prize plate” is included with a package of themed plates. The prize plate is manually or automatically inserted within a stack of plates during the assembling of the themed plates in a stack for packaging. A prize plate having a unique depictions corresponding to the theme that is inserted in a limited number of plate packages.
