<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 09/380,838 filed Dec. 9, 1999, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,540,962, which is a ยง371 of PCT/JP98/01010 filed Mar. 11, 1998, all of which are incorporated by reference.</div>
<heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates to a test device for analysis of components contained in liquid samples, particularly aqueous solutions such as blood and urine.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">A simple test device for analysis of a liquid sample by reaction with a reagent generally utilizes capillary action for introduction or transfer of a sample to a site for reaction with the reagent in the test device. As this test device, there are the-type of device where a reagent applied onto a capillary tube comes to be dissolved in a sample and the type of device where a sample penetrates into a reagent layer provided on a capillary tube.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">As an example of the former, JP-A63-274839 describes a test device comprising a lower stretching member also serving as a shaft and an upper member containing a reagent while forming a capillary tube via a spacer with said lower member. As an example of the latter, JP-A 4-188065 describes an analytical device comprising a carrier, a reagent layer sealed to the carrier, and a cover which while covering the reagent layer, is fixed so as to form a capillary chamber with the carrier, said cover having a sample feed opening and an air outlet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">However, in the type of device where a reagent comes to be dissolved in a sample, such as in the test device described in JP-A 63-274839, the concentration of a reaction solution should be accurately defined, so a sample to be fed should previously be introduced into a vessel with a known volume such as pipette. Further, in the type of device where a sample penetrates into a reagent layer, such as in the test device described in JP-A 4-188065, the reagent should be contained in a paper or a film separate from a capillary tube and then fixed to the capillary tube in order to maintain the volume of the reagent layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Accordingly, the object of the present invention is to provide a test device which can easily measure a predetermined amount of a sample and simultaneously analyze the sample without pipetting the sample into another vessel or separately preparing a reagent layer for fixing the sample.</div>
<heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">To achieve the object, the test device of the present invention is a test device for analyzing a specific component in a test solution with a reagent by allowing the test solution introduced via a test solution feed opening to react with the reagent maintained in a predetermined position in a capillary tube having the feed opening and an air outlet, said capillary tube comprising:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">a first hydrophilic region for transferring the test solution from the test solution feed opening to the reagent,</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">a second hydrophilic region having a predetermined area maintaining the reagent, and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">a hydrophobic region which separates the first hydrophilic region from the second hydrophilic region and communicates with the air outlet without passing through the first and second hydrophilic regions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">According to this test device, a test solution introduced via the test solution feed opening advances by capillary action through-the first hydrophilic region to the reagent. Simultaneously, the air in the capillary tube is pushed out and discharged from the air outlet. Once the test solution reaches the hydrophobic region, its transfer is prevented transiently by the hydrophobic region. Then, when external force is applied to the test device, the test solution pass through the hydrophobic region to transfer to the second hydrophilic region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">Because the area of the second hydrophilic region is constant, the amount of the test solution maintained therein is determined by its area and the internal diameter of the capillary tube. When the test solution passes the hydrophobic region to transfer to the second hydrophilic region, the test solution remaining on the hydrophobic region or the solution which cannot be maintained on the second hydrophilic region is removed by repulsion by the hydrophobic region. Accordingly, it is not necessary to pipette the test solution previously into a vessel having a known volume or to maintain the reagent in a layered predetermined area. Further, because the region maintaining the reagent is hydrophilic, the reagent can be fixed to the second hydrophilic region by merely applying it. By reaction between a predetermined amount of the maintained test solution and the reagent, a specific component in the test solution can be analyzed highly accurately.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">External force applied to permit the test solution to pass through the hydrophobic region includes e.g. instantaneous vibration or centrifugal force by shaking the test device by the hand of an operator, suction force by suction through the air outlet, and pressurization through the feed opening.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">The air outlet is preferably a penetration hole formed in such a direction that it intersects the capillary tube. By forming the penetration hole in this way, the capillary tube can be formed into a tube where excluding the penetration hole, the test solution feed opening only is open, and the overflow of the test solution maintained in the second hydrophilic region can be prevented. The angle at which the penetration hole intersects the capillary tube at the side of the first hydrophilic region is preferably an acute angle. By this constitution, when the test solution is transferred by external force to the second hydrophilic region, it can stop flowing from the penetration hole, thus preventing biohazard.</div>

<heading>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading>First Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">The test device of the present invention in the first embodiment is shown in the perspective view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the plan view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and the sectional view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">Test device <b>1</b> is provided with rectangular parallelepiped main body <b>2</b>. The main body <b>2</b> is composed of three transparent plates where the middle plate is manufactured into a frame, and the hollow <b>3</b> which is long and narrow in the lengthwise direction, surrounded by the frame and the upper and lower plates, functions as a capillary tube. The upper plate in the main body <b>2</b> is provided with a feed opening <b>4</b> communicating with one end of the hollow <b>3</b>. The internal surface of the hollow <b>3</b> consists of the first hydrophilic region <b>31</b> continuous with the feed opening <b>4</b> and modified to be hydrophilic, the hydrophobic region <b>32</b> continuous therewith, and the second hydrophilic region <b>33</b> continuous therewith, and the hollow <b>3</b> is blocked at the back of the second hydrophilic region <b>33</b>. The main body <b>2</b> is provided with the penetration hole <b>5</b> for permitting the hydrophobic region <b>32</b> to communicate with the outside without passing through the hydrophilic regions <b>31</b> and <b>33</b>, and the penetration hole <b>5</b> is provided in such a direction that it intersects with the hollow <b>3</b> and forms an acute angle with the first hydrophilic region. A reagent (not shown) is applied to the second hydrophilic region <b>33</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">The method of manufacturing the test device <b>1</b> is e.g. as follows. Three rectangular plates made of ABS are prepared. ABS is inherently hydrophobic. In the first plate, regions on which the hydrophilic regions <b>31</b> &amp; <b>33</b> are to be formed are irradiated with UV rays from a low-pressure mercury lamp as a light source. The portions thus irradiated have been modified to be hydrophilic. The second plate is manufactured into a frame and provided with the penetration hole <b>5</b>. The third plate is provided with the feed opening <b>4</b>, and the predetermined portions are modified to be hydrophilic in the same manner as in the first plate. After a reagent (not shown) is applied to the second hydrophilic region <b>33</b>, the three plates are laminated and fixed. The test device is thus completed. Further, a plate made of an originally hydrophilic material may be used in place of the plate made of ABS. In this case, the test device <b>1</b> can be produced in the same manner by applying a hydrophobic coating such as alkoxy silane onto the predetermined portions on a hydrophilic plate such as a glass plate. There is no necessity for separately forming a reagent in either case, unlike the prior art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">The procedure of analyzing a liquid sample by the test device <b>1</b> is as follows: Collected blood itself or blood subjected to corpuscle-separating treatment, in a slightly larger amount than the optimum amount, is pushed against the feed opening <b>4</b>. The blood while wetting the first hydrophilic region <b>31</b> is transferred by capillary action toward the second hydrophilic region <b>33</b>, but is prevented from being transferred on the way by the hydrophobic region <b>32</b>. If collected blood itself is used as a sample, a pretreatment means such as corpuscle separating membrane etc. may be provided on the way of the first hydrophilic region <b>31</b>. Then, the side of the main body <b>2</b> (right side in the drawing) is tapped lightly. By this external force, the blood with which the first hydrophilic region <b>31</b> is filled is transferred via the hydrophobic region <b>32</b> to the second hydrophilic region <b>33</b>. Simultaneously, the air in the space surrounded by the second hydrophilic region <b>33</b> is removed through the penetration hole <b>5</b>. The blood initiates reaction with the reagent. The hydrophobic region <b>32</b> is not wetted by blood, so the amount of blood to be filled in the second hydrophilic region delimited by the inner wall of the capillary tube and the hydrophobic region <b>32</b> is always constant. Accordingly, the blood can be analyzed quantitatively with high accuracy. In addition, the main body <b>2</b> is transparent so the blood can be analyzed rapidly with an optical means.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">For the following reason, it is preferable that the penetration hole <b>5</b> as an air outlet is arranged preferably in a position apart by c=0.2 mm or more from the boundary portion between the secondary hydrophilic region <b>33</b> and the hydrophobic region <b>32</b>. The hydrophobic region, once a test solution is passed therethrough, can be rendered slightly hydrophilic by the action of the test solution. Because the hydrophobic region and the secondary hydrophilic region are continuous on the same surface, a test solution introduced into the second hydrophilic region may form a meniscus at the boundary with the hydrophobic region. Accordingly, if this boundary portion is too close to the air outlet, the meniscus is not stopped by the hydrophobic region and thus binds directly to the air outlet, thus permitting the test solution to flow out through the air outlet.</div>
<heading>Second Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">Now, the test device in the second embodiment is shown in the plan view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and in the sectional view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. This test device <b>6</b> has the same structure as in the first embodiment except that it is not provided with the penetration hole <b>5</b>, the hollow <b>7</b> is also open in the opposite side to the feed opening <b>8</b>, the opening <b>9</b> has an exhaust function in place of the penetration hole <b>5</b>, the hydrophobic regions <b>72</b> and <b>74</b> in the hollow <b>7</b> are separated into two positions between which the second hydrophilic region <b>73</b> is sandwiched.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">In the case of analysis by this test device <b>6</b>, the air in the hollow <b>7</b> is removed through the opening <b>9</b> as the test solution advances due to capillary action. The hydrophobic regions <b>72</b> and <b>74</b> are not wetted by liquid, so the amount of blood filled in the second hydrophilic region <b>73</b> delimited by the inner wall of the capillary tube and the hydrophobic regions <b>72</b> and <b>74</b> is always constant. Because air is removed from the opening <b>9</b> which is located at a position extending from the second hydrophilic region <b>73</b>, the test solution advances rapidly.</div>
<heading>Third Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">The test device of the present invention in the third embodiment is shown in the plan view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In this embodiment, the capillary tube is bent between the first hydrophilic region and the hydrophobic region. Further, assuming that the air outlet extends without bending the first hydrophilic region at the boundary with the hydrophobic region, it is arranged at a position which is not the imaginary extending portion. Hereinafter, the test device is described in detail by reference to the drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">The test device <b>11</b> is provided with the rectangular parallelepiped main body <b>12</b>. The main body <b>12</b> is composed of three transparent plates, where the middle plate is manufactured into a frame, and the hollow <b>13</b> which is long and narrow in the lengthwise direction, surrounded by the frame and the upper and lower plates and bent at two positions, acts as a capillary tube. The hollow <b>13</b> begins at one end of the main body <b>12</b> and is blocked on the way without reaching the other end. In this example, its beginning portion serves as the feed opening <b>14</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">The inside of the hollow <b>13</b> is composed of the first hydrophilic region <b>131</b>, the hydrophobic region <b>132</b>, and the second hydrophilic region <b>133</b>. The first hydrophilic region <b>131</b> extends from the feed opening <b>14</b> to the first bending portion, the hydrophobic region <b>132</b> extends from the first to second bending portions, and the hollow <b>13</b> is blocked at the back of the second hydrophilic region <b>133</b>. The hollow <b>13</b> bends to the right at the first bending point and to the left at the second bending point in the direction to which a sample advances. In the present invention, the relationship between the angel of the first bending point, particularly the angle of the outer peripheral side expressed as ฮฑ in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and the width of the hollow <b>13</b> is important. That is, assuming that the first hydrophilic region <b>131</b> extends without being bent at the boundary with the hydrophobic region <b>132</b>, the imaginary extending portion is designed so as to overlap with the second hydrophilic region <b>133</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">The main body <b>12</b> is provided with the penetration hole <b>15</b> permitting the hydrophobic region <b>132</b> to communicate with the outside without passing through both hydrophilic regions <b>131</b> and <b>133</b>. This penetration hole <b>15</b> functions as an air outlet. The first bending point is provided at the inner peripheral side with the penetration hole <b>15</b>. A reagent (not shown) is applied to the second hydrophilic region <b>133</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">The method of manufacturing the test device <b>11</b> is essentially the same as in the first embodiment. However, polystyrene (PS) is used in place of ABS as the material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">The procedure of analyzing a test sample by the test device <b>11</b> is also the same as in the first embodiment. However, a part of blood flowing from the first hydrophilic region <b>131</b> to the secondary hydrophilic region <b>133</b> is contacted with the side wall of the hydrophobic region <b>132</b>. While its direction is changed by the counter force to forcibly transfer the air in the hydrophobic region <b>132</b> to the penetration hole <b>15</b>, the blood is transferred to the second hydrophilic region <b>133</b>. Accordingly, the air is removed easily as compared with the first embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">The degree of bending of the capillary tube is not limited. The capillary tube may also be bent smoothly or may be bent such that the first hydrophilic region and the hydrophobic region intersect. However, the capillary tube is preferably bend to such an extent that said imaginary extending portion overlaps with the second hydrophilic region. By doing so, the whole of the test solution flowing from the first hydrophilic region is prevented from being splashed on the side wall of the hydrophobic region.</div>
<heading>EXAMPLE 1 </heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">The test device <b>11</b> in the form shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> was prepared where the width and height of the hollow <b>13</b> were 3 mm and 0.2 mm respectively, the depth โaโ of the second hydrophilic region <b>133</b> was 3 mm, the length โbโ of the hydrophobic region <b>132</b> was 5 mm, the hollow <b>13</b> was bent at 30ยฐ to the right at the first bending point and at 30ยฐ to the left at the second-bending point in the direction to which a sample advances.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">Human plasma or serum (hereinafter referred to as human plasma) was introduced as the test solution via the feed opening <b>14</b> into the test device <b>11</b>, and external force was applied to transfer the test solution to the second hydrophilic region <b>133</b>. For comparison, the test device R<b>11</b> having the same shape and quality as the test device <b>11</b> except that the hollow was not bent as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> was prepared, and the test solution was transferred to the second hydrophilic region <b>133</b>โฒ in the same manner. The ratio of inclusion of air bubble (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) in the test solution maintained in the second hydrophilic regions <b>133</b> and <b>133</b>โฒ was evaluated. The number of test devices was 20 for each of the test devices <b>11</b> and R<b>11</b>. Three minutes later, the maintained test solution was removed by means of a micro-syringe, and its amount was measured to evaluate the maintenance accuracy. These evaluation results are shown in Table 1.</div>

<heading>Fourth Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">In the first to third embodiments described above, the hydrophobic region is continuous on the same face with the second hydrophilic region. In this structure, as shown in the first embodiment, the test solution which entered into the second hydrophilic region may form a meniscus in the boundary with the hydrophobic region. If this meniscus is convex, there is no problem. However, if it is concave and the distance โcโ (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is unintentionally inadequate, there is a possibility that the test solution goes along the wall of the tube to flow gradually from the air outlet. Accordingly, it becomes difficult to quantitatively maintain the test solution in the second hydrophilic region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">Accordingly, in the fourth embodiment, a groove poorer in wettability than the second hydrophilic region is made at the boundary between the hydrophobic region and the second hydrophilic region. Thus, the groove further stresses the difference in wettability between the two regions to regulate the meniscus.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">The main body <b>22</b> is provided with the penetration hole <b>25</b> permitting the hydrophobic region <b>232</b> to communicate with the outside without passing through both hydrophilic regions <b>231</b> and <b>233</b>. The penetration hole <b>25</b> functions as an air outlet. A reagent (not shown) is applied to the second hydrophilic region <b>233</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">The method of manufacturing the test device <b>21</b> is essentially the same as in the first embodiment. However, two plates made of polystyrene (PS) and one plate made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) are used in place of three plates made of ABS as the material. By irradiation with UV rays, the predetermined regions are modified to be hydrophilic. Then, the grooves <b>26</b> are made with a knife around the portion which will form the hydrophobic region <b>232</b> on the first and second PS plates. A water-repellent agent such as dimethyl polysiloxane is applied to the portion surrounded by the grooves <b>26</b>. The presence of the grooves <b>26</b> prevents the water-repellent agent from flowing into the hydrophilic region. After a reagent (not shown) is applied to the second hydrophilic region <b>233</b>, the three plates are laminated and fixed. The test device is thus completed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">The procedure of analyzing a liquid sample by the test device <b>21</b> is also the same as shown in the first embodiment. However, the grooves <b>26</b> are made at the boundary between the hydrophobic region <b>232</b> and the second hydrophilic region <b>233</b>, so the amount of blood to be filled in the second hydrophilic region <b>233</b> is always more constant than in the first embodiment. Accordingly, the sample can be quantitatively analyzed with high accuracy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067">Said grooves are made preferably on the whole periphery of the hydrophobic region including the boundary with the second hydrophilic region. The reason for this is as follows: Whether a certain region is hydrophilic or hydrophobic is relatively determined. In the method of altering wettability on a capillary tube, there are cases where a capillary tube is rendered more hydrophilic or more hydrophobic than original. In the present invention, at least two hydrophilic regions and at least one hydrophobic region should be formed in a capillary tube. Accordingly, there are the following 3 combinations: (1) the hydrophobic region remains original while the region to be rendered hydrophilic is modified to be more hydrophilic than original; (2) the region to be rendered hydrophobic is modified to be more hydrophobic than original while the hydrophilic region remains original; and (3) the region to be rendered hydrophobic is modified to be more hydrophobic than original while the region to be rendered hydrophilic is rendered more hydrophilic than original. The modification for conferring hydrophilicity is conducted by physical means such as UV irradiation, whereas the modification for conferring hydrophobicity is usually conducted by applying a water-repellent agent. Said grooves assume the role of preventing the water-repellent agent applied onto the hydrophobic region from flowing to the hydrophilic region. Accordingly, the boundary between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions can be made definite by providing the whole periphery of the hydrophobic region with the grooves.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068">If the diameter of said capillary tube provided with the grooves is 100 to 800 ฮผm in the depth direction of the groove, the depth of the groove is preferably 1/10 to ยฝ relative to the diameter of the capillary tube.</div>
<heading>Fifth Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">Now, the test device in the fifth embodiment is shown in the plan view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> and in the sectional view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. The test device <b>29</b> has the same structure as in the fourth embodiment except that (1) it is not provided with the penetration hole <b>25</b>, (2) the hollow <b>27</b> is also open in the opposite side to the feed opening <b>278</b>, and the opening <b>275</b> has an exhaust function in place of the penetration hole <b>25</b>, (3) the hydrophobic regions <b>272</b> and <b>274</b> in the hollow <b>27</b> are separated into two positions between which the second hydrophilic region <b>273</b> is sandwiched, and (4) accordingly the groove <b>276</b> is also made at the boundary between the second hydrophilic region <b>273</b> and the second hydrophobic region <b>274</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0070">In the case of analysis by this test device <b>29</b>, the air in the hollow <b>27</b> is removed from the opening <b>275</b> as a test solution advances due to capillary action. The hydrophobic regions <b>272</b> and <b>274</b> are not wetted by liquid. Further, the grooves <b>276</b> are made in the boundary between the hydrophobic regions <b>272</b>, <b>274</b> and the second hydrophilic region <b>273</b>, so the amount of blood to be filled in the second hydrophilic region <b>273</b> is always constant. Because air is removed from the opening <b>275</b> which is located at a position extending from the second hydrophilic region <b>273</b>, the test solution advances rapidly.</div>

<heading>Sixth Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0076">As described in the fourth embodiment, the test solution introduced into the second hydrophilic region will form a meniscus in the boundary with the hydrophobic region. If this meniscus is large, the test solution cannot be quantitatively maintained in the second hydrophilic region even if the second hydrophilic region is provided with excellent dimension accuracy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0077">Thus, in the sixth embodiment, the width โdโ of the capillary tube in the boundary portion between the hydrophobic region and the second hydrophilic region is made narrower than the width โDโ of the capillary tube in the second hydrophilic region. Accordingly, when the area of the second hydrophilic region is constant, the meniscus formed in the test device in this example is smaller than the meniscus formed in the test device with a capillary tube having uniform width. The test device in the sixth embodiment is shown in the plan view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. Hereinafter, the test device is described in detail by reference to the drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0078">The test device <b>31</b> is provided with the rectangular parallel piped main body <b>32</b>. The main body <b>32</b> is composed of three transparent plates, where the middle plate is manufactured into a frame, and the hollow <b>33</b> which is long and narrow in the lengthwise direction, surrounded by the frame and the upper and lower plates, acts as a capillary tube. The hollow <b>33</b> begins at one end of the main body <b>32</b> and is blocked on the way without reaching the other end. In this example, the beginning portion serves as the feed opening <b>34</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0079">The inside of the hollow <b>33</b> is composed of the first hydrophilic region <b>331</b>, the hydrophobic region <b>332</b> and the second hydrophilic region <b>333</b> in this order from the side of the feed opening <b>34</b>. The width of the hollow <b>33</b> from the feed opening <b>34</b> to the hydrophobic region <b>332</b> is constant, whereas the width of the hollow <b>33</b> in the second hydrophilic region <b>333</b> continuous with the hydrophobic region <b>332</b> is increased in the width direction. Then, the hollow <b>33</b> is blocked at the back of the second hydrophilic region <b>333</b>. Accordingly, the first hydrophilic region <b>331</b> and the hydrophobic region <b>332</b> are rectangular, and the second hydrophilic region <b>333</b> only is trapezoid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0080">The main body <b>32</b> is provided with the penetration hole <b>35</b> for permitting the hydrophobic region <b>332</b> to communicate with the outside without passing through both the hydrophilic regions <b>331</b> and <b>333</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0084">Said air outlet is arranged preferably at a position apart by c=0.2 mm or more from the boundary portion between the secondary hydrophilic region and the hydrophobic region.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0091">As shown in Table 3, when the test solution is transferred to the reagent-maintaining portion, the test solution can be maintained quantitatively without forming a meniscus, according to the test device in this example. On the other hand, the test devices <b>31</b>โฒ and <b>31</b>โณ were inferior in maintenance accuracy. The amount of the sample maintained in the test device <b>31</b>โฒ varied probably because of a varying size of the meniscus.

<heading>Eighth Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0092">Because the area of the second hydrophilic region is constant, the amount of the test solution maintained in the second hydrophilic region is approximately determined by its area and the internal diameter of the capillary tube. However, when the test solution is transferred via the hydrophobic region to the second hydrophilic region, an excess test solution remains on the hydrophobic region or the first hydrophilic region. If this excess solution is left, it binds to the test solution maintained in the second hydrophilic region, thus lowering analytical accuracy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0093">Accordingly, in the eighth embodiment, an excess liquid-retainer capable of retaining the test solution that may flow from the second hydrophilic region is formed in the hydrophobic region ranging from the boundary portion between the hydrophobic region and the second hydrophilic region to the air outlet. In this embodiment, an excess solution is transiently retained in the liquid retainer formed in the hydrophobic region. Because this portion is hydrophobic, it repels an excess test solution into the air outlet. Accordingly, the test solution can be analyzed highly accurately. The air outlet is preferably rendered more readily wetted with the test solution than in the hydrophobic region. By doing so, an excess test solution retained in the liquid retainer can be rapidly removed into the air outlet.

<heading>Ninth Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0104">In the ninth embodiment, an excess test solution which could not be maintained in the second hydrophilic region is removed in a different constitution from that in the eighth embodiment. In this embodiment, the air outlets are formed at a position (first air outlet) close to the first hydrophilic region at one side of the capillary tube and at a position (second air outlet) close to the second hydrophilic region at the other side of the capillary tube respectively, between which the hydrophobic region is sandwiched. The inside of the capillary tube communicates with the air via the first air outlet, so an excess test solution is rapidly captured by the second air outlet. Accordingly, it can be analyzed highly accurately. The test device in the ninth embodiment is shown in the plan view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. Hereinafter, the test device is described in detail by reference to the drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0105">The test device <b>51</b> is provided with the rectangular parallelepiped main body <b>52</b>. The main body <b>52</b> is composed of three transparent plates where the middle plate is manufactured into a frame, and the hollow <b>53</b> which is long and narrow in the lengthwise direction, surrounded by the frame and the upper and lower plates, acts as a capillary tube. The hollow <b>53</b> begins at one end of the main body <b>52</b> and is blocked on the way without reaching the other end. In this example, the beginning portion serves as the feed opening <b>54</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0106">The inside of the hollow <b>53</b> is composed of the first hydrophilic region <b>531</b>, the hydrophobic region <b>532</b> and the second hydrophilic region <b>533</b> in this order from the side of the feed opening <b>54</b>. The hollow <b>53</b> is blocked at the back of the second hydrophilic region <b>533</b>, and possesses uniform width from the feed opening <b>54</b> to the blocked portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0107">The main body <b>52</b> is provided with the penetration holes <b>55</b> and <b>58</b> for permitting the hydrophobic region <b>532</b> to communicate with the outside without passing through both the hydrophilic regions <b>531</b> and <b>533</b>. These penetration holes <b>55</b> and <b>58</b> function as an air outlets. The penetration holes <b>55</b> and <b>58</b> are formed at both sides of the capillary tube such that they face to each other around the hydrophobic region <b>532</b>. However, the penetration hole <b>55</b> is close to the second hydrophilic region <b>533</b>, and the penetration hole <b>58</b> is close to the first hydrophilic region. The inside of the penetration hole <b>58</b> has the same hydrophobicity as the hydrophobic region <b>532</b>, while the inside of the penetration hole <b>55</b> is rendered less hydrophilic than the second hydrophilic region <b>533</b> but more hydrophilic than the hydrophobic region <b>532</b>. A reagent (not shown) is applied to the second hydrophilic region <b>533</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0108">The method of manufacturing the test device <b>51</b> is the same as in the first embodiment except that two plates made of PS and one plate made of PVC are used in place of plates made of ABS as the material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0109">The procedure for analyzing a liquid sample by the test device <b>51</b> is also the same in the first embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0110">However, in the test device <b>51</b> unlike the first embodiment, air is introduced via the penetration hole <b>58</b> while an excess test solution is removed from the penetration hole <b>55</b> relatively poor in hydrophobicity. Accordingly, the amount of blood to be filled in the second hydrophilic region <b>533</b> is always more constant than in the first embodiment, and the sample can be analyzed quantitatively with high accuracy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0111">The second air outlet also functions in capturing an excess test solution, whereas the first air outlet always fulfills the exhaust function only. Accordingly, the inside of the first air outlet is preferably rendered more hydrophobic than the inside of the second air outlet in order to raise the reliability of the first air outlet.</div>
<heading>EXAMPLE 5 </heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0112">The test device <b>51</b> in the form shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> was prepared where the width and height of the hollow <b>53</b> were 3 mm and 500 ฮผm respectively, and the depth of the second hydrophilic region <b>533</b> was 3 mm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0113">Human plasma was introduced as the test solution via the feed opening <b>54</b> into the test device <b>51</b>, and by applying external forces, the test solution was transferred to the second hydrophilic region <b>533</b>. For comparison, the test devices R<b>1</b>, R<b>2</b> and R<b>3</b> (not shown) having the same shape and quality as those of the test device <b>51</b> except for the following differences were produced besides the test device <b>51</b>. The test device R<b>1</b> does not have the penetration hole <b>58</b>, and further the inside of the penetration hole <b>55</b> is rendered hydrophobic to the same degree as in the hydrophobic region <b>532</b>. In the test device R<b>2</b>, the insides of the penetration holes <b>55</b> and <b>58</b> are rendered hydrophobic to the same degree as in the hydrophobic region <b>532</b>. In the test device R<b>3</b>, the inside of the penetration hole <b>55</b> is rendered hydrophobic to the same degree as in the hydrophobic region <b>532</b>, while the inside of the penetration hole <b>58</b> is rendered hydrophilic. In the test devices R<b>1</b> to R<b>3</b>, the test solution was transferred to the second hydrophilic region in the same manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0114">When transfer of the test solution was observed, the following three types of abnormal transfer occurred besides the normal transfer of a suitable amount of the test solution to be maintained in the second hydrophilic region. In the first type, the amount of the solution transferred to the second hydrophilic region was inadequate as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. In the case of the second type, the test solution retained in the second hydrophilic region contained bubbles as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. These problems in both cases were possibly due to an insufficient exhaust function at the time of transfer of the test solution. In the case of the third type, an excess test solution remained in the hydrophobic region as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. The number of test devices showing such abnormal transfer is shown for each type in Table. 5.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0115">Three minutes later, the maintained test solution was removed by means of a micro-syringe, and its amount was measured to evaluate the maintenance accuracy. These evaluation results are collectively shown in Table 5. The number of test devices for each case was 20.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0117">As shown in Table 5, when the test solution is transferred to the reagent-maintaining portion, an excess test solution is rapidly removed and a suitable amount of the test solution only is maintained without forming bubbles, according to the test device in this example.</div>
<heading>Tenth Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0118">The suction force by capillary action is not strong and readily affected by the physical properties of the liquid. Accordingly, if the transfer of the test solution depends exclusively on capillary action, the transfer of the test solution to the analytical part is time-consuming. Further, the distance between the test solution feed opening and the analytical part cannot be made large.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0119">Accordingly, the test device in the tenth embodiment is provided with a suction generating means for promoting transfer of the test solution. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is a perspective view of the test device in the tenth embodiment, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is an XXV-XXV sectional view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0120">The test device <b>101</b> is provided with the rectangular parallelepiped main body <b>20</b>, and the main face of the main body is provided with the test solution feed opening <b>30</b>, the air hole <b>40</b>, and the suction generating chamber <b>50</b>. The suction generating chamber <b>50</b> is arranged so as to be protruded from the main face of the main body <b>20</b>, and its inside is hollow. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the inside of the test device <b>101</b> is provided with the capillary tube <b>60</b> leading from the test feed opening <b>30</b> to the suction generating chamber <b>50</b>. The capillary tube <b>60</b> communicates on the way with the air via the air hole <b>40</b>. Both ends of the capillary tube <b>60</b> are blocked by the corpuscle removing filter <b>70</b> at the side of the test solution feed opening <b>30</b> and by the reagent film <b>80</b> at the side of the suction generating chamber <b>50</b>. In the inside of the capillary tube <b>60</b>, the analytical part <b>61</b> as the first hydrophilic region, the hydrophobic region <b>62</b>, and the second hydrophilic region <b>63</b> are formed linearly from the side of the suction generating chamber <b>50</b> to the side of the feed opening <b>30</b>. Said air hole <b>40</b> is formed in the hydrophobic region <b>62</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0121">The materials of the main body <b>20</b> make use of light-transmissible plastics. For example, ABS, polystyrene, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) etc. are used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0122">The materials of the suction generating chamber <b>50</b> should be elastic so as to change the volume of the chamber. The materials which can be used for the suction generating chamber <b>50</b> include rubber, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, PET etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0123">The corpuscle removing filter <b>70</b> makes use of matrix such as glass filter to impart liquid permeability and solid impermeability. Lecithin may be used as filter medium to improve the ability to remove corpuscle components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0124">The reagent film <b>80</b> should be gas-permeable and simultaneously liquid-impermeable. Accordingly, a porous resin is used as the reagent film <b>80</b>. Further, the reagent film <b>80</b> contains a reagent for analyzing a specific component, as well as an optically reflective agent such as titanium dioxide. Then, the lower half of the reagent film <b>80</b> is formed into the reagent layer <b>81</b> containing the reagent, and the upper half thereof is formed into the optically reflective layer <b>82</b> containing an optically reflective agent. However, the reagent and the optically reflective agent may be mixed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0125">The method of forming the analytical part <b>61</b> (first hydrophilic region), the hydrophobic region <b>62</b>, and the second hydrophilic region <b>63</b> in the inside of the capillary tube <b>60</b> is essentially the same as in the first embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0126">Analysis of plasma or serum components by the test device <b>101</b> is as follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0127">First, after whole blood is applied onto the feed opening <b>30</b>, the suction generating chamber <b>50</b> is pressed with a finger whereby its volume is reduced, and simultaneously the excess air therein is removed from the air hole <b>40</b>. Then, the air hole <b>40</b> is closed with another finger, and the finger pressing against the suction generating chamber <b>50</b> is removed. The suction generating chamber <b>50</b> is composed of an elastic material so that the reduced volume will return to the original volume. Suction is thereby generated, and the whole blood in the feed opening <b>30</b> is introduced into the capillary tube <b>60</b>, to transfer to the analytical part <b>61</b>. However, the corpuscle removing filter <b>70</b> allows the liquid to pass but does not allow solids to pass therethrough, so the corpuscle components are removed and only plasma or serum is introduced into the capillary tube <b>60</b>, to transfer to the analytical part <b>61</b>. Because this filter is arranged apart from the analytical part, there is no need to worry about errors due to the influence of corpuscle components in order to optically measure the result of reaction with the reagent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0128">Then, the finger with which the air hole <b>40</b> is closed is removed and left for a while. By doing so, a predetermined amount of plasma or serum can be fed to the analytical part <b>61</b>. That is, the analytical part <b>61</b> is hydrophilic, and it is surrounded by the hydrophobic region <b>62</b> and the air-permeable but liquid-impermeable reagent film <b>80</b>, so the amount of plasma or serum fed to the analytical part <b>61</b> is always equal to the volume of the analytical part <b>61</b>. However, because the suction force of the suction generating chamber <b>50</b> is relatively strong where the ability of the hydrophobic region <b>62</b> to repel water is inadequate, excess plasma or serum may remain in the hydrophobic region <b>62</b>. In this case, the test device <b>101</b> is e.g. slightly shaken with the hand so that the excess plasma or serum may be returned to the second hydrophilic region <b>63</b>. If there is air in the capillary tube <b>60</b>, the air is simultaneously removed from the air hole <b>40</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0129">If plasma or serum is fed to the analytical part <b>61</b>, the reagent contained in the reagent film <b>80</b> is eluted. As a result of its reaction with a specific component in plasma or serum, a colored substance is formed and the plasma or serum is thereby colored. The main body <b>20</b> is light-transmissible, and the reagent film <b>80</b> has the optically reflective layer <b>82</b>, so the degree of this coloration can be measured with a device equipped with light irradiation part <b>90</b> and light detecting part <b>10</b>, such as densitometer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0130">The test device <b>101</b> can generate strong suction in the capillary tube by the suction generating means in addition to capillary action, and this forcible suction can be utilized to transfer the test solution forcibly from the feed opening for the test solution to the analytical part.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0131">Accordingly, unlike a test device using only capillary action, a test solution containing corpuscles such as whole blood which require filtration can also be measured by the present test device, and the test solution can be rapidly transferred. Further, even a test solution obtained in such a small volume as the volume of the analytical part can be subjected to measurement. That is, regardless of the amount or physical properties, the test solution can be certainly transferred to the analytical part.</div>
<heading>Eleventh Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0132">As the eleventh embodiment, the test device <b>101</b> including a roller automatically regulating the volume of the suction generating chamber and opening and shutting the air hole is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> shows the test device at each stage for analysis of plasma or serum components. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26(A)</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26(B)</figref>, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26(C)</figref> are sectional views of the test device <b>11</b> at the preparative stage, corpuscle removing stage and plasma or serum volume regulating stage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0133">At the preparative stage (A) , roller <b>140</b> presses the suction generating chamber <b>50</b> downward to reduce the volume. At the stage of (B), roller <b>140</b> rolls down from the suction generating chamber <b>50</b> and stops on the air hole <b>40</b>, thereby shutting the passage of air. The volume of the suction generating chamber <b>50</b> will be returned to the original volume, thus generating suction. Corpuscles are thereby removed from whole blood <b>150</b>, and plasma or serum <b>160</b> is introduced into the capillary tube. At the stage of (C), roller <b>140</b> rolls again whereby the air hole <b>40</b> is opened. At this stage, the amount of plasma or serum fed to the analytical part is regulated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0134">Because roller <b>140</b> automatically works, it is not necessary for the operator to press the suction generating chamber <b>50</b> or to close the air hole <b>40</b> by the finger. Accordingly, the procedure is made simpler, and an operational miss by the operator can be prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0135">In the tenth and eleventh embodiments, the reagent film <b>80</b> contains a reagent, but the reagent may replaced by the air-permeable but liquid-impermeable film and the reagent may be directly applied onto the surface of its facing analytical part <b>61</b>, i.e. onto the surface of the first hydrophilic region in order to fix the reagent thereto.</div>
<heading>INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0136">According to the test device of the present invention, a test solution can be analyzed by applying a suitable amount of a test solution without previously measuring the test solution by a measuring device. Accordingly, it is useful as an analytical device for rapid and easy analysis. Further, the test device of the preset invention can be produced in a less number of steps because a reagent can be fixed by merely applying the reagent onto a predetermined position.</div>
