<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This application is a continuation of pending International Application No. PCT/IT01/00128 filed Mar. 14, 2001, which designates the United States and claims priority of Italian application No. UD2000A000228 filed Dec. 28, 2000.</div>
<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">This invention relates to an automatic or semiautomatic translation system and method with post-editing for the correction of errors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">In particular the invention relates to an improved computer translation system and method with intervention of the operator to obtain a high professional level translation quality depending on the capacity of the operator who checks the translation of the computer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">The technical field consequently is of high professional translation in the field of computer assisted translation, starting from a text of a certain language, memorized or able to be memorized in the computer, to produce texts in other languages in a manner checked by the operator.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">The method is preferably used, even if not exclusively, in the field of translation, including
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0006">automatic translation with post-editing operated by the operator,</li> <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0007">semiautomatic or interactive translation always checked by the operator during the evolution of the translation.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">The inventor realized, in 1987, an automatic translation system, today known on the market as “Hypertrans”, which is able to operate on Macintosh by Apple Computer Inc. Cupertino Calif. U.S.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">At that time translators in DOS systems were known but without analysis of the sentence, that is word by word, and therefore, without big substantial instructions but only using searching in a file and changing with the existing translation from the consultation dictionary, as there was the well known limit of 750 K.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">Small sentence translators also existed at that time, but were based on a memory containing a limited number of more frequently used sentences.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">At that time there also existed systems for translation with analysis of the sentence, however only on large computers or a mainframe, as for example “Systran” translator system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">Other systems were not known on the market and possible patented ideas had not found concrete application.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">After experimentation and placing of the system on the market, this had continuous improvements particularly in the technological field, to be considered today worldwide, as the most qualitatively advanced technological professional translation system in all the combinations of the main European languages EN, DE, FR, IT, ES.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">During the years an important improvement was made to the system for interactive translation giving the possibility of memorization of sentences for their eventual reuse as for example “Translation manager” of the IBM “International Business Machines”, as one can also see from the following disclosure of the prior art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">Even if this methodology gave a great qualitative advantage of the translation, it had the inconvenience of the low probability level that the sentence memorized could be repeated frequently, so the system is used only for translations which are repetitive, as for example the translation of the instruction manuals of the machines, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">All the techniques known up to now freed the way to post-digiting or post-editing, which in any way had to be made manually by the operator after the translation in the same program (basic translation software) or in any word processing system. The subsequent completion times of a translation of a high professional level involved the sum of the translation time plus the final check and correction time, so, to date the sum of these two times is not competitive with the translation operated directly by a skilled-person who knows both languages very well.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">The known system product by the same inventor and known on the market as “Hypertrans” operating on MAC computers of the Apple Computer of Cupertino Calif. U.S., is today a highly professional system of maximum quality, particularly directed to the technical field, such as patents.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">It is able to translate with couples of bi-directional modules in any combination of English, German, French, Italian and Spanish, and also Portuguese.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">This system of maximum professional level is able to supply to the operator, a very high quality grade, but the time required for the completion of the translation in perfect mode, that is machine time+man time (including the check and final correction), is always high, particularly for the final correction in post-editing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">This invention is particularly directed to the reduction of this post-editing time that is the human correction time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">In prior art there exist a plurality of machine translation systems.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0110">The drawbacks of the state of the art consist substantially in the fact that the current systems or translation methods do not allow the operator to reach a suitable working performance with high quality level translation without a very long time detriment for the necessary correction work of the skilled man, and in particular, we have observed that as the automatic translation, or semiautomatic translation, namely for fragments or sentences, it is never perfect, and has a lot of errors, and one loses a lot of time to correct the text in post-editing to adapt it to an acceptable quality level.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0111">Further, even if one provides a translation for fragments or sentences or paragraphs in continuous succession (machine-aided translation or interactive translation), one still loses a lot of time for corrections, and also, repeated corrections must be made for the repetition of the same type of translation mistake, as a computer will endlessly repeat the same mistake, unless the programmer who has supplied the operating instructions to the program intervenes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0112">The operator unfortunately cannot intervene in the programming system of which is equipped with the respective translation engine.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0113">But even if the programmer could intervene, the time required for reprogramming or teaching of the new case, the check of the functionality and the advantage that one wants to obtain therefrom become inadmissible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0114">In fact, the mistake generated by the computer in the translation is likely to derive as an incorrect or ambiguous exposition, as it is well known that when the human being writes he does not think about the rules, but writes on impulse without considering the ambiguities and the plurality of meanings for the same word or expression, and such cases of not respecting the rules are innumerable and always increasing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0115">Consequently wanting to foresee and encode everything is impossible for the large number of possible combinations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0116">When a text already edited is checked, the correction time is therefore always high even if there are automatic search replace engines.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0117">In fact, the current automatic search and replace engines require the operator to manually input the correction each time, manually selecting the specific text to be corrected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0118">The quality of the search and replace often generates other errors due to the necessary adapting of what has been changed in the specific context in said position, being many times obliged to adapt the changing portion in accordance to the preceding text portion and to the following text portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0119">Todays, the systems for translation are very fast and require a time lower than reading the text to translate (e.g. ten pages few minutes): The quality of the resulting translation by automatic translation is not acceptable for the skilled man, and it needs a lot of time for correction (e.g. for 10 pages 4-5 hours), and this is because the skilled-translator man, always needs time to read, interpret, and then check if the automatic translation system has made good or bad corrections, and then make corrections to what has been translated automatically.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0120">Therefore a lot of expert translators prefer to renounce automatic translation because they use more time to correct than to do a direct translation without the use of the automatic or semiautomatic translation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0121">The problem of the reduction of the translation time at a parity with the best resulting quality from the human translation is always in need, particularly for the current globalization of the markets and unification of the people who speak different languages.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0122">Consider for example the global communications, laws, patents, etc, where the quality of the translation should be at a maximum level.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0123">It is an object of the present invention to avoid the above-mentioned drawbacks and allow the obtainment of a perfect translation or in any way a high quality translation, namely at human level, or better, with the use of the automatic translation system or semiautomatic translation and comparatively in less time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0124">Therefore the main purpose of the present invention is to use the automatic or interactive-semiautomatic computer translation but with strong reduction of the translation time and with the maximum obtainable quality with the intervention of the same skilled-operator.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0125">In order to achieve these objectives, the invention includes a computer translation system having viewing means on monitor of a translation-interface having a couple of text-columns, wherein each text-column includes parallel scrolling field means, characterized in that the couple of text-columns are divided horizontally to form at least two pairs of parallel scrolling fields the at least two pairs comprising a main pair of scrolling fields including a main translation field having text to be translated and a correction field, having a translation of the text, for checking and correcting the translated text, and a second pair of scrolling fields, located above the main pair, including first and second accumulating fields for accumulating checked text from the main translation field and the correction field, respectively, the computer translation system having transfer means to progressively transfer a portion of the texts in the main translation and correction fields to the accumulating fields.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0126">In this way checking and correction is more easy and fast, because of continuous alignment of top paragraphs of the main translation and correction pair of fields, making easy check between correspondent words and sentences of two parallel top-paragraphs of the entire text, strongly reducing time. Furthermore transfer of checked top-paragraphs to the bottom of the accumulating fields, in adding to the accumulating fields, allow more easy checking and correction of remaining text in said main fields, this working being repeated until the entire text has been line-by-line checked, corrected and transferred to said accumulating fields (in technical speaking “line by line”,=paragraph by paragraph, because in electronic word processing, a “RETURN” delimits a Complete Paragraph=“LINE”).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0127">Advantageously said translation system is endowed with moving means to move said pair of accumulator fields from immediately above said pair of main translation and correction fields to another place or make them disappear, said transfer means being anyway able to work to transfer paragraphs from main pair to the accumulator pair.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0128">In this way it is possible to check, paragraph by paragraph, the whole translation, transferring the checked text, paragraph by paragraph (“line-by-line” in computer programming) to said accumulating fields, reducing the checking-time to over 50% and obtaining better performance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0129">A progress of translation is advantageously shown using a paragraph-counter means, indicating the number of checked paragraphs and the number of remaining paragraphs to check and evidencing means of modified text in said pair of main translation and correction fields. In this way further reduction in the checking time is allowed because operators see immediately what remains to be checked.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0130">Advantageously the computer translation system is of the type having viewing means on the monitor of the translation-interface comprising a T-shaped structure having an upper bar and a vertical shank, where the upper bar of the T-shaped structure comprises a line of control buttons and the vertical shank is a dividing line forming the couple of text-columns, wherein each column includes scrolling field means having a width proportional to the length of the text therein substantially equal to each other column, characterized in that said couple of text-columns is divisible horizontally forming a T-shaped structure with a lower bar through the shank forming the at least two pairs of parallel scrolling fields.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0131">The solution process provides an automatic/semiautomatic translation method, for processing the translation in the desired language, of the type utilizing a translation system which comprises means of automatic or semiautomatic translation and means to allow the correction of the translation operated by the computer and means to implement the dictionaries in the computer, and word processing means in post-editing for the checking and the final correction with eventual activation of automatic search and replace, characterized by:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0133">integrating the post-editing in a single ensemble with the translation system, and</li> <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0134">identifying and memorize each correction that is carried out in post-editing, and in a single operation,</li> <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0135">activating the search and replace of the mistake in the text in correction, and</li> <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0136">activating the memorization of the correction carried out to said translation system with integration of one or more program semantic codes,</li> <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0137">in order to obtain at the same moment and directly connected to the respective correction, not only the extension of same correction to the text in post-editing, but also the auto learning of the correction itself to said translation system.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0132">In this way one has the advantage of a continuous improvement of the quality of the translation and of a continuous reduction of the errors and consequent reduction of the total time for obtaining the text not only translated but also checked and perfectly finished.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0133">Advantageously the method provides on the inside a translation system that includes:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0140">at least one electronic dictionary with correct translation of sentence fragments, sentences and words, associated, for each translation, with a programming semantic code, that activates during the translation of a text or text portion, a respective adapting program of the translation in progress to the preceding text portion and/or to the following text portion for adapting to a specific context;</li> <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0141">means for making the translation phrase by phrase of the text with sequential analysis of the subsequent words and/or sentence fragments within the extent of treatment of the respective sentence, associated to comparing means of the words or sentence fragments, to identify materially or virtually also with declination or base or root, their presence in said electronic dictionary, to make possible a sequential translation;</li> <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0142">processing means of the translation on the basis of the said dictionary and of the corresponding program semantic codes:</li> <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0143">with eventual adapting of the current translation to the preceding text portion and to the text portion that follows that in processing and,</li> <li id="ul0006-0005" num="0144">with eventual adapting in accordance with the current translation of the part already translated;</li> <li id="ul0006-0006" num="0145">output means to memorize and show the operated translation;</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0134">characterized by providing:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0147">a plurality of said program semantic codes, each associated to a respective translation software with different modality, said modality being known to the operator that operates the translation in order to allow the use of one or the other code or the combination of more codes to define a certain translation software for a specific text portion;</li> <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0148">memory means of the carried out corrections and, on request of the operator;</li> <li id="ul0008-0003" num="0149">activation means of an auto learning program which was previously corrected,</li> <li id="ul0008-0004" num="0150">determining the new teaching to operate, enclosing:</li> <li id="ul0008-0005" num="0151">the text portion that contains said correction, and the corresponding original text portion that had to be translated, and</li> <li id="ul0008-0006" num="0152">inputting one or more program semantic codes at this new teaching to be added in said electronic dictionary, in order that said teaching deriving from previous correction can be reutilized immediately in the following translation.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0135">In this way the system retrieves automatically not only the correction operated by the human operator as traditionally used, but upon approval of the operator, also utilizes this correction remembering it as a new teaching and avoiding the subsequent repetition of the translation mistakes made by the computer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0136">In this way the translation system becomes substantially intelligent as it is endowed with auto learning and the translation in this way will continuously improve, and more corrections and teachings will be done and improve the result, reducing progressively the errors made and allowing a sensible reduction of time for the completion of the translation at a level of human quality;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0137">Advantageously the system further provides on the inside:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0156">activation means, on command, after the correction, of the following steps:</li> <li id="ul0010-0002" num="0157">identify the last change made on the text comparing the original previous text and the modified text;</li> <li id="ul0010-0003" num="0158">propose in a dialog box the previous text and the modified text or the text to modify, if signaled;</li> <li id="ul0010-0004" num="0159">on acceptance, make an automatic search and replace in the entire text already translated.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0138">In this way the correction times reduce furthermore, with important productivity advantages.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0139">We carried out translation tests with post-editing after automatic translation with the new process on a Mac G3 Computer at 400 MHz for the same sample patent-disclosure of 10 pages:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0012-0001" num="0162">with the interactive traditional system: the translation time + the hand-operated post-editing time was of two hours;</li> <li id="ul0012-0002" num="0163">with the new system the time used resulted in half an hour;</li> <li id="ul0012-0003" num="0164">the increase in productivity therefore was about 400%, as it is not only the number of the corrections that reduces, but also and above all the stop and consulting times for each correction.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0140">Advantageously the method provides on the inside the option of the fully automatic or semiautomatic translation. In this way it is possible to operate in accordance to the specific requirements, with the difference that with the automatic translation the signaled errors will be eliminated only in the next text to translate, while with the interactive or semiautomatic translation the errors are eliminated during the translation itself as they appear.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0141">The method includes the visualization on the screen of a first scrolling field to receive the text to translate and a second scrolling field to show the translation, one adjacent and parallel to the other, which proportion automatically in the respective width in a manner inversely proportional to the length of the two texts. In this way one has the immediate advantage to supply a fast and immediate confront line by line, of the original text in respect of translated text substantially at the same height, being further provided in parallel sliding means of both the fields.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0142">With such solution one has the advantage of a faster comparison improving considerably the correction times. In fact the difficulty in the translators that must check the original text with the translation to follow step by step the original text and the translated text is known, and sometimes one loses precious minutes just to find the original word corresponding to the one translated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0143">In order to further speed-up and identify the missing words not translated the system provides automatically the conversion of their writing in bold or italic or different color, facilitating and speeding up furthermore the system for the search and the identification of the parallel correspondence between the two words/expressions in the parallel fields.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0144">More advantageously the method provides automatic uploading and downloading means for the text to be translated and for the translated text respectively, fragmenting it, in at least 5 pairs of memory fields, each field providing substantially the contents of 30000 characters (about. 20 pages). In this way one has the advantage of supplying the possibility to the operator to treat also large texts (e.g. up to 100 pages at a time), with the same quality and without danger to make errors in the reconstruction of the translated text.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0145">More advantageously one provides over the pair of translation main fields, at least a pair of accumulator fields, namely with accumulating function similarly placed in parallel and of same width of the pair of main fields to be used:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0146">In order to further speed-up and individuate the missing words not translated the system provides automatically the conversion of their writing in bold or italic or different color, facilitating and speeding up furthermore the system for the search and the individualization of the parallel correspondence between the two words/expressions in the parallel fields.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0147">More advantageously the method provides automatic unloading and charging means for the text to translate and for the translated text respectively, fragmenting it, in at least 5 couples of memory fields, each field providing substantially the contents of 30000 characters (about. 20 pages). In this way one has the advantage to supply the possibility to the operator to treat also large texts (e.g. up to 100 pages at a time), with the same quality and without danger to make errors in the reconstruction of the translated text.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0148">More advantageously one provides over the couple of the said translation main fields, at least a couple of accumulator fields, namely with accumulating function similarly placed in parallel and of same width of the said couple of main fields to be used:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0013-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0014-0001" num="0174">both for interactive translations with correction during translation,</li> <li id="ul0014-0002" num="0175">and for correction in post-editing after the automatic translation.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0149">In this way the accumulator system loses nothing because of break-off of the course of the translation always allowing to take up at any time without losing anything. Furthermore one always has the advantage of a perfect line-out of the remaining paragraphs still to correct, that progressively pass to the couple of the said accumulator fields.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0150">More advantageously under the said translation main fields, a couple of text fields remaining to translate is provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0151">In this way the program operates interactively transferring progressively a paragraph at a time, from the couple of interesting lower fields, in one or into the other, the text to translate, to said couple of the main fields to make the translation and the following correction, being before the translated and corrected text in said fields, moved to the said couple of said accumulator fields.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0152">In this way one has the additional advantage of a complete visualization both the translated text, and the text in progress of translation, paragraph by paragraph, therefore with best visualization for checking in parallel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0153">In this way one has the additional advantage of a complete visualization both of the translated text, and the text in progress of translation, paragraph by paragraph, therefore with good visualization for checking in parallel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0154">Advantageously in a window the number of the checked and translated paragraphs and the number of the paragraphs remaining to translate are indicated. In this way one has the advantage of always having under control the amount of time needed to complete the work.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0155">More advantageously the method provides for each correction carried out in the translated text, besides the integrated search replace and of autolearning options, the autoactivation of the differentiation of the characters of the corrected word/fragment and corresponding portion of the text to translate putting them in distinguishable characters by the rest of the text, as for example bold, italics or other color.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0156">In this way it is immediately signaled to the operator up to where the corrections have been made, facilitating and reducing therefore the time required to complete the work. In fact skilled persons know the time that one wastes if one forgets where he was and this particularly in the treatment of long texts, as for example the patents.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0157">Advantageously the method provides the addition for each teaching different possibilities of translation of the same text with separate corresponding program semantic codes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0158">In this way, in function of the programmed option the system can choose the one or the other translation according to the context.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0159">More advantageously the method includes the possibility to impute different teaching depending on context, e.g. electric, electronic, chemical, mechanic, aeronautic, . . . , medical, sporting, clothing, legal, spoken or speech, etc., each able to be activated by a code previously assigned to or from the translation itself in relation to the type of translation. In this way for different subjects a translation correspondingly different is supplied (personalization). It is known in fact that for example the patents are classified according to an international coding for different technological sectors (IPC code). Each category of patents has a code, so imputing before the translation said code, if it regards a document that relates to electronics the system will translate in one manner or the other (e.g. chips=patatine for the alimentary (food) domain and chips=chips for the electronics etc.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0160">More advantageously the method and respective system provide in the machine-aided translation the translation by the said charger, paragraph by paragraph, namely one paragraph at a time, allowing in turn the correction with autolearning (self-learning).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0161">In this way one has the great advantage of considerably better performing the quality of the translation and to speed-up furthermore the correction and translation time as, thanks to the first error corrections at the beginning of the translated text, the system learns automatically, and at once, memorizes this kind of text and utilizes these teachings immediately in the prosecution of the translation in the same text.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0162">Without autolearning the quality of the automatic translation always remains the same, so if an automatically translated patent has 60 corrections to be made in the first page and its length is of 10 pages, the total corrections to be made are approximately 60 errors/page×10 pages=600 mistakes to correct, while with the autolearning already in the first page the errors are reduced by half as the translation is carried out paragraph by paragraph, and in the following pages the errors continuously reduce the half of the half as the previous half has already been eliminated and cannot repeat, and so forth so far as to reach a minimum that generally is not lower than 10%, so with the invention one has a total of errors to correct equal to (30 first page+15 second page+8 third page+6×7 remaining pages=95 corrections.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0163">Therefore a saving of 600−95=505 errors on 600, equal to theoretically over 80% less of corrections, to say one increases the productivity of 500% namely five times.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0164">As a matter of fact one must consider a greater time lost for the teaching that one can estimate not lower than 20% of the correction-time, maximum 30%, so one returns to what was experimented, namely to an increasing of productivity, if the time lost for the teaching is of 30%, of (600/95)×0.7=442%. As a matter of fact the advantage will be as much and as high as the number of the corrections to be made and so much higher is the number of the pages to translate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0165">It is obvious instead that such advantage reduces considerably for automatic translations in which the number of corrections is much more limited, or if the translation is very short, e.g. some paragraphs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0166">In such case the advantage that we can obtain is only to increase the performance in productive quality of the automatic translation of the system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0167">To reduce the times and have optimal quality, there is provided means which make possible, after the automatic translation of the entire text and subsequently, the sequential post-editing with correction and checking from a skilled man, by means of correction with autolearning and autoreplacing paragraph by paragraph, canceling progressively the couple of the checked paragraphs and transferring them in said pair of accumulating fields.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0168">In this way one has the advantage of having as the previous one, the immediate parallel visualization of the paragraph to translate and what is translated for the contribution of the corrections but with the additional advantage to be able to also see the whole text that follows both for the field to translate and for the translated. With this solution particularly the check and comprehension times from the operator of what has been translated and corrected are reduced, having a more wide view of the entire text, of what is in translation and of what is following during translation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0169">In connection with the above one provides the comparison of the following automatically translated paragraph with the corresponding paragraph on the screen, in order that if they do not correspond, for eventual operation of automatic search-replacing, one can remake automatically the retranslation with the new teachings, reducing in such case furthermore the number of corrections that one must do.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0170">This solution, if it requires more time for the retranslation, of the paragraph concerned, provides a possibility to the operator to evaluate the correct learning and eventually readapt it with a new teaching that, according to the system, can be changed or customized for the specific case.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0171">More advantageously in the system a third comparison field associated with the first two is provided, in order to introduce the correct text of the translation from another outside operator and this in order to operate interactively by comparison and when non correspondence is detected, activate the respective proposals of autolearning of the teachings deriving from the outside corrections.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0172">In this way one has the advantage to be able to use teachings also coming from the exterior of the system, for example by control carried out not in the same batch, but for example for the post-editing on other machines for example connected via internet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0173">In conclusion with this method, not only the quality of the translation is sped-up and improved, but one provides the possibility to the operator to personalize and implement progressively during the translation itself or even later, not only the missing words or the usual and repetitive sentences as in the known systems of the prior art, but also sentence fragments, which thanks to the respective programming semantic code supplied by the operator himself, but also suggested by the program during the context analysis of the translation, of the prefixes, of the endings, etc:, can insert and automodify itself in adequate manner in the following translations and in the same following of the translation in progress.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0174">Thanks to the well known repetition of countenances in the documents in translation, the system adapts automatically and rapidly to the new translation sector giving, after the first steps of translated text, a progressively best resulting translation level and absolutely incomparable quality level with reference to any currently known translation system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0175">The tests carried out have supplied amazing results that even after a small amount of translation the errors made for sentence drop to a minimum, reaching almost immediately the errors average value for sentence between 1 and 2, to then reach the errors value for sentence&gt;1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0176">Preferred variations advantageously in the system included:

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0187">As disclosed in the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. from 1 to 18</figref>, and particularly from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the system includes substantially at least two columns, comprising at least two scrolling parallel main fields, one adjacent to the other (F<b>1</b>, B/U) one for the text to translate and one for the translated text to correct.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0188">Under the line of the controls there are to the right and to the left of the charging fields (C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>, C<b>3</b>, C<b>4</b>, C<b>5</b>) to charge with the import control button the text to translate up to 100 pages (20 pages per field) in order to translate automatically or semi automatically as from the option (A) of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0189">The text in progress of translation passes from chargers (C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>, C<b>3</b>, C<b>4</b>, C<b>5</b>), to the pair of the translation main fields. (F<b>1</b>, B/U). Once the translation and correction has been completed, the couple of the texts passes to the pair of accumulator fields (A<b>1</b>), that can shift: from small under the control-bar (adjacent to said chargers), to proportioned over the same pair of translation main fields (A<b>1</b>, F<b>1</b>, Ref. U <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0190">One can also charge a text directly in a main field of the main pair of the translation fields (F<b>1</b>, B/U) and obtain the translation into the opposite main field of the said main pair (F<b>1</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0191">Analogously any combination of charger fields can happen (C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>, C<b>3</b>, C<b>4</b>, C<b>5</b>) toward the main fields (F<b>1</b>, B/U) and then pass to opposite side of the main fields pair in logical sequence and flow finally in the opposite charging fields.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0192">As for example if one has to translate from Italian one will activate the direction from right button towards the left button as in the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. from 1 to 18</figref>, see indication evidenced by the top right arrow button in the control line (From English to Italian is the contrary).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0193">Once the work is completed one can use the Export control button (“Exp”=Export).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0194">The system is divided by modules, each including a couple of languages, therefore in the representation is shown a single one of the operative modules that concerns in a reversible way the translation from English to Italian or vice versa.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0195">Also the dictionary (S <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) is double, one for the Italian towards English and one for English towards Italian (the disclosed is for the translation from English towards Italian).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0196">Both have a series of fields:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0019-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0020-0001" num="0236">for searching the single words during translation (1),</li> <li id="ul0020-0002" num="0237">for the text portion that follows the word under consideration (up with five words for a total of six), (2);</li> <li id="ul0020-0003" num="0238">for the base standard translation (3);</li> <li id="ul0020-0004" num="0239">for the program semantic code/s (4) and</li> <li id="ul0020-0005" num="0240">for alternative translations personalized with operative sectorial codes, (for example electronics, physical, chemistry, etc.) (5).</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0197">We can give also two codes and two different translations to each teaching as for example able to be read in field (S column <b>3</b>) Eg. “cart”=“trasportare, carro” with the attributed codes “verbinfcon” and “soms”, to say that the first word is an infinitive verb that one must conjugate in conformity with the context of the sentence and in particular with what precedes it, while alternatively one must translate as singular male noun and adapt obviously possible articles, pronouns etc front in the part already translated in conformity, move behind possible adjectives arranging them, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0198">These codes are supplied by the operator during the autolearning, and they are determinant and indispensable for having an excellent quality of the result.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0199">As for example “ag4” means adjective with 4 declensions, “ag2” adjective with two declensions, “ag1” invariable adjective.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0200">Similarly the code-prefix “verb” indicates that we have a verb, the prosecution with “con” means that the verb has to be conjugate, the prosecution with “inf” means that the current verb is an infinitive verb, the intermediate fragment “ing” means that the current verb is a gerund, the intermediate fragment “pass” means that the current verb is a past verb, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0201">E.g. if the code that writes the operator, in the autolearning during post-editing, is “verbls/p2432”, it means that the system must adopt the adapting program of the verbs in which Ref.” “1 s/p” gives an order to the program to adapt the first word to context of the sentence in the sense of the singular/plural conjugation, the following number “24” gives the order to the program about the second word informing it that is a past participle and obliges the program to accord it in conformity to four solutions (E.g. a, e, i, o, for Italian language), while the third word “32” gives the order to accord only in two solutions: plural and singular.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0202">These codes are a lot and the operator can arrange them in a different way, as an object programming language, but in which the sequence modules of the program are already inserted and therefore the operator knows the result that he is going to obtain, not needing to be a programmer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0203">Naturally above there is a control-bar that allows the operator to operate changes at will, on all the fields that are obviously in a parallel scrolling form for exact alignment correspondence.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0204">Coming back to the main translation interface (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), it has been claimed that the fields of each couple (F<b>1</b>, B/U) self-adjust in the width inversely proportional to length of the texts of the couple, in order to always supply the same number of lines (scrolling height pitch) to facilitate comparison and reduce the correction check times in post-editing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0205">The pair of accumulators (A<b>1</b>, Ref. U <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>) have instead the intermediate function to accumulate the sentences in turn that are translated and corrected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0206">The control bar of the main interface, also has a lot of figurative control buttons, as for example parallel field pairs scrolling controls, their alignment, the interface changing in size, the search and replace control “RS”, capital to small letter change, the transfer control between fields and a Data File, the copy pastage controls, the word counting, the lock/unlocking, the spelling, the “cut-returns” for the arrangement of texts from a “DOS” system having one return per line, that causes illogical analysis of the sentence, and the different controls of how to carry out the translation, as: “START” for starting or to take up a translation from the position where one was at before;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0207">“LineByLine” to proceed paragraph by paragraph;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0208">“TQ” for the interactive translation system in Total Quality, where each fragment between punctuation is submitted before registering it in the opposite field during control and check of the translation for the correction and autolearning;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0209">“MemLine” (Checking Action Mode) that allows after an automatic translation the transfer into the pair of accumulator fields (A<b>1</b>), line-by-line (namely paragraph by paragraph) the checked and corrected paragraphs from main fields pair (F<b>1</b>) to the accumulator field pair (A<b>1</b>);</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0234">Coding examples of behavior or semantics of the teachings</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0235">Basic possible codes are innumerable as already explained, for example in the field of nouns “soms”, “somp”, .“sofs”, “sofp” is provided, that are the masculine and feminine combined with the singular and plural, and additionally able to be combined with e.g, “somsn” word group as a substantive (noun) that does not shift (because it is not associable with adjectives), “sofpnn” as previously but already containing the article, “somsNP” as proper noun, etc. or “ax2”, “ax4” for words and sentences in which one requires an adapting of the endings to that which will be subsequently translated (e.g. in accordance to a next substantive), or “ag1”, “ag2”, “ag4” to be accorded and moved to the substantive, or “nexinf” to oblige the following choice in translation to infinitive or “nexverb” to oblige the choice of the next translation to qualify as a verb, or “nexfut” to condition the next to past tense, etc. as an encoded language that in turn transmits the activations of the program similarly to the human intelligence and to the human structure as noticeable for example in a Dna, but electronic, where its manipulation is directly allowed by the operator who manages the translation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0236">In this way it has been shown to reach very high levels of translation because the more the computer works the more it improves becoming ever more intelligent, but on the condition that the operators who uses it, correct it and teach it how it must behave from that moment on, exactly as one does with a child.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0239">The method is applied to a computer comprising an automatic translation system having on a monitor, a “T”-shape translation interface wherein the upper bar of the “T” is a line of control-buttons and the vertical bar of the “T” is a dividing line forming two columns inversely proportioned in width to the length of the respective contained text (column having longer text is wider than parallel column that contains a shorter text), where the two columns are divisible horizontally in pairs of parallel-scrolling fields, involving at least a pair of main translation fields (F<b>1</b>, B-U) and above it a pair of accumulator fields (accumulating fields) of what has been translated and checked (A<b>1</b>, U).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0242">In this way the Operator does not lose time in waiting for retranslation, because he uses the waiting time to read the top-paragraph to check.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0243">When retranslation has been made (instantly) first translated paragraph is exchanged with the new first paragraph coming from said better performed retranslation (because said autolearning), and finally allowing instantly to amend the retranslated top-paragraphs, in the usual autolearning way, before continuing in transfer from said pair of main fields (F<b>1</b>-Z) to said accumulating pair of fields (A<b>1</b>-Z).

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0244">Before checking paragraph by paragraph, said retranslation is made only if the interested paragraph to check contains text portions already subjected to previous amendments and autolearning, made between the full automatic first translation and the moment to check.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0245">In this way retranslation is avoided if the interested top paragraph does not contain text portions involved in previous autolearning subject matter. So retranslation is automatically operated only if necessary.</div>
