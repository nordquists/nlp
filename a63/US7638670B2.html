<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This application is a divisional of U.S. Ser. No. 11/371,983, filed Mar. 9, 2006, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,425,661, which claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. provisional application U.S. Ser. No. 60/660,018, filed Mar. 9, 2005, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</div>
<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">This invention relates to the selective oligomerization (specifically trimerization and/or tetramerization) of olefins (specifically ethylene) using catalysts.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The oligomerization of ethylene typically returns a broad distribution of 1-olefins having an even number of carbon atoms (C<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>8</sub>, C<sub>10</sub>, etc.). These products range in commercial value, of which 1-hexene may be the most useful, as it is a comonomer commonly used in the production of commercial ethylene based copolymers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Several catalysts useful for the oligomerization of olefin monomers have been developed, including the trimerization of ethylene. Several of these catalysts use chromium as a metal center. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,668,838, assigned to Union Carbide Chemicals and Plastics Technology Corporation, discloses a chromium catalyst complex formed by contacting a chromium compound with hydrolyzed hydrocarbyl aluminum and a donor ligand such as hydrocarbyl isonitriles, amines, and ethers.

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">The inventions disclosed herein include chromium metal complexes and compositions, which are useful as catalysts for the selective oligomerization of olefins, specifically C<sub>2 </sub>to C<sub>12 </sub>olefins and especially C<sub>2 </sub>to C<sub>8 </sub>olefins, including the trimerization and/or tetramerization of ethylene.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">For the purposes of this invention and the claims thereto when an oligomeric material (such as a dimer, trimer, or tetramer) is referred to as comprising an olefin, the olefin present in the material is the reacted form of the olefin. Likewise, the active species in a catalytic cycle may comprise the neutral or ionic forms of the catalyst. In addition, a reactor is any container(s) in which a chemical reaction occurs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">As used herein, the new numbering scheme for the Periodic Table Groups is used as set out in C<smallcaps>HEMICAL AND </smallcaps>E<smallcaps>NGINEERING </smallcaps>N<smallcaps>EWS, </smallcaps>63(5), 27 (1985).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">As used herein, the phrase “characterized by the formula” is not intended to be limiting and is used in the same way that “comprising” is commonly used. The term “independently selected” is used herein to indicate that the groups in question—e.g., R<sup>1</sup>, R<sup>2</sup>, R<sup>3</sup>, R<sup>4</sup>, and R<sup>5</sup>—can be identical or different (e.g., R<sup>1</sup>, R<sup>2</sup>, R<sup>3</sup>, R<sup>4</sup>, and R<sup>5 </sup>may all be substituted alkyls, or R<sup>1 </sup>and R<sup>2 </sup>may be a substituted alkyl and R<sup>3 </sup>may be an aryl, etc.). Use of the singular includes use of the plural and vice versa (e.g., a hexane solvent, includes hexanes). A named R group will generally have the structure that is recognized in the art as corresponding to R groups having that name. The terms “compound” and “complex” are generally used interchangeably in this specification, but those of skill in the art may recognize certain compounds as complexes and vice versa. In addition, the term “catalyst” will be understood by those of skill in the art to include either activated or unactivated forms of the molecules the comprise the catalyst, for example, a procatalyst and including complexes and activators or compositions of ligands, metal precursors and activators and optionally including scavengers and the like. For purposes of this invention, a catalyst system is defined to be the combination of an activator and a metal ligand complex or the combination of an activator, a ligand and a metal precursor. A metal ligand complex is defined to be the product of the combination of a metal precursor and a ligand. For the purposes of illustration, representative certain groups are defined herein. These definitions are intended to supplement and illustrate, not preclude, the definitions known to those of skill in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">“Optional” or “optionally” means that the subsequently described event or circumstance may or may not occur, and that the description includes instances where the event or circumstance occurs and instances where it does not. For example, the phrase “optionally substituted hydrocarbyl” means that a hydrocarbyl moiety may or may not be substituted and that the description includes both unsubstituted hydrocarbyl and hydrocarbyl where there is substitution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">The term “substituted” as in “substituted hydrocarbyl,” “substituted aryl,” “substituted alkyl,” and the like, means that in the group in question (i.e., the hydrocarbyl, alkyl, aryl or other moiety that follows the term), at least one hydrogen atom bound to a carbon atom is replaced with one or more substituent groups such as hydroxy, alkoxy, alkylthio, phosphino, amino, halo, silyl, and the like. When the term “substituted” introduces a list of possible substituted groups, it is intended that the term apply to every member of that group. That is, the phrase “substituted alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl” is to be interpreted as “substituted alkyl, substituted alkenyl and substituted alkynyl.” Similarly, “optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl” is to be interpreted as “optionally substituted alkyl, optionally substituted alkenyl and optionally substituted alkynyl.”</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">The term “saturated” refers to the lack of double and triple bonds between atoms of a radical group such as ethyl, cyclohexyl, pyrrolidinyl, and the like. The term “unsaturated” refers to the presence of one or more double and triple bonds between atoms of a radical group such as vinyl, allyl, acetylide, oxazolinyl, cyclohexenyl, acetyl and the like, and specifically includes alkenyl and alkynyl groups, as well as groups in which double bonds are delocalized, as in aryl and heteroaryl groups as defined below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">The terms “cyclo” and “cyclic” are used herein to refer to saturated or unsaturated radicals containing a single ring or multiple condensed rings. Suitable cyclic moieties include, for example, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cyclooctenyl, bicyclooctyl, phenyl, napthyl, pyrrolyl, furyl, thiophenyl, imidazolyl, and the like. In particular embodiments, cyclic moieties include between 3 and 200 atoms other than hydrogen, between 3 and 50 atoms other than hydrogen or between 3 and 20 atoms other than hydrogen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">The term “hydrocarbyl” as used herein refers to hydrocarbyl radicals containing 1 to about 50 carbon atoms, specifically 1 to about 24 carbon atoms, most specifically 1 to about 16 carbon atoms, including branched or unbranched, cyclic or acyclic, saturated or unsaturated species, such as alkyl groups, alkenyl groups, aryl groups, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">The term “alkyl” as used herein refers to a branched or unbranched saturated hydrocarbon group typically although not necessarily containing 1 to about 50 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, t-butyl, octyl, decyl, and the like, as well as cycloalkyl groups such as cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and the like. Generally, although again not necessarily, alkyl groups herein may contain 1 to about 20 carbon atoms.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">The term “alkenyl” as used herein refers to a branched or unbranched, cyclic or acyclic hydrocarbon group typically, although not necessarily, containing 2 to about 50 carbon atoms and at least one double bond, such as ethenyl, n-propenyl, isopropenyl, n-butenyl, isobutenyl, octenyl, decenyl, and the like. Generally, although again not necessarily, alkenyl groups herein contain 2 to about 20 carbon atoms.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">The term “alkynyl” as used herein refers to a branched or unbranched, cyclic or acyclic hydrocarbon group typically although not necessarily containing 2 to about 50 carbon atoms and at least one triple bond, such as ethynyl, n-propynyl, isopropynyl, n-butynyl, isobutynyl, octynyl, decynyl, and the like. Generally, although again not necessarily, alkynyl groups herein may have 2 to about 20 carbon atoms.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">The term “aromatic” is used in its usual sense, including unsaturation that is essentially delocalized across several bonds around a ring. The term “aryl” as used herein refers to a group containing an aromatic ring. Aryl groups herein include groups containing a single aromatic ring or multiple aromatic rings that are fused together, linked covalently, or linked to a common group such as a methylene or ethylene moiety. More specific aryl groups contain one aromatic ring or two or three fused or linked aromatic rings, e.g., phenyl, naphthyl, biphenyl, anthracenyl, or phenanthrenyl. In particular embodiments, aryl substituents include 1 to about 200 atoms other than hydrogen, typically 1 to about 50 atoms other than hydrogen, and specifically 1 to about 20 atoms other than hydrogen. In some embodiments herein, multi-ring moieties are substituents and in such embodiments the multi-ring moiety can be attached at an appropriate atom. For example, “naphthyl” can be 1-naphthyl or 2-naphthyl; “anthracenyl” can be 1-anthracenyl, 2-anthracenyl or 9-anthracenyl; and “phenanthrenyl” can be 1-phenanthrenyl, 2-phenanthrenyl, 3-phenanthrenyl, 4-phenanthrenyl, or 9-phenanthrenyl.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">The term “alkoxy” as used herein intends an alkyl group bound through a single, terminal ether linkage; that is, an “alkoxy” group may be represented as —O-alkyl where alkyl is as defined above. The term “aryloxy” is used in a similar fashion, and may be represented as —O-aryl, with aryl as defined below. The term “hydroxy” refers to —OH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">Similarly, the term “alkylthio” as used herein intends an alkyl group bound through a single, terminal thioether linkage; that is, an “alkylthio” group may be represented as —S-alkyl where alkyl is as defined above. The term “arylthio” is used similarly, and may be represented as —S-aryl, with aryl as defined below. The term “mercapto” refers to —SH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">The terms “halo” and “halogen” are used in the conventional sense to refer to a chloro, bromo, fluoro or iodo radical.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">The terms “heterocycle” and “heterocyclic” refer to a cyclic radical, including ring-fused systems, including heteroaryl groups as defined below, in which one or more carbon atoms in a ring is replaced with a heteroatom—that is, an atom other than carbon, such as nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, phosphorus, boron or silicon. Heterocycles and heterocyclic groups include saturated and unsaturated moieties, including heteroaryl groups as defined below. Specific examples of heterocycles include pyridine, pyrrolidine, pyrroline, furan, tetrahydrofuran, thiophene, imidazole, oxazole, thiazole, indole, and the like, including any isomers of these. Additional heterocycles are described, for example, in Alan R. Katritzky, <i>Handbook of Heterocyclic Chemistry</i>, Pergammon Press, 1985, and in <i>Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry</i>, A. R. Katritzky et al., eds., Elsevier, 2d. ed., 1996. The term “metallocycle” refers to a heterocycle in which one or more of the heteroatoms in the ring or rings is a metal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">The term “heteroaryl” refers to an aryl radical that includes one or more heteroatoms in the aromatic ring. Specific heteroaryl groups include groups containing heteroaromatic rings such as thiophene, pyridine, pyrazine, isoxazole, pyrazole, pyrrole, furan, thiazole, oxazole, imidazole, isothiazole, oxadiazole, triazole, and benzo-fused analogues of these rings, such as indole, carbazole, benzofuran, benzothiophene and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">More generally, the modifiers “hetero” and “heteroatom-containing”, as in “heteroalkyl” or “heteroatom-containing hydrocarbyl group” refer to a molecule or molecular fragment in which one or more carbon atoms is replaced with a heteroatom. Thus, for example, the term “heteroalkyl” refers to an alkyl substituent that is heteroatom-containing. When the term “heteroatom-containing” introduces a list of possible heteroatom-containing groups, it is intended that the term apply to every member of that group. That is, the phrase “heteroatom-containing alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl” is to be interpreted as “heteroatom-containing alkyl, heteroatom-containing alkenyl and heteroatom-containing alkynyl.”</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">By “divalent” as in “divalent hydrocarbyl”, “divalent alkyl”, “divalent aryl” and the like, is meant that the hydrocarbyl, alkyl, aryl or other moiety is bonded at two points to atoms, molecules or moieties with the two bonding points being covalent bonds.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0086">The reaction to produce a pyridyl-amine ligand can be performed in four general reaction steps. In step 1, a bromopyridine can be reacted with n-butyl lithium (n-BuLi) and DMF in a formylation reaction, replacing a bromide atom on the bromopyridine with an aldehyde group. The remaining bromide atom on the initial bromopyridine molecule can then be replaced with R<sub>7 </sub>through a coupling reaction. The third reaction step is an imine-forming condensation reaction. The imine condensation reaction is followed by reaction step 4, the nucleophilic addition of R<sub>2 </sub>to the structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0087">Generally, R<sub>2</sub>M is a nucleophile such as an alkylating, arylating or hydrogenating reagent and M is a metal such as a main group metal, or a metalloid such as boron. The alkylating, arylating or hydrogenating reagent may be a Grignard, alkyl or aryl-lithium or borohydride reagent. In step 4, a complexing agent such as magnesium bromide can be used to direct the nucleophile selectively to the imine carbon, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,750,345 and 6,713,577. R<sub>3 </sub>can be installed (into the bridging group T, and as defined above in relation to Formula (I) above) through nucleophilic addition to the appropriate ketimine, which can be obtained through a variety of known synthetic procedures, including those detailed in Method C below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0088">Alternative strategies to the reaction scheme illustrated in Scheme 1 can also be employed. For example, in Scheme 2, ligands where R<sub>20 </sub>is not hydrogen may be synthesized through a condensation of the aldehyde with a secondary amine (R<sub>1</sub>R<sub>20</sub>NH), using benzotriazole to create a stabilized iminium salt. Nucleophilic addition of R<sub>2 </sub>to the imine follows, releasing the benzotriazole adduct. An example of each type of pyridyl-amine ligand synthesis (R<sub>20</sub>=H, R<sub>20</sub>=alkyl) is given in Examples 1 and 2, respectively, below.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0090">Once the desired ligand is formed, it can be combined with a Cr atom, ion, compound or other Cr precursor compound, and in some embodiments the present invention encompasses compositions that include any of the above-mentioned ligands in combination with an appropriate Cr precursor and an optional activator. For example, in some embodiments, the Cr precursor can be an activated Cr precursor, which refers to a Cr precursor (described below) that has been combined or reacted with an activator (described below) prior to combination or reaction with the ancillary ligand. As noted above, in one aspect the invention provides compositions that include such combinations of ligand and Cr atom, ion, compound or precursor. In some applications, the ligands are combined with a Cr compound or precursor and the product of such combination is not determined, if a product forms. For example, the ligand may be added to a reaction vessel at the same time as the Cr precursor compound along with the reactants, activators, scavengers, etc. Additionally, the ligand can be modified prior to addition to or after the addition of the Cr precursor, e.g., through a deprotonation reaction or some other modification.</div>

Each L is a ligand independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, optionally substituted alkyl, heteroalkyl, allyl, diene, alkenyl, heteroalkenyl, alkynyl, heteroalkynyl, aryl, heteroaryl, alkoxy, aryloxy, boryl, silyl, amino, phosphino, ether, thioether, phosphine, amine, carboxylate, alkylthio, arylthio, 1,3-dionate, oxalate, carbonate, nitrate, sulfate, and combinations thereof. Optionally, two or more L groups are joined into a ring structure. One or more of the ligands L may be ionically bonded to Cr and, for example, L may be a non-coordinated or loosely coordinated or weakly coordinated anion (e.g., L may be selected from the group consisting of those anions described below in the conjunction with the activators). See Marks et al., <i>Chem. Rev. </i>100, pp 1391-1434 (2000) for a detailed discussion of these weak interactions. The chromium precursors may be monomeric, dimeric or higher orders thereof.</div>

wherein R<sup>1</sup>, R<sup>20</sup>, L, J and T are described above; x is 1 or 2; and m′ is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. J′ is defined the same as J is defined above, provided that J′ includes 2 atoms bonded to the Cr, one of the which is in the ring position adjacent to the atom bonded to T, which is bonded to Cr through a dative bond, and the other of which is bonded to the Cr through a covalent bond. The more specific embodiments of the ligands (e.g., formulas I and II) may replace the coordinated ligands drawn in formulae VI. Numerous other coordination modes are possible, for example the ligands may bind to two chromium metal centers in a bridging fashion (see for example Cotton and Walton, <i>Multiple Bonds Between Metal Atoms </i>1993, Oxford University Press). Some studies (for example, Rensburg et al., <i>Organometallics </i>23, pp 1207-1222 (2004)) suggest that the ligand environment around Cr may be different at different points in the catalytic cycle. Hemilabile ligands, which can change their binding mode to the metal, may be useful in this regard.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0097">In some embodiments, the ligand will be mixed with a suitable metal precursor prior to or simultaneous with allowing the mixture to be contacted to the reactants. When the ligand is mixed with the metal precursor, a metal-ligand complex may be formed. In connection with the metal-ligand complex and depending on the ligand or ligands chosen, the metal-ligand complex may take the form of dimers, trimers or higher orders thereof or there may be two or more metal atoms that are bridged by one or more ligands. Furthermore, two or more ligands may coordinate with a single metal atom. The exact nature of the metal-ligand complex(es) formed depends on the chemistry of the ligand and the method of combining the metal precursor and ligand, such that a distribution of metal-ligand complexes may form with the number of ligands bound to the metal being greater than, equal to or less than the number of equivalents of ligands added relative to an equivalent of metal precursor.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0109">In addition, the catalyst systems of this invention may be combined with other catalysts in a single reactor and/or employed in a series of reactors (parallel or serial).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0110">The ligands-metal-precursors combinations and the metal ligand complexes, described above, are optionally activated in various ways to yield compositions active for selective ethylene oligomerization. For the purposes of this patent specification and appended claims, the terms “cocatalyst” and “activator” are used herein interchangeably and are defined to be any compound which can activate any one of the ligands-metal-precursor-combinations and the metal ligand complexes, described above by converting the combination, complex, or composition into a catalytically active species. Non-limiting activators, for example, include alumoxanes, aluminum alkyls, other metal or main group alkyl or aryl compounds, ionizing activators, which may be neutral or ionic, Lewis acids, reducing agents, oxidizing agents, and combinations thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0111">In one embodiment, alumoxane activators are utilized as an activator in the compositions useful in the invention. Alumoxanes are generally oligomeric compounds containing —Al(R*)-O— sub-units, where R* is an alkyl group. Examples of alumoxanes include methylalumoxane (MAO), ethylalumoxane, isobutylalumoxane, and modified methylalumoxanes (MMAO), which include alkyl groups other than methyl such as ethyl, isobutyl, and n-octyl, such as MMAO-3A, PMAO-IP (referring to polymethylalumoxane, improved process, manufactured by Akzo-Nobel and meaning an MAO prepared from a non-hydrolytic process). Alkylalumoxanes and modified alkylalumoxanes are suitable as catalyst activators, particularly when the abstractable ligand of the catalyst is a halide, alkoxide or amide. Mixtures of different alumoxanes and modified alumoxanes may also be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0112">The activator compounds comprising Lewis-acid activators and in particular alumoxanes are specifically characterized by the following general formulae:
<br/>
(R<sup>a</sup>—Al—O)<sub>p </sub>
<br/>
R<sup>b</sup>(R<sup>c</sup>—Al—O)<sub>p</sub>—AlR<sup>e</sup> <sub>2 </sub>
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0113">where R<sup>a</sup>, R<sup>b</sup>, R<sup>c </sup>and R<sup>d </sup>are, independently a C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>30 </sub>alkyl radical, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, and “p” is an integer from 1 to about 50. Most specifically, R<sup>a</sup>, R<sup>b</sup>, R<sup>c </sup>and R<sup>d </sup>are each methyl and “p” is a least 4. When an alkyl aluminum halide or alkoxide is employed in the preparation of the alumoxane, one or more R<sup>a</sup>, R<sup>b</sup>, R<sup>c </sup>or R<sup>e </sup>are groups may be halide or alkoxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0114">It is recognized that alumoxane is not a discrete material. An alumoxane is generally a mixture of both the linear and cyclic compounds. A typical alumoxane will contain free trisubstituted or trialkyl aluminum, bound trisubstituted or trialkyl aluminum, and alumoxane molecules of varying degree of oligomerization. Those methylalumoxanes most preferred contain lower levels of trimethylaluminum. Lower levels of trimethylaluminum can be achieved by reaction of the trimethylaluminum with a Lewis base or by vacuum distillation of the trimethylaluminum or by any other means known in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0115">For further descriptions, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,665,208, 4,952,540, 5,041,584, 5,091,352, 5,206,199, 5,204,419, 4,874,734, 4,924,018, 4,908,463, 4,968,827, 5,329,032, 5,248,801, 5,235,081, 5,157,137, and 5,103,031 and European publications EP0561476A1, EP0279586B1, EP0516476A1, and EP0594218A1 and PCT publication WO94/10180.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0116">When the activator is an alumoxane (modified or unmodified), some embodiments select the maximum amount of activator at a 5000-fold molar excess Al/Cr over the catalyst precursor. The minimum preferred activator-to-catalyst-precursor is a 1:1 molar ratio. More specifically, the Al/Cr ratio is from 1000:1 to 100:1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0117">Alumoxanes may be produced by the hydrolysis of the respective trialkylaluminum compound. MMAO may be produced by the hydrolysis of trimethylaluminum and a higher trialkylaluminum such as triisobutylaluminum. MMAO's are generally more soluble in aliphatic solvents and more stable during storage. There are a variety of methods for preparing alumoxane and modified alumoxanes, non-limiting examples of which are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,665,208, 4,952,540, 5,091,352, 5,206,199, 5,204,419, 4,874,734, 4,924,018, 4,908,463, 4,968,827, 5,308,815, 5,329,032, 5,248,801, 5,235,081, 5,157,137, 5,103,031, 5,391,793, 5,391,529, 5,693,838, 5,731,253, 5,731,451, 5,744,656, 5,847,177, 5,854,166, 5,856,256 and 5,939,346 and European publications EP0561476A1, EP0279586B1, EP0594218A1 and EP0586665B1, and PCT publications WO94/10180 and WO99/15534, all of which are herein fully incorporated by reference. It may be preferable to use a visually clear methylalumoxane. A cloudy or gelled alumoxane can be filtered to produce a clear solution or clear alumoxane can be decanted from the cloudy solution. Another alumoxane is a modified methyl alumoxane (MMAO) cocatalyst type 3A (commercially available from Akzo Chemicals, Inc. under the trade name Modified Methylalumoxane type 3A, covered under U.S. Pat. No. 5,041,584).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0118">Aluminum alkyl or organoaluminum compounds which may be utilized as activators (or scavengers) include trimethylaluminum, triethylaluminum, triisobutylaluminum, tri-n-hexylaluminum, tri-n-octylaluminum, diisobutylaluminum hydride, ethylaluminum dichloride, diethylaluminum chloride, diethylaluminum ethoxide and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0007">Ionizing Activators</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0119">In some embodiments, the activator includes compounds that may abstract a ligand making the metal complex cationic and providing a charge-balancing non-coordinating or weakly coordinating anion. The term “non-coordinating anion” (NCA) means an anion which either does not coordinate to said cation or which is only weakly coordinated to said cation thereby remaining sufficiently labile to be displaced by a neutral Lewis base.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0120">It is within the scope of this invention to use an ionizing or stoichiometric activator, neutral or ionic, such as tri(n-butyl)ammonium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)boron, a tris(perfluorophenyl)boron metalloid precursor or a tris(perfluoronaphthyl)boron metalloid precursor, polyhalogenated heteroborane anions (WO98/43983), boric acid (U.S. Pat. No. 5,942,459) or combination thereof. It is also within the scope of this invention to use neutral or ionic activators alone or in combination with alumoxane or modified alumoxane activators.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0121">Examples of neutral stoichiometric activators include tri-substituted boron, tellurium, aluminum, gallium and indium or mixtures thereof. The three substituent groups are each independently selected from alkyls, alkenyls, halogen, substituted alkyls, aryls, arylhalides, alkoxy and halides. In some embodiments, the three groups are independently selected from halogen, mono or multicyclic (including halosubstituted) aryls, alkyls, and alkenyl compounds and mixtures thereof, preferred are alkenyl groups having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, alkyl groups having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, alkoxy groups having 1 to 20 carbon atoms and aryl groups having 3 to 20 carbon atoms (including substituted aryls). In other embodiments, the three groups are alkyls having 1 to 4 carbon groups, phenyl, naphthyl or mixtures thereof. In further embodiments, the three groups are halogenated, specifically fluorinated, aryl groups. In even further embodiments, the neutral stoichiometric activator is tris(perfluorophenyl)boron or tris(perfluoronaphthyl)boron.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0122">Ionic stoichiometric activator compounds may contain an active proton, or some other cation associated with, but not coordinated to, or only loosely coordinated to, the remaining ion of the ionizing compound. Such compounds and the like are described in European publications EP0570982A1, EP0520732A1, EP0495375A1, EP0500944B1, EP0277003A1 and EP0277004A1, and U.S. Pat.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0123">Ionic catalysts can be prepared by reacting a Cr compound with some neutral Lewis acids, such as B(C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>6</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, which upon reaction with the abstractable ligand (X) of the Cr compound forms an anion, such as ([B(C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>(X)]<sup>−</sup>), which stabilizes the cationic Cr species generated by the reaction. The catalysts can be prepared with activator components which are ionic compounds or compositions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0124">In some embodiments, compounds useful as an activator component in the preparation of the ionic catalyst systems used in the process of this invention comprise a cation, which is optionally a Brönsted acid capable of donating a proton, and a compatible non-coordinating anion which is capable of stabilizing the active catalyst species which is formed when the two compounds are combined and said anion will be sufficiently labile to be displaced by olefinic substrates or other neutral Lewis bases such as ethers, nitriles and the like. Two classes of compatible non-coordinating anions useful herein have been disclosed in EP0277003A1 and EP0277004A1 published 1988: anionic coordination complexes comprising a plurality of lipophilic radicals covalently coordinated to and shielding a central charge-bearing metal or metalloid core; and, anions comprising a plurality of boron atoms such as carboranes, metallacarboranes and boranes.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0153">In some embodiments, the process of the invention relates to the oligomerization, and more specifically the trimerization and/or tetramerization of ethylene.

The trimerization of α-olefins is described in Köhn et al., <i>Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., </i>39 (23), pp 4337-4339 (2000).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0155">Very generally, oligomerization can be carried out in the Ziegler-Natta or Kaminsky-Sinn methodology, including temperatures from −100° C. to 300° C. and pressures from atmospheric to 3000 atmospheres (303,900 kPa). Suspension, solution, slurry, gas phase, or high-pressure oligomerization processes may be employed with the catalysts and compounds of this invention. Such processes can be run in a batch, semi-batch, or continuous mode. Examples of such processes are well known in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0156">Suitable solvents for oligomerization are non-coordinating, inert liquids. Examples include straight and branched-chain hydrocarbons such as isobutane, butane, pentane, isopentane, hexane, isohexane, heptane, octane, dodecane, and mixtures thereof, cyclic and alicyclic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane, cycloheptane, methylcyclohexane, methylcycloheptane, and mixtures thereof, perhalogenated hydrocarbons such as perfluorinated C<sub>4-10 </sub>alkanes, chlorobenzene, and aromatic and alkylsubstituted aromatic compounds such as benzene, toluene, mesitylene, and xylene. Suitable solvents also include liquid olefins which may act as monomers or comonomers including ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-pentene, 3-methyl-1-pentene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 1-octene, and 1-decene.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0157">Other additives that are useful in an oligomerization reaction may be employed, such as scavengers, promoters, modifiers, reducing agents, oxidizing agents, dihydrogen, aluminum alkyls, or silanes. For example, Jolly et al.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0158">In some useful embodiments, the activator (such as methylalumoxane or modified methylalumoxane-3A) is combined with the metal-ligand-complex or the ligand-metal-precursor-combination immediately prior to introduction into the reactor. Such mixing may be achieved by mixing in a separate tank then swift injection into the reactor, mixing in-line just prior to injection into the reactor, or the like. It has been observed that in some instances, a short activation time is very useful. Likewise in-situ activation, where the catalyst system components are injected separately into the reactor, with or without monomer, and allowed to combine within the reactor directly is also useful in the practice of this invention. In some embodiments, the catalyst system components are allowed to contact each other for 30 minutes or less, prior to contact with monomer, alternately for 5 minutes or less, alternately for 3 minutes or less, alternately for 1 minute or less.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0233">General: All air sensitive procedures were performed under a purified argon or nitrogen atmosphere in a Vacuum Atmospheres or MBraun glove box. All solvents used were anhydrous, de-oxygenated and purified according to known techniques (see for example, D. D. Perrin &amp; W. L. F. Armarego <i>Purification of Laboratory Chemicals, </i>3<sup>rd </sup> <i>Ed</i>., (Pergamon Press: New York, 1988)). All ligands and metal precursors were prepared according to procedures known to those of skill in the art, e.g., under inert atmosphere conditions, etc. Ethylene oligomerization experiments were carried out in a parallel pressure reactor, described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,306,658, 6,455,316 and 6,489,168, and in U.S. application Ser. No. 09/177,170, filed Oct. 22, 1998, WO 00/09255, and a parallel batch reactor with in situ injection capability, as described in WO 04/060550, and U.S. Application No. 2004/0121448, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0234">Quantitative analysis of the liquid olefin products was performed using an automated Agilent 6890 Dual Channel Gas Chromatograph fitted with 2 Flame Ionization Detectors. The liquid olefin products were first separated using RT-x1 columns (1.25 m length×0.25 mm thickness×1 μm width; manufactured by Restek and spooled into module by RVM Scientific) and quantified by flame ionization detection by comparison with calibration standards. Cyclooctane was used as an internal standard. Samples were loaded onto the columns from an 8×12 array of 1 mL glass vials using a CTC HTS PAL LC-MS autosampler purchased from LEAPTEC. Polyethylene yields were determined using a Bohdan model BA-100 automated weighing module.</div>

For certain ligands, the use of a complexing reagent is not necessary. In some cases the regioselectivity of Step 4 is such that the products of nucleophilic attack at both the imine carbon and the imine nitrogen can be isolated, e.g. ligands A29 and A38 can be obtained from the same reaction, with the product ratio depending on the conditions used.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0259">The pyridyl-amine ligand A53 (0.268 g, 1 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL of anhydrous CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2 </sub>under inert atmosphere. The solution was cooled to −78° C. and n-butyllithium (0.69 mL of a 1.6 M solution in hexanes, 1.1 mmol) was added with stirring. The resulting solution was warmed to RT and stirred for 1 h. Methyl iodide was then added and the mixture was stirred at RT for 12 h. The reaction mixture was poured onto saturated NH<sub>4</sub>Cl and the organics separated. The organic layer was washed with brine, collected, and dried over Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. The product was adsorbed onto neutral alumina gel and purified via alumina chromatography, eluting with a gradient of 0-20% EtOAc in hexanes.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0032">5a. General Protocols</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0261">Ethylene oligomerization reactions were performed in a 96-well format using 1 mL glass vials arranged in an 8×12 array within an aluminum block. Reagents were added from stock solutions or slurries to the 1 mL vials using a Cavro liquid handling robot driven by Symyx software, see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,507,945, which is incorporated herein by reference, or a manual hand pipettor. The vials contained parylene coated stir-bars and were weighed prior to their use in screening (described below). Solutions of a parent array of desired ligands were transferred to arrays of glass vials (0.3 μmol of each ligand) and the solvent was then removed from the ligand array using a nitrogen or argon stream. The resultant ligand array was then contacted with a suitable chromium precursor, an activator (or combination of activators) and pressurized with ethylene within a parallel batch reactor with in situ injection capability. Specific details are described below. The parallel batch reactor is described in WO04/060550, and U.S. Application No. 2004/0121448, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0284">After 1 hour of reaction, the parallel batch reactor was depressurized and the array was removed. The array of vials was then transferred to a room temperature aluminum block, and to each vial was added ca. 200 μL of toluene followed by 30-50 μL of water. The vials were stirred and then topped off with toluene to bring the total volume to ca. 800 μL. A Teflon sheet and rubber gasket were placed over the top of the array and an aluminum cover was screwed on the top to seal the array. The array was then mechanically agitated and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 minutes before analyzing the composition of each well using Gas Chromatography with a Flame Ionization Detector (e.g. the GC-FID technique). Following the GC analysis of the array, the volatiles were removed under vacuum centrifuge and the vials were weighed in order to determine the yield of solid product. The calculated catalyst and cocatalyst residues were then subtracted from the weight to give the yield of polyethylene produced. Table 1 presents selected results from the selective ethylene oligomerization reactions performed in 96-well formats. In Table 1, 1-hexene selectivity is shown as a percentage and is defined as 100×[micromoles of 1-hexene]/[sum of micromoles of C<sub>6</sub>-C<sub>16 </sub>olefins (excluding dodecene when dodecane was used as solvent)].</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0056">6e. Oligomerization Reactions</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0305">The trimerization reactions were allowed to continue for between 4.6 minutes and 60 minutes, during which time the temperature and pressure were maintained at their pre-set levels by computer control. The specific reaction times for each experiment are shown in Table 2. After the reaction time elapsed, the reaction was quenched by addition of an overpressure of oxygen (approximately 35 psi (241 kPa) of a 20% O<sub>2</sub>/80% N<sub>2 </sub>mixture) sent to the reactor. The reaction times were the lesser of the maximum desired reaction time or the time taken for a predetermined amount of ethylene gas to be consumed in the reaction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0057">6f. Product Analysis</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0306">After completion of the trimerizations reactions, the glass vial inserts containing the reaction products were removed from the pressure cell and removed from the inert atmosphere dry box, and deionized water (50 mL-100 mL) was added. The glass vial inserts were then centrifuged for approximately 10 minutes. 0.5 mL of the supernatant was then removed and analyzed by the GC-FID technique. The remaining supernatant was then decanted, and the vial insert containing insoluble residue was then placed in a centrifuge evaporator and the volatile components were removed. After most of the volatile components had evaporated, the vial contents were dried thoroughly (to constant weight) by evaporation at elevated temperature (approximately 80° C.) under reduced pressure in a vacuum oven. The vial was then weighed to determine the mass of solid product (final weight minus vial tare weight). The calculated mass of the catalyst and cocatalyst residue was then subtracted from the total mass to give the yield of polyethylene produced. Table 2 presents the results from the ethylene oligomerization reactions performed in a 48-well parallel pressure reactor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0307">In Table 2, 1-hexene selectivity is shown as a percentage and is defined as 100×[micromoles of 1-hexene]/[sum of micromoles of C<sub>6</sub>-C<sub>16 </sub>olefins (excluding dodecene when dodecane is used as solvent)].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0308">Catalyst activity (TOF) for production of the desired oligomer (1-hexene) is defined as the [micromoles of 1-hexene]/[micromoles of catalyst]/[reaction time in minutes]*60 minutes/hour, as shown in the column “1-hexene TOF”.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0332">A solution of CrMeCl<sub>2</sub>(THF)<sub>3 </sub>(24 mg, 0.068 mmol, 1 equiv, 2 mL toluene) was added to a toluene solution of A54 (20 mg, 0.068 mmol, 1 equiv, 5 mL toluene) at room temperature. The reaction mixture was stirred at 75° C. for 90 minutes, during which time the reaction mixture turned from a clear yellow-brown solution to an olive green solution with an olive green precipitate. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, and Li(acac) (14 mg, 0.13 mmol) was added to the mixture. The reaction mixture was stirred at 75° C. for 22 hours, during which time it changed color to yellow and then to a clear amber solution. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and filtered through a glass microfiber filter. The filter was washed with 2×1.5 mL of toluene, and the combined filtrate was dried under a nitrogen stream. The resulting red-orange solid was dissolved in 2 mL of THF and pentane was added until a fine powder began to precipitate (approximately 4.5 mL of pentane were added total). The solution was left to recrystallize at −35° C. The supernatant was removed by pipette and the solid was dried in vacuo for 2 hours. 37 mg of product was obtained.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0088">Preparation of Complex Solutions</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0361">For Example 7.1, 1.8 mg of Complex M13 was dissolved in 5.67 mL of toluene, in an 8 mL glass vial, to give a 0.625 mM solution.

An ethylene pressure of 400 psi (2.76 MPa) in the pressure cell and the temperature setting were maintained, using computer control, until the end of the selective oligomerization experiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0091">Reactor Preparation for Other Examples in Table 5.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0365">The reactor preparation for the other examples in Table 5 were performed similarly, except that 0.200 mL of 50 mM solutions of TMA or TIBA in heptane, or 0.050 mL of a 200 mM solution of MMAO-3A in heptane, or 0.250 mL of a 200 mM solution of TMA in heptane, were injected, to achieve the desired micromoles of Group 13 reagent listed in Table 5, followed by a suitable volume of heptane to achieve a total liquid volume of 5.10 mL after the Complex injection step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0092">7c. Injection of Activator Solution and Catalyst Solution into the Pressure Reactor Vessel for Example 7.1:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0366">Activator Injection Step: 0.075 mL of a 200 mM solution of MMAO-3A in heptane was robotically aspirated into a needle (as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,759,014 and 6,913,934), followed by the aspiration of 0.060 mL of heptane. The outside of the needle was sprayed with heptane, then the needle contents (heptane and MMAO-3A solution) were injected into the pressurized reaction vessel through a mechanical septum, followed immediately by injection of 0.240 mL of heptane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0367">Complex Injection Step: 0.080 mL of a 0.625 mM solution of Complex M13 in heptane was robotically aspirated from an 8 ml glass vial, followed by the aspiration of 0.104 mL of heptane. The outside of the needle was sprayed with heptane, then the needle contents (heptane and complex solution) were injected into the pressurized reaction vessel through a mechanical septum, followed immediately by injection of 0.416 mL of heptane, to bring the total volume injected to 0.600 mL. The Complex injection into the pressurized reaction vessel occurred 2 minutes after the Activator injection.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0093">Injection of Activator Solution and Catalyst Solution or Slurry into the Pressure Reactor Vessel for Other Examples:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0368">The Activator &amp; Complex Injection procedure was performed in a similar fashion to the procedure described above, for other examples in Table 5. In the Examples where the Activator is MMAO-3A (abbreviated to MMAO in Table 5), a suitable volume of a 200 mM solution of MMAO-3A in heptane was injected, to achieve the specified molar equivalents of activator to complex in the pressurized reaction vessel. In the examples where the activator is “SJ2BF20” (N,N-di(n-decyl)-4-n-butyl-anilinium tetrakis(perfluorophenyl)borate, [(4-n-Bu-C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)NH(n-decyl)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>[B(C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>−</sup>) or “THF20” (trityl tetrakis(perfluorophenyl)borate, [(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)C]<sup>+</sup>[B(C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>]<sup>−</sup>), a suitable volume of a 2.5 mM solution of the activator reagent in toluene was injected, to achieve the specified molar equivalents of activator to complex in the pressurized reaction vessel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0369">The volume of complex solution (or slurry) injected into the pressurized reactor was calculated to achieve the specified micromoles of complex listed in Table 5. In the Examples 7.14, 7.15 and 7.20, in which a dodecane or heptane slurry of the complex was used, the slurry was vortexed at 1200 rpm, to achieve a uniform suspension, during the whole of the injection procedure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0094">7d. Oligomerization Reactions</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0370">The oligomerization reactions were allowed to continue for between 3 minutes and 60 minutes, during which time the temperature and pressure were maintained at their pre-set levels by computer control. The specific reaction times for each experiment are shown in Table 5. After the reaction time elapsed, the reaction was quenched by addition of an overpressure of oxygen (approximately 50 psi (0.34 MPa) of a 20% O<sub>2</sub>/80% N<sub>2 </sub>mixture) sent to the reactor. The reaction times were the lesser of the maximum desired reaction time or the time taken for a predetermined amount of ethylene gas to be consumed in the reaction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0095">7e. Product Analysis</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0371">After completion of the oligomerization reactions, the glass vial inserts containing the reaction products were removed from the pressure cell and removed from the inert atmosphere dry box, and deionized water (100 μL) was added. The glass vial inserts were then centrifuged for approximately 10 minutes. After centrifuging, 0.5 mL of the supernatant was then removed and analyzed by the GC-FID technique described above. The remaining supernatant was then decanted, and the vial insert containing insoluble residue was then placed in a centrifuge evaporator and the volatile components were removed. After the volatile components had evaporated, the vial contents were dried thoroughly (to constant weight) at elevated temperature (approximately 80° C.) under reduced pressure in a vacuum oven. The vial was then weighed to determine the mass of solid product (final weight minus vial tare weight). The calculated mass of the catalyst and cocatalyst residue was then subtracted from the total mass to give the yield of polyethylene produced, as listed in Table 5.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0372">Table 5 presents the results from the ethylene oligomerization reactions performed in a 48-well parallel pressure reactor. In Table 5,1-hexene selectivity is shown as a percentage and is defined as 100×[micromoles of 1-hexene]/[sum of micromoles of C<sub>6</sub>-C<sub>16 </sub>olefins]. Catalyst activity (Turn Over Frequency, TOF) for production of the desired oligomer (1-hexene) is defined as the [micromoles of 1-hexene]/([micromoles of catalyst]*[reaction time in minutes]/60), as shown in the column “1-hexene TOF”. In Table 5, MMAO-3A is abbreviated to “MMAO”.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0374">As discussed herein, catalytic performance can be determined a number of different ways, as those of skill in the art will appreciate. Catalytic performance can be determined by the yield of oligomer (for example, trimer or tetramer) obtained per mole of metal complex, which in some contexts may be considered to be activity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0375">The results of selective ethylene trimerization or tetramerization using ligands of the invention in combination with chromium precursors or with isolated chromium metal complexes are surprising. The results illustrate that certain combinations are more productive in the trimerization of ethylene, for example, to produce 1-hexene at a higher selectivity and a lower selectivity toward polyethylene when compared with other chromium-ligand catalysts under similar conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0376">All documents described herein are incorporated by reference herein, including any priority documents and/or testing procedures. As is apparent from the foregoing general description and the specific embodiments, while forms of the invention have been illustrated and described, various modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
