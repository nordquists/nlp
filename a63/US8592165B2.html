<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The present invention relates to the field of prevention and treatment of diseases that are characterized by the occurrence of certain carbohydrate epitopes. The invention provides nutraceuticals and pharmaceutical compositions comprising a microorganism positive for the carbohydrate epitope and fractions thereof which induce an effective carbohydrate-specific cellular immune response against carbohydrate-positive cells and diseases. Furthermore it provides methods for the selection, isolation and identification of carbohydrate-positive microorganisms which are suitable as an effective part of the nutraceutical or pharmaceutical composition. It provides methods for the generation of carbohydrate specific dendritic cells and cell lines and carbohydrate specific T cells, T cell clones and T cell lines. The invention further provides formulations and methods for prophylaxis and treatment of diseases associated with certain carbohydrate epitopes.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Carbohydrate antigens often occur in combination with human diseases. For instance, aberrant glycosylation is a typical hallmark of cancer cells, thereby creating new carbohydrate structure that are absent from or rarely present on normal human cells. Those carbohydrate structures were believed to be suitable candidates for the generation of tumor vaccines, but the carbohydrate itself are poorly immunogenic structures classified as T cell independent antigens. Therefore, vaccine development focused on the generation of synthetic carbohydrate based anti-tumor vaccines, whereby carbohydrate epitopes are coupled to immune potentiating carrier structures or natural proteins or oligopeptides (such as MUC1) and combined with additional adjuvances for the induction of an immune response especially for the induction of a cellular immune response. Polysaccharide are linked to immunogenic polypeptides such as tetanus or diphtheria toxoid or KLH or T helper epitopes in order to alter the immune response from T cell independent to T cell dependent in order to generate immunological memory. The production of such vaccines is extraordinarily difficult and expensive. Furthermore, such vaccines represent non-natural or artificial antigens with unknown or adverse side effects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Until recently it was believed that carbohydrates are not presented by antigen presenting cells (e.g. dendritic cells) to immune effector cells and do not mediate a T cell immune response.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Now few reports show that complex carbohydrate are not removed during processing of glycoproteins by antigen presenting cells and can be presented to major histocompatibility complex II restricted T cells together with the peptid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">In the case of the MUC1 antigen, internalization, processing and presentation of glycopeptides on dendritic cells could be shown. MUC1 bearing short sialylated carbohydrates induced activation and maturation of dendritic cells phenotypically similar to that induced by bacterial LPS thereby lacking specificity, but these DCs were not capable of inducting a Th1 type immune response after coculture with allogenic CD4+ T cells or cytotoxic CD8 responses (Carlos et al. (2005) J Immunol 175: 1628-1635).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">MUC1-derived peptides O-glycosylated with a Tn epitope induce cellular immunogenicity in mice, but immunization with glycopeptide-loaded dendritic cells showed no immunotherapeutic effect, no selective lysis of human MUC1 expressing murine cell lines and the elicited CTLs showed cross-reactivity between glycosylated and non-glycosylated forms of the same peptides, so the immune response was not effective and not CH-specific (Stepensky et al. (2005) Clin Exp Immunol 143:139-149).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">Cancer associated MUC1 carrying short sugar moieties from mono- to tetrasaccharides (such as the tumor antigens Tn, TF, S-Tn, and S-TF) can even induce suppression of human T cell responses (Agrawal et al. Nat Med 1998 January; 4(1):43-9).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">Bacterial glycosylation is completely different from eukaryotic glycosylation due to a different profile of enzymes involved in the glycosylation machinery. The majority of the polysaccharides of bacteria are negatively charged polysaccharides which clearly fail to activate T cells and hence are generally classified as T cell independent type 2 antigens. More recently it was described that zwitterionic capsular polysaccharides from certain bacteria have the ability to activate CD4+ T cells. However, MHCII restriction for zwitterionic polysaccharide antigens is not clear, and the T cells are activated in a polyclonal non-antigen specific fashion which is not antigen or epitope specific but show a broad Vβ usage and cross-reactivity apparently resembling the broad activation induced by mitogens (Cobb and Kasper, Cell Microbiol 2005; Eyon, Zenewicz, Flavell, Cell, 2005).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">Furthermore, carbohydrates and carbohydrate antigens are generally known as weak immunogens.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">Th1 type immunity is considered to be important and necessary in tumor rejection and in elicitation of potent immune responses in various diseases (Kobayashi et al., 1998, J. Immunol. 160: 5869-5873). It was shown that some short tumor carbohydrates may be presented and recognized together with certain aminoacids as combined necessary binding motifs. However, this does not lead to a Th1 type immune response. In contrast, in case of MUC1 desialylated MUC1 (presenting short sugar moieties such as Tn or TF) fails to induce T cell cytokine production and hence no T cell activation or in case of sialylated sugars induction of the secretion of cytokines such as TNFalpha together with IL-6 which are connected with tumor metastasis, tumor progression and bad prognosis, occur and hence fail to activate the necessary TH1 response and is even thought to be connected with tumor escape from immune responses (Carlos et al., J. Immunol,).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">This state of the art teaches that natural molecules comprising human carbohydrate tumor antigens can not induce a potent cellular Th1 and cytotoxic immunity directed against carbohydrate epitopes, and that polysaccharides from bacteria, in particular the capsular polysaccharides, can not induce an antigen specific immune response.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">Hence, the use of these carbohydrate molecules would not be suitable for tumor vaccine approaches using (i) dendritic cells for presentation of the carbohydrate antigens which would not induce a potent cytotoxic immune response when administered in humans and not be suitable for tumor vaccine approaches using (ii) APC such as DC for presentation of the carbohydrate antigens for generation of antigen specific T cells in a Th1 response for a adoptive T cell therapy in patients.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">However, due to the importance of carbohydrate antigens in the development of pathologic diseases such as cancer, it would be advantageous to obtain means for inducing an effective carbohydrate-specific cellular immune response.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">It is the object of the present invention to provide respective means.</div>
<heading>DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">In order to overcome the above mentioned drawbacks in the art, the present invention provides the means for the induction of an effective carbohydrate-specific cellular immune response against a carbohydrate epitope or epitopes present on a molecule from a human or animal cell associated with a disease of said human or animal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">To our knowledge this surprising finding is the first report on the induction of a carbohydrate specific Th1 type immune response induced by a natural molecule.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">Even further surprisingly we show for the first time that an effective carbohydrate-specific cellular Th1 type and a cytotoxic T cell immune response can be induced by the administration of suitable amounts of at least one microorganism that expresses a human or animal disease-associated carbohydrate epitope or at least one fraction thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">The usage of bacteria that usually inhabit the gastro-intestinal tract of humans results in a prophylactic and therapeutic agent that does not cause undesired side effects. The carbohydrate nature is responsible for the lack of relevant tolerogencity and shows no relevant allergic reactions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">As glycosylation in microorganisms is completely different from glycosylation in humans or animals, it was surprising that the microorganisms provided and obtainable by the present invention express a “human” carbohydrate epitope or part of it as it occurs on a human cell surface or is produced from a human cell and that this human antigen or part of it is presented by dendritic cells after loading with said microorganisms and induces an effective cellular immune response against said carbohydrate antigen which can in sense of the invention also be or comprise an effective cellular immune response against carbohydrate structures, carbohydrate conjugates or a mammalian cell comprising said carbohydrate epitope. Those loaded dendritic cells are functionally active and stimulate and activate T cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">Most surprisingly this immune response is also carbohydrate specific and is e.g. not predominantly triggered by the underlying peptide sequence.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">One important aspect of the present invention is that the carbohydrate positive microorganism is recognized by at least one carbohydrate binding molecule such as e.g. a carbohydrate epitope specific antibody. Hence, the carbohydrate positive microorganism is specifically bound by a carbohydrate epitope specific antibody when contacted with said antibody. The Carbohydrate structure is thus accessible for said carbohydrate epitope specific antibody in the carbohydrate positive microorganism of the present invention and not “hidden” by other structures. This important characteristic which can be determined upon testing—suitable tests are described below—ensures that the carbohydrate positive microorganism and/or the carbohydrate positive fraction or lysate thereof carries the carbohydrate epitope of interest and is thus at least immunochemically virtually identical to the carbohydrate epitope of interest and not an epitope that is merely similar to the carbohydrate epitope of interest. This feature is important to ensure that an immune response is triggered by said carbohydrate positive microorganism that is sufficiently specific for the carbohydrate epitope of interest. Such carbohydrate epitope specific antibodies, that can be used to determine that a microorganism carries the carbohydrate epitope of interest, specifically recognize the carbohydrate epitope e.g. in a tumor-relevant surrounding and hence as naturally occurring. This further ensures that the microorganism carries the carbohydrate epitope of interest in a form that triggers the desired immune response.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">The carbohydrate epitope specific antibodies can accordingly be used to determine that the carbohydrate positive microorganisms of the present invention carry Carbohydrate structures mimicking the carbohydrate epitope of interest e.g. as present on tumors. This characteristic—carbohydrate epitope specificity—is decisive for the ability of the microorganism of the present invention to trigger the desired immune response.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">Due to the fact that the microorganisms of the present invention are truly carbohydrate positive and are respectively selected—what can be determined/done by the use of carbohydrate epitope specific antibodies—the invention provides carbohydrate positive microorganisms which induce or enhance a specific and thus potent immune response against the carbohydrate epitope of interest. As indicated above, said carbohydrate epitope is preferably a human carbohydrate epitope and hence a carbohydrate epitope found on or presented by a human cell. The formulation of the present invention activates the immune system in a tumor-specific manner by inducing high anti-carbohydrate epitope antibody levels which are specific. To our knowledge, the present invention is the first antigen-specific food additive/nutraceutical or pharmaceutical which is able to activate a specific immune shield against tumors and the first food-additive which is able to induce a carbohydrate and in particular Core-1 tumor antigen-specific immune response.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">According to one embodiment, the invention provides a method of identifying a carbohydrate positive microorganism according to the present invention which microorganism is thus capable of triggering a specific immune response.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">Hence, a method for isolating a carbohydrate positive microorganism carrying a preferably human carbohydrate epitope of interest from a mixture of microorganisms is provided, comprising</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">(a) bringing a carbohydrate binding molecule specific for the carbohydrate epitope of interest into contact with a mixture of microorganisms, and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">(b) isolating at least one microorganism bound to said carbohydrate binding molecule from said mixture,</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">(c) optionally testing that the isolated microorganism is a carbohydrate positive microorganism by testing the isolated microorganism for specific binding to said carbohydrate binding molecule.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">This selection method allows the identification of microorganisms which carry the carbohydrate epitope of interest and are thus suitable components for the formulations according to the present invention. As outlined above, said carbohydrate epitope is preferably a human carbohydrate epitope such as e.g. a tumor marker.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">As becomes apparent from the examples, several carbohydrate epitopes exist which are associated with diseases and in particular cancer (see e.g. table 1). Furthermore, there are also binding molecules known which specifically bind said human carbohydrate epitopes of interest (see table 2). Furthermore, methods for generating carbohydrate binding molecules specific for the carbohydrate epitope of interest are also described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">According to a preferred embodiment, said method additionally comprises testing the induction of an effective carbohydrate specific cellular immune response and/or humoral immune response against said carbohydrate epitope by said microorganism and/or fraction and/or lysate thereof in vivo or in vitro. According to this preferred embodiment said carbohydrate positive microorganism induces or enhances an immune response against the carbohydrate epitope of interest in at least one human or animal recognizing the carbohydrate epitope of interest and/or tumor cell positive for said carbohydrate epitope. Due to the fact that the microorganism is positive for the carbohydrate epitope of interest, an immune response against the carbohydrate epitope of interest is induced/enhanced upon administration of the identified microorganism. Thereby an immunosurveillance mechanism is established that may e.g. eliminate newly arising tumor cells carrying the carbohydrate epitope of interest, thereby preventing primary tumor growth and/or which strengthens the immune system and/or improves an immune response.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">Therefore, according to a preferred embodiment, step (d) comprises testing the induction of an effective carbohydrate specific cellular immune response against said carbohydrate epitope by said carbohydrate positive microorganism and/or fraction and/or lysate thereof for the activation of CD4 positive Th1 type T cells and/or for the activation of cytotoxic CD8 positive T cells, preferably in at least one animal or human and/or in vitro.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">According to one embodiment, said cellular immune response test performed in step (d) comprises
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0036">i.) Loading at least one dendritic cell with the carbohydrate positive cell identified in steps (a) to (c);</li> <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0037">ii.) bringing into contact a suitable amount of said at least one dendritic cell loaded with said carbohydrate positive microorganism with a suitable amount of immune cells which can be activated or inhibited by a dendritic cell;</li> <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0038">iii.) cultivation in order to allow interaction of said immune cells with said loaded dendritic cells;</li> <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0039">iv.) adding a suitable amount of antigen presenting cells (APC) loaded with a suitable amount of at least one second compound carrying the same carbohydrate epitope as the carbohydrate positive microorganism, wherein said second compound is different from said carbohydrate positive microorganism;</li> <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0040">v.) cultivation for restimulation of said immune cells</li> <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0041">vi.) determining whether restimulation of the immune cells occurred.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">By performing this cellular response test it can be determined whether a certain carbohydrate epitope present of said carbohydrate positive microorganism is capable of triggering a cellular immune response. So far the prior art assumed that carbohydrates are unable to trigger a cellular immune response. However, it has now been found that certain carbohydrate epitopes are able to elicit a cellular immune response. It is thus important to provide test systems for determining whether a carbohydrate positive microorganism identified by the method of the present invention is indeed able to trigger a respective cellular response, thereby determining whether said microorganism is suitable e.g. for therapy. Said test uses dendritic cells as dendritic cells are able to prime and thus stimulate immune cells such as T-cells. Dendritic cells process compounds they are encountering and present the processed compounds/antigens on their surface. However, MHC cells such as dendritic cells can only present certain kinds of antigens and it is important to determine whether the antigen/epitope of interest can be presented by dendritic cells as only such antigens/epitopes are able to elicit a cellular immune response.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">Therefore, dendritic cells are loaded with the Carbohydrate-positive microorganism identified in steps (a) to (c). Suitable conditions for loading are described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">Said loaded dendritic cells are then contacted with immune cells, in particular lymphocytes such as T-cells. The immune cells can be obtained e.g. from human donors. Dendritic cells presenting antigens matching the receptors of the immune cells activate and thus stimulate the lymphocytes thereby allowing them to proliferate and survive. Lymphocytes which do not match the antigens presented by the dendritic cells are not activated and die.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">This first round of stimulation provides activated lymphocytes which are specific for any corresponding antigen presented by said loaded dendritic cells. However, the aim of the present step is to identify whether the carbohydrate positive microorganism can stimulate a cellular response specific for the carbohydrate epitope.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">Therefore, a selection step is performed wherein the lymphocytes are restimulated in order to determine whether the carbohydrate epitope of the carbohydrate positive microorganism stimulates the lymphocytes and thus triggers a cellular response. In said selection step antigen presenting cells such as e.g. dendritic cells are loaded with a second compound which also carries the carbohydrate of interest. However, said second compound is different from the carbohydrate positive microorganism. This second compound is also processed by the APCs and the antigens are presented by said APCs. As the second compound is different from the carbohydrate positive microorganism, most presented antigens, preferably all antigens are—besides the Carbohydrate of interest—different from the antigens presented in the first round. This has the effect that only those lymphocytes survive the second round of restimulation which find a matching antigen presented by said APCs. In case the dendritic cells of the first round as well as the APCs of the second round both present an antigen comprising or consisting of the carbohydrate epitope of interest, lymphocytes recognizing said antigen are stimulated and thus survive as they are also restimulated. Those lymphocytes which do not find a matching partner when contacting with said APCs loaded with said second compound carrying the carbohydrate epitope of interest die due to a lack of restimulation. This selection step ensures that a cellular response against the Carbohydrate of interest is detected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">Further embodiments regarding the provided test systems that can be used in conjunction with the present invention are described in the claims and subsequently.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">The carbohydrate positive microorganisms identified by said method which have the described characteristics and advantages and can be used in the formulation according to the present invention. The formulation according to the present invention can be used for prophylactic and/or therapeutic purposes and/or in supporting immunological activities.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">The invention also provides formulations which can be used as pharmaceutical composition and as nutraceuticals and can induce the immune responses against the carbohydrate epitopes on human or animal cells or against a disease by a series of different administration routes including the systemic administration such as but not limited to intra peritoneal, intravenous, intradermal, subcutaneous but even more surprisingly via oral administration mediating a systemic immune response even when administering the microorganisms or fractions thereof via the oral route.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">A formulation of the invention is a nutraceutical or a pharmaceutical composition which comprises at least one microorganism specifically bound by at least one carbohydrate binding molecule binding a carbohydrate epitope present on a molecule from a human or animal cell, or a fraction or a lysate thereof, whereby said microorganism or a fraction or a lysate thereof, or said formulation, said nutraceutical, or said pharmaceutical composition induce an effective carbohydrate-specific cellular immune response against said carbohydrate antigen in at least one animal or human, preferably a cytotoxic T cell response.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">In one embodiment of the invention the formulation of the present invention can be a nutraceutical and provides the means for the induction of a specific immune shield against diseases associated with certain carbohydrate epitopes or antigens. This is in contrast to conventional probiotics and prebiotics which result not in an antigen specific immune response but in an overall unspecific induction of the immune system. Use of the formulation of the present invention as a nutraceutical has several advantages compared to conventional vaccination strategies. One of it is the important convenience for the patient or the person who is using it. The immunostimulation is carbohydrate epitope or antigen specific and can even be induced well prior to the establishment of a disease or tumor building a specific immune shield in order to prevent, inhibit or reduce the development of such diseases or to be used in combination with other therapies of the disease or a therapy. Therefore, aggressive therapies (such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery) with severe side effects can be avoided. In a preferred embodiment the individual does not necessarily have to visit a physician in order to actively pursue disease prophylaxis, but can obtain the necessary formulation incorporated in a food, thereby decreasing the psychological barrier against other prevention possibilities.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention have also the advantage that they can target diseases with high medical need where carbohydrates or carbohydrate markers play an important role.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">Without intending to be limiting, examples of such diseases and the associated human carbohydrate epitopes are listed in table 1.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">Surprisingly, the formulation of the present invention acts as an immunosurveillance mechanism against carbohydrate-positive diseases or tumor cells after administration in a human or an animal.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">Due to the biologic nature of the formulation, its production is less expensive and time consuming as the production of conventional immunotherapeutic formulations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">Surprisingly, the formulation of the present invention has internal adjuvant properties, therefore additional adjuvances or immune-potentiating carriers are not necessary in all cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">A) Nutraceuticals and Pharmaceutical Composition</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">The present invention provides a formulation selected from the group comprising nutraceutical and pharmaceutical compositions, comprising at least one carbohydrate positive microorganism which is recognized and thus bound upon contact by at least one carbohydrate binding molecule specifically recognizing a carbohydrate epitope present on a molecule from a human or animal cell, or a fraction or a lysate thereof, whereby said microorganism, said fraction or said lysate or said formulation comprising those induces an effective carbohydrate-specific cellular immune response against said carbohydrate epitope, and/or a carbohydrate structure, carbohydrate conjugate or a mammalian cell comprising said carbohydrate epitope.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0117">Food in the context of the invention is traditionally obtained through farming, ranching, and fishing, with hunting, foraging and other methods of subsistence locally important for some populations, but minor for others. In the modern era, in developed nations, food supply is increasingly dependent upon agriculture, industrial farming, aquaculture and fish farming techniques which aim to maximise the amount of food produced, whilst minimising the cost. These include a reliance on mechanised tools which have been developed, from the threshing machine, seed drill, through to the tractor and combine, etc. These have been combined with the use of pesticides to promote high crop yields and combat those insects or mammals which reduce yield. More recently, there has been a growing trend towards more sustainable agricultural practices. This approach—which is partly fueled by consumer demand—encourages biodiversity, local self-reliance and organic farming methods.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0178">According to one embodiment, the invention provides an in vitro cellular immune response test against a carbohydrate epitope of interest comprising
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0012-0001" num="0193">a.)

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0179">The invention provides a method for determining whether certain carbohydrate epitope is capable of triggering a cellular immune response. So far the prior art assumed that carbohydrates are unable to trigger a cellular immune response. However, it has now been found that certain carbohydrate epitopes are able to elicit a cellular immune response. It is thus important to provide test systems for determining whether a certain carbohydrate epitope is indeed able to trigger a respective response, thereby determining whether said carbohydrate epitope is a suitable working point e.g. for therapy. The invention thus uses dendritic cells as dendritic cells are able to prime and thus stimulate immune cells such as T-cells. Dendritic cells process compounds they are encountering and present the processed compounds/antigens on their surface. However, MHC cells such as dendritic cells can only present certain kinds of antigens and it is important to determine whether the antigen/epitope of interest can be presented by dendritic cells as only such antigens/epitopes are able to elicit a cellular immune response. The principles of this cellular immune response test are also illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0180">Therefore, dendritic cells are loaded with the compound of interest which is assumed to or carries the carbohydrate structure/epitope of interest. Said compound can e.g. be a microorganism carrying the carbohydrate epitope of interest as described herein, a tumor cell or any other compound carrying the carbohydrate epitope of interest. Suitable conditions for loading and suitable compounds carrying carbohydrate structures are described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0181">Said loaded dendritic cells are then contacted with immune cells, in particular lymphocytes such as T-cells. The immune cells can be obtained e.g. from human donors. Dendritic cells presenting antigens matching the receptors of the immune cells activate and thus stimulate the lymphocytes thereby allowing them to proliferate and survive. Lymphocytes which do not match the antigens presented by the dendritic cells are not activated and die.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0182">This first round of stimulation provides activated lymphocytes which are specific for any corresponding antigen presented by said loaded dendritic cells. However, the aim of the present method is to identify whether the carbohydrate epitope/antigen of interest can stimulate a cellular response.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0183">Therefore, a selection step is performed wherein the lymphocytes are restimulated in order to determine whether the carbohydrate of interest stimulates the lymphocytes and thus triggers a cellular response. In said selection step antigen presenting cells such as e.g. dendritic cells are loaded with a second compound which also carries the carbohydrate of interest. However, said second compound is different from the first compound. This second compound is also processed by the APCs and the antigens are presented by said APCs. As the second compound is different from the first compound most presented antigens, preferably all antigens are—besides the carbohydrate epitope of interest—different from the antigens presented in the first round. This has the effect that only those lymphocytes survive the second round of restimulation which find a matching antigen presented by said APCs. In case the dendritic cells of the first round as well as the APCs of the second round both present an antigen comprising or consisting of the carbohydrate epitope of interest, lymphocytes recognizing said antigen are stimulated and thus survive as they are also restimulated. Those lymphocytes which do not find a matching partner when contacting with said APCs loaded with said second compound carrying the carbohydrate epitope of interest die due to a lack of restimulation. This selection step ensures that a cellular response against the carbohydrate of interest is detected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0184">In the last step it is determined whether the lymphocytes were indeed restimulated. This can be done e.g. by determining
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0013-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0014-0001" num="0205">secretion products of the lymphocytes which are secreted if said lymphocytes are (re)stimulated such as interferon alpha, interferon gamma or GM-CSF</li> <li id="ul0014-0002" num="0206">the proliferation of the T-cells.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0185">Suitable tests for determining whether restimulation occurs are described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0186">The specificity of said test can be enhanced by using a carbohydrate binding structure which specifically recognizes said carbohydrate epitope of interest when presented by the dendritic cells/APCs. According to said embodiment, at least a portion of said stimulated lymphocytes according to step c) are contacted with a suitable amount of antigen presenting cells (APC) loaded with a suitable amount of at least one second compound carrying the same carbohydrate epitope as said first compound, wherein said second compound is different from said carbohydrate positive compound, in the presence of a carbohydrate binding molecule recognizing said carbohydrate epitope of interest. Said carbohydrate binding molecule recognizing said carbohydrate epitope of interest blocks the interaction of the APCs with said lymphocytes thereby preventing restimulation and hence survival of the cells. This additional step further ensures that the carbohydrate of interest specifically stimulates lymphocytes and thus triggers a specific cellular immune response. This specificity enhancing/confirming step can be either done in parallel—by splitting the stimulated lymphocytes according to step c—or by performing said enhancing/confirming step additionally and thus afterwards.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0187">According to a first embodiment (cellular immune response test 1) the amount/degree of restimulated lymphocytes is determined by measuring GM-CSF secretion. E.g. the amount of secreted GM-CSF can be measured by ELISA or ELISPOT.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0493">In certain circumstances it will be desirable to deliver the formulations disclosed herein parenterally, intravenously, intramuscularly, or even intraperitoneally. Solutions of the active compounds as free base or pharmacologically acceptable salts may be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant, such as hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions may also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0494">The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous Solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable Solutions or dispersions. In all cases the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g. glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, and/or vegetable oils. Proper fluidity may be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be facilitated by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars or sodium Chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0495">For parenteral administration in an aqueous solution, for example, the solution should be suitably buffered if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic with sufficient saline or glucose. These particular aqueous Solutions are especially suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal administration. In this connection, a sterile aqueous medium that can be employed will be known to those of skill in the art in light of the present disclosure. For example, one dosage may be dissolved in 1 ml of isotonic NaCl solution and either added to 1000 ml of hypodermoclysis fluid or injected at the proposed site of infusion. Some Variation in dosage will necessarily occur depending on the condition of the subject being treated. The person responsible for administration will, in any event, determine the appropriate dose for the individual subject. Moreover, for human administration, preparations should meet sterility, pyrogenicity, and the general safety and purity Standards as required by national or regional Offices of biologics Standards.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0496">Sterile injectable Solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compounds in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredients into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable Solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum-drying and freeze-drying techniques which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0511">The gastrointestinal disorders are preferably selected from the group comprising functional bowel disorders and inflammatory bowel diseases; whereby the inflammatory bowel diseases are selected form the group comprising Crohn's disease, ileitis, and/or ulcerative colitis and the functional bowel disorders are selected form the group comprising gastro-esophageal reflux, dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome and/or functional abdominal pain. The gastrointestinal tract in the context of the invention consists of the following components: mouth (buccal cavity; includes salivary glands, mucosa, teeth and tongue), pharynx, esophagus and cardia, stomach, which includes the antrum and pylorus, bowel or intestine: small intestine, which has three parts: duodenum, jejunum, ileum; large intestine, which has three parts: cecum (the vermiform appendix is attached to the cecum); colon (ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon and sigmoid flexure); rectum and/or anus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0512">Diseases associated with the carbohydrate epitope in the meaning of the invention are also diseases entirely or partially due to the formation of autoantibodies and their damaging effect on the overall organism or organ systems, i.e., due to autoaggression. A classification into organ-specific, intermediary and/or systemic autoimmune diseases can be made. Preferred organ-specific autoimmune diseases are HASHIMOTO thyroiditis, primary myxedema, thyrotoxicosis (BASEDOW disease), pernicious anemia, ADDISON disease, myasthenia gravis and/or juvenile diabetes mellitus.

The basis is an aggressive immune reaction due to breakdown of the immune tolerance to self-determinants and a reduction of the activity of T suppressor cells (with lymphocyte marker T8) or an excess of T helper cells (with lymphocyte marker T4) over the suppressor cells; furthermore, formation of autoantigens is possible e.g. by coupling of host proteins to haptens (e.g. drugs), by ontogenetic tissue not developing until self-tolerance has developed, by protein components demasked as a result of conformational changes of proteins in connection with e.g. infection by viruses or bacteria; and by new proteins formed in connection with neoplasias.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0513">Septicemic diseases in the meaning of the invention are diseases due to continuous or periodic invasion of pathogenic bacteria and/or their toxins from a focus of disease and their spreading on the lymph-blood route to form a general or local infection.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0517">For testing, a study with healthy human volunteers should be performed, wherein serum antibody titers against Core-1 are determined by using at least one of the humoral immune response tests 1 to 6 determining the existing antibody response against Core-1 before first application of the nutraceutical and preferably volunteers with no or lower anti-Core-1 antibody levels are selected for the human trial. In those volunteers the nutraceutical comprising AG6 or MU1 or a placebo should be orally given over a period of 3 to 30 weeks. Oral application of at least two different dosages should be performed. Immune responses are followed by determination of the antibody and/or T cell response against Core-1 by using at least one of the humoral response tests 1 to 6 and/or cellular immune response tests 1 to 5 prior to and in suitable intervals after start of oral administration of the nutraceutical. If a formulation has the desired characteristics, there is a significant elevation of the antibody response against Core-1 and/or T cell response against Core-1 observed in a significant number of volunteers in the volunteer group that receives the nutraceutical in comparison to the titer before the study as positively tested by being positive in at least one of the humoral immune response tests 1 to 6 and/or in at least one of the cellular immune response tests 1 to 5. In the placebo group elevation of antibody or T-cell response against Core-1 should be less frequently observed or to a lesser extent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0518">This shows the effectiveness of the nutraceutical in humans for building an immune response against Core-1 which functions as a shield against Core-1 positive cancer cells for the prevention, reduction or spread of Core-1 positive tumors or metastasis or its treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0519">For testing the therapeutic potential, a study should be performed with human immuno competent cancer patients with Core-1 positive tumors which underwent surgery for removing the bulk tumor. Serum antibody titers against Core-1 are then determined by using at least one of the humoral immune response tests 1 to 6 for determining the existing antibody response against Core-1 before first application of the pharmaceutical composition. The pharmaceutical composition comprising AG6 or MU1 or a placebo are administered several times orally, intra peritoneally or intra venously over a period of 3 to 70 weeks. Administration of at least two different suitable dosages is performed. Immune responses are followed by determination of the antibody and/or T cell response against Core-1 by using at least one of the humoral response tests 1 to 6 and/or cellular immune response tests 1 to 5 and/or the clinical response are followed by determination of time to progression, tumor free survival and/or tumor volumes and/or sites, each prior to and in suitably intervals after start of the administration of the pharmaceutical composition. There is a significant elevation of the antibody response against Core-1 and/or of the T cell response against Core-1 observed in a significant number of volunteers in the group that receives the formulation of the invention in comparison to the titre before the study as positively tested by being positive in at least one of the humoral immune response tests 1 to 6 and/or in at least one of the cellular immune response tests 1 to 5 and/or a partial or complete clinical response or a elongated time to progression or time of survival in a significant number of the patients receiving the formulation. In the placebo group elevation of antibody or T-cell response against Core-1 is less frequently observed or to a lesser extend and/or no or a significantly lower clinical response is observed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0520">This may show the effectiveness of the pharmaceutical composition in humans for building an immune response against Core-1 which functions as a shield against Core-1 positive cancer cells for the prevention, reduction or spread of the occurrence of Core-1 positive tumors or metastasis or its treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0521">The contacting of the Core-1 positive microorganism or fraction thereof within the body of the living organism (human/animal) can initiate the production of antibodies binding Core-1, the Core-1 antigen, or Core-1 positive tumor cells in a significant number of humans or animals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0522">Surprisingly, antibodies against Core-1 can function as an immunosurveillance mechanism against newly arising cancer cells. Even more surprising, a Core-1 specific cellular immune response comprising activation of CD4 positive T cells of Th1 type and/or activation of CD8 positive cytotoxic T cells directed against Core-1, and/or a carbohydrate structure, carbohydrate conjugate or a mammalian cell comprising said carbohydrate epitope can be achieved in a significant number of humans or animals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0523">In a study with healthy human volunteers serum antibody titers against Tn or Lewis- or Lewis-Y can be determined by using at least one of the humoral immune response tests 1 to 6 determining the existing antibody response against Tn or Lewis Y before first application of the nutraceutical and preferably volunteers with no or lower Tn or Lewis Y antibody levels are selected for the human trial. In those volunteers the nutraceutical comprising a Tn positive microorganism, or a Lewis-Y positive microorganism or a placebo are orally given over a period of 3 to 30 weeks. Oral application of at least two different dosages is performed. Immune responses are followed by determination of the antibody and T cell response against Tn or Lewis Y by using at least one of the humoral response tests 1 to 6 and cellular immune response tests 1 to 5 prior to and in suitably intervals after start of oral administration of the nutraceutical. For suitable formulations a significant elevation of the antibody response against Tn or Lewis Y and/or T cell response against Tn or Lewis Y, respectively, should be observed in a significant number of volunteers in the volunteer group that receives the nutraceutical in comparison to the titre before the study as positively tested by being positive in at least one of the humoral immune response tests 1 to 6 and/or in at least one of the cellular immune response tests 1 to 5. In the placebo group elevation of antibody or T-cell response against Tn or Lewis Y is less frequently observed or to a lesser extend. The induction of the cellular immune response is characterized by the activation of Tn- or Lewis Y-specific T cells such as CD4 positive Th1 cells and/or CD8 positive cytotoxic T cells indicating the induction of an effective Tn- or Lewis Y-specific cellular immune response, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0524">This may show the effectiveness of the nutraceutical in humans for building an immune response against Tn or Lewis-Y which functions as a shield against Tn or Lewis Y positive cancer cells for the prevention, reduction or spread of Tn or Lewis Y positive tumors or metastasis or its treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0525">Before first application of the pharmaceutical composition in a study with human immuno-competent cancer patients suffering from Lewis-Y positive tumors, serum antibody titres against Lewis-Y are determined by using at least one of the humoral immune response tests 1 to 6 determining the existing antibody response against Lewis-Y.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0526">Patients are treated in the adjuvant setting after removing the bulk tumor. The pharmaceutical composition comprising a Lewis-Y positive bacteria strain or a placebo are administered several times orally, intra peritoneally or intra venously over a period of 3 to 70 weeks. Administration of at least two different suitable dosages is performed. Immune responses are followed by determination of the antibody and/or T cell response against Lewis-Y by using at least one of the humoral response tests 1 to 6 and/or cellular immune response tests 1 to 5. The clinical response is followed by determination of time to progression, tumor free survival and/or tumor volumes and/or sites, each prior to and in suitably intervals after start of the administration of the pharmaceutical composition. There is a significant elevation of the antibody response against Lewis-Y and/or of the T cell response against Lewis-Y observed in a significant number of volunteers in the group that receives the formulation of the invention in comparison to the titre before the study as positively tested by being positive in at least one of the humoral immune response tests 1 to 6 or in at least one of the cellular immune response tests 1 to 5 and/or a partial or complete clinical response or a elongated time to progression or time of survival in a significant number of the patients receiving the formulation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0527">The induced T cell response shows the features of an effective Lewis-Y specific cellular immune response comprising activation of CD4 positive Th1 T cells and/or CD8 positive cytotoxic T cells. In the placebo group elevation of antibody or T-cell response against Lewis-Y is less frequently observed or to a lesser extend and/or no or a significantly lower clinical response is observed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0528">This shows the effectiveness of the pharmaceutical composition in humans for building an immune response against Lewis-Y which functions as a shield against Lewis-Y positive cancer cells for the prevention, reduction or spread of the occurrence of Lewis-Y positive tumors or metastasis or its treatment.</div>

Surprisingly, antibodies against Lewis-Y function as a immunosurveillance mechanism against newly arising cancer cells. The induction of an effective Lewis-Y specific cellular immune response can result in the killing of residual or newly arising Lewis-Y positive tumor cells in the patient.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0562">Carbohydrate-Positive Microorganism</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0563">In accordance with the present invention the term “carbohydrate positive microorganism” means any mircoorganism which is recognized and thus bound upon contact by at least one carbohydrate binding molecule specifically recognizing a carbohydrate epitope (as defined elsewhere herein) usually present on a molecule from a human or animal cell. Preferably this binding can be inhibited by mild periodate treatment, and/or by partial or complete chemical or enzymatic removal or alteration of the carbohydrate epitope or the carbohydrate structure comprising the carbohydrate epitope, and/or by inhibition of the binding of the carbohydrate binding molecule with suitable amounts of another carbohydrate binding molecule recognizing said carbohydrate epitope, and/or by inhibition of the binding of the carbohydrate binding molecule with suitable amounts of the carbohydrate epitope or a molecule, mixtures of molecules or cell comprising said carbohydrate epitope when incubated with the microorganism during binding studies with the carbohydrate binding molecule. Also comprised by the term “carbohydrate positive microorganism” are microorganisms wherein the carbohydrate epitope of interest is exposed only after a chemical or enzymatical treatment such as e.g. a periodate treatment. Hence, said microorganism is recognized and thus bound upon contact by at least a corresponding carbohydrate binding molecule after said treatment.</div>

Preferably, said carbohydrate binding molecule specifically recognizes a carbohydrate epitope present on a human or animal cell such as e.g. a tumor marker. By using respective carbohydrate binding molecules which are specific for a “human” carbohydrate epitope, one may isolate a carbohydrate positive microorganism carrying a structure that is identical to or mimics the carbohydrate epitope of interest as can be determined by binding of said carbohydrate binding molecule which is preferably an antibody. Examples of suitable carbohydrate binding molecules are described e.g. in Table 2.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0567">Said carbohydrate-specific antibody can be a whole antibody from any animal or human such as murine, rat, human, camel, humanized or chimaeric IgM, IgG, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, IgE, IgD or any fragment of an antibody as long as it comprises the binding specificity or dependency against the carbohydrate, such as Fab, F(ab)2, single chain Fv, or single domain antibodies. Those antibodies can also contain at least one additional amino acid or mutations or polypeptide sequences, such as tags, linkers or multimerization domains and they can also originate from other sources than animals, such plants and such as selection from synthetic antibody libraries using for example phage display or ribosome display or by recombinant construction.</div>

For further clarification, for example such as but not limited to (i) said carbohydrate epitope can equal the tetrasaccharide Lewis Y with all four carbohydrate units of which are necessary for the binding of the carbohydrate binding molecule the monoclonal antibody A70-C/C8, or said carbohydrate epitope is also Lewis Y comprising the trisaccharide H-type 2 which is the minimal binding specificity requirement for the carbohydrate binding molecule the monoclonal antibody A46-B/B10 and which also binds to the tetrasaccharide of Lewis Y, and/or (ii) said carbohydrate epitope equals the carbohydrate part bound by a carbohydrate molecule but it is linked differently, such as but not limited to a beta linkage instead of an alpha linkage or vice versa or linked via a different carbohydrate atom.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0571">The term carbohydrate epitope can also mean the carbohydrate antigen which can be the same as the carbohydrate epitope or be any structure comprising a carbohydrate epitope described elsewhere herein in addition to e.g. a peptide part/portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0572">The carbohydrate epitope can consist of carbohydrate structures or carbohydrate-mimicking structures such as polypeptides, peptides, lipids or carbohydrates or combinations thereof of a chemical structure different from the carbohydrate but which have a conformational structure which can be recognized by carbohydrate binding molecules of the invention and thus has immunochemically similar or identical properties.</div>

<heading>Anaerobic Culture Techniques and Media</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0654">Anaerobic techniques employed in the cultivation of bacteria were based on methods previously described which have been summarised by Breznak and Costilow. Media prepared with cysteine.HCl as a reducing agent were dispensed into anaerobic culture tubes (Ochs, Bovenden, Germany) or glass serum bottles, leaving approximately half to a third of the total vessel volume as gas head space, and sealed with butyl rubber stoppers. Solutions prepared without reducing agents (e.g. PBS-a) were boiled prior to dispensing. Before autoclaving, the gas phase was replaced with N<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2 </sub>(80/20, v/v). To achieve this, needles were thrust through the butyl rubber-stoppered bottles and the bottles were evacuated by means of a vacuum pump (Vacuubrand, Wertheim, Germany). Following evacuation, bottles, which were repeatedly shaken during the entire process, were gassed with N<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2 </sub>(80/20, v/v). This evacuation and gassing procedure was carried out three times in total. Prior to entering the vessels, the gas mixture was passed over a hot palladium catalyst to remove residual traces of oxygen present in the gas mixture. Resazurin (1 mg l<sup>−1</sup>) was used as a redox indicator.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0655">Media for plating were poured under a laminar flow hood and stored under anoxic conditions for at least 24 h before use. This was achieved in either pressurised (1.5×10<sup>5 </sup>Pa) anaerobic jars with a 3.5 l AnaeroGen (Oxoid, Basingstoke, England) or with a repeatedly flushed N<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2 </sub>(80/10/10, v/v/v) anaerobic chamber airlock (Don Whitley Scientific, Shipley, England). Manipulation of samples was carried out in an anaerobic chamber (MACS variable atmosphere workstation, Don Whitley Scientific, Shipley, England or Coy Laboratory Products, Grass Lake, USA).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0656">Non-sterile solutions and materials were sterilised by autoclaving (121 C, 1.2×10<sup>5 </sup>Pa, 15 min). Heat-labile compounds were made as concentrated stock solutions in milli-Q water, sterile-filtered (0.22 μm, mixed cellulose ester, Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) and added to media at the concentrations required.</div>

<heading>2.1 Preparation of TF1 and TF2 coated DYNABEADS® Magnetic Beads</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0657">A volume of 100 μl DYNABEADS® Magnetic Beads (M-450 Rat Anti-Mouse IgM, Dynal Biotech ASA, Oslo, Norway) each was placed in 2 ml Safe-Lock Eppendorf tubes (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), washed twice with 2 ml phosphate buffered saline a (PBS-a: 8.1 g l<sup>−1 </sup>NaCl, 0.16 g l<sup>−1 </sup>NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.98 g l<sup>−1 </sup>Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O, 1 g l<sup>−1 </sup>BSA, pH 7.4) using the Dynal Magnetic Particle Concentrator—S (MPC®-S, Dynal Biotech, Oslo, Norway) and suspended in 25 μl of PBS-a. Lyophilised TF1 or TF2 cell culture supernatants were dissolved in 1 ml milli-Q synthesis grade water (Millipore, Billerica, Mass., USA). Dissolved TF1 or TF2 cell culture supernatants (1 ml) were added to the tubes with DYNABEADS® Magnetic Beads and incubated for 30 min at 4 C on a test tube rotator (model 34528, Snijders Scientific, Netherlands). Tubes were placed in the MPC®-S and left to stand for 3 min before removing the fluid with a pipette. The DYNABEADS® Magnetic Beads ere re-suspended in 2 ml PBS-a, placed in the MPC®-S and the fluid removed by pipetting. This washing step was performed three times. Washed DYNABEADS® Magnetic Beads were suspended in their original volume of 100 μl PBS-a. DYNABEADS® Magnetic Beads prepared in this manner were either used immediately or within two weeks of preparation after a repeated three-fold wash step with 2 ml PBS-a.</div>
<heading>2.2 Collection and Processing of Faecal Samples for DYNABEADS® Magnetic Beads Enrichment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0658">Faecal samples of eight volunteers (Table 3) were collected in perforated plastic tubes, maintained under anoxic conditions using an AnaeroGen Compact (Oxoid, Basingstoke, England) and stored at 4° C. for a maximum of 4 h before processing. Volunteers were healthy adults who had not taken antibiotics for at least 3 months prior to the sampling date and consumed their usual diets.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0679">3.3 Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0680">Some Core 1 positive isolates obtained with the repeated Dynabead® enrichment procedure appeared very similar in their cell and colony morphology, despite having being isolated from different media. The strains were also very similar with regard to their biochemical profiles obtained with the VITEK system. The question arose, whether the isolated bacteria are identical strains. RAPD is a method that does not require sequence information, which can be applied to distinguish strains. Briefly, total genomic DNA is PCR amplified with a 10 base pair primer at low stringency so that random sequences of DNA are amplified based on homologous sequences to the primer being present in the target DNA. The resulting PCR products can be separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and the resulting pattern can be compared between strains. The resulting band patterns for all LH strains were analogous for the five RAPD primers (OPL07, M13, OPX14, OPA16, OPA18) employed. The pattern clearly differs from that of <i>E. coli </i>strain DSMZ 8697 (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> <i>a</i>), a strain that has been reported to have blood group B activity. The MU strains also appear very similar (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> <i>b</i>); however their band pattern clearly differs from that of other <i>Bacteroides </i>strains, including AG6. It would appear that one Core 1 positive strain was repeatedly enriched from each positive donor during the isolation process. The strains isolated differed between individuals.</div>

<heading>Preparation of Core-1-Containing Components of Bacteria</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0699">10.1. Analysis of Crude Capsule Preparations by SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analyses</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0700">Crude capsule preparations of strain AG6 were performed according to Pantosti et al. (1991, Infect. Immun. 59, 2075-2082).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0701">Capsule preparation was analysed by SDS-PAGE and polysaccharide in the preparation were detected by alcian blue staining after Karlyshev et al. (2001, J. Clin. Microbiol. 39, 279-284) showing a variety of carbohydrate containing bands and high percentage of high molecular weight carbohydrates within the preparation (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>). After Western blot, polysaccharides were detected by the DIG-Glycan Detection Kit (LaRoche Diagnostics). Showing strong bands at 37 and 26 kDa. (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). Detection of core-1-containing polysaccharide on the western blot was performed using the core-1-specific antibody NEMOD-TF2 (culture supernatant) showing a core-1-positive band at 37 kDa (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0702">10.2. Chromatographic Enrichment of Core-1 Positive Polysaccharides</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0703">Within the capsule preparation of strain AG6 there were still contaminants of lipopolysaccharides as shown by the measurement or KDO content of 11.2 μmol/μg after Haraet al. 1989, Anal. Biochem. 179, 162-166) and by SDS-PAGE.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0704">Therefore capsule polysaccharides and lipopolysaccharides were separated by reversed phase chromatography on a C18 column using a propanol/methanol-gradient (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) according to Hashimoto et al. (2001, Eur. J. Biochem. 268, 3139-3144). Polysaccharides were eluted by a gradient of eluent B (72% propanol/8% methanol in 0.1M ammonium acetate pH 4.5). Detection of polysaccharides within the fractions was performed by dot blot and DIG-Glycan-Kit. Detection of core-1 was performed using the core-1 specific antibodies Nemod-TF1 and Nemod-TF2. Polysaccharides were eluted at propanol concentrations of 14-19% and 25-43%. Core-1 specific carbohydrate were only detected at 29-29.4% propanol (RP1) and 39-42% propanol (RP2), see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> showing strong enrichment of core-1 positive polysaccharide by this method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0705">Core-1 positive fractions were used for additional chromatographic separations by mild acid hydrolysis followed by DEAE-chromatography using a 0-0.5M NaCl gradient according to Tzianabos et al. (1992, J. Biol. Chem. 267, 18230-18235). By this method the Core-1-positive polysaccharides were separated into three fractions eluted at 0 M NaCl (D1), 0.04 M NaCl (D2) and 0.9-0.17 M NaCl (D3), resulting in a further enrichment of core-1-positive polysaccharides.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0706">In the process according to the instant invention, capsular polysaccharides of <i>B. ovatus </i>AG6 are purified and the structure is analysed by mass spectrometry. Preferable, the capsular polysaccharide of <i>B. ovatus </i>AG6 are accumulated by the phenol water extraction followed by ether extraction as already described by Pantosti et al. 1991. Thereafter, the core-1-positive polysaccharide is accumulated from rough capsular preparation (CPS) by reverse phase chromatography (C18 Synergi 4□ Fusion-RP 80i, 250 mm×10 mm, Phenomenex). The monosaccharide contents of rough capsular polysaccharide extract and purified core-1-positive polysaccharide are determined by HPAEC-PAD analyses (high pH anion exchange chromatography, pulsed amperometric detection). Finally the structure of the core-1-positive capsular polysaccharide is analysed by mass spectrometry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0707">10.3 Monosaccharide Analyses of Rough Capsular Preparation Extract and Purified Capsular Extract of <i>B. ovatus </i>AG6</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0708">In the first step, the core-1-positive polysaccharide of the rough capsular preparation of <i>B. ovatus </i>AG6 was accumulated by reverse phase chromatography as already described before. Thereafter, the yield of purification as well as the monosaccharide content of accumulated core-1-positive polysaccharide was determined by HPAEC-PAD analyses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0709">Before monosaccharide analyses occurred, polysaccharide extracts was completely hydrolysed by 2 N trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) at 100° C. for 4 h. During the TFA hydrolyses the acetyl groups were lost. Therefore the monosaccharides glucosamin and galactosamin (GlcNH<sub>2 </sub>and GalNH<sub>2</sub>) could not distinguish from N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylgalactosamin (GlcNAc and GalNAc). Monosaccharides were separated by high pH anion exchange chromatography and detected by pulsed amperometry as already described before. To identify the monosaccharides and to determine their concentrations, external and internal monosaccharide standards were used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0710">The proportional monosaccharide content of rough CPS extract, which was determined for LPS and CPS comparison (mentioned before), obviously vary from the proportional monosaccharide content of rough CPS extract determined for this comparison. Both rough CPS extracts were prepared from different cultures of <i>B. ovatus </i>AG6, which might be an explication for the mentioned variety of monosaccharide contents.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0711">The yield of core-1-positive polysaccharides accumulated by reverse phase chromatography was 30%. Comparision of proportional monosaccharide contents of rough and purified capsular extracts revealed an increased amount of fucose, GalNAc/GalNH2, galactose and glucose, whereas glucose might be a contamination (table 7). The proportional content of rhamnose, GlcNH2/GlcNAc and mannose could be reduced by reverse phase chromatography (table 7). Galacturonic acid and glucuronic acid, which are characteristic components of capsular polysaccharides, could not be identified in the purified core-1-positive polysaccharide extract. These might indicate, that <i>B. ovatus </i>AG6 have more than one capsular polysaccharide. Both capsular polysaccharides might be separated from each other by reverse phase chromatography. Tzianabos et al. (1992) also described, that the capsule of <i>B. fragilis </i>consists of two different polysaccharides.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0720">Mass spectrometric analyses of enzymatically digested core-1-positive polysaccharides gave indications of glycosidic bounds between the monosaccharides. Furthermore galactose (successful cleavage by beta1-3 galactosidase) and fucose (successful cleavage by alpha1-3,4 fucosidase) could be identified (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0721">This result is in accordance with the monosaccharide analyses mentioned before, which revealed an accumulation of fucose, galactose and GalNAc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0722">10.5 Verification of Core-1-Structure as Branching Disaccharide of Repeating Unit of Capsular Polysaccharide</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0723">The branching core-1-structure, Galbeta1-3GalNAc, in the repeating unit should be identified by double digestion with the exoglycosidases beta1-3 galactosidase and HexNAcase (beta1-2,3,4,6 GalNAc/GlcNAc cleavage) followed by monosaccharide analyses as described above. Two samples containing equal amounts of core-1-positive polysaccharide were filtrated to purify them from free monosaccharides. Afterwards one of both samples was digested with beta1-3 galactosidase at 37° C. overnight. Both samples were filtrated once again to separate free galactose from the digested sample, whereas the undigested sample were used as negative control. Subsequently, the retentats were collected and digested with HexNAcase. Finally both samples were filtrated again. All eluates were analysed by HPAEC-PAD.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0724">To control, if the core-1-structure was removed by double digestion but was untouched by HexNAcase digestion (negative control), the retentates were analysed by dot-blot using the DIG-Glykan Detection Kit (Roche Diagnostics) to detect polysaccharides and the core-1-specific antibody Nemod-TF1 to identify the core-1-structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0725">In both eluates of double digested sample galactose (first eluat) and GalNAc (second eluat) could by identified by monosaccharide analyses. While in the eluat of negative control, which was only digested with the exoglycosidase HexNAcase, neither galactose nor GalNAc could be identified. This is a strong indication for the branching core-1-structure, Galbeta1-3GalNAc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0726">Dot-Blot analyses of double digested retentat and HexNAcase digested sample using the DIG-Glykan detection Kit revealed similar polysaccharide concentrations, which was applied on the nitrocellulose membrane. The core-1-structure could not detected in the double digested sample any more, whereas in the HexNAcase digested sample the core-1-structure was still identified by immunoblot using Nemod-TF1 antibody.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0727">10.6 Verification of the Core-1-Positive Polysaccharide Structure by Analyses of its Separated Fragments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0728">For further verification of core-1-positive polysaccharide structure, the glykan was fragmentated by hydrolysis with 1% acidic acid (1.5 h, 100° C.). The glycan fragments were labeled by the fluorophore 2-amino benzamide (2-AB) as already described by J. C. Bigge et al. (1995). For this procedure, samples were rendered particle-free and salt-free by purification at Carbograph SPE column (Alltech Associates Inc.) and lyophilized. The pellet was dissolved in 5 μl 2-AB in DMSO/glacial acetic acid/sodium cyanoborohydride and incubated at 60° C. for 2 h. The 2-AB labeled fragments were separated from free 2-AB by paper chromatography. Finally 2-AB conjugated fragments were eluted by water. After lyophilization the pellet was dissolved in 50% acetonitril. Based on their size, fragments were separated by normal phase HPLC (column: Luna 3μ NH2 A100, Phenomenex, eluent A: 15 mM NH4-acetat, eluent B: acetonitril) with fluorescence detection. The sequence of fragments was analysed by ESI mass spectrometry. Finally, for verification of glycosidic bonds and better identification of monosaccharides being components of the fragments, the oligosaccharides were digested with the exoglykosidase beta1-3 galactosidase, alpha1-3, 4 fucosidase and HexNAcase as already described before. The success of digestion was controlled by ESI mass spectrometry and the removal of terminal monosaccharides was identified by HPAEC-PAD as already described before.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0729">The already identified structure of repeating units of core-1-positive polysaccharide was confirmed by both analyses getting the expected oligosaccharide fragments and cleaved monosaccharides (table 9).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0731">In conclusion, the structure of repeating units of core-1-positive capsular polysaccharide (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) was confirmed by a variety of analyses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0732">Furthermore, the results revealed (please also see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, in particular #5), that the glycosidic linkage between the Gal-GalNAc and the backbone GalNAc molecule is alpha-anomeric. This finding was supported by dot blot analyses with mAbs TF1, TF2 and HH8, which are specific for the alpha anomer of TF. The mAbs A68-E/A2 and A68-E/E3 which are specific for TFbeta were also used. Thereby, the tumour-specific Ag TFalpha was identified within the branching structure of capsular polysaccharide of <i>B. ovatus </i>AG6.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0772">Dendritic cell line NemodDC (pNM-DC) has been used as source for antigen presenting cells (APC). The pNM-DCs were differentiated into iNM-DC, followed by loading with bacterial lysates (BaLy) of following bacteria strains: AG6, MU1, 52 and 53. 50 μg/ml of every BaLy was added together with maturation cytokines to the culture media and iNM-DC were differentiated to their mature status (mNM-DC).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0773">More detailed, in the first step pNM-DC (1×10<sup>5</sup>/ml) were differentiated into iNM-DC by 7 days incubation in NemodDC medium (70% MEM-alpha, 20% FCS, 10% CM5637) with addition of 1000 U/mI of GM-CSF, 100 U/ml IL-4 and 2.5 ng/ml TNF-alpha{tilde over (,)} Next, 1×10<sup>6</sup>/ml of immature NM-DC (iNM-DC) were loaded either with bacteria lysates (50 μg/ml), tumor cell lysates (1×10<sup>6 </sup>lysed tumor cells for loading on 1×10<sup>6 </sup>NM-DC) or AGP- and GP-proteins (20 μg/ml) and maturated for 2 days by addition of 75 ng/ml TNF-alphã.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0774">The maturation phenotype of mNM-DC is very important for successful T-cell activation and was tested by means of flow cytometry for expression of CD1a, CD11c, CD14, CD40, CD35, CD80, CD83, CD86, CD116, HLA-ABC and HLA-DR. Only those DC which had phenotype correspondent to the phenotype of mature DCs were used for T-cell activation.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0776">After 7-10 days of priming of T lymphocytes with NM-DC loaded with Core-1-positive bacterial lysates, resulting T cells (0.7-1×10<sup>6</sup>/ml) were restimulated with mNM-DC (1×10<sup>5</sup>/ml) loaded with Core1-positive tumor cell lysates (50 μg/ml). Following 48 hours of incubation supernatants were harvested and assayed using for evaluation of the cytokine production in response to human Core-1-positive tumor cell line NM-D4 the GM-CSF- and TNF-alpha-BD OptEIA™ Kits.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0777">The 96-well plates were pre-coated with 50 μl of appropriate capture anti-human (GM-CSF or TNF-alpha) antibodies diluted 1:250 in coating buffer. After washing and blocking steps, 100 μl of supernatants or standards were added to microwells and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. For standard curve the recombinant human GM-CSF in concentrations 0; 7.8; 15.6; 31.2; 62.5; 125; 250 pg/ml and the recombinant human TNF-alpha in concentrations 0; 4.7; 9.4; 18.8; 37.5; 75; 150; 300 pg/ml were used. After washing, 100 μl prepared Working Detector solution per well were added, and plate was incubated 1 hour at room temperature. In the next step 100 μl TMB One-Step Substrate Reagent were added per well. After final incubation for 30 minutes and addition of 50 μl of Stop Solution the extensions were read at 450 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0778">The results demonstrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A</figref> and B show clear evidence that T cells generated to Core1-positive bacteria lysates are able to recognise DC loaded with Core1-positive cell-lysate from human cell line NM-D4 by production of tumor-inhibitory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and GM-CSF. In contrast, very low level of cytokines was released in response to Core1-negative cell lysates.

This assay allows the quantification of functional ability of the pre-sensitised T cells to recognise Core1 antigens in an antigen specific manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0781">The T lymphocytes were first activated in vitro by being co-cultured with DC loaded with bacterial lysates. After 7 to 10 days of priming, activated T cells were harvested and re-challenged with DC (in ratio T cell to DC 10:1) loaded with Core1-positive (NM-D4) and Core1-negative (NM-wt) human tumor cell lysates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0782">The wells of the ELISpot plate were pre-coated with mouse-anti-human-IFN-gamma-antibody (Mabtech-Kit) that binds to the nitrocellulose base of the ELISpot plate. The re-challenged T cells were transferred into the wells, and cytokines are released during the incubation period. IFN-gamma that is released locally around each T cell binds to, and is therefore ‘captured’ by the specific antibody. After 24 hours of incubation the cells were removed. A second anti-human-IFN-gamma antibody in concentration 1 μg/ml is added to the wells; this biotinylated antibody is coupled to an enzyme that is capable of converting a substrate into an insoluble coloured product. The plates are washed once more, and streptavidin conjugated with enzyme-AP in a concentration of 1 μg/ml is added. Finally a precipitating substrate BCIP+NBT is added and the plate is incubated until spots emerge at the side of the responding T cells. The coloured spots are counted and analysed using a digital-imaging system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0783">The results showed that T cells generated to Core1-positive bacterial lysates (AG6 and MU1) are able to recognise DC loaded with Core1-positive cell-lysate from human tumor cell line NM-D4 by production of tumor-inhibitory cytokine IFN-gamma (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>). Very low level of cytokines was released in response to Core1-negative cell lysates (R+DC/wt). Furthermore, the specificity of recognition of Core1-positive cell-lysate (R+DC/D4) was proved by blocking of cytokine release with the Core-1 specific antibody Nemod-TF1 (R+DC/D4+Ak).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0785">The sensitised and re-stimulated T cells as described above for ELISpot analysis, were transferred after incubation from ELISpot plate into 96-well plate and were assayed using the colorimetric Cell Proliferation Reagent WST-1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), whose tetrazolium salt is cleaved by mitochondrial enzymes so that the amount of dye developed (read at 450 nm) directly correlates to the number of metabolically active cells in the culture. Absorbance of culture medium plus wst-1 in the absence of cells was the blank position for the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. The procedure consists of one-step-adding of 10 μl per well of WST-Proliferation reagent (Roche) and incubation for 3 hours at 37° C. following measurement at 450 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0786">The results demonstrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, show clear evidence that T cells generated to Core1-positive bacteria lysates, recognise DC loaded with Core1-positive cell-lysate from human tumor cell line NM-D4 as shown by specific proliferation.
