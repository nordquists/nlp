<heading id="h-0002">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure is directed generally to hydrogen-producing assemblies, fuel cell systems including the same, methods of producing hydrogen gas, and methods of powering an energy-consuming device, and more particularly to hydrogen-producing assemblies that include a conductive monolithic body that defines at least a burner conduit and a reforming conduit in a conductive heat exchange relationship with the burner conduit within the monolithic body, fuel cell systems including the same, methods of producing hydrogen gas using the same, and methods of powering an energy-consuming device using the same and a fuel cell stack.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Hydrogen-producing fuel processing systems, or assemblies, include a series of devices or components that produce hydrogen gas as a primary reaction product from one or more reactants, or feedstocks. The fuel processing system includes a fuel processing assembly with a hydrogen-producing region that is adapted to convert the one or more feedstocks into a product stream containing hydrogen gas as a majority component. In operation, the hydrogen-producing region is typically operated at an elevated temperature and pressure and contains a suitable catalyst to produce at least hydrogen gas from the feedstock(s) delivered thereto. The produced hydrogen gas may be used in a variety of applications. One such application is energy production, such as by electrochemical fuel cells. An electrochemical fuel cell is a device that converts a fuel and an oxidant to electricity, a reaction product, and heat. For example, fuel cells may convert hydrogen and oxygen gases into water and electricity. In such fuel cells, the hydrogen gas is the fuel, the oxygen gas is the oxidant, and the water is the reaction product. Fuel cells are typically coupled together to form a fuel cell stack.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Hydrogen-producing fuel processing assemblies and systems typically include a series of interconnected functional components that collectively produce hydrogen gas from one or more reactants, or feedstocks. These components include at least one reactor, hydrogen-producing region, or reforming region, in which hydrogen gas is produced by chemical reaction of the feedstock(s), which may be delivered to the hydrogen-producing region in one or more feed streams by a pump or other suitable feedstock delivery system. When a feedstock is a liquid feedstock at ambient conditions, the functional components may include a vaporizer, or vaporization region. A heating assembly, such as a burner, may consume a fuel to produce a combustion exhaust stream that may be used to heat at least the vaporization region, such as at least to a suitable temperature to vaporize the liquid feedstock. When the hydrogen-producing region utilizes an endothermic reaction, such as a steam reforming reaction, it may be thought of as a reforming region and the combustion exhaust stream may be utilized to heat the reforming region to at least a minimum hydrogen-producing temperature. The reformate stream produced by the reforming region may be delivered to a fuel cell stack, and optionally may first be delivered to a separation assembly to increase the hydrogen purity of the stream that is delivered to the fuel cell stack.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Typically, the components of the fuel processing assembly and/or fuel processing system are discrete components that include individual shells or housings and which are interconnected by tubing or similar fluid conduits, fittings, and the like. The entire fuel processing system may be enclosed in a system enclosure or system housing, but the individual components typically are positioned in a spaced-apart relationship within the housing, with the housing defining an open chamber, or cavity, within which the individual components are positioned. The separate structures of these components, and the fluid conduits used to seal and interconnect these components, contribute to the number of parts, potential leak points, assembly time, and manufacturing expense of the fuel processing system. Also, the spatially separated orientation of conventional fuel processing assemblies increases the thermal management needs of the fuel processing system. These needs may be exacerbated by the conventional use of steel alloy housings for components of at least the fuel processing assembly, such as at least the vaporization region and reforming or other hydrogen-producing region thereof. Due to the low thermal conductivity of steel alloys, the surface area of the housing often has to be largely enhanced (e.g., through finned tubes or plate heat exchangers) or a high heat transfer rate has to be imposed on these components (e.g., through direct flame impingement), which may result in increased design cost or lower reliability, respectively.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Hydrogen-producing assemblies, fuel processing systems, and fuel cell systems according to the present disclosure are designed to efficiently utilize heat generated by a heating source in the production of hydrogen gas. Accordingly, hydrogen-producing assemblies according to the present disclosure include a monolithic body that defines at least a reforming conduit, in which a feed stream is catalyzed into a reformate gas stream containing hydrogen gas as a primary component, and a burner conduit, in which a fuel-air stream is combusted. The monolithic body is constructed to conduct heat generated by the exothermic combustion reaction within the burner conduit to the reforming conduit, which is positioned in a conductive heat exchange relationship, or position, within the monolithic body relative to the burner conduit. In some hydrogen-producing assemblies according to the present disclosure, the monolithic body further defines a vaporizing conduit, in which liquid portions of the feed stream are vaporized prior to being delivered to the reforming conduit. In such embodiments, the monolithic body is constructed to conduct heat from the burner conduit to the vaporizing conduit. In some embodiments, the reforming conduit defines both a reforming region and a vaporizing region, and a separate vaporizing conduit is not necessary (although still may be provided in some embodiments). In such embodiments, the reforming conduit may additionally or alternatively be referred to as a combined vaporizing/reforming conduit. In some hydrogen-producing assemblies according to the present disclosure, the burner conduit extends along a central longitudinal axis of the monolithic body, and one or more reforming conduits, vaporizing conduits (when present), and/or the combined vaporizing/reforming conduits (when present) are spaced radially from the burner conduit in a concentric pattern through the monolithic body.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Methods of producing hydrogen gas using hydrogen-producing assemblies according to the present disclosure, and methods of powering an energy-consuming device using a hydrogen-producing assembly according to the present disclosure and a fuel cell stack are also disclosed.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION AND BEST MODE OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">Fuel processing systems according to the present disclosure are schematically illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and generally indicated at <b>10</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, fuel processing systems <b>10</b> are schematically illustrated together with an optional fuel cell stack <b>42</b>, which may be used to power an energy-consuming device, as discussed herein. Fuel processing systems <b>10</b> include a hydrogen-producing fuel processing assembly, or hydrogen-producing assembly, <b>12</b> and are adapted to produce a product hydrogen stream <b>14</b> containing hydrogen gas as a majority component, and in many embodiments at least substantially pure hydrogen gas, from one or more feed streams <b>16</b>. Feed stream <b>16</b> may be drawn or otherwise received from one or more sources, or supplies, <b>112</b> by feedstock delivery system <b>22</b> and thereafter delivered to hydrogen-producing assembly <b>12</b>. It is thus within the scope of the present disclosure that the one or more sources, or supplies, may be a portion of the feedstock delivery system or may be external sources or supplies with which the feedstock delivery system is in fluid communication to receive the feed stream(s), or components thereof, from the one or more sources or supplies.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">Although much of the following discussion of feed streams will refer to liquid feed streams, or at least feed streams that are liquid at ambient conditions, it is within the scope of the present disclosure that feed stream <b>16</b> may be a liquid feed stream when drawn or otherwise received from a suitable source, a gaseous feed stream, or a feed stream that includes liquid and gaseous components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">Feed stream <b>16</b> includes at least one feedstock <b>18</b> and may include water <b>17</b>. Illustrative, non-exclusive examples of feedstocks according to the present disclosure may include any feedstock that includes hydrogen, such as a carbon-containing feedstock, a hydrogen-containing feedstock, and/or water. Illustrative, non-exclusive examples of suitable liquid feedstocks <b>18</b> include at least one carbon-containing feedstock such as a hydrocarbon or an alcohol that is liquid at ambient conditions, such as 25° C. and 1 atm. Illustrative, non-exclusive examples of suitable liquid hydrocarbons include diesel, kerosene, gasoline, synthetic liquid fuels, and the like. Additional illustrative, non-exclusive examples of suitable liquid hydrocarbons include oxygenated hydrocarbons, such as acetone, acetic acid, formate, and dimethyl carbonate. Illustrative, non-exclusive examples of gaseous feedstock <b>18</b> include carbon-containing feedstocks such as methane, butane, propane, and natural gas and hydrogen-containing feedstocks such as ammonia. Illustrative, non-exclusive examples of suitable alcohols include methanol, ethanol, and polyols, such as ethylene glycol and propylene glycol. While a single feed stream <b>16</b> is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it is within the scope of the disclosure that more than one stream <b>16</b> may be used and that these streams may contain the same or different feedstocks. When feed stream <b>16</b> contains two or more components, such as a feedstock and water, the components may be delivered in the same or different feed streams.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, feedstock delivery system <b>22</b> may be adapted to draw or otherwise receive at least a liquid feedstock from a supply, or source, <b>112</b> and to deliver a feed stream <b>16</b> containing at least the feedstock for use in at least the hydrogen-producing region of the fuel processing system's hydrogen-producing assembly <b>12</b>. Supply <b>112</b> may include any suitable type and/or number of reservoirs and/or other sources from which one or more feedstocks for the feed stream may be drawn or otherwise received. Illustrative, non-exclusive examples of suitable supplies <b>112</b> include tanks, canisters, and other fluid vessels, which may be pressurized or unpressurized. Feedstock delivery system <b>22</b> may utilize any suitable delivery mechanism, such as a positive displacement or other suitable pump or mechanism for propelling and pressurizing the feed streams. When one or more pumps are used, the number, type and capacity of the pumps may vary, such as with respect to the desired flow rate of liquid to be pumped thereby, the desired pressure to be provided to the liquid, the composition of the liquid, whether or not the flow rate is intended to be selectively varied, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">When the fuel processing assembly is configured to receive water and a feedstock as reactants to produce hydrogen gas and when the feedstock is miscible with water, the feedstock may be, but is not required to be, delivered to the fuel processing assembly in the same feed stream as the water component of feed stream <b>16</b>, such as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> by reference numerals <b>17</b> and <b>18</b> pointing to the same feed stream <b>16</b>. For example, when the fuel processing assembly receives a feed stream containing water and a water-soluble alcohol, such as methanol, these components may be premixed and delivered as a single feed stream. As an illustrative, non-exclusive example, a reforming feed stream may contain approximately 25-75 vol % methanol or ethanol or another suitable water-miscible feedstock, and approximately 25-75 vol % water. For feed streams formed (at least substantially) of methanol and water, the streams will typically contain approximately 50-75 vol % methanol and approximately 25-50 vol % water. Feed streams <b>16</b> containing ethanol or other water-miscible alcohols will typically contain approximately 25-60 vol % alcohol and approximately 40-75 vol % water. For hydrogen-generating assemblies that utilize steam reforming or autothermal reforming reactions to produce hydrogen gas, an illustrative, non-exclusive example of a feed stream contains 69 vol % methanol and 31 vol % water, although other compositions and liquid feedstocks may be used without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. It is within the scope of the present disclosure that such a feed stream that contains both water and at least one feedstock may be used as the feed stream for hydrogen-producing region <b>19</b> and as a combustible fuel stream for a burner or other heating assembly (when present) that is adapted to heat at least the hydrogen-producing region of the fuel processing system, such as to a suitable hydrogen-producing temperature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">Hydrogen-producing assembly <b>12</b> includes a hydrogen-producing region <b>19</b>, in which an output, or reaction product, stream <b>20</b> containing hydrogen gas is produced by utilizing any suitable hydrogen-producing mechanism(s) to chemically react the feedstock(s) from the feed stream(s). Output stream <b>20</b> includes hydrogen gas as at least a majority component and may additionally or alternatively be referred to as a reformate stream, or reformate gas stream, <b>20</b>. Output stream <b>20</b> may include one or more additional gaseous components, and thereby may be referred to as a mixed gas stream, which contains hydrogen gas as its majority component, and which also contains other gases. The other gases that are typically present in the reformate stream include carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, steam, and/or unreacted feedstock.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">An illustrative, non-exclusive example of a suitable mechanism for producing hydrogen gas in hydrogen-producing region <b>19</b> from feed stream(s) <b>16</b> delivered by feedstock delivery system <b>22</b> is steam reforming, in which a reforming catalyst is used to produce hydrogen gas from at least one feed stream <b>16</b> containing a feedstock <b>18</b> and water <b>17</b>. In a steam reforming process, hydrogen-producing region <b>19</b> contains a suitable steam reforming catalyst <b>23</b>, as indicated in dashed lines in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In such an embodiment, in which a steam reforming catalyst is utilized, the fuel processing assembly may be referred to as a steam reformer, hydrogen-producing region <b>19</b> may be referred to as a reforming region, and output, or mixed gas, stream <b>20</b> may be referred to as a reformate gas stream. As used herein, reforming region <b>19</b> refers to any hydrogen-producing region utilizing a hydrogen-producing mechanism, or reaction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">The selection of steam reforming catalyst may affect the operation, or operating, conditions of the hydrogen-producing region, as well as the temperature of the hydrogen-producing assembly. Any suitable type of catalyst may be applied to the reforming reactions, including such illustrative, non-exclusive examples as monolith, pellets, extrudates, spheres, meshes, fibers, mat, and (wall) wash coats. Illustrative, non-exclusive examples of suitable steam reforming catalysts are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,128,769, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">Another illustrative, non-exclusive example of a suitable hydrogen-producing reaction that may be utilized in hydrogen-producing region <b>19</b> is autothermal reforming, in which a suitable autothermal reforming catalyst is used to produce hydrogen gas from water and a feedstock in the presence of air. When autothermal reforming is used, the fuel processing assembly further includes an air delivery assembly <b>67</b> that is adapted to deliver an air stream to the hydrogen-producing region, as indicated in dashed lines in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Autothermal hydrogen-producing reactions utilize a primary endothermic reaction that is utilized in conjunction with an exothermic partial oxidation reaction, which generates heat within the hydrogen-producing region upon initiation of the initial hydrogen-producing reaction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">Yet another illustrative, non-exclusive example of a suitable hydrogen-producing reaction that may be utilized in hydrogen-producing region <b>19</b> is ammonia thermal decomposition, in which a mixed gas stream including hydrogen gas and nitrogen gas is formed from a feed stream that includes ammonia. Illustrative, non-exclusive examples of ammonia thermal decomposition catalysts according to the present disclosure include ammonia synthesis catalysts and catalysts including transition metals from Group VIII of the Periodic Table.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">An additional illustrative, non-exclusive example of a suitable hydrogen-producing reaction that may be utilized in hydrogen-producing region <b>19</b> is the steam pre-reforming of higher hydrocarbons. Higher hydrocarbons are defined as those containing at least two carbon atoms in a molecule, such as ethane, propane, butane, etc. The purpose of steam pre-reforming is to break down the carbon-to-carbon chain within the molecules at lower temperature to avoid the coke formation that may occur at traditional methane steam reforming temperatures. The products of steam pre-reforming are methane, hydrogen, and carbon oxides. Illustrative, non-exclusive examples of steam pre-reforming catalysts according to the present disclosure include nickel (Ni), ruthenium (Ru), and/or rhodium (Rh)-based catalysts.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">It is also within the scope of the present disclosure that hydrogen-producing region <b>19</b> may include a plurality of zones, or portions, and that each of the plurality of zones may be operated under similar operating conditions, such as at the same temperature. Alternatively, at least a portion of the plurality of zones may be operated under different operating conditions, such as at one or more different temperatures. As an illustrative, non-exclusive example, when the feedstock is, or includes, a hydrocarbon, it may be desirable to include two different hydrogen-producing zones, with one zone operating at a lower temperature than the other zone to provide a pre-reforming region. In such an embodiment, the fuel processing system alternatively may be described as including a plurality of hydrogen-producing regions. It is within the scope of the present disclosure that the mechanisms utilized by these hydrogen-producing regions to produce hydrogen gas may be the same. However, it is also within the scope of the present disclosure that the mechanisms utilized by these hydrogen-producing regions to produce hydrogen gas may be different. For example, and as discussed herein, a hydrogen-producing region that utilizes an autothermal reaction to produce hydrogen gas may be followed by a hydrogen-producing region that utilizes a steam reforming reaction to produce hydrogen gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">At least the hydrogen-producing region <b>19</b> of hydrogen-producing assembly <b>12</b> is designed to be operated at an elevated temperature when being utilized to produce hydrogen gas. This hydrogen-producing temperature may be achieved and/or maintained in hydrogen-producing region <b>19</b> through the use of a heating assembly <b>60</b> or other suitable heat source. Hydrogen-producing steam reformers typically operate at temperatures in the range of 200-900° C. Temperatures outside of this range are within the scope of the disclosure. When the feedstock is methanol, the steam reforming reaction will typically operate in a temperature range of approximately 200-500° C.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">For a fuel processing assembly utilizing methanol and water as feedstocks, an illustrative, non-exclusive method for starting up the fuel processing system is to utilize electric heating (e.g., with a band heater or other suitable resistive heater) and a catalytic combustion catalyst section within the burner chamber. That is, in some embodiments, a hydrogen-producing assembly may include a combustion catalyst <b>202</b> disposed within the burner to define an ignition zone <b>208</b>. When the device reaches a suitable operating (or hydrogen-producing) temperature for the methanol reforming catalyst and above the light-off temperature of at least one combustible component of the burner fuel, methanol/water may be delivered to the burner. Once the burner fuel and air reach the combustion catalyst <b>202</b>, the burner lights off automatically, assuming a suitable light-off temperature and pressure of the fuel and air and/or a suitable light-off temperature of the combustion catalyst. In addition, as long as the combustion catalyst remains above the light-off temperature of the burner fuel, no other ignition-proving mechanism may be needed, such as according to Sections 1.10 and 1.11 of ANSI/CSA America FC 1-2004).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">Another factor to consider in connection with the burner is the placement of the combustion catalyst. Typical flame temperatures of at least 800° C. and less than 1600° C. may be achieved in a porous, catalytic, or open burner. Conventional platinum and palladium or palladium oxide combustion catalysts with a promoter, such as cerium oxide and lanthanum oxide, are catalytically active above room temperature for platinum, and above approximately 250° C. for palladium and palladium oxide, with these temperatures being referred to as the corresponding light-off temperatures for a hydrogen-rich reformate fuel in the presence of these catalysts. Conventional combustion catalysts typically are unstable above 900-1000° C. and thus need to be protected thermally and/or protected by staged air or staged fuel introduction with heat exchange between each stage to avoid overheating the combustion catalyst.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">As schematically indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> at <b>204</b>, it is within the scope of the present disclosure that a burner, when present in the heat transfer body <b>140</b> and/or monolithic body <b>143</b>, may include a selection of a suitable fuel-air mixing structure that is positioned within a burner chamber, or conduit, of the burner. Such a fuel-air mixing structure may permit ignition of the fuel and air mixture within the ignition zone and allow the combustion thereof to propagate back toward the inlet where air and fuel are first introduced into the burner and subsequently mixed by the fuel-air mixing structure. In this manner, the combustion may be transient within the burner and the combustion may propagate to a combustion region <b>206</b> of the burner, which may (but is not required to) be back toward the inlet of the burner. The combustion is then supported within the combustion region by the fuel-air mixing structure. As used herein, the “combustion region” of a burner refers to a region within the burner in which combustion is maintained during steady state, and may (but is not required to) coincide with at least a portion of the fuel-air mixing structure, when present. That is, while ignition of the fuel and air mixture may occur in an ignition zone separate from the combustion region and combustion may propagate from the ignition zone to the combustion region, the combustion region defines the portion of the burner in which combustion is maintained after initial ignition of the fuel and air mixture. In some embodiments, the combustion region fills the entire burner chamber, or conduit, while in other embodiments, the combustion region is a subregion of the burner chamber, or conduit. In some embodiments, the combustion region is generally adjacent the inlet to the burner chamber, or conduit. In some embodiments, the combustion region is spaced apart from, such as spaced above, the inlet to the burner chamber. In some embodiments, the combustion region extends for less than one half of the length of the burner conduit. Other configurations are also within the scope of the present disclosure. In some embodiments, the fuel-air mixing structure may be configured to support flameless combustion in the combustion region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">While combustion is maintained in the combustion region of the burner, and in some embodiments supported by a fuel-air mixing structure, heat is conducted through the heat transfer body and/or the monolithic body to the hydrogen-producing region and/or optional vaporization region of the hydrogen-producing assembly. Accordingly, the exhaust gases are cooled as they travel through the burner. Proper fuel and air management may maintain the exhaust gas temperature below a damage threshold of the combustion catalyst, for example, when the combustion catalyst is disposed at or adjacent the exit, or outlet, of the burner. Further optimization of the burner may permit efficient heat transfer from the combustion gases to the hydrogen-producing region and the optional vaporization region with the exit temperature of the gases just above the target equilibrium reforming temperature, an illustrative, non-exclusive example of which is 250-315° C. for a high thermal efficiency system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">Illustrative, non-exclusive examples of suitable fuel-air mixing structure that may be incorporated into a burner include (but are not limited to) one or more of porous foams, monolithic blocks, packed pellets, balls, pall rings, saddle rings, cross-partition rings, Raschig rings, Intalox saddles, cascade rings, Berl saddles, structured packing, screens or bundles of fine tubing or fiber, any of which may be made of metal and/or ceramic materials that are structurally stable at desired operating temperatures. In some embodiments, the fuel-air mixing structure may extend between the combustion catalyst and the combustion region. Additionally or alternatively, the fuel-air mixing structure may extend between the combustion catalyst and the burner inlet. Additionally or alternatively, the fuel-air mixing structure may extend from adjacent the burner, or exhaust, outlet to adjacent the burner, or fuel-air, inlet. Additionally or alternatively, the fuel-air mixing structure may extend adjacent the burner outlet and adjacent the burner inlet. Additionally or alternatively, the fuel-air mixing structure may be disposed in two or more spaced-apart regions of the burner. Additionally or alternatively, the fuel-air mixing structure may be disposed only in the combustion region of the burner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">In some embodiments, the combustion catalyst is disposed on a portion of the fuel-air mixing structure, when present, adjacent the burner, or exhaust, outlet. Additionally or alternatively, the combustion catalyst may be disposed only on a portion of the fuel-air mixing structure adjacent the burner, or exhaust, outlet. In some such embodiments, the portion of the fuel-air mixing structure on which the combustion catalyst is disposed may extend for less than one eighth or for less than one fourth of the length of the burner, the burner conduit, the burner chamber, the monolithic body, and/or the heat transfer body. Additionally or alternatively, the combustion catalyst may be disposed in spaced-apart regions of the burner. Additionally or alternatively, the combustion catalyst may be disposed on a wall of the burner chamber, or conduit, and not be disposed on the fuel-air mixing structure, even when present. Additionally or alternatively, the combustion catalyst may be disposed both on a wall of the burner chamber, or conduit, as well as on the fuel-air mixing structure. The distribution and positioning of the combustion catalyst may vary according to such factors as the combustion catalyst itself, the reforming temperatures being utilized, the thermal conductivity of the heat transfer body/combustion catalyst interface, and the desired heat flux at specific locations. Alternatively, the location, form, and/or composition of the catalyst may be optimized to reduce undesirable emissions to the environment. In some embodiments, the combustion catalyst may be positioned along the entire length of the burner, burner chamber, or burner conduit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">When utilizing a porous media as a fuel-air mixing structure, selection of too small a pore size may prevent the combustion from traveling toward the desired combustion region, thereby permitting undesirable long-term combustion of the mixture in the ignition zone. The result of a small pore configuration is thus likely to include one or more of poor thermal integration and heat transfer, excess thermal losses in the combustion exhaust, poor emissions due to incomplete combustion and residence time, and limited life of the combustion catalyst due to high temperatures without adequate heat transfer in the combustion catalyst zone.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">As schematically indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, hydrogen-producing assemblies <b>12</b> according to the present disclosure may include one or more screens, or other retaining structure, <b>104</b> positioned within or adjacent to the various conduits or regions defined by the heat transfer body <b>140</b>. When present, this structure may retain media positioned within the conduits, such as (but not limited to) reforming catalyst within the hydrogen-producing region, heat transfer material within the optional vaporization region, fuel-air mixing structure within the burner conduit, and/or combustion catalyst within the burner conduit.</div>

Vessel <b>150</b> may be formed from metallic and/or non-metallic materials and may define a gas-tight enclosure that includes one or more defined inlets and outlets <b>152</b> for fluids to enter and be removed from the vessel. For example, the vessel may include an exhaust port <b>154</b> through which at least combustion exhaust and/or any leaked gases may be removed from the vessel. The vessel may include insulation <b>156</b> within the vessel's walls and/or between the internal wall of the vessel and the exterior of the body. Vessel <b>150</b> may be pressurized or unpressurized. When pressurized, it may be pressurized to provide support to the body, such as by being pressurized to a pressure in the range of 0.01 to 2, 3, 5, or 10 times the pressure of the hydrogen-producing region. It is within the scope of the present disclosure that other pressures, including pressures that are below, within, or above these illustrative ranges, may be utilized without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.</div>

Reforming conduit <b>210</b> may be described as defining or including hydrogen-producing region <b>19</b> and burner conduit <b>212</b> may be described as defining or including burner <b>62</b> of hydrogen producing assembly <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">Monolithic body <b>143</b> may further define a feed inlet <b>214</b> to the reforming conduit for receiving a feed stream <b>16</b> into the reforming conduit, and a reformate outlet <b>216</b> from the reforming conduit for delivering the reformate gas stream <b>20</b> downstream of the hydrogen-producing region, with the associated flow illustrated in dashed lines in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">A reforming catalyst <b>23</b> is disposed within the reforming conduit and is configured to catalyze production of reformate gas stream <b>20</b> from feed stream <b>16</b> via an endothermic reaction within a reforming temperature range. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a fuel-air mixing structure <b>204</b> is shown disposed within the burner conduit and configured to support combustion of the fuel-air stream in a combustion region of the burner conduit, generally adjacent fuel-air inlet <b>218</b>. As discussed herein and as schematically illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, fuel-air mixing structure <b>204</b> may be disposed in various configurations within the burner conduit. For example, as illustrated in solid lines in the left optionally illustrated portion of the burner conduit, the fuel-air mixing structure may extend for a majority of the length of the burner conduit. Additionally or alternatively, as illustrated in solid lines in the right optionally illustrated portion of the burner conduit, the fuel-air mixing structure may extend only adjacent the exhaust outlet. Additionally or alternatively, as illustrated in dashed lines in the left optionally illustrated portion of the burner conduit, together with the solid lines, the fuel-air mixing structure may extend the entire length of the burner conduit, or from the fuel-air inlet to the exhaust outlet. Additionally or alternatively, as illustrated in dashed lines in the right optionally illustrated portion of the burner conduit, the fuel-air mixing structure may extend generally adjacent the fuel-air inlet.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">Beyond the air-fuel mixing zone, the burner chamber may include one or more passive mixing elements to enhance the convective heat transport from combustion exhaust to the endothermic region of the reforming region and/or vaporizing region. Illustrative, non-exclusive examples of suitable passive mixing elements include bluff bodies, turbulators, vanes, fans, blocks, and the like. When present, the mixing elements may be formed from oxidation-resistant materials or materials with oxidation-resistant coatings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">In the illustrative, non-exclusive example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, combustion catalyst <b>202</b> is disposed within the burner conduit and is configured to catalyze ignition of fuel-air stream <b>64</b> via an exothermic reaction. As discussed herein and as schematically illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, combustion catalyst <b>202</b> may be disposed in various configurations within burner conduit <b>218</b>. For example, as schematically indicated with a solid lead line, combustion catalyst <b>202</b> may be disposed on a burner conduit wall <b>222</b>, such as on a portion of the burner conduit wall generally adjacent the exhaust outlet. Additionally or alternatively, as schematically indicated with dashed lead lines, combustion catalyst <b>202</b> may be disposed on the entirety of the burner conduit wall and/or on a portion of, or all of, the fuel-air mixing structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">Accordingly, monolithic body <b>143</b> may be constructed to conduct heat generated by the exothermic reaction of the combustion of the fuel-air stream in a combustion region of the burner conduit from the burner conduit to the reforming conduit to maintain the reforming catalyst within the reforming temperature range.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">In some embodiments, as illustrated with solid lines in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a heat transfer body <b>140</b>, and/or a monolithic body thereof, may include a reforming conduit <b>210</b> and a burner conduit <b>212</b>, with delivery of fuel-air stream <b>64</b> to the burner conduit and delivery of feed stream <b>16</b> to the reforming conduit via a first end cap manifold, or end cap inlet manifold, <b>141</b>. The flow of the fuel-air stream and the feed stream may therefore be co-current, and the respective reformate gas stream and exhaust stream may exit the heat transfer body via a second end cap manifold, or end cap outlet manifold, <b>141</b>. Additionally or alternatively, a similarly configured heat transfer body may utilize counter-current fluid flow, in which the fuel-air stream enters and the reformate gas stream exits the monolithic body via a first end cap manifold, and in which the exhaust stream exits and the feed stream enters the monolithic body via a second end cap manifold. Additionally or alternatively, one or both of the reforming conduit and the burner conduit may include more than one portion that extends the length of the monolithic body, with the respective portions being fluidly coupled via an end cap manifold.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">As illustrated in dashed lines in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a heat transfer body <b>140</b> and/or a monolithic body <b>143</b> thereof may (but is not required to) further define a vaporizing conduit <b>224</b> that defines, or includes, a vaporization region <b>69</b>, and which extends through the monolithic body adjacent the burner conduit. In such an embodiment, the monolithic body further defines a vaporizer inlet <b>226</b> to the vaporizing conduit for receiving feed stream <b>16</b> into the vaporizing conduit, and a vaporizer outlet <b>228</b> for delivering the feed stream to the reforming conduit via an end cap manifold.

As illustrated, the heat transfer body includes a monolithic body <b>143</b> that may be formed by aluminum extrusion. Monolithic body <b>143</b> includes a center burner chamber, or conduit, <b>212</b> and four side chambers, or conduits, <b>144</b>. Accordingly, hydrogen-producing assembly <b>300</b> may be described as an example of a hydrogen-producing assembly having a monolithic body with a cross-section generally corresponding to that illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, albeit with differently shaped conduits <b>144</b>. The feedstock(s), which also may be referred to as reactant(s), is (are) introduced to one of the side chambers, as indicated by the feed stream <b>16</b>, which can serve as the vaporization region <b>69</b> for liquid components (such as a methanol water mixture) or as a preheat chamber for gas components. While not required to all embodiments, it is within the scope of the present disclosure that this chamber (and/or any other vaporization region <b>69</b>) may be filled with, or otherwise contain, particulate or other suitable thermally conductive matter to enhance heat transfer. Illustrative, non-exclusive examples of suitable thermally conductive matter include wire cuts, pellets, extrudates, and beads. This optional thermally conductive matter is schematically illustrated at <b>169</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref> and <b>13</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">When present in such a chamber or other vaporization region, this thermally conductive matter may be formed from any suitable thermally conductive metal or other material, and it is within the scope of the present disclosure that the thermally conductive matter may be formed from the same material as heat transfer body <b>140</b> and/or monolithic body <b>143</b>. Illustrative, non-exclusive examples of suitable materials include aluminum, stainless steel, and ceramics. The thermally conductive matter should permit fluid flow through the chamber or other vaporization region, while also increasing heat transfer in this chamber or vaporization region. The particulate or other matter may act as nucleation sites for inducing smooth boiling of the feedstock(s) within the chamber and/or suppress local overheating and uncontrolled (explosive, violent, or unstable) boiling and vaporization. This may result in less, or reduced, pressure fluctuations within the chamber (or vaporization region), compared to if such thermally conductive matter was not present therein.</div>

A reformate gas stream is produced and exits the hydrogen-producing assembly, as indicated at <b>20</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">The center chamber receives a fuel-air stream <b>64</b> and serves as the burner <b>62</b> that supplies the heat essential for vaporization and the endothermic hydrogen-producing reaction. An exhaust stream <b>66</b> exits the heat transfer body and may be vented to the ambient environment or alternatively be used in other aspects of fuel processing systems, fuel cell systems, and the like, for example, to heat components thereof. In this embodiment, gas combustibles are ideal candidates for the burner fuel, although burner <b>62</b> may additionally or alternatively utilize liquid combustibles as its fuel. Specifically, in a fuel processing system, an ideal fuel is the byproduct stream from a hydrogen purification unit or other separation assembly and/or the anode exhaust gas from a reformate-tolerant PEM fuel cell stack. The center burner conduit may be filled with a fuel-air mixing structure, as discussed herein, to enhance fuel and air mixing and heat transfer to the body. Alternatively, the center burner conduit may be partially or completely empty, such as when additional heat transfer and/or fuel/air mixing is not required and/or when it is desirable to reduce pressure drop within the burner.</div>

However, hydrogen-producing assembly <b>600</b> includes four combined vaporizing/reforming conduits <b>70</b> spaced around a central burner conduit <b>212</b>. The flow of the fuel-air stream <b>64</b> through the burner conduit and the feed stream <b>16</b> and reformate stream <b>20</b> through the combined vaporizing/reforming conduits <b>70</b> are co-current. That is, the feed stream and the air-fuel stream are delivered to the respective conduits of the monolithic body via an end cap inlet manifold <b>141</b>, and the reformate stream <b>20</b> and the exhaust stream <b>66</b> exit their respective conduits of the monolithic body via an end cap outlet manifold <b>141</b>.

Furthermore, as discussed, it is within the scope of the present disclosure that a screen <b>710</b> may be position at or above the inlet to the burner conduit to retain the combustion catalyst and/or the fuel-air mixing structure therein.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">Another illustrative, non-exclusive example of a hydrogen-producing assembly <b>12</b> with a heat transfer body <b>140</b> according to the present disclosure, and portions thereof, is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29-33</figref>, and is generally indicated at <b>900</b>. The heat transfer body of hydrogen-producing assembly <b>900</b> generally corresponds to the cross-section illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The heat transfer body of hydrogen-producing assembly <b>900</b> includes a pair of side extrusions <b>902</b> that are welded together to form a monolithic body <b>143</b>; however, it is within the scope of the present disclosure that a single extrusion form the entirety of the monolithic body. Each of the side extrusions <b>902</b> define a plurality of combined vaporizing/reforming conduits <b>70</b>. Hydrogen-producing assembly <b>900</b> also includes a pair of end plate inlet manifolds and a pair of end plate outlet manifolds, which correspond to the arrays of the combined vaporizing/reforming conduits. It is also within the scope of the present disclosure that a single end plate inlet manifold and a single end plate outlet manifold be utilized to direct the fluids respectively to and from the conduits defined by the side extrusions. Additionally or alternatively, the end plate manifold of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, having a heater conduit <b>65</b> may be utilized with hydrogen-producing assembly <b>900</b>. For example, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, hydrogen-producing assembly <b>900</b> may include a pair of cartridge heaters <b>71</b> that extend into heater conduits of the end cap inlet manifolds.

This heating assembly also may be suitable for hydrogen-producing assembly <b>800</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25-27</figref>. As indicated, the heating assembly includes an air delivery tube <b>904</b> for delivering an air stream <b>702</b> and a fuel delivery tube <b>906</b> for delivering a fuel stream <b>704</b> collectively to the burner conduit of the hydrogen-producing assembly. Other configurations are also within the scope of the present disclosure, but as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, the illustrated delivery tubes each include a plurality of perforations, through which the respect fluid is dispensed under pressure toward the burner conduit, which is positioned directly above the delivery tubes. The air stream and fuel stream are thus mixed, first, simply by dispersal through the area adjacent the delivery tubes, and then by the fuel-air mixing structure (when present) disposed within the burner conduit, as discussed herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139">In many applications, it is desirable for a hydrogen-producing assembly <b>12</b> and/or a fuel processing system <b>10</b> to produce a product hydrogen stream <b>14</b> containing at least substantially pure hydrogen gas. Accordingly, the fuel processing assembly may utilize a process that inherently produces sufficiently pure hydrogen gas. When the output stream contains sufficiently pure hydrogen gas and/or sufficiently low concentrations of one or more non-hydrogen components for a particular application, product hydrogen stream <b>14</b> may be formed directly from output stream <b>20</b>. However, in many hydrogen-producing processes, output stream <b>20</b> will be a mixed gas stream that contains hydrogen gas as a majority component along with other gases. Similarly, in many applications, the output stream <b>20</b> may be substantially pure hydrogen but still contain concentrations of one or more non-hydrogen components that are harmful or otherwise undesirable in the application for which the product hydrogen stream is intended to be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0140">Accordingly, fuel processing system <b>10</b> may (but is not required to) further include a purification region <b>24</b>, in which a hydrogen-rich stream <b>26</b> is produced from the output, or mixed gas, stream. Hydrogen-rich stream <b>26</b> contains at least one of a greater hydrogen concentration than output stream <b>20</b> and a reduced concentration of one or more of the other gases or impurities that were present in the output stream. Purification region <b>24</b> is schematically illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, where output stream <b>20</b> is shown being delivered to an optional purification region <b>24</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, at least a portion of hydrogen-rich stream <b>26</b> forms product hydrogen stream <b>14</b>. Accordingly, hydrogen-rich stream <b>26</b> and product hydrogen stream <b>14</b> may be the same stream and have the same compositions and flow rates. However, it is also within the scope of the present disclosure that some of the purified hydrogen gas in hydrogen-rich stream <b>26</b> may be stored for later use, such as in a suitable hydrogen storage assembly, subjected to a further purification process, and/or consumed by the fuel processing system (such as for use as a fuel stream for a heating assembly).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0141">Purification region <b>24</b> may, but is not required to, produce at least one byproduct stream <b>28</b>. When present, byproduct stream <b>28</b> may be exhausted, sent to a burner or other combustion source, used as a heated fluid stream, stored for later use, or otherwise utilized, stored or disposed of. In some embodiments, the byproduct stream may be delivered to the burner or other combustion-based heating assembly <b>60</b> for use as a fuel stream, such as to heat at least the hydrogen-producing region of the fuel processing assembly. In such an embodiment, it is further within the scope of the present disclosure that the byproduct stream may (but is not required to) have sufficient fuel value, when combusted by the burner or other heating assembly, to maintain the hydrogen-producing region at a suitable hydrogen-producing temperature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0143" num="0142">It is within the scope of the disclosure that byproduct stream <b>28</b> may be emitted from the purification region as a continuous stream responsive to the delivery of output stream <b>20</b> to the purification region, or intermittently, such as in a batch process or when the byproduct portion of the output stream is retained at least temporarily in the purification region. When purification region <b>24</b> produces a byproduct stream <b>28</b>, the purification region may additionally or alternatively be referred to as a separation region, as the region separates the (mixed gas) output stream <b>20</b> into hydrogen-rich stream <b>26</b> and byproduct stream <b>28</b>. The purification region, when present, may form a portion of hydrogen-producing assembly <b>12</b>, or may be in fluid communication therewith, such as to receive the output stream therefrom.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0144" num="0143">Purification region <b>24</b> includes any suitable device, or combination of devices, that are adapted to reduce the concentration of at least one component of output stream <b>20</b>. In most applications, hydrogen-rich stream <b>26</b> will have a greater hydrogen concentration than output, or mixed gas, stream <b>20</b>. However, it is also within the scope of the disclosure that the hydrogen-rich stream will have a reduced concentration of one or more non-hydrogen components that were present in output stream <b>20</b>, yet have the same, or even a reduced, overall hydrogen concentration as the output stream. For example, in some applications where product hydrogen stream <b>14</b> may be used, certain impurities, or non-hydrogen components, are more harmful than others. As a specific example, in many conventional fuel cell systems (such as proton exchange membrane fuel cell systems), carbon monoxide may damage a fuel cell stack if it is present in even a few parts per million, while other non-hydrogen components that may be present in stream <b>20</b>, such as water, will not damage the stack even if present in much greater concentrations. Therefore, in such an application, a suitable purification region may not increase the overall hydrogen concentration, but it will reduce the concentration of a non-hydrogen component that is harmful, or potentially harmful, to the desired application for the product hydrogen stream.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0144">Illustrative, non-exclusive examples of suitable devices for purification region <b>24</b> include one or more hydrogen-selective membranes <b>30</b>, chemical carbon monoxide removal assemblies <b>32</b>, and pressure swing adsorption systems <b>38</b>. It is within the scope of the disclosure that purification region <b>24</b> may include more than one type of purification device, and that these devices may have the same or different structures and/or operate by the same or different mechanisms. As discussed, hydrogen-producing fuel processing system <b>10</b> may include at least one restrictive orifice or other flow restrictor downstream of at least one purification region, such as associated with one or more of the product hydrogen stream, hydrogen-rich stream, and/or byproduct stream.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0145">Hydrogen-selective membranes <b>30</b> are permeable to hydrogen gas, but are at least substantially, if not completely, impermeable to other components of output stream <b>20</b>. Membranes <b>30</b> may be formed of any hydrogen-permeable material suitable for use in the operating environment and parameters in which purification region <b>24</b> is operated. Examples of suitable materials for membranes <b>30</b> include palladium and palladium alloys, and especially thin films of such metals and metal alloys. Palladium alloys have proven particularly effective, especially palladium with 35 wt % to 45 wt % copper. A palladium-copper alloy that contains approximately 40 wt % copper has proven particularly effective, although other relative concentrations and components may be used within the scope of the disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0147" num="0146">Hydrogen-selective membranes are typically very thin, such as a thin foil that is approximately 0.001 inches (approximately 0.0025 cm) thick. It is within the scope of the present disclosure, however, that the membranes may be formed from other hydrogen-permeable and/or hydrogen-selective materials, including metals and metal alloys other than those discussed above, as well as non-metallic materials and compositions, and that the membranes may have thicknesses that are greater or less than those discussed above. For example, the membrane may be made thinner, with commensurate increase in hydrogen flux. Examples of suitable mechanisms for reducing the thickness of the membranes include rolling, sputtering, and etching. Examples of various membranes, membrane configurations, and methods for preparing the same are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,221,117, 6,319,306, and 6,537,352, the complete disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0148" num="0147">Chemical carbon monoxide removal assemblies <b>32</b> are devices that chemically react carbon monoxide and/or other undesirable components of stream <b>20</b>, if present in output stream <b>20</b>, to form other compositions that are not as potentially harmful. Examples of chemical carbon monoxide removal assemblies include water-gas shift reactors and other devices that convert carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide, and methanation catalyst beds that convert carbon monoxide and hydrogen to methane and water. It is within the scope of the disclosure that fuel processing system <b>10</b> may include more than one type and/or number of chemical removal assemblies <b>32</b>. In addition, the chemical removal assemblies may be positioned or otherwise included in one or more chambers of body <b>140</b> that are in fluid communication with the upstream and downstream processes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0149" num="0148">Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) is a chemical process in which gaseous impurities are removed from output stream <b>20</b> based on the principle that certain gases, under the proper conditions of temperature and pressure, will be adsorbed onto an adsorbent material more strongly than other gases. Typically, it is the impurities that are adsorbed and removed from output stream <b>20</b>. The success of using PSA for hydrogen purification is due to the relatively strong adsorption of common impurity gases (such as CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, hydrocarbons including CH<sub>4</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>) on the adsorbent material. Hydrogen adsorbs only very weakly and so hydrogen passes through the adsorbent bed while the impurities are retained on the adsorbent material. Impurity gases such as NH<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>S, and H<sub>2</sub>O adsorb very strongly on the adsorbent material and are removed from stream <b>20</b> along with other impurities. If the adsorbent material is going to be regenerated and these impurities are present in stream <b>20</b>, purification region <b>24</b> preferably includes a suitable device that is adapted to remove these impurities prior to delivery of stream <b>20</b> to the adsorbent material because it is more difficult to desorb these impurities.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0150" num="0149">Adsorption of impurity gases occurs at elevated pressure. When the pressure is reduced, the impurities are desorbed from the adsorbent material, thus regenerating the adsorbent material. Typically, PSA is a cyclic process and requires at least two beds for continuous (as opposed to batch) operation. Examples of suitable adsorbent materials that may be used in adsorbent beds are activated carbon and zeolites, especially 5 Å (5 angstrom) zeolites. The adsorbent material is commonly in the form of pellets, granules, or extrudate and it is placed in a cylindrical pressure vessel utilizing a conventional packed-bed configuration. Other suitable adsorbent material compositions, forms, and configurations may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0150">PSA system <b>38</b> also provides an example of a device for use in purification region <b>24</b> in which the byproducts, or removed components, are not directly exhausted from the region as a gas stream concurrently with the purification of the output stream. Instead, these byproduct components are removed when the adsorbent material is regenerated or otherwise removed from the purification region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0152" num="0151">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, purification region <b>24</b> is shown downstream from hydrogen-producing assembly <b>12</b>.

In such an embodiment, the separation region may be thermally integrated within heat transfer body <b>140</b> along with the other components of the fuel processing assembly that are housed within the body.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0153" num="0152">In the context of a hydrogen-producing assembly, or fuel processing system, that is adapted to produce a product hydrogen stream that will be used as a feed, or fuel, stream for a fuel cell stack, the fuel processing assembly may be adapted to produce substantially pure hydrogen gas, or even pure hydrogen gas. For the purposes of the present disclosure, substantially pure hydrogen gas refers to hydrogen gas that is greater than 90% pure, and which may be greater than 95% pure, greater than 99% pure, and even greater than 99.5% pure. Illustrative, non-exclusive examples of components and configurations of fuel processing assemblies and fuel processing systems for producing streams of at least substantially pure hydrogen gas are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,319,306, 6,221,117, 5,997,594, 5,861,137, and U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2001/0045061, 2003/0192251, 2003/0223926, 2006/0090397, and 2007/0062116. The complete disclosures of the above-identified patents and patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0154" num="0153">As discussed, product hydrogen stream <b>14</b> may be used in a variety of applications, including applications where high purity hydrogen gas is utilized. An example of such an application is as a fuel, or feed, stream for a fuel cell stack. A fuel cell stack is a device that produces an electrical potential from a source of protons, such as hydrogen gas, and an oxidant, such as oxygen gas. Accordingly, a fuel cell stack may be adapted to receive at least a portion of product hydrogen stream <b>14</b> and a stream of oxygen (which is typically delivered as an air stream), and to produce an electric current therefrom. This is schematically illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, in which a fuel cell stack is indicated at <b>40</b> and produces an electric current, or electrical output, which is schematically illustrated at <b>41</b>. In such a configuration, in which the fuel processing assembly or fuel processing system is coupled to a fuel cell stack, the resulting system may be referred to as a fuel cell system <b>42</b> because it includes a fuel cell stack and a source of fuel for the fuel cell stack. It is within the scope of the present disclosure that fuel processing assemblies, feedstock delivery systems, and heating assemblies according to the present disclosure may be used in applications that do not include a fuel cell stack.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0155" num="0154">Fuel cell stack <b>40</b> contains at least one, and typically multiple, fuel cells <b>44</b> that are adapted to produce an electric current from an oxidant, such as air, oxygen-enriched air, or oxygen gas, and the portion of the product hydrogen stream <b>14</b> delivered thereto. A fuel cell stack typically includes multiple fuel cells joined together between common end plates <b>48</b>, which contain fluid delivery/removal conduits, although this construction is not required to all embodiments. Examples of suitable fuel cells include proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells and alkaline fuel cells. Others include solid oxide fuel cells, phosphoric acid fuel cells, and molten carbonate fuel cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0156" num="0155">The electric current, or electrical output, produced by stack <b>40</b> may be used to satisfy the energy demands, or applied load, of at least one associated energy-consuming device <b>46</b>. Illustrative examples of devices <b>46</b> include, but should not be limited to, motor vehicles, recreational vehicles, construction or industrial vehicles, boats or other sea craft, tools, lights or lighting assemblies, appliances (such as household or other appliances), households or other dwellings, offices or other commercial establishments, computers, signaling or communication equipment, battery chargers, etc. Similarly, fuel cell stack <b>40</b> may be used to satisfy the power requirements of fuel cell system <b>42</b>, which may be referred to as the balance-of-plant power requirements of the fuel cell system. It should be understood that device <b>46</b> is schematically illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> and is meant to represent one or more devices, or collection of devices, that are adapted to draw electric current from the fuel cell system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0157" num="0156">Fuel cell stack <b>40</b> may receive all of product hydrogen stream <b>14</b>. Some or all of stream <b>14</b> may additionally, or alternatively, be delivered, via a suitable conduit, for use in another hydrogen-consuming process, burned for fuel or heat, or stored for later use. As an illustrative example, an optional hydrogen storage device <b>50</b> is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>. Fuel processing and/or fuel cell systems according to the present disclosure may, but are not required to, include at least one hydrogen storage device. Device <b>50</b> is adapted to store at least a portion of product hydrogen stream <b>14</b>. For example, when the demand for hydrogen gas by stack <b>40</b> is less than the hydrogen output of fuel processing assembly <b>12</b>, the excess hydrogen gas may be stored in device <b>50</b>. Illustrative examples of suitable hydrogen storage devices include hydride beds and pressurized tanks. Although not required, a benefit of fuel processing system <b>10</b> or fuel cell system <b>42</b> including a supply of stored hydrogen is that this supply may be used to satisfy the hydrogen requirements of stack <b>40</b>, or the other application for which stream <b>14</b> is used, in situations when fuel processing assembly <b>12</b> is not able to meet these hydrogen demands. Examples of these situations include when the fuel processing assembly is starting up from a cold, or inactive state, ramping up (being heated and/or pressurized) from an idle state, offline for maintenance or repair, and when the fuel cell stack or application is demanding a greater flow rate of hydrogen gas than the maximum available production from the fuel processing assembly. Additionally or alternatively, the stored hydrogen may also be used as a combustible fuel stream to heat the fuel processing system or fuel cell system. Fuel processing systems that are not directly associated with a fuel cell stack may still include at least one hydrogen-storage device, thereby enabling the product hydrogen streams from these fuel processing systems to also be stored for later use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0158" num="0157">Fuel cell system <b>42</b> may also include at least one battery <b>52</b> or other suitable energy-storage, or electricity-storing, device that is adapted to store the electric potential, or power output, produced by stack <b>40</b>. When present, a battery may be utilized to power an electric heater for heating a monolithic body, as discussed herein. For example, a fuel system according to the present disclosure may be configured to power an electric heater with the battery in response to a primary power source becoming unavailable to power an energy-consuming device and/or the electric heater. Illustrative, non-exclusive examples of other energy storage devices that may be used include flywheels and capacitors, such as ultracapacitors or supercapacitors. Similar to the above discussion regarding excess hydrogen, fuel cell stack <b>40</b> may produce a power output in excess of that necessary to satisfy the load exerted, or applied, by device <b>46</b>, including the load required to power fuel cell system <b>42</b>. In further similarity to the above discussion of excess hydrogen gas, this excess power output may be used in other applications outside of the fuel cell system and/or stored for later use by the fuel cell system. For example, the battery or other storage device may provide power for use by system <b>42</b> during startup or other applications in which the system is not producing electricity and/or hydrogen gas. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> flow-regulating structures are generally indicated at <b>54</b> and schematically represent any suitable manifolds, valves, controllers, switches and the like for selectively delivering hydrogen and the fuel cell stack's power output to device <b>50</b> and battery <b>52</b>, respectively, and to draw the stored hydrogen and stored power output therefrom.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0160">As used herein, the term “and/or” placed between a first entity and a second entity means one of (1) the first entity, (2) the second entity, and (3) the first entity and the second entity.

This definition also allows that entities may optionally be present other than the entities specifically identified within the list of entities to which the phrase “at least one” refers, whether related or unrelated to those entities specifically identified. Thus, as a non-limiting example, “at least one of A and B” (or, equivalently, “at least one of A or B,” or, equivalently “at least one of A and/or B”) may refer, in one embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, with no B present (and optionally including entities other than B); in another embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, B, with no A present (and optionally including entities other than A); in yet another embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, and at least one, optionally including more than one, B (and optionally including other entities).
