<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. ยง119 to Korean Application No. 10-2013-0096745, filed Aug. 14, 2013, the subject matter of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Embodiments may relate to a laundry treating apparatus and a method for controlling the same.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, a laundry treating apparatus, a machine for applying physical and chemical actions to laundry or clothes to treat the same, calls a washing machine for removing dirt from the laundry, a spin-dryer for spinning a drum holding the laundry therein for extracting water from the laundry, and a dryer for applying cold or heated air to the drum for drying wet laundry, collectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">The laundry treating apparatus may detect an amount of laundry (hereinafter called a laundry amount) introduced to the drum before performing an operation, such as washing, rinsing, spinning, drying, and etc., and sets an amount of water supply, an operation course, and an operation time period according to the detected laundry amount.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">The laundry amount detection may be made by using a principle in which a load on a motor varies with the laundry amount and a current applied to the motor for rotating the drum varies with the load. However, since the load on the motor varies, not only with the load on the motor, but also with a state of clothes in the drum, there has been a problem in that a detected laundry amount shows a variation.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments may provide a laundry treating apparatus and a method for controlling the same that may accurately sense the laundry amount. Embodiments may provide a laundry treating apparatus and a method for controlling the same that can eliminate an influence of a state of clothes introduced to the drum to determination of the laundry amount for determining more accurate laundry amount.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Embodiments may provide a method for controlling a laundry treating apparatus having a drum rotatably provided for holding clothes, and a motor for rotating the drum. The method may include a first speed rotating for controlling the drum to accelerate the drum to rotate at a first speed, a braking for applying a brake to stop the drum, a second speed accelerating for accelerating the drum to a second speed, a current sensing for sensing a current being applied to the motor during the drum is accelerated to the second speed, and a laundry amount determining for determining a laundry amount based on the current sensed in the current sensing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Embodiments may provide a laundry treating apparatus including a drum rotatably provided for holding clothes, a motor for rotating the drum, a motor control unit for applying a brake to stop the motor after controlling the motor to rotate the drum at a first speed, and controlling the motor to make the drum to again accelerate to a second speed, a current sensing unit for sensing a current being applied to the motor during the motor is controlled by the motor control unit, and a laundry amount sensing unit for determining a laundry amount based on a current value sensed at the current sensing unit during the drum is accelerated to the second speed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">The laundry treating apparatus and the method for controlling the same may have an effect of determining a more accurate laundry amount by minimizing influence of an initial stage of the clothes introduced to the drum to a current value being applied to the motor, because the current value being applied to the motor is sensed after rotating the drum for changing the state of the clothes introduced to the drum.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">The laundry treating apparatus and the method for controlling the same may have an effect of making the laundry amount sensed become a reliable index that reflects an actual laundry amount even when the clothes are introduced to the drum in a non-uniform state by the user.</div>

Since the hall element can detect N, S poles and magnitudes thereof from the voltage V<sub>H </sub>generated thus, the hall element can detect a position of the rotor that is a permanent magnet of a PMSM (Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor) or BLDC (Brushless DC electric Motor). Moreover, since the hall element <b>113</b> <i>c </i>generates the voltage V<sub>H </sub>proportional to the magnitude of the magnetic flux B, enabling to detect current intensity that generates the magnetic flux, the hall element may also be used as a current sensor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">The position detection unit <b>231</b> may detect a position of the drum <b>124</b> based on the position of the rotor <b>113</b> <i>b </i>sensed by the hall element <b>113</b> <i>c</i>.

The position detection unit <b>231</b> may detect the rotation speed of the motor <b>113</b> by using the current that the current sensing unit <b>260</b> senses.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">The laundry treating apparatus may perform operations or washing, rinsing, spinning, and drying according to setting to the control panel <b>114</b>, for performing an operation optimized to an amount of the clothes by setting detailed variables, such as a water supply amount, a rotation speed of the drum <b>124</b>, a rotation pattern, an operation time period according to the amount of clothes (laundry amount) introduced to the drum <b>124</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow chart illustrating a method for controlling a laundry treating apparatus in accordance with an example embodiment. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a graph illustrating time vs. rotation speed of a drum when a laundry treating apparatus is operated according to a control method in accordance with an example embodiment. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a sectional view illustrating current sensing sections. A method for controlling a laundry treating apparatus in accordance with example embodiments will be described, with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 5</figref>. Other embodiments and configurations may also be provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">The clothes may be introduced to the drum <b>124</b> and the drum <b>124</b> may be accelerated (A1, [t1, t2]). A command speed ฯ* applied to a speed control unit <b>233</b> is a first speed ฯ1, and a rotation speed ฯ of the drum <b>124</b> may rise (or increase) following the first speed ฯ1. The first speed ฯ1 is a speed that can change a clothes state in the drum <b>124</b>, required to make at least some of the clothes held in the drum <b>124</b> to move, and may be set between 46 rpm to 60 rpm, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">If the rotation speed ฯ of the drum <b>124</b> sensed at a position detection unit <b>231</b> reaches the first speed ฯ1 (A2), the speed control unit <b>233</b> controls the drum <b>124</b> to rotate at a fixed speed of the first speed ฯ1 (A3, [t2, t3]) by a proportional integral control (PI).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">If a certain time period is passed from the t2 to reach the t3, a brake may be applied to the motor <b>113</b> to stop the drum <b>124</b> (A4, [t3, t4]). A braking system of the drum <b>124</b> may be regenerative braking or dynamic braking.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">For counting a number of repetitions of current sensing (A8, A9) to be described later, an โnโ is set to zero (A5).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">At a position aligning section [t4, t5] before the drum <b>124</b> stopped thus is accelerated again, a position of the drum <b>124</b> may be aligned (A6, A61). Magnetization of the stator <b>113</b> <i>a </i>can be made to make the rotor <b>113</b> <i>b </i>to be at a regular position, when a d-axis current may be output from a current control unit <b>235</b>. In this process, resistance of the motor <b>113</b> and an error of voltage information may be sensed. The position alignment of the drum <b>124</b> may also be performed at a position aligning section A62, A63, A64, A65 between acceleration to a second speed ฯ2 (to be described later) is repeated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">When the same command speed ฯ* is requested, in order to make the present speed ฯ to follow the command speed, a torque value generated by the motor <b>113</b> is required to vary with the laundry amount. In view of the current, the current applied to the motor <b>113</b> is required to vary with the laundry amount. Accordingly, the current applied to the motor <b>113</b> may be an index that reflects the laundry amount.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">Although the laundry amount may be determined based on the current detected at any section in which the rotation of the drum <b>124</b> is made, preferably, the laundry amount may be determined based on the current applied to the motor <b>113</b>, which is sensed at a section in which the clothes are lifted by rotation of the drum <b>124</b>. Determination of the laundry amount may be made at the laundry amount sensing unit <b>239</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">The current applied to the motor <b>113</b>, a present current forwarded from the inverter <b>250</b>, may be sensed by the current sensing unit <b>260</b>. The present current value may be expressed with a d-axis present current Id and a q-axis present current Iq on a d-q rotating coordinate system. Additionally, of the d-axis present current Id and q-axis present current Iq, since a component that generates the torque for rotating the rotor <b>113</b> <i>b </i>is the q-axis component mostly, the laundry amount is preferably determined based on the q-axis present current Iq.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">Additionally, although a value sensed starting from a time point the current is applied to the motor <b>113</b> for rotating the drum <b>124</b> from a stationary state may be used as the present current required for determining the laundry amount, the present current value sensed at an initial stage of the rotation of the drum <b>124</b> can not reflect the laundry amount accurately due to different reasons, such as a degree of magnetization of the stator <b>113</b> <i>a</i>, a state of arrangement of the clothes in the drum <b>124</b>, and etc. Consequently, the laundry amount may be determined based on the present current value sensed after the drum <b>124</b> is rotated to a certain extent from the stationary state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> again, operations for determining the laundry amount may be described in more detail.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">The drum <b>124</b> may be accelerated from a stationary state (A7, [t5, t9]). The command speed ฯ* applied to the speed control unit <b>233</b> is a second speed ฯ2, and the rotation speed ฯ of the drum <b>124</b> rises (or increases) following the second speed ฯ2. The second speed ฯ2 may be set lower than the first speed ฯ1, for an example, 46 rpm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">In this example, it is not required to accelerate the drum <b>124</b> until the drum <b>124</b> reaches the ฯ2 which is the command speed, without fail. That is, although <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates that braking of the drum <b>124</b> is made after the drum <b>124</b> reaches the command speed ฯ2 in each of the acceleration operations, this is no more than illustrative one, and it will be adequate if the drum <b>124</b> is accelerated following a predetermined command speed in the acceleration operation. It is preferable that the command speed in each of the acceleration operations has the same value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">Moreover, even if a highest value of the rotation speed may not reach the command speed ฯ2 depending on a drive time period of the motor <b>113</b> in the acceleration operation, even in this example, it is preferable that the highest value is lower than the first speed ฯ1.</div>
