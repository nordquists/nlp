<div class="description-paragraph">lhe presentinvention relates to baseball and has for its purpose to provide s in addition to its usual qualities, ortionlerly adapting the -.ssme to and wherein the bet is in no more ode interior to the ordinary bsselodll "l3 he invention has for its further purpose to devise a means whereby any ordinary baseball bat may be equipped With the proposed improvement; and wherein such inreinent Will not increase the cost of the o any appreciable amount. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> W these and other objects in view the lure HUT! consists in the novel details of eonstruotion and combinations of parts more fully oereineit'ter disclosed and particularly pointed out in the claims. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Rotor-ring to the accompanying drawings forming a port of this specification in which like numerals designate like parts in all the views :-Fip,ure 1 is a perspective View of s ln sebnll but embodying the present invenlion. Fig. 2 is a. longitudinal elevetionel riew thereof, showing the manner of attac 1- inn' the non-resilient element, and 3 is a longitudinal sectional view, showing the non-resilient element in position. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Referring to the construetio'n 1n dot-ell, 1 designates on ordinary baseball bat; having the striking portion 2 thereof provided with e plumllty of slots 3 that extend entirely through said portion 2,, and are disposed lengthwise thereof.
