<heading id="h-0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">One or more embodiments setting forth the ideas described throughout this disclosure pertain to the field of mounts as utilized in sporting equipment for electronics and visual markers. More particularly, but not by way of limitation, one or more aspects of the disclosure enable a method of coupling a motion sensor to a piece of equipment for example to accurately position and orient the motion sensor as well as account for manufacturing variations through calibration to provide a highly accurate motion sensor wherever and however mounted to the piece of equipment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Known systems for mounting electronics on sporting equipment include mounts in the shafts of fishing poles, and golf clubs for example. Existing mounts have the following limitations:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0006">Existing mounts for sporting equipment electronics require alteration of an existing piece of sporting equipment before attaching the mount and hence electronics. For example, known mounts require modification of the shaft of the piece of equipment to include threads.</li> <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0007">Some mounts extend longitudinally away from the normal ending point of the shaft for a distance that is far enough to interfere with or provide a confusing point at which to grasp the club.</li> <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0008">Other mounts combine the electronics on the mount itself in a monolithic package that does not allow for the weight of the club to remain constant with or without electronics installed. For example, in sports with rules against instrumented sporting equipment, the weight of an instrumented piece of sporting equipment differs from the weight of the same non-instrumented piece of sporting equipment that complies with competition rules.</li> <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0009">There are no known systems that include electronics within the shaft of a piece of sporting equipment that are also utilized to provide a visual marker for motion capture. Traditionally, mounts have been used for electronics or visual markers, but not both.</li> <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0010">Existing enclosures and mounts may break or shatter if they experience an impact shock. Upon impact, fragments of the mount, or of the enclosed electronics, may fly away from the enclosure and/or mount towards a user or spectator, posing a safety hazard.</li> <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0011">Existing enclosures and mounts do not provide shock absorption or shock isolation. The enclosed electronics may therefore experience very large shock forces, destroying them or corrupting sensor measurements.</li> <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0012">Existing enclosures and mounts provide limited or no water resistance.</li> <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0013">Existing mounts include manufacturing variations in the position and orientation of the mount on the piece of equipment. This creates errors in motion sensor data unless accounted for through either precise determination of mounting position and orientation and/or calibration of the motion sensor or both.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0014">Specifically, sensor data from sensors attached to or integrated into equipment is affected by the position, i.e., location, and orientation of the sensors with respect to the equipment. Accurate and useful analysis of motion may require knowledge of this location and orientation. Existing processes for mounting sensors on equipment do not include physical mounting constraints and calibration steps that provide accurate sensor location and orientation information. This uncertainty in precise sensor location and orientation is particularly problematic for sports such as golf, baseball, tennis or any other sport, where motions can be very rapid and metrics calculated from sensor data may be very sensitive to small changes in estimated sensor location and orientation. For at least the limitations described above there is a need for method of coupling a motion sensor to a piece of equipment.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0015">One or more embodiments of the invention enable a method of coupling a motion sensor to a piece of equipment, such as for example, without limitation, a golf club, a baseball bat, or a tennis racket or any other type of equipment. A method of coupling the sensor to equipment may provide information on the position and orientation of the sensor relative to the equipment, to assist for example in analysis of sensor data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0016">One or more embodiments of the invention enable a motion sensor package that is encased in an elastomer; the elastomer casing may provide shock isolation and water resistance. An elastomeric material such as silicone or rubber may be molded or cast around internal electronics that may include motion sensors, processors, batteries, and antennas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0017">One or more embodiments incorporate a shatter proof enclosure and mount for a motion capture element that enables a durable, secure, and safe coupling of the motion capture element to a piece of sporting, exercise or medical rehabilitation equipment, for example a baseball bat, hockey stick, lacrosse stick, helmet, skateboard, ski, snowboard, surfboard, golf club, tennis racquet, weight training bar, or any other equipment capable of movement. In addition, embodiments enable existing equipment that was not manufactured originally with a mount for electronics to be retrofitted with an enclosure and mount for motion capture element. The apparatus may be located internal or external to the piece of sporting equipment and may show a visual marker for use in visually obtaining motion in combination with electronically detected motion obtained with the motion capture sensor. For example, the outer portion of the enclosure may display a visual marker on the outer portion while the inner portion of the enclosure may be located on or within a shaft or grip in the handle portion of the equipment for example. In one or more embodiments, the grip may extend beyond the shaft and couple or aid in the coupling of the motion capture element with the shaft. One or more embodiments of the grip may include a grip that may roll down from the sides of a motion capture element to enable the motion capture element to be accessed without removing the grip from the shaft. The mount is configured to hold the enclosure to the piece of equipment wherein the enclosure holds the electronics and/or a visual marker. Embodiments of the invention do not require modifying the equipment, for example the baseball bat, tennis racquet, golf club, or other stick based equipment to include threads within the shaft. The apparatus may be flush mounted with the normal end of the equipment or have any desired length of extension from the end of the equipment. The mount also allows for the battery to be easily removed and replaced, for example without any tools. Other embodiments may make use of micro harvesting of energy to recharge batteries internal to the enclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0018">One or more embodiments of the mount include a shaft enclosure and expander that may be coupled with an attachment element, for example a screw that is aligned along an axis parallel to the axis of the shaft of the handle-based piece of equipment. The shaft enclosure and expander are situated within the handle portion of a handle-based piece of equipment such as a baseball bat, hockey stick, lacrosse stick, or golf club and engage in inner portion of the shaft or grip for example. In one or more embodiments, the screw is then rotated to move the shaft enclosure and expander together, which thus forces legs of the shaft enclosure in a direction orthogonal to the axis of the shaft. The force of the shaft enclosure against the inner wall of the shaft thus couples the shaft enclosure to the shaft non-permanently, for example based on the coefficient of static friction therebetween. After the shaft enclosure and expander are brought close enough together via the attachment element to securely couple the mount to the shaft or inside portion of a grip that is coupled to the shaft, then either the electronics package or a weight element is coupled with the shaft enclosure. In one or more embodiments, the weight element may weigh the same or approximately the same as the motion capture element so that there is no difference in weight to the piece of equipment with or without the motion capture element. In addition, certain sports may not allow the piece of equipment to be instrumented during match play. Embodiments of the weight element require no modification of the equipment. A cap is coupled with the shaft enclosure in either case, which provides a cover for the weight element or electronics package and which may include a visual marker and/or logo on the cap. Any other method or structure that enables a non-permanent mount of the apparatus that requires no modification of the shaft is in keeping with the spirit of the invention. Other embodiments may make use of a spear collet that enables coupling of a motion capture sensor with this type of mount to a stick or handle-based piece of equipment having a small hole in the end of the rubber grip on the handle. Other embodiments may utilize a shock puck that surrounds the enclosure and absorbs sudden shocks to the motion capture sensor within the enclosure, or otherwise dampens vibrations from the piece of equipment. Other embodiments may couple with helmets to obtain concussion related acceleration data, or obtain motion data related to board based sports such as snowboards, surfboards, skateboards as well as skis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0019">If the electronics package is installed, then generally a positive battery contact, printed circuit board (PCB), an insulator or insulative spacer, with negative electrical contact and battery may be installed between the shaft enclosure and cap. The electronics that may be coupled with the PCB for example may include active motion capture electronics that are battery powered, passive or active shot count components, for example a passive or active radio frequency identification (RFID) tag. Embodiments of the electronics may include motion capture accelerometers and/or gyroscopes and/or an inertial measurement unit along with wireless transmitter/receiver or transceiver components. The RFID tag enables identification of the specific piece of equipment, for example to determine which piece of equipment specific motion capture data is associated with. Identification information for example enables golf shots for each club associated with a golfer to be counted. Golf shots may optionally be counted via an identifier associated with motion capture electronics on the golf club in conjunction with a mobile computer, for example an IPHONE® equipped with an RFID reader that concentrates the processing for golf shot counting on the mobile computer instead of on each golf club. Optionally a wireless antenna may be coupled with the cap or alternatively may be implemented integral to the PCB as desired. In one or more embodiments, the antenna may be implemented as a Bluetooth® antenna embedded in an external portion of the enclosure, for example embedded in epoxy on an outer portion of the enclosure to maximize antenna coverage. One or more embodiments of the invention may also include a Global Positioning System (GPS) antenna. The GPS antenna may be mounted on the printed circuit board or may be located separate from the printed circuit board. One or more embodiments of the invention may also directly or indirectly communicate with any other sensors coupled with the club including motion analysis capture elements, strain gauges or any other type of sensor coupled for example with the golf club head. One or more embodiments of the invention may also utilize a battery coupling that attaches the battery to the shaft enclosure so that when the cap is removed, the battery does not fall out, unless intended. Embodiments may also utilize spring based electrical contacts to prevent loss of electrical conductivity under high acceleration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0020">As previously stated, one or more embodiments may include a weight element that is interchangeable with the electronic package in the mount. The electronics package may be removed for example to comply with any sporting rules that do not allow instrumented sporting equipment. For example, USGA Rule 14-3 on Artificial Devices prohibits any “unusual device”, for example under 14-3(b) “For the purpose of gauging or measuring distance”. Any embodiment of the electronics package including a GPS receiver may thus be removed prior to match play for example and replaced with a weight element to minimize the weight difference. For example, the weight element may for example weigh close to or the same as the electronics to minimize overall instrumented versus non-instrumented weight differences of the golf club. In addition, a manufacture may provide the mount on each club with a small weight for example, that is removed when the golfer decides to upgrade the club to include active instrumented electronics or passive shot count elements that weigh the same amount. The net effect on the club dynamics for swing then is negligible. In one embodiment, the plastic portion of the mount weighs 5.7 grams and the battery weighs 3 grams while the screw weighs 1.9 grams. Thus the mounting components have minimal weight and by selecting a weight element of the same weight of the electronics package, or elements within the shaft enclosure and cap that are replaced by the weight element, the golfer feels no change in club weight when upgrading to an instrumented club. The same weight element may be utilized with respect to embodiments of the invention in all other sports and pieces of equipment used in those sports, as one skilled in the art will appreciate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0021">The visual marker may be mounted on the cap for use with visual motion capture cameras. An equipment number may also be displayed on in a display area of the cap to indicate which type or specific piece of equipment is associated with the motion capture sensor, e.g., a club number is associated with the golf club. Embodiments of the visual marker may be passive or active, meaning that they may either have a visual portion that is visually trackable or may include a light emitting element such as a light emitting diode (LED) that allows for image tracking in low light conditions respectively. This for example may be implemented with a graphical symbol or colored marker at the cap of the mount on the shaft at the end of the handle for example. Motion analysis may be performed externally, for example using a camera and computer system based on the visual marker in any captured images. The visual data may also be utilized in motion analysis in combination with any wireless data from any installed electronics package.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0022">Enclosures and mounts containing motion sensors and other electronics may be susceptible to impact events. For example, in sports applications such as baseball, the equipment may be specifically designed to impact an object such as a ball. While the choice of location of the enclosure and/or mount on the equipment may mitigate the impact risk, it cannot necessarily eliminate it. One or more embodiments therefore contain a protective layer, either surrounding the enclosure or integrated into the enclosure, to protect users and spectators in the event of an impact. The protective layer may for example be designed to maintain its integrity during an impact, and to prevent fragments of the enclosure or the enclosed components from exiting the enclosure after an impact.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0023">In one or more embodiments, the protective layer may comprise an elastomer, such as for example silicone rubber or any other flexible material. In one or more embodiments, the protective layer may comprise a mesh that for example flexes during impact or otherwise maintains its integrity. A mesh for example may be designed with a sufficiently fine spacing between filaments to prevent fragments of any substantial size from exiting the mesh. A mesh may be for example integrated into the material of the enclosure, or attached around the enclosure. In one or more embodiments, the protective layer may comprise a shatter proof or shatter resistant material, such as for example acrylic or polycarbonate. One or more embodiments may provide multiple layers of protective material, such as for example a mesh surrounding a layer of elastomer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0024">One or more embodiments may encase all electronic components in a layer of elastomer. Components that are encased may include for example motion sensors, such as an accelerometer and a gyro, a microprocessor, a wireless antenna, and a battery. The layer of elastomer may surround and protect all of the electronic components. It may be configured to provide shock isolation for the electronic components, and to provide a water resistant barrier around these components. Any elastomer may be used, including for example, without limitation, silicone, natural rubber, synthetic rubber, and polyurethane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0025">In one or more embodiments, the size and shape of the elastomer layer may match a component of an item of sports equipment; the sensor package may be installed in the sports equipment by replacing the original component with the elastomer encased sensor package. For example, the elastomer layer may be formed to be a skateboard riser. The sensor electronics are then integrated directly into the riser. Installing the sensor package for the skateboard then involves simply replacing the original riser with the sensor package riser.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0026">One or more embodiments may include both an elastomer layer that encases electronic components and an outer housing into which the elastomer encased package is placed. The outer housing may comprise for example a receiver portion with a cavity that holds the elastomer encased package, and a lid portion that fits onto the receiver portion. The closed outer housing may completely surround the elastomer layer. One or more embodiments may have a receiver and lid that are cylindrical and threaded so they can be screwed together to close the housing. One or more embodiments may include an installation and removal tool that is used to screw the lid onto or off of the receiver.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0027">In one or more embodiments, the outer housing may have a size and shape that fits into a cavity in an item of sports equipment. Such a cavity may exist in or be created in a surfboard, for example, or in a baseball bat at either the knob end or the tip end. In one or more embodiments, the receiver portion or the lid portion of the outer housing may be integrated into an item of sports equipment. For example, a cavity with threads may be machined into the tip of a baseball bat; this cavity then functions as the receiver portion of the outer housing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0028">One or more embodiments may include a dummy weight that can replace the elastomer enclosed sensor package without substantially changing the overall weight of the item into which the sensor package is installed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0029">One or more embodiments may include a golf club grip adapter that is used to attach an outer housing to a golf club grip. The adapter may for example have a tube that is inserted through the top of a golf club grip. A protrusion on the receiver portion of the outer housing may fit into the tube of the adapter to attach the sensor package to the club.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0030">One or more embodiments may enable a method of coupling a motion sensor to a piece of equipment. Equipment may be for example, without limitation a golf club, a baseball bat, or a tennis racket. The method may include manufacturing a sensor receiver, coupling the receiver to the piece of equipment, and inserting a sensor housing containing one or more sensors into the receiver. In one or more embodiments, the method may also incorporate a post-installation calibration procedure. Calibration may for example include performing one or more calibration movements with the equipment, collecting sensor data during these movements, and analyzing the sensor data to determine the sensor's pose (position and orientation) relative to the equipment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0031">One or more embodiments may include manufacturing of a sensor receiver for a golf club. The golf club sensor receiver may for example be attached at the end of the club shaft opposite the club face. The receiver's outer surface may include an alignment feature so that the receiver can be installed in a specific orientation relative to the golf club. The receiver may have an inner cavity to receive a sensor housing; the cavity may have features such as protrusions and indentations that mate with corresponding features on the sensor housing to ensure that the housing is installed in the receiver in a fixed orientation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0032">A sensor receiver for a golf club may be for example manufactured into a golf club grip, or it may be separate component that attaches to a golf club grip. A sensor receiver component may for example have a protrusion from the bottom of the receiver that mates with a hole in the top of a golf club grip.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0033">Calibration movements for a piece of equipment, such as a golf club may include for example holding the club with the shaft vertical, rotating the club around the shaft, and rotating the club around an axis perpendicular to the shaft. The same calibration movements may be applied to other types of equipment as well, for example baseball bats, tennis racquets, etc.</div>

<heading id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0093">A method of coupling a motion sensor to a piece of equipment will now be described. In the following exemplary description numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a more thorough understanding of the ideas described throughout this specification. It will be apparent, however, to an artisan of ordinary skill that embodiments of ideas described herein may be practiced without incorporating all aspects of the specific details described herein. In other instances, specific aspects well known to those of ordinary skill in the art have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the disclosure. Readers should note that although examples of the innovative concepts are set forth throughout this disclosure, the claims, and the full scope of any equivalents, are what define the invention. One skilled in the art will recognize that embodiments of the invention may be utilized in any equipment capable of coupling with the apparatus. This includes any piece of sporting, exercise or medical rehabilitation equipment, for example a baseball bat, hockey stick, lacrosse stick, helmet, skateboard, ski, snowboard, surfboard, golf club, tennis racquet, weight training bar, or any other equipment capable of movement. The apparatus may be located internal or external to the piece of sporting equipment and may show a visual marker for use in visually obtaining motion in combination with electronically detected motion obtained with the motion capture sensor. For example, the outer portion of the enclosure may display a visual marker on the outer portion while the inner portion of the enclosure may be located on or within a shaft or grip in the handle portion of the equipment for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0094"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an embodiment of the invention <b>100</b> alone in perspective view and as mounted in a shaft of a piece of movement equipment, for example a baseball bat, hockey stick, lacrosse stick, golf club, tennis racquet or any piece of equipment having a handle near shaft <b>110</b> as shown in cutaway view. Embodiments enable a mount for a new piece of equipment or that can be retrofitted in an existing piece of equipment. The mount may be located in the handle portion of the shaft, or for example within a grip that is to be attached to the shaft, and is configured to hold electronics and/or a visual marker.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0095"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an embodiment of the invention broken into an exploded view of the main components along with the shaft handle and blow up views of the major components in transparent shading. One or more embodiments of the mount include enclosure or shaft enclosure <b>220</b> and expander <b>210</b> that may be coupled with an attachment mechanism, for example a screw aligned along an axis parallel to the axis of the shaft. The shaft enclosure and expander are situated within the handle, i.e., shaft <b>110</b>. In one or more embodiments, the screw is then rotated to move the shaft enclosure towards the expander, which thus forces legs of the shaft enclosure in a direction orthogonal to the axis of the shaft. The force of the shaft enclosure against the inner wall of the shaft thus couples the shaft enclosure to the shaft based on the coefficient of static friction therebetween. Any other mechanism of coupling the shaft enclosure to a shaft in a non-permanent manner is in keeping with the spirit of the invention. After the shaft enclosure and expander are brought close enough together via the screw to securely couple the mount to the shaft, then either the electronics package or a weight element that may for example weigh the same as the electronics, is coupled with the shaft enclosure. Cap <b>230</b> is coupled with the shaft enclosure in either case, which provides a cover for the weight element or electronics package and which may include a visual marker and/or logo on the cap. One or more embodiments of the electronics package are removable to comply with any sporting rules that do not allow instrumented sporting equipment for example. Any other method or structure that enables a non-permanent mount of the apparatus that requires no modification of the shaft is in keeping with the spirit of the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0096">Optionally, an identification element or ID sticker, for example an RFID tag may be mounted within the enclosure, cap, or any other portion of the apparatus, for equipment identification, or shot count functionality. The identification element may also be implemented integral to, or coupled with the PCB in any manner as desired.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0097">If the electronics package is installed, then generally a positive battery contact, printed circuit board or PCB, an insulator or insulative spacer, with negative electrical contact and battery may be installed between the shaft enclosure and cap. Optionally, a wireless antenna and/or GPS antenna may be coupled with the cap or alternatively may be implemented integral to the PCB as desired. Also see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-C</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>4</b>A-D and <b>9</b> for more detailed views.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0098"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> illustrates a detailed cutaway view of the main components of an embodiment of the invention, specifically expander <b>210</b>, shaft enclosure <b>220</b> and cap <b>230</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> illustrates a detailed cutaway view showing negative battery contact <b>450</b>, also shown in full in exploded view in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> illustrates a detailed cutaway view showing positive battery contact <b>420</b>, also shown in full in exploded view in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Optional O-ring indentation <b>310</b> on shaft enclosure <b>220</b> provides a potential well for O-ring <b>320</b> to be located. Different size O-rings may be utilized to provide a secure fit on the end of shaft enclosure <b>220</b> on the end near cap <b>230</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0099"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an exploded view “A” of the main mount components, namely expander <b>210</b>, shaft enclosure <b>220</b> along with screw <b>410</b>, positive battery contact <b>420</b> and battery <b>430</b>, while view “B<b>1</b>” shows a top oriented view of the insulator <b>440</b>, negative battery contact <b>450</b>, electronics package <b>460</b>, here a printed circuit board or PCB and cap <b>230</b>, while view “B<b>2</b>” shows a bottom oriented view of the same components shown in view “B<b>1</b>”. The left portion of shaft enclosure <b>220</b> shows extensions or “legs” that allow for the shaft enclosure to radially expand when expander <b>210</b> is pulled along the axis shown by screw <b>410</b>, when screw <b>410</b> is rotated. To keep expander <b>210</b> from simply rotating when screw <b>410</b> is rotated, expander <b>210</b> may include a protrusion (shown on the left side of the expander) that aligns in a slot formed by two of the shaft enclosure's legs. In this manner, expander <b>210</b> is pulled along the axis of the screw without rotating along that axis. Electronics package <b>460</b> for example may include active motion capture electronics that are battery powered, passive or active shot count components, for example a passive or active RFID tag, which for example may be coupled with electronics package <b>460</b> or for example coupled with insulator <b>440</b>. In addition, a GPS antenna may also be coupled with electronics package <b>460</b> or cap <b>230</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>). Embodiments of the electronics may include motion capture accelerometers and/or gyroscopes and/or an inertial measurement unit along with wireless transmitter/receiver or transceiver components. The RFID tag enables golf shots for each club associated with a golfer to be counted. The RFID tag may be coupled with any component shown as RFID tags are tiny, for example cap <b>230</b> or shaft enclosure <b>220</b> or electronics package <b>460</b>, or any other element. Golf shots may optionally be counted via an identifier associated with motion capture electronics on the golf club in conjunction with a mobile computer, for example an IPHONE® equipped with an RFID reader that concentrates the processing for golf shot counting on the mobile computer instead of on each golf club.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0100">The visual marker may be mounted on cap <b>230</b>, shown as a circle with dots in view B<b>1</b> may be utilized with visual motion capture cameras. An equipment number, for example a golf club number may also be displayed on in a display area of the cap to indicate which club number is associated with the golf club, which is shown as a small circle with a number in it in view B<b>1</b>. Embodiments of the visual marker may be passive or active, meaning that they may either have a visual portion that is visually trackable or may include a light emitting element such as a light emitting diode (LED) that allows for image tracking in low light conditions respectively. This for example may be implemented with a graphical symbol or colored marker at the cap of the mount on the shaft at the end of the handle for example. Motion analysis may be performed externally, for example using a camera and computer system based on the visual marker in any captured images. The visual data may also be utilized in motion analysis in combination with any wireless data from electronics package <b>460</b>.</div>

In addition, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> also shows a second embodiment of shaft enclosure <b>220</b> <i>a </i>having coupling elements that enable second embodiment of insulator <b>440</b> <i>a </i>to securely couple to shaft enclosure <b>220</b> <i>a </i>without falling out if the mount is turned upside down for example. In this embodiment, insulator <b>440</b> <i>a </i>holds battery <b>430</b> inside while providing access to the battery so that positive battery contact <b>420</b> <i>a </i>and negative battery contact <b>450</b> <i>a </i>can make electrical contact with battery <b>430</b>. View “B” shows a bottom-oriented view of the insulator, positive and negative battery contact, electronics package, here a printed circuit board or PCB and cap. Weight element <b>490</b> can be any shape so long as weight element <b>490</b> fits within, or couples in any direct or indirect manner with shaft enclosure <b>220</b> or <b>220</b> <i>a </i>and cap <b>230</b> for example. Weight element <b>490</b> can be made to weigh as near as desired to the weight of the components that it replaces, for example to comply with any sporting rules that do not allow instrumented sporting equipment, e.g., during competition. Weight element <b>490</b> can also be utilized with the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> as one skilled in the art will appreciate.</div>

Insulator <b>440</b> <i>a </i>includes for example snap components, e.g., coupling elements <b>441</b> that couple with coupling elements <b>221</b> of shaft enclosure <b>220</b> <i>a </i>so that insulator <b>440</b> <i>a </i>and hence battery <b>430</b> do not fall out when the cap is removed. To remove insulator <b>440</b> <i>a </i>and hence battery <b>430</b>, tab <b>442</b> may be engaged with for example a finger, screw driver or other implement to disengage coupling elements <b>441</b> from coupling elements <b>221</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0138"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> illustrates an embodiment that encases motion sensor electronics in a layer of elastomer.

One or more embodiments may incorporate any type or types of motion sensors, including for example, without limitation, any sensor that measures one or more aspects of a position, orientation, linear velocity, angular velocity, linear acceleration, or angular acceleration. Electronics <b>2620</b> may also include one or more processors such as microprocessor <b>3203</b>.

Electronic components may be mounted on or connected via one or more printed circuit boards, such as for example circuit board <b>3205</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0139">The electronic components <b>2620</b> may be encased in an elastomer using any desired manufacturing process <b>3210</b>. For example, an elastomeric casing may be molded or cast, or applied directly around electronics <b>2620</b>. One or more embodiments may use any elastomeric material or materials, including for example, without limitation, silicone rubber, natural rubber, synthetic rubber, or polyurethane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0140">Encased sensor package <b>3230</b> may for example be surrounded on all sides with an elastomer layer, with all of the electronics <b>2620</b> fully encased by the elastomer. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> shows a cross section view <b>3240</b> of the encased sensor package <b>3230</b>. The elastomer layer <b>3220</b> is shaped to fully surround the enclosed electronic components.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0141"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> illustrates two benefits of the elastomer encasing: shock isolation, and water resistance. Impact with an object such as ball <b>3301</b> can generate very large shock forces on the sensor package. For example, the outer edge of the elastomer layer <b>3220</b> may experience a very large acceleration such as <b>3310</b>. However, the elastomer layer provides shock isolation to reduce the shock forces on the enclosed electronics. For example, the elastomer layer may be modeled as a spring-damper system equivalent to a spring <b>3320</b> and a viscous damper <b>3321</b>. As is known in the art, a spring-damper system can substantially reduce the impact shock felt by the enclosed components; for example, the acceleration of the electronic components may be reduced to level <b>3311</b>, far below the external acceleration <b>3310</b>. One or more embodiments may select a desired level of shock isolation, and configure the shape, thickness, and materials of the elastomer layer <b>3220</b> accordingly to achieve this level of shock isolation. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, the elastomer layer <b>3220</b> may also provide resistance to water <b>3330</b>, by reflecting some or all of the water from the outer surface of the layer.

Knowing the pose of a sensor relative to the equipment to which it is coupled may assist in calculating accurate metrics for equipment motion from sensor data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0143" num="0150"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref> shows a high-level flowchart of a method of coupling a sensor to a piece of equipment. For illustration, the method is shown for coupling a sensor to a golf club. In one or more embodiments, the method may be used to couple any type of sensor or sensors to any type of equipment, including but not limited to golf clubs. For example, without limitation, one or more embodiments may enable a method to couple a sensor or sensors to a piece of sports equipment such as a golf club, a bat, a racket, a stick, or any other item used in any sport or athletic activity. One objective in coupling a sensor to piece of equipment is to obtain a known, reasonably precise pose of the sensor after executing the steps of the method. The first three steps shown in the flowchart of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref> have associated “degrees of freedom” that may affect the sensor pose relative to the equipment.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0144" num="0151">In step <b>3901</b>, a sensor receiver is manufactured.

Sensors contained in the sensor housing may include for example, without limitation, inertial sensors such as accelerometers and rate gyroscopes. Manufacturing tolerances <b>3911</b> may occur during step <b>3901</b>, which may affect the precision with which the sensor can be installed in a known position and orientation relative to the equipment. As discussed below, post-installation calibration information <b>3921</b> may be used in one or more embodiments to compensate for these tolerances <b>3911</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0152">In step <b>3902</b>, the sensor receiver manufactured in step <b>3901</b> is coupled to a golf club.

This step <b>3902</b> may also have degrees of freedom that are introduced during installation, such as relative rotation <b>3912</b> of the sensor receiver relative to the club. (For example, a grip may be rotated around a golf club shaft during grip installation.) To compensate for this degree of freedom <b>3912</b>, one or more embodiments may include an alignment feature <b>3922</b> on the sensor receiver that allows it to be aligned precisely in a particular orientation relative to the club. Specific examples of alignment features are described below.</div>

To compensate for this degree of freedom, one or more embodiments may include protrusions or indentations (or both) <b>3923</b> in the sensor receiver that mate with corresponding features on the sensor housing, thereby ensuring that the sensor housing is in a fixed, well-known orientation and position relative to the sensor receiver.</div>

Golf club grip <b>4001</b> includes a cavity <b>4003</b> that may either be a separate insert, or that is manufactured in the grip that is configured to receive sensor housing <b>4004</b>. The sensor housing may for example include inertial sensors (such as accelerometers and gyroscopes), other sensors, and other electronics such as batteries, processors, and communications circuitry. In this illustrative example, golf club grip <b>4001</b> has a flat surface <b>4002</b> on one side, which allows the grip (and the contained sensor receiver) to be aligned in a particular orientation relative to the golf club when the grip is installed. Because the cavity <b>4003</b> is either an insert, or manufactured into the grip itself, it is in a precise and well-known orientation relative to this flat surface <b>4002</b>. The inner surface of the receiver (which encloses cavity <b>4003</b>) has two indentations <b>4006</b> <i>a </i>and <b>4006</b> <i>b</i>, which correspond to protrusions <b>4005</b> <i>a </i>and <b>4005</b> <i>b </i>on sensor housing <b>4004</b>. These mating features in the receiver and the sensor housing ensure that the sensor housing is installed in a precise orientation relative to the receiver; they also prevent the sensor housing from rotating once installed into the receiver.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0150" num="0157"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41A, 41B, and 41C</figref> illustrate a different embodiment with a sensor receiver that is a separate component that attaches to a grip, rather than being integrated into or manufactured into a grip as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41A</figref> shows an exploded view; <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41B</figref> shows a partially installed sensor receiver; and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41C</figref> shows a fully installed sensor receiver. Golf club grip <b>4104</b> has a hole <b>4105</b> at the top of the grip (furthest from the clubhead). Sensor receiver <b>4101</b> (i.e., the mount) has a protrusion <b>4103</b> that fits into this hole <b>4105</b>. Because hole <b>4105</b> and protrusion <b>4103</b> are cylindrical, receiver <b>4101</b> has a rotational degree of freedom when installed into grip <b>4104</b>. To compensate for this degree of freedom, sensor receiver <b>4101</b> has an alignment feature <b>4102</b>, which is flat face that can be aligned with corresponding secondary alignment feature, here flat face <b>4106</b> of grip <b>4104</b>. Sensor housing <b>4004</b> is installed into receiver <b>4101</b>. The cavity of receiver <b>4101</b> that receives housing <b>4004</b> has features that may for example be similar to those illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> to lock the sensor housing <b>4004</b> into a known orientation when installed. Alternatively, or in combination, the sensor receiver or mount <b>4101</b> may include protrusion <b>4102</b> <i>a </i>that aligns the mount with secondary alignment feature <b>4106</b> <i>a</i>, here in hole <b>4105</b>. This may be implemented as a key and slot arrangement as shown or in any other manner that keeps the mount from rotating when coupled with the piece of equipment, as shown grip <b>4104</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41B</figref> shows sensor housing <b>4004</b> fully installed into receiver <b>4101</b>, and receiver <b>4101</b> partially installed into grip <b>4104</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41C</figref>, receiver <b>4101</b> is pushed all the way down into grip <b>4104</b>, and the flat faces <b>4102</b> and <b>4016</b> are aligned so that the outer surface of receiver <b>4101</b> is flush with the outer surface of grip <b>4104</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0158"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref> illustrates the information needed to map between sensor data and motion of the equipment into which the sensor is installed. This is shown for a golf club <b>4201</b>; however, the principle is similar for other types of equipment. For analysis of a golf swing, motion of the club face is generally of primary interest, since this is the area of the club that strikes the ball. However, the sensor <b>4203</b> is installed in or near the grip of the club, rather than at the clubface. It is therefore desirable to map between sensor motion data and motion of the clubface, which requires knowledge of the transformation <b>4205</b> that maps between the sensor coordinate frame <b>4204</b> and the clubface coordinate frame <b>4202</b>. Use of an equipment reference frame <b>4202</b> with an origin at the clubface is illustrative; in one or more embodiments, it may be desirable to map between sensor data and reference frames anywhere on a piece of equipment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0152" num="0159">As discussed above with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>, degrees of freedom introduced in manufacturing and potentially in installation may generate uncertainty in the precise transformation <b>4205</b>. Therefore, a post-installation calibration procedure may be desirable to recover or confirm this transformation. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref> shows an illustrative calibration procedure for a golf club; procedures for other equipment may be similar. In the calibration procedure shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>, three different calibration motions are performed on golf club <b>4201</b> after the sensor receiver and sensor housing are installed into the club. Sensor data is collected during these motions, and is then analyzed in step <b>4320</b> to determine the transformation <b>4205</b>. Specifically, a first calibration motion <b>4301</b> is to hold the club still with the shaft vertical (in the direction of gravity), and to collect sensor data <b>4311</b> from sensor <b>4203</b> during this time period. (Sensor data table <b>4311</b> shows three columns of time samples for illustration; one or more embodiments may collect sensor data over any desired time period and may use any desired number of sensor data samples for any calibration motion.) Data <b>4311</b> may for example include accelerometer data from a 3-axis accelerometer, and angular velocity data from a 3-axis rate gyroscope. In one or more embodiments, other sensor data may be collected instead of or in addition to accelerometer and gyroscope data. A second calibration motion <b>4302</b> is to rotate club <b>4201</b> around an axis aligned with the golf club shaft; sensor data <b>4312</b> is collected during this rotation. A third calibration motion <b>4303</b> is to rotate club <b>4201</b> around an axis perpendicular to the shaft; sensor data <b>4313</b> is collected during this rotation. Data <b>4311</b>, <b>4312</b>, and <b>4313</b> is analyzed in process <b>4320</b> to determine the sensor pose and the transformation <b>4205</b> between sensor pose and an equipment reference frame.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0153" num="0160">The calibration motions <b>4301</b>, <b>4302</b>, and <b>4303</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref> are illustrative; one or more embodiments may use any number of calibration motions of any type. The appropriate motions may depend for example on the type of equipment, on the type of sensors, on the degrees of freedom introduced in manufacturing and installation, and on the desired precision of the sensor pose.</div>
