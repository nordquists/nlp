<heading id="h-0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0002">1. Field of the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure generally relates to hockey equipment used for street hockey or roller hockey. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to a modified hockey stick designed to help both new and seasoned hockey players improve their stick handling abilities thereby improving their game.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">2. Description of the Related Art</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Stick handling is a fundamental skill required to excel in the game of hockey. For ice hockey, once a player learns to skate, he/she must then learn to maneuver the stick to effectively control the puck. Although this part of the learning process seems easy, most players end up wielding the stick incorrectly leading to reduced range of motion and added stress to the player. In the initial stages of learning the game, this can be prevented from turning habitual. A stick, which is easily moved, light, and flexible, is required. Another aspect of playing hockey is that the stick must always be supported and moved along with the player on the playing surface. Carrying a stick can become tiring for children and those who are still increasing the strength of their upper extremities. As a result, “stick handling” is often “stick dragging” for novice players. Even for seasoned players, effortless and agile movement with conventional hockey sticks is not always possible. A stick, which is easy to maneuver by players of all ages and skill levels, is therefore required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Hence, there is a long felt but unresolved need for a stick, which is easily moved, light, and flexible. Furthermore, there is a need for a stick, which is easy to maneuver by players of all ages.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">The invention, disclosed herein, addresses the above-mentioned need for a stick, which is easily moved, light, and flexible. Furthermore, the invention addresses the need for a stick, which is easy to maneuver by players of all ages and skill levels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">It is an object of the invention to provide a stick that helps children or others learning to play the game of hockey with a stick that is easier to handle than a conventional hockey stick.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">It is another object of the invention to provide a stick with improved handling for both experienced and novice players. Such a stick is usable in multiple versions of hockey, for example, field hockey, ice hockey, roller hockey, underwater hockey, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">The modified hockey stick, disclosed herein, comprises a handle and a blade. The blade comprises at least one opening configured in the bottom surface of the blade. The at least one opening extends in an upward direction within the blade of the modified hockey stick.

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> exemplarily illustrates a front elevation view of a modified hockey stick <b>100</b>. The modified hockey stick <b>100</b>, disclosed herein, comprises a handle <b>101</b> and a blade <b>102</b>. The blade <b>102</b> comprises at least one opening <b>103</b> configured in the bottom surface <b>102</b> <i>a </i>of the blade <b>102</b>. The at least one opening <b>103</b> extends in an upward direction within the blade <b>102</b> of the modified hockey stick <b>100</b>. The opening <b>103</b> is configured to receive a shank of a wheel <b>104</b> for supporting rolling movement of the modified hockey stick <b>100</b> on a playing surface. In an embodiment, three openings <b>103</b> are configured within the bottom surface <b>102</b> <i>a </i>of the blade <b>102</b> as exemplarily illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>. The small swivel wheels <b>104</b> at the bottom surface <b>102</b> <i>a </i>of the blade <b>102</b> of the modified hockey stick <b>100</b> ensures smooth rolling movement over several types of terrain, for example, concrete, asphalt, etc., to swivel and have a smooth effect on the ground. In an embodiment, there may be two or three wheels <b>104</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">In an embodiment, the modified hockey stick <b>100</b> can be used for training purposes for adults and kids, roller hockey (or a new type of roller hockey if the size of the blade must change.) Further, the modified hockey stick <b>100</b> helps to practice or play roller hockey, ice hockey/practice. The swivel wheels <b>104</b> maintain balance and swivel as to not ruin the blade <b>102</b> and help with the movement and balancing of the modified hockey stick <b>100</b>. The modified hockey stick <b>100</b> prevents the hockey blade <b>102</b> from sticking or getting ruined on the ground or ice. Alternately, the modified hockey stick <b>100</b> can be used by players of medium to advanced skill levels. For such players, the modified hockey stick <b>100</b> helps with smoother movement and improving their existing skillset. In another embodiment, the length of the modified hockey stick <b>100</b> is adjustable in size according to the player. The modified hockey stick <b>100</b> is made of materials, for example, fiberglass, wood, etc. In an embodiment, the swivel wheels <b>104</b>, very small, are made of rubber.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> exemplarily illustrates a front elevation view of a modified hockey stick <b>100</b>. To increase the ease of moving the modified hockey stick <b>100</b>, the present invention provides support wheels <b>104</b> or castors for moving the modified hockey stick <b>100</b> along the playing surface. The playing surface is, for example, a solid surface, such as a field or street, in the case of land hockey, or a sheet of ice in the case of ice hockey. In either case, the purpose of the modified stick is to provide the player with some additional support and assistance in moving the modified hockey stick <b>100</b>. As shown in the attached drawings, the modified hockey stick <b>100</b> is adapted to include several wheels <b>104</b> or castors along the bottom surface <b>102</b> <i>a </i>of the blade <b>102</b> of the modified hockey stick <b>100</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the modified hockey stick <b>100</b> includes two openings <b>103</b> on the bottom surface <b>102</b> <i>a </i>of the blade <b>102</b>. The openings <b>103</b> extend into the blade <b>102</b> of the modified hockey stick <b>100</b>, to receive the shank or other base member of a wheel <b>104</b> or a castor within the openings <b>103</b>. As a result, the wheel <b>104</b> extends from the bottom surface <b>102</b> <i>a </i>of the blade <b>102</b> of the modified hockey stick <b>100</b> and rolls along the playing surface as it is carried by the player.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">Although the illustrated embodiment shows the use of the two wheels <b>104</b>, which can be moved between several mounting positions along the blade <b>102</b> of the modified hockey stick <b>100</b>. A single wheel <b>104</b> or more than two wheels <b>104</b> might also be used. The position of the wheel <b>104</b> or wheels <b>104</b> may be in any location desired by the player, to accommodate the height of the player, or the comfort of the modified hockey stick <b>100</b> with the wheels <b>104</b> in the available wheel positions. It should be clear that the size of the wheels <b>104</b> are relatively small, to avoid interference with the ability of the blade <b>102</b> of the modified hockey stick <b>100</b> to hit either a ball or a puck. Likewise, the blade <b>102</b> of the modified hockey stick <b>100</b> has a sufficient width to accommodate one or more openings <b>103</b> for securing the wheels <b>104</b> or castors. In the illustrated embodiment, a conventional castor-like wheel is used, which can be locked into the opening <b>103</b> provided within the blade <b>102</b>, and to rotate and move in any direction on the playing surface. Using a castor of this type enables the player to move in any direction and have the modified hockey stick <b>100</b> respond without resistance. Alternative wheels <b>104</b> might also be used, for example, providing a single axis wheel partially extending from the bottom surface <b>102</b> <i>a </i>of the blade <b>102</b>. However, such wheels <b>104</b> may have the limitation of fully directional rolling movement to follow the player's movements without resistance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">The modified hockey stick <b>100</b> is preferably a conventional handle material construction, and is also provided with a conventional plastic, fiberglass, or wood blade construction, any of which would enable openings <b>103</b> formed in the bottom surface <b>102</b> <i>a </i>of the blade <b>102</b> and extending into the body of the blade <b>102</b> as exemplarily illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-2</figref>. The modified hockey stick <b>100</b> can be used in different versions of hockey, for example, field hockey, street hockey, roller hockey, underwater hockey, etc. The modified hockey stick <b>100</b> can be manufactured in varied sizes depending on the requirement of the version of the sport. Furthermore, players of all sizes and ages can use the modified hockey stick <b>100</b> irrespective of their skill levels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">The foregoing description conveys the best understanding of the objectives and advantages of the present invention. Different embodiments may be made of the inventive concept of this invention. It is to be understood that all matter disclosed herein is to be interpreted merely as illustrative, and not in a limiting sense.</div>
