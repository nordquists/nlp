<heading id="h-0001">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">Composite ball bats for baseball or softball are often made with one or more layers or plies of composite laminate material. In an assembled composite bat, the composite layers are often concentrically arranged, such that an inner layer forms an inner portion of a bat wall while an outer layer forms an outer portion of a bat wall. Composite layers typically include a fiber-reinforced matrix or resin material in which the fibers are parallel with the plane of the layer, such that, in an assembled bat, the fibers are arranged circumferentially around the bat's longitudinal axis, which is often referred to as the bat's X-axis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">In a typical composite bat formed with multiple layers of composite laminate material, the volume of matrix material (sometimes in the form of resin) is higher between the layers (in the interlaminar interfaces) than in the laminate layers themselves. These areas, and other areas in which the matrix material makes up much or all of the assembly, are typically referred to as “resin-rich” areas. Resin-rich areas tend to be weaker than areas reinforced with more fibers. In a typical composite ball bat (and other composite structures), there may be resin rich veins running axially (along the X-axis) within the bat wall. Designers of composite bats consider these areas when determining the overall strength of the bat. For example, designers may analyze the interlaminar shear strength of an assembled bat.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">During repeated use of composite bats, the matrix or resin of the composite material tends to crack, and the fibers tend to stretch or break. Sometimes the composite material develops interlaminar failures, which involve plies or layers of the composite materials separating or delaminating from each other along a failure plane between the layers in the interlaminar interface. For example, the plies may separate along the resin-rich areas. This “break-in” reduces stiffness and increases the elasticity or trampoline effect of a bat against a ball, which tends to temporarily increase bat performance. Typically, the separation of the plies along the resin-rich areas results in fracturing between the plies, but the fibers in the plies generally resist cracking through the thickness of the plies.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">As a bat breaks in, and before it fully fails (for example, before the bat wall experiences a through-thickness failure), it may exceed performance limitations specified by a governing body, such as limitations related to batted ball speed. Some such limitations are specifically aimed at regulating the performance of a bat that has been broken in from normal use, such as BBCOR (“Bat-Ball Coefficient of Restitution”) limitations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Some unscrupulous players choose to intentionally break in composite bats to increase performance. Intentional break-in processes may be referred to as accelerated break-in (ABI) and may include techniques such as “rolling” a bat or otherwise compressing it, or generating hard hits to the bat with an object other than a ball. Such processes tend to be more abusive than break-in during normal use, and they exploit the relatively weak interlaminar shear strength of resin-rich areas found in the composite structures of typical ball bats to try to increase batted ball speed. Some sports governing bodies require that composite bats meet certain standards even after an ABI procedure in order to limit the increase in performance from use and abuse of a composite bat.</div>

<heading id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">The present technology is directed to composite ball bats with transverse fibers and associated systems and methods. Various embodiments of the technology will now be described. The following description provides specific details for a thorough understanding and enabling description of these embodiments. One skilled in the art will understand, however, that the invention may be practiced without many of these details. Additionally, conventional or well-known aspects of ball bats and composite materials may not be shown or described in detail so as to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the relevant description of the various embodiments. Accordingly, embodiments of the present technology may include additional elements, or may exclude some of the elements described below with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-11</figref>, which illustrate examples of the technology.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">The terminology used in this description is intended to be interpreted in its broadest reasonable manner, even though it is being used in conjunction with a detailed description of certain specific embodiments of the invention. Certain terms may even be emphasized below; however, any terminology intended to be interpreted in any restricted manner will be overtly and specifically defined as such in this detailed description section.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">Where the context permits, singular or plural terms may also include the plural or singular term, respectively. Moreover, unless the word “or” is expressly limited to mean only a single item exclusive from the other items in a list of two or more items, then the use of “or” in such a list is to be interpreted as including (a) any single item in the list, (b) all of the items in the list, or (c) any combination of items in the list. Further, unless otherwise specified, terms such as “attached” or “connected” are intended to include integral connections, as well as connections between physically separate components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">Specific details of several embodiments of the present technology are described herein with reference to baseball or softball but the technology may be used in other activities, and it is not limited to use with ball bats.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a ball bat <b>100</b> having a barrel portion <b>110</b> and a handle portion <b>120</b>. There may be a transitional or taper portion <b>130</b> in which a larger diameter of the barrel portion <b>110</b> transitions to a narrower diameter of the handle portion <b>120</b>. The handle portion <b>120</b> may include an end knob <b>140</b>, and the barrel portion <b>110</b> may optionally be closed with an end cap <b>150</b>. The barrel portion <b>110</b> may include a non-tapered or straight section <b>160</b> extending between the end cap <b>150</b> and an end location <b>170</b>. In various embodiments, the taper portion <b>130</b> may include some of the barrel portion <b>110</b>, or it may include some of the handle portion <b>120</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">The bat <b>100</b> may have any suitable dimensions. For example, the bat <b>100</b> may have an overall length of 20 to 40 inches, or 26 to 34 inches. The overall barrel diameter may be 2.0 to 3.0 inches, or 2.25 to 2.75 inches. Typical ball bats have diameters of 2.25, 2.625, or 2.75 inches. Bats having various combinations of these overall lengths and barrel diameters, or any other suitable dimensions, are contemplated herein. The specific preferred combination of bat dimensions is generally dictated by the user of the bat <b>100</b>, and may vary greatly among users.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">The barrel portion <b>110</b> may be constructed with one or more composite materials. Some examples of suitable composite materials include laminate plies reinforced with fibers of carbon, glass, graphite, boron, aramid (such as Kevlar®), ceramic, or silica (such as Astroquartz®). The handle portion <b>120</b> may be constructed from the same materials as, or different materials than, the barrel portion <b>110</b>. In a two-piece ball bat, for example, the handle portion <b>120</b> may be constructed from a composite material (the same or a different material than that used to construct the barrel portion <b>110</b>), a metal material, or any other material suitable for use in a striking implement such as the bat <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">The ball striking area of the bat <b>100</b> typically extends throughout the length of the barrel portion <b>110</b>, and may extend partially into the taper portion <b>130</b> of the bat <b>100</b>. The barrel portion <b>110</b> generally includes a “sweet spot,” which is the impact location where the transfer of energy from the bat <b>100</b> to a ball is generally maximal, while the transfer of energy (such as shock or vibration) to a player's hands is generally minimal. The sweet spot is typically located near the bat's center of percussion (COP), which may be determined by the ASTM F2398-11 Standard. Another way to define the location of the sweet spot is between the first node of the first bending mode and the second node of the second bending mode. This location, which is typically about four to eight inches from the distal free end of the bat <b>100</b> (the end with the optional cap <b>150</b>), generally does not move when the bat is vibrating. For ease of measurement and description, the “sweet spot” described herein coincides with the bat's COP.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">For purposes of orientation and context for the description herein, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also illustrates a bat coordinate system <b>180</b> having axes X, Y, Z. The X axis corresponds with the longitudinal axis of the bat <b>100</b>, spanning along the length of the bat between the proximal end <b>190</b> and the distal (free) end <b>195</b>. The Y and Z-axes are orthogonal to the X-axis and to each other when the composite material (such as composite laminate plies) is generally flat, prior to forming in a rounded shape. In an assembled bat, the Z axis is oriented generally along a radial direction extending from the X-axis, transverse to the bat wall, while the Y-axis becomes generally circumferential around the bat wall in a completed bat. For ease of description herein, the Z-axis will be used to refer to the radial direction passing through the thickness of a wall of the bat <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of the bat <b>100</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In some embodiments of the present technology, the ball bat may include a barrel wall <b>200</b> surrounding a hollow interior <b>210</b>. In some embodiments, the interior <b>210</b> need not be hollow throughout the entirety of the bat <b>100</b>. For example, a bat <b>100</b> according to embodiments of the present technology may optionally include various supports or fillers in the interior <b>210</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a cross-section of a typical barrel wall according to the prior art. The cross-section may be positioned in an area similar to area A shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, or elsewhere along a bat. A typical prior art composite ball bat includes one or more layers of composite laminate <b>300</b>, each layer including fibers in a matrix material, such as a resin. In an assembled bat, the layers <b>300</b> are stacked in a concentric manner relative to the longitudinal or X-axis of the bat. As described above, prior art composite ball bats may fracture along the X-axis between the layers <b>300</b>, which is known as interlaminar shear failure. The fiber planes in typical prior art ball bats are oriented in the X-Y plane along the X-axis, along the Y-axis (projecting in and out of the drawing sheet for <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), or along a direction angled between the X-axis and the Y-axis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a cross-section of a barrel wall <b>200</b> according to an embodiment of the present technology. For example, this section may be positioned in Area A in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (or elsewhere in the ball striking area). In some embodiments, the barrel wall may include a plurality of primary or concentric layers <b>400</b> of composite laminate material (which are arranged concentrically about the longitudinal or X-axis). For example, in some embodiments, the barrel wall may include between two and ten or more concentric layers <b>400</b> of composite laminate material. Optionally, in some embodiments, the concentric layers <b>400</b> of composite laminate material may be covered with an outer skin <b>410</b>, an inner skin <b>420</b> (facing the hollow interior <b>210</b> of the ball bat), or both an outer skin <b>410</b> and an inner skin <b>420</b>. In some embodiments, the outer skin <b>410</b> may include a layer of composite laminate material or another suitable assembly of composite layers. In other embodiments, the outer skin <b>410</b> may include an elastomeric material or a reinforced elastomeric material. In some embodiments, the inner skin <b>420</b> may be formed with the same material(s) as the outer skin <b>410</b>, or in other embodiments, the inner skin <b>420</b> may include different materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">In accordance with an embodiment of the present technology, one or more secondary layers <b>430</b> of composite laminate material may be positioned in the wall and oriented generally along the Z-axis, in the Z-Y plane, transverse (such as perpendicular or oblique) to the concentric layers <b>400</b>. Such an arrangement provides radially-oriented interlaminar interfaces or shear areas between the secondary layers <b>430</b> along the Z-axis, in the Z-Y plane. For example, a resin-rich area may be formed between the layers <b>430</b> but oriented along the Z-axis (radially) rather than along the longitudinal X-axis (as is the case for the resin-rich areas between the concentric layers <b>400</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">When subjected to an ABI procedure, a barrel wall according to embodiments of the present technology may develop faults or cracks, or fail through the thickness of the wall (along the Z-axis), rather than along the length (X-axis) of the wall. The secondary layers <b>430</b> may also stop the proliferation of cracks or faults between the concentric layers <b>400</b>. By orienting the fiber axes in the Z-Y plane (radially), the hoop stiffness of the barrel will remain generally intact even if the veins of resin between secondary layers <b>430</b> have cracked. This limits or resists increases in trampoline effect from normal break-in or ABI.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, the secondary layers <b>430</b> may be made of the same material as, or different material from, the primary or concentric layers <b>400</b>. In some embodiments, the fibers in the secondary layers <b>430</b> may be uniformly aligned with each other along a direction in the Z-Y plane. For example, in some embodiments, the fibers may be aligned with the Z-axis, or they may be aligned with the Y-axis, or they may be aligned with a direction between the Z-axis or the Y-axis, such as between 0 and 90 degrees relative to the Z-axis. In some embodiments, the fibers may be oriented in a hoop arrangement or a circumferential direction around the barrel. In other embodiments, the fibers may be radially-oriented along directions extending from the bat's X-axis, or otherwise transverse to the X-axis. In other embodiments, the fibers in the secondary layers <b>430</b> may be aligned in other directions, and in accordance with various embodiments, they may or may not be uniformly aligned.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">For ease of description only, an arrangement or grouping of secondary layers <b>430</b>, such as the arrangement or grouping of secondary layers <b>430</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, may be referred to as a “Z-stack” herein. In some embodiments, a Z-stack may occupy a full length of the striking area of a ball bat. For example, a Z-stack may occupy the full length of the barrel portion <b>110</b>, and, optionally, part of the taper portion <b>130</b>. In some embodiments, a plurality of separate Z-stacks (Z-stacks spaced apart from each other) may be distributed along a full length of the striking area or along other suitable areas of the bat. In some embodiments, a Z-stack may be positioned at (such as centered around) the sweet spot of the ball bat, or at the center of the striking area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, a designer may select a length L of a Z-stack based on the interlaminar strength of the other parts of the barrel wall (for example, the primary or concentric layers <b>400</b>) and the desired performance (such as trampoline effect) of the bat. A longer length L of a Z-stack correlates with less performance increase in the bat during use or abuse, such as ABI. In some embodiments, a length L of a Z-stack may be between approximately 0.125 inches and 10 inches. In some embodiments, a length L of a Z-stack may be between one inch and four inches, depending on the length of the ball striking area and the characteristics of the resin-rich areas between various layers, or on other factors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, a thickness T of a Z-stack may be selected based on the interlaminar strength of the materials in the Z-stack (such as the type of composite ply). The interlaminar strength correlates with the strength of the interlaminar interfaces <b>440</b>, which are the interfaces between adjacent secondary layers <b>430</b> in the Z-stack.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">For example, if the materials in the Z-stack have high interlaminar strength, the thickness T of the Z-stack (which may also be the thickness T of the interlaminar interfaces between the secondary layers <b>430</b>) may be approximately five to ten percent of the overall wall thickness W. In some embodiments, the Z-stack thickness T may be 75 percent or more of the overall wall thickness W. In general, the Z-stack thickness T may be any suitable fraction of the overall wall thickness W, and the Z-stack thickness T may be limited to what is suitable for preventing or at least resisting exceeding the interlaminar strength of the primary layers <b>400</b> during use or abuse.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the Z-stack (formed with secondary layers <b>430</b>) may be positioned between the outer skin <b>410</b> and the inner skin <b>420</b>, such that the Z-stack abuts the skins <b>410</b>, <b>420</b>. However, in some embodiments, the Z-stack may be radially positioned between concentric layers <b>400</b>, for example, there may be one or more concentric layers <b>400</b> in a radially outward position (along the Z-axis) relative to the Z-stack, and one or more concentric layers <b>400</b> in a radially inward position (along the Z-axis) relative to the Z-stack, such that the Z-stack is sandwiched between primary layers <b>400</b> along the Z-axis. In particular embodiments, there may be one, two, or more concentric layers <b>400</b> positioned radially outwardly (in the Z-direction) from the Z-stack, and one, two, or more concentric layers <b>400</b> positioned radially inwardly from the Z-stack.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, a bat wall, such as a barrel wall <b>200</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), may include twenty to thirty composite laminate plies, such as 26 plies, forming the concentric layers <b>400</b>, while the Z-stack may include secondary layers <b>430</b> that together have a thickness T along the Z-axis corresponding to 22 to 24 of the concentric layers <b>400</b>. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the Z-stack may make up a majority of the wall thickness W. In some embodiments, at least ten percent of the overall wall thickness W of a bat, such as a barrel wall <b>200</b>, may comprise fibers in the Z-Y plane, in secondary layers <b>430</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">The secondary layers <b>430</b> (and their corresponding fibers therein) may be transverse (such as perpendicular or oblique) to the primary or concentric layers <b>400</b>, or otherwise oriented generally along the Z-axis. Accordingly, interlaminar interfaces <b>440</b> between the secondary layers <b>430</b> may be transverse (such as perpendicular or oblique) to the concentric layers <b>400</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a method <b>500</b> of making the secondary layers <b>430</b>, according to an embodiment of the present technology. In a first step, as illustrated in box <b>510</b>, a sheet <b>515</b> of composite laminate material is cut into pieces, such as strips <b>518</b>. Each strip <b>518</b> may have a width equivalent to the thickness T of a Z-stack. In some embodiments, each strip <b>518</b> may have the same width but, in other embodiments, each strip may have different widths.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">Each strip <b>518</b> may have a length L<b>1</b> equal to or approximately equal to one half of the circumference of a Z-stack. A bat designer would understand how to select the circumference of a Z-stack based on the dimensions of a ball bat and the position of the Z-stack in the bat (such as in the barrel wall <b>200</b>), using basic geometry considerations. In a second step, in box <b>520</b>, the strips <b>518</b> may be arranged in a stack <b>525</b>. The number of strips <b>518</b> in a stack <b>525</b> may correspond to the length L of a Z-stack (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and may depend on the thickness of each individual strip <b>518</b>. In a third step, in box <b>530</b>, the stack <b>525</b> may be bent around a mandrel or otherwise curved to form half of a Z-stack to be laid up with the primary or concentric layers <b>400</b> of composite laminate (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The method <b>500</b> may be repeated to form the other half of the Z-stack. The strips <b>518</b> may deform slightly when being curved, but they may conform during the curing process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a method <b>600</b> of making the secondary layers <b>430</b>, according to another embodiment of the present technology. In a first step, in box <b>610</b>, a sheet <b>515</b> of composite laminate material may be cut into curved pieces, such as curved strips <b>615</b>. The curved strips <b>615</b> may have a width equivalent to the thickness T of a Z-stack. A bat designer would understand how to select the radius of each curved strip <b>615</b> based on the dimensions of a ball bat and the position of the Z-stack in the bat (such as in the barrel wall <b>200</b>), using basic geometry considerations. In a second step, in box <b>620</b>, the curved strips <b>615</b> may be placed in a stack <b>625</b>, forming a Z-stack of secondary layers <b>430</b>. The number of strips <b>615</b> in a stack <b>625</b> may correspond to the length L of a Z-stack (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and may depend on the thickness of each individual curved strip <b>615</b>. The method <b>600</b> may form a semicircular stack <b>625</b>, and the method may be repeated to form a second semicircular stack <b>625</b>, which may be laid up with the concentric layers <b>400</b> of composite material (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) to form a composite bat.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">The methods <b>500</b>, <b>600</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> may use prepreg sheets <b>515</b> of composite material or, in some embodiments, the sheets <b>515</b> may be dry fiber mats, which may be wetted and cured later in the overall bat assembly using a resin transfer molding (RTM) process. Although each of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> illustrate semicircular stacks <b>525</b>, <b>625</b>, in some embodiments, the methods may include forming the stacks as complete circles before placing them into the overall composite bat assembly.</div>

In step <b>710</b>, the concentric layers <b>400</b> are laid up on a mandrel, along with the secondary layers <b>430</b> (which form a Z-stack). The concentric layers <b>400</b> and the secondary layers <b>430</b> (for example, transverse layers) may be uncured prepreg material in step <b>710</b>. In step <b>720</b>, the mandrel may be removed. In step <b>730</b>, a supporting element, such as a bladder shaped generally like a ball bat, may be inserted into the layers where the mandrel was previously positioned. In step <b>740</b>, the bladder and the layers <b>400</b>, <b>430</b> may be placed in a mold for curing in step <b>750</b> to create a ball bat according to an embodiment of the present technology (a knob <b>140</b> and end cap <b>150</b> may also be added). Although the method <b>700</b> may include laying up layers of prepreg material, in some embodiments, fiber mats may be used for the concentric layers <b>400</b> or the secondary layers <b>430</b> instead of prepreg material, and the fiber mats may be laid up on a mandrel for a resin transfer molding (RTM) process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a cross-section of a portion of a ball bat according to another embodiment of the present technology. For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> may illustrate a portion of the barrel wall <b>200</b> (see also, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The cross-section is shown symmetrically arranged relative to the longitudinal X-axis of the ball bat. In some embodiments, the barrel wall <b>200</b> may be formed using a plurality of concentric layers <b>400</b>, an optional outer skin <b>410</b>, and an optional inner skin <b>420</b>. In some embodiments, a Z-stack may be formed without cutting or forming layers or strips of composite laminate material. For example, in some embodiments, a Z-stack <b>800</b> may be formed by positioning a tube or sock <b>810</b> of fiber material or pre-preg composite material on a mandrel and compressing it along the X-axis to cause it to wrinkle into layers <b>820</b>. Although the layers <b>820</b> are illustrated with gaps therebetween, in some embodiments, the layers <b>820</b> may be directly adjacent to each other as the tube or sock <b>810</b> is compressed into its wrinkled form. The adjacent layers <b>820</b> function as secondary layers (similar to the secondary layers <b>430</b> described above with regard to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>) to provide interlaminar interfaces <b>830</b> in the Z-Y plane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">In some embodiments, the sock <b>810</b> may be a tube formed with a pre-preg material having woven or braided glass, carbon, or aramid fibers, or any other suitable fiber material, including other fiber materials mentioned herein. The sock <b>810</b> may be pushed onto a mandrel between the concentric layers <b>400</b> (to form the wrinkles and layers <b>820</b>) and co-cured with the concentric layers <b>400</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, the sock <b>810</b> may not be a pre-preg material. For example, in some embodiments, the sock <b>810</b> may be made of fibers, and a layer of resin film may be placed on top of the sock <b>810</b> to wet the sock <b>810</b> during the curing process. An example method of making an embodiment of the present technology is to place the inner skin material <b>420</b> on a bat-shaped mandrel, push the sock <b>810</b> onto the mandrel to form wrinkles with layers <b>820</b> along the Z-direction or otherwise transverse to the X-axis, then stack concentric layers <b>400</b> around the sock <b>810</b>, then lay a resin film over the sock <b>810</b>, and then cure the assembly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments, the sock <b>810</b> may be formed and cured before being placed into the bat assembly. For example, the sock <b>810</b> may be formed with a fiber mat, compressed onto a mandrel to form wrinkles, placed in a mold, injected with resin, cured, then cut into pieces to be added to a composite assembly, between the concentric layers <b>400</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">In some embodiments, other components may form the wrinkled interface that creates the layers <b>820</b>. For example, in some embodiments, a sheet of material, such as pre-preg material, may be wrapped around the circumference of a mandrel and pushed or wrinkled into a pleated arrangement to form folds constituting the layers <b>820</b>. The sock <b>810</b> or other wrinkled materials provide convenient ways to create interfaces between secondary (for example, transverse) layers and in the Z-Y plane (such as the layers <b>820</b>).</div>

However, instead of, or in addition to, an arrangement of secondary layers (<b>430</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) oriented transverse (such as perpendicular or oblique) to the primary or concentric layers <b>400</b>, a section of bulk molding compound <b>910</b> or similar material may be positioned in the barrel wall <b>200</b> (for example, forming a ring within the barrel wall).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, the bulk molding compound <b>910</b> may be laid up and cured simultaneously with the concentric layers <b>400</b> according to various composite manufacturing methods. The bulk molding compound disrupts interlaminar shear fractures between the concentric layers <b>400</b> and also limits or prevents proliferation of fractures along the Z-direction (radial direction) of the barrel wall <b>200</b>. In various embodiments, any suitable number of concentric layers <b>400</b> may be used in the barrel wall <b>200</b>, and in some embodiments, there may be a concentric layer <b>400</b> between the bulk molding compound <b>910</b> and one or both of the outer and inner skins <b>410</b>, <b>420</b>. In some embodiments, the bulk molding compound <b>910</b> may be directly adjacent to one or both of the outer and inner skins <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> (without a concentric layer <b>400</b> between the bulk molding compound <b>910</b> and the outer skin <b>410</b> or the inner skin <b>420</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a schematic sectional view of a portion of a ball bat, such as a barrel wall <b>200</b>, according to another embodiment of the present technology. In some embodiments, secondary layers <b>1010</b> may be positioned in the ball bat composite structure in a radial orientation relative to the X-axis, and in a lengthwise orientation along the X-axis of the ball bat, such that the interlaminar interfaces <b>1020</b> span a length L<b>2</b> of a portion of the ball bat along the X-axis. The secondary layers <b>1010</b> may be generally straight along the X-axis as they span the length L<b>2</b>, rather than being curved around, or cut to form a curve around, the X-axis (curved secondary layers <b>430</b> are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>). In some embodiments, the secondary layers <b>1010</b> may form most or all of the overall wall thickness W of a bat wall, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In other embodiments, other layers or skins may cover the secondary layers <b>1010</b>, inside the bat wall, outside the bat wall, or both.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates a side view of a portion of a partially constructed ball bat, such as a portion of a barrel wall <b>200</b>, according to another embodiment of the present technology. In some embodiments, a braided or twisted rope <b>1110</b> may be wrapped around a mandrel or otherwise circumferentially incorporated into the wall <b>200</b> of a ball bat. By incorporating a wrapping of rope <b>1110</b> into the bat wall structure, adjacent coils or wraps <b>1120</b> may form transverse layers functioning similarly to the secondary layers <b>430</b> described above with regard to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. For example, the coils or wraps <b>1120</b> provide interlaminar interfaces in the Z-Y plane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">In some embodiments, the rope <b>1110</b> may be laid up with the concentric layers of laminate (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and cured in a resin transfer molding (RTM) process. In other embodiments, the rope <b>1110</b> may be formed using pre-preg material and cured simultaneously with other pre-preg materials in the assembly (such as the concentric layers <b>400</b>). In some embodiments, approximately 80% to 90% of the fibers in the rope <b>1110</b> may be oriented along the Z-direction (radially) or in the Z-Y plane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">Embodiments of the present technology provide multiple advantages. For example, embodiments of the present technology provide interlaminar interfaces or shear interfaces along the Z-axis, in the Z-Y plane, or otherwise radially outward from, or transverse to (such as perpendicular or oblique to), the X-axis. Such interfaces provide less of an increase in trampoline effect, or no increase in trampoline effect, when they fracture, unlike when interfaces along the X-axis fracture. Accordingly, ball bats according to embodiments of the present technology are less prone to unfair performance increases or violations of league rules when the bats are used or abused (such as in an ABI process).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">The inventors discovered that fibers or interfaces oriented generally along a Z-direction according to various embodiments of the present technology resist or even prevent delamination along the X-Y plane or along the length of the ball bat. The fibers or plies in the Z-direction may resist a crack running only along the X-axis. Accordingly, bats according to embodiments of the present technology may fail along the Z-direction before they fail along the X-Y plane, so they become disabled after an ABI procedure rather than gaining performance beyond regulations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that specific embodiments of the disclosed technology have been described for purposes of illustration, but that various modifications may be made without deviating from the technology, and elements of certain embodiments may be interchanged with those of other embodiments, and that some embodiments may omit some elements. For example, in some embodiments, composite laminate material may be replaced by or supplemented with sheet molding compound or bulk molding compound. In some embodiments, the quantity of fibers oriented along a direction transverse to the longitudinal axis of the bat may be more than ten percent of a total quantity of fibers in a given portion of the barrel wall.</div>
