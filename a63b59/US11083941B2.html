<heading id="h-0001">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/148,572 filed on May 6, 2016 and incorporated by reference herein.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to sports implements and, more particularly, to hockey sticks and other sports implements (e.g., lacrosse sticks).</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Sports implements are used in various sports to strike, propel, or otherwise move a puck, ball, or other object.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, in hockey, a player uses a hockey stick to move, pass, and shoot a puck or ball during a game. Notably, the hockey stick comprises a shaft for holding by the player and a blade for handling the puck or ball. When not in use, it is generally desirable to have a manner in which to display and/or store the hockey stick. For instance, a retailer may wish to display a selection of hockey sticks at a point of sale (e.g., a store), or in some cases, the player may wish to display his/her hockey stick(s) at home.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">A hockey stick's structure may not provide many options for displaying and/or storing thereof. For example, traditionally, retailers display their selection of hockey sticks on a rack on which the hockey sticks may be disposed vertically by standing each hockey stick on its blade, or in other cases, on a wall support on which the hockey sticks may be disposed horizontally and supported on their shafts. Other variations of display and storage solutions exist, but in general, they involve supporting the hockey stick on its shaft and/or its blade.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Similar issues often arise in other sports, such as lacrosse, in which players use sticks or other sports implements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">For these and other reasons, there is a need for improvements in hockey sticks and other sports implements.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">It is to be expressly understood that the description and drawings are only for the purpose of illustrating certain embodiments of the invention and are an aid for understanding. They are not intended to be a definition of the limits of the invention.</div>
<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an example of a sports implement <b>10</b> for use by a player playing a sport, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. The sports implement <b>10</b> comprises an elongate member <b>12</b> configured to be held by the player and an object-contacting member <b>14</b> configured to contact an object (e.g., a puck or ball) intended to be moved in a game. In this embodiment, the sport is hockey and the sports implement <b>10</b> is a hockey stick for use by the player to pass, shoot or otherwise move a puck or ball. The elongate member <b>12</b> of the hockey stick <b>10</b> is a shaft, which comprises a handle <b>20</b> of the hockey stick <b>10</b>, and the object-contacting member <b>14</b> of the hockey stick <b>10</b> is a blade.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">In this example, the hockey stick <b>10</b> is a “mini” hockey stick, i.e., a miniaturized version of a hockey stick, which can be used by the player (e.g., a child or other individual) for playing “mini” hockey (e.g., with a miniaturized version of a hockey goal). In other examples, the hockey stick <b>10</b> may have a regular size (i.e., not be a mini hockey stick) to be used by the player to play regular hockey (e.g., ice hockey, roller hockey, or street hockey).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">The hockey stick <b>10</b> comprises an end cap <b>30</b> defining a longitudinal end <b>32</b> of the hockey stick <b>10</b>, which can sometimes be referred to as a “butt end” of the hockey stick <b>10</b>. In this embodiment, the end cap <b>30</b> is provided to aesthetically complete the hockey stick <b>10</b> and to enhance use of the hockey stick <b>10</b>, such as by protecting the player and/or helping the player manipulate the hockey stick <b>10</b> when playing. In addition, in this embodiment, as further discussed below, the end cap <b>30</b> allows the hockey stick <b>10</b> to be hung, such as at a point of sale (e.g., a store) or another location where the hockey stick <b>10</b> may be displayed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">The shaft <b>12</b> is configured to be held by the player to use the hockey stick <b>10</b>. The shaft <b>12</b> includes a front surface <b>16</b> and a rear surface <b>18</b> opposite one another, as well as a top surface <b>22</b> and a bottom surface <b>24</b> opposite one another. Longitudinal proximal and distal end portions <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> of the shaft <b>12</b> are respectively adjacent to the handle <b>20</b> and the blade <b>14</b> and define a length of the shaft <b>12</b>. A length L of the hockey stick <b>10</b> is measured from a proximal end <b>34</b> of the shaft <b>12</b> along the top surface <b>22</b> of the shaft <b>12</b> through the blade <b>14</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. For example, in some embodiments, since the hockey stick <b>10</b> is a mini hockey stick in this example, the length L of the hockey stick <b>10</b> may be no more than 30 inches, in some cases no more than 25 inches, in some cases no more than 20 inches, in some cases no more than 18 inches, and in some cases no more than 16 inches, and in some cases even less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">A cross-section of the shaft <b>16</b> may have any suitable configuration. For instance, in this embodiment, with additional reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the cross-section of the shaft <b>12</b> has a major axis <b>36</b> which defines a major dimension D of the shaft's cross-section and a minor axis <b>38</b> which defines a minor dimension W of the shaft's cross-section. In this example, the cross-section of the shaft <b>12</b> is generally polygonal. More particularly, in this example, the cross-section of the shaft <b>12</b> is generally rectangular, with the front surface <b>16</b>, the rear surface <b>18</b>, the top surface <b>22</b>, and the bottom surface <b>24</b> being generally flat. Corners between these surfaces of the shaft <b>12</b> may be rounded corners.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">In this embodiment, the shaft <b>12</b> is a composite shaft. That is, the shaft <b>12</b> is at least mainly (i.e., mainly or entirely) made of composite material. For example, in this embodiment, the shaft <b>12</b> comprises a wall <b>40</b> made of the composite material and forming a cavity <b>42</b> which extends along at least part, in this case all, of its length. The cavity defines an internal surface <b>45</b> of the shaft <b>12</b>. The cavity <b>42</b> may be hollow or may contain a filler (e.g., foam). For instance, the shaft <b>12</b> may be a fiber-matrix composite shaft comprising fibers disposed within a hardened resin matrix. The fibers may be aligned and oriented in defined directions with an outer layer often being a woven fiber. Various fibers may be employed including carbon, aramid, boron, glass, etc. The shaft <b>12</b> may have aligned layers of fibers and a woven outer layer. The shaft <b>12</b> may be formed by wrapping plies over a mandrel and then curing or by overlaying fibers around a mandrel that is then fed into a heating element to cure the resin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">The shaft <b>12</b> may have any other suitable shape and/or be constructed in any other suitable way in other embodiments. For example, in some embodiments, the cross-section of the shaft <b>12</b> may have any other suitable configuration (e.g., the front surface <b>16</b>, the rear surface <b>18</b>, the top surface <b>22</b>, and/or the bottom surface <b>24</b> may be curved and/or angular and/or have any other suitable shape) and/or may vary along the length of the shaft <b>12</b>. As another example, in some embodiments, the shaft <b>12</b> may comprise wood, aluminum or any other suitable material (e.g., the shaft <b>12</b> may be a metallic shaft made of aluminum or other suitable metal, may be made of a combination of metal and fiber composite, or may be a wooden shaft).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">The blade <b>14</b> is configured to allow the player to pass, shoot or otherwise move the puck or ball. With additional reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in this embodiment, the blade <b>14</b> comprises a shank <b>44</b>, a heel <b>46</b> and a blade element <b>48</b>. The heel <b>46</b> is located at a junction of the shank <b>44</b> and the blade element <b>48</b>. The shank <b>44</b> interfaces with the shaft <b>12</b>. In some embodiments where the blade <b>14</b> is adapted to be inserted into a hollow space of the shaft <b>12</b> (e.g., the cavity <b>42</b>), the shank <b>44</b> may comprise a tenon for insertion in that hollow space. A periphery <b>50</b> of the blade <b>14</b> comprises a front surface <b>52</b> and a rear surface <b>54</b> opposite one another, as well as a top edge <b>56</b>, a tip edge <b>58</b> and a bottom edge <b>60</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">In this embodiment, with additional reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the blade <b>14</b> comprises a foam core <b>62</b> wrapped with one or more layers of fiber material <b>64</b>. The foam core <b>62</b> may include one or more foam materials (e.g., polyurethane foam, etc.). The layers of fiber material <b>64</b> may include fibers (e.g., glass fibers, carbon fibers, aramid fibers, etc.) that may have been preimpregnated with resin to be taped on the foam core <b>62</b> during manufacturing. In some embodiments, the layers of fiber material <b>64</b> may be stitched to the foam core <b>62</b> during manufacturing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">The blade <b>14</b> may have any other suitable shape and/or be constructed in any other suitable way in other embodiments. For example, in some embodiments, the blade <b>14</b> may comprise a wooden core. Also, the blade <b>14</b> may be a replaceable component of the hockey stick <b>10</b> and thus removable from the shaft <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">The end cap <b>30</b> is mountable to the shaft <b>12</b> adjacent to the handle <b>20</b> to define the longitudinal end <b>32</b> of the hockey stick <b>10</b>. In this embodiment, the end cap <b>30</b> forms an enlargement that is larger than the cross-section of the shaft <b>12</b> at the handle <b>20</b>. This may be useful, for instance, to help the player pick up the hockey stick <b>10</b> when it is dropped. Also, in this embodiment, the end cap <b>30</b> is removably mountable to the shaft <b>12</b> such that it can be mounted and removed from the shaft <b>12</b> as desired.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">With additional reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 13</figref>, the end cap <b>30</b> comprises an end portion <b>66</b> comprising an end <b>68</b> of the end cap <b>30</b> that defines the longitudinal end <b>32</b> of the hockey stick <b>10</b> and a hanging portion <b>70</b> comprising a hanger <b>72</b> to hang the hockey stick. The hockey stick <b>10</b> may be hung by the hanger <b>72</b> on a support <b>74</b>, which may comprise a hook, a bar, a pin, or any other device on which the hockey stick <b>10</b> can be hung.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">The hanger <b>72</b> is adjustable. That is, the hanger <b>72</b> is changeable in state, i.e., in position, configuration, and/or one or more other aspects. Notably, in this embodiment, the hanger <b>72</b> can be adjusted depending on whether the hockey stick <b>10</b> is to be hung on the support <b>74</b> or used to play.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">The end cap <b>30</b> extends from the end <b>68</b>, which is a first end, to a second end <b>69</b> along a longitudinal axis <b>75</b> which defines a longitudinal direction of the end cap <b>30</b>. The end portion <b>66</b> of the end cap <b>30</b> is configured to be precluded from being inserted into a hollow space of the shaft <b>12</b> adjacent to the handle <b>20</b> (e.g., the cavity <b>42</b>). To that end, the end portion <b>66</b> has cross-sectional dimensions that are larger than the cross-sectional dimensions of the shaft <b>12</b>. More particularly, a cross-section of the end portion <b>66</b> normal to the longitudinal direction of the end cap <b>30</b> is larger than a cross-section of the shaft <b>12</b> normal to the longitudinal direction of the shaft <b>12</b>. In this embodiment, the end cap <b>30</b> has a plurality of lateral sides <b>76</b> <sub>1</sub>, <b>76</b> <sub>2</sub>, <b>76</b> <sub>3</sub>, <b>76</b> <sub>4</sub>, including a first lateral side <b>76</b> <sub>1 </sub>opposite to a second lateral side <b>76</b> <sub>2</sub>, and a third lateral side <b>76</b> <sub>3 </sub>opposite to a fourth lateral side <b>76</b> <sub>4</sub>. In use, the first and second lateral sides <b>76</b> <sub>1</sub>, <b>76</b> <sub>2 </sub>of the end cap <b>30</b> face the front and rear surfaces <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> of the shaft <b>12</b> respectively while the third and fourth lateral sides <b>76</b> <sub>3</sub>, <b>76</b> <sub>4 </sub>of the end cap <b>30</b> face the top and bottom surfaces <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> of the shaft <b>12</b> respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">In this embodiment, the end cap <b>30</b> is generally rectangular and thus has four lateral sides. However, in other embodiments, for example where the shaft <b>12</b> may have more or less than four lateral sides (e.g., in cases where the shaft has a hexagonal cross-section), the end cap <b>30</b> may have more or fewer lateral sides in order to match the sides of the shaft <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">Also, in this embodiment, contrary to the end portion <b>66</b>, the hanging portion <b>70</b> of the end cap <b>30</b> is configured to be inserted into the cavity <b>42</b> of the shaft <b>12</b>. To that end, the cross-sectional dimensions of the hanging portion <b>70</b> are made smaller than the cross-sectional dimensions of the end portion <b>66</b>. More particularly, the cross-section of the end portion <b>66</b> of the end cap <b>30</b> normal to the longitudinal direction of the end cap <b>30</b> is larger than a cross-section of the hanging portion <b>70</b> normal to the longitudinal direction of the end cap <b>30</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">The hanging portion <b>70</b> comprises an attachment <b>78</b> defining the second end <b>69</b> of the end cap <b>30</b>. In this embodiment, the attachment <b>78</b> is such that it fits tightly into the cavity <b>42</b> of the shaft <b>12</b> to prevent the end cap <b>30</b> from being accidentally removed from the hockey stick <b>10</b> when used by the player. As such, the attachment <b>78</b> is configured to engage the internal surface <b>45</b> of the shaft <b>12</b>. More particularly, in this embodiment, the attachment <b>78</b> is configured to engage the internal surface <b>45</b> of the shaft <b>12</b> via a press-fit. In other words, the attachment <b>78</b> is a “press-fit” attachment that engages the internal surface <b>45</b> of the shaft <b>12</b> by a press-fit of the hanging portion <b>70</b> in the cavity <b>42</b> of the shaft <b>12</b>. As such, the attachment <b>78</b> frictionally engages the internal surface <b>45</b> of the shaft <b>12</b>. To that end, in this embodiment, the attachment <b>78</b> comprises a plurality of attachment members <b>80</b> <sub>1</sub>-<b>80</b> <sub>A </sub>that are spaced apart from one another in the longitudinal direction of the end cap <b>30</b>. Each attachment member <b>80</b> <sub>i </sub>engages the internal surface <b>45</b> of the shaft <b>12</b>. The attachment <b>78</b> comprises a core <b>82</b> from which the attachment members <b>80</b> <sub>1</sub>-<b>80</b> <sub>A </sub>project outwardly (in use, towards the internal surface <b>45</b> of the shaft <b>12</b>). In this embodiment, a cross-section of the core <b>82</b> normal to the longitudinal direction of the end cap <b>30</b> varies in size in the longitudinal direction of the end cap <b>30</b>. More specifically, in this example of implementation, the core <b>82</b> tapers in the longitudinal direction of the end cap <b>30</b> away from the end portion <b>66</b> of the end cap <b>30</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">In this embodiment, the hanger <b>72</b> of the hanging portion <b>70</b> comprises a body portion <b>84</b> and an opening <b>86</b> in the body portion <b>84</b> for receiving the support <b>74</b> for the hockey stick <b>10</b>. More specifically, in this example of implementation, the opening <b>86</b> is disposed in a recess <b>88</b> in the body portion <b>84</b> and extends from the first lateral side <b>76</b> <sub>1 </sub>to the second lateral side <b>76</b> <sub>2 </sub>of the end cap <b>30</b>. The opening <b>86</b> may extend from the third lateral side <b>76</b> <sub>3 </sub>to the fourth lateral side <b>76</b> <sub>4 </sub>of the end cap <b>30</b> in other embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">In this example of implementation, the hanger <b>72</b> is adjustable between a “hanging state” in which the hockey stick <b>10</b> is hangable by the hanger <b>72</b> (e.g., on the support <b>74</b>) and a “non-hanging state” in which the hockey stick <b>10</b> is not hangable by the hanger <b>72</b>. Thus, the hanging state of the hanger <b>72</b> is for displaying the hockey stick <b>10</b> while the non-hanging state of the hanger <b>72</b> is for using the hockey stick <b>10</b> to play hockey.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">In this embodiment, the hanger <b>72</b> is adjustable such that the hanger <b>72</b> is movable relative to the shaft <b>12</b>. That is, a position of the hanger <b>72</b> relative to the shaft <b>12</b> is different in the hanging state of the hanger <b>72</b> and in the non-hanging state of the hanger <b>72</b>. In particular, the hanger <b>72</b> is movable relative to the shaft <b>12</b> between a hanging position in which the hockey stick <b>10</b> is hangable by the hanger <b>72</b> and a non-hanging position in which the hockey stick <b>10</b> is not hangable by the hanger <b>72</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">In the hanging position, the hanger <b>72</b> is exposed such that the hanger <b>72</b> is accessible. In the non-hanging position, the hanger <b>72</b> is concealed such that the hanger <b>72</b> is inaccessible. More specifically, in the non-hanging position, the hanger <b>72</b> extends deeper into the cavity <b>42</b> of the shaft <b>12</b> than when the hanger <b>72</b> is in the hanging position.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">The hanging portion <b>70</b> further comprises a retainer <b>90</b> to retain the hanger <b>72</b> relative to the shaft <b>12</b> to allow the hanger <b>72</b> to hang the hockey stick <b>10</b>. More specifically, the retainer <b>90</b> retains the hanger <b>72</b> in the hanging position such that the hanger <b>72</b> is exposed and accessible. To that end, the retainer <b>90</b> is configured to engage a longitudinal end of the shaft <b>12</b>, notably the proximal end <b>34</b>, to resist insertion of the hanging portion <b>70</b> of the end cap <b>30</b> into the cavity <b>42</b> of the shaft <b>12</b> beyond the retainer <b>90</b>. In this example of implementation, the retainer <b>90</b> comprises a retaining projection <b>92</b> projecting transversally to the longitudinal direction of the end cap <b>30</b>. In this embodiment, the retaining projection <b>92</b> extends on the first lateral side <b>76</b> <sub>1 </sub>of the end cap <b>30</b>. That is, the retaining projection <b>92</b> extends on a single one of the lateral sides <b>76</b> <sub>1</sub>, <b>76</b> <sub>2</sub>, <b>76</b> <sub>3</sub>, <b>76</b> <sub>4 </sub>of the end cap <b>30</b>. In other embodiments, the retaining projection <b>92</b> may extend on more than one of the lateral sides <b>76</b> <sub>1</sub>, <b>76</b> <sub>2</sub>, <b>76</b> <sub>3</sub>, <b>76</b> <sub>4 </sub>of the end cap <b>30</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">The retainer <b>90</b> is deformable to adjust the hanger <b>72</b>. In particular, the retainer <b>90</b> is deformable such that it deforms when an increased load is applied on the end cap <b>30</b> to insert the end cap <b>30</b> into the cavity <b>42</b> of the shaft <b>12</b> beyond the retainer <b>90</b>. That is, the retainer <b>90</b> resists insertion of the hanging portion <b>70</b> of the end cap <b>30</b> into the cavity <b>42</b> of the shaft <b>12</b> as long as a load applied on the end cap <b>30</b> to insert the end cap <b>30</b> into the cavity <b>42</b> is smaller than an insertion load F<sub>IN</sub>. Once the load applied on the end cap <b>30</b> to further insert the end cap <b>30</b> into the cavity <b>42</b> is equal to or greater than the insertion load F<sub>IN</sub>, the retainer <b>90</b> deforms thus allowing further insertion of the end cap <b>30</b> into the cavity <b>42</b> of the shaft <b>12</b> to move the hanger <b>72</b> into its non-hanging position. As such, the retainer <b>90</b> is deformable to move the hanger <b>72</b> between the hanging position and the non-hanging position.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">In this embodiment, the end cap <b>30</b> comprises an elastomeric material. For instance, in this example, the end cap <b>30</b> comprises rubber. In other embodiments, the end cap <b>30</b> may be made from any other suitable material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">Also, in this embodiment, the end cap <b>30</b> is a one-piece end cap. That is, an entirety of the end cap <b>30</b> is integrally made and thus constitutes a single component. More specifically, in this embodiment, the end cap <b>30</b> is molded to constitute a molded one-piece end cap. In this example of implementation, the end cap <b>30</b> is injection molded. The end cap <b>30</b> may be molded in any other suitable way.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">Thus, the hockey player or retailer wishing to display and/or store the hockey stick <b>10</b> causes the hanger <b>72</b> to be in its hanging state such as to hang the hockey stick <b>10</b> by the hanger <b>72</b> (e.g., via the support <b>74</b>). At a point of sale, this may be useful to hang multiple hockey sticks on a single support <b>74</b>. Once it is no longer desired to hang the hockey stick <b>10</b> by the hanger <b>72</b>, the hockey player or retailer causes the hanger <b>72</b> to be changed to its non-hanging state. For example, an instruction is provided to change the hanger <b>72</b> to its non-hanging state once the hockey stick <b>10</b> is removed from the support <b>74</b> at the point of sale of the hockey stick <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">The hockey stick <b>10</b> may be constructed in various other ways in other embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">For instance, in a variant, the hanger <b>72</b> can be adjusted from its hanging state to its non-hanging state without changing the position of the hanger <b>72</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the hanger <b>72</b> may comprise an adjustment mechanism <b>94</b> for adjusting the hanger <b>72</b> from its hanging state to its non-hanging state. In these cases, the retainer <b>90</b> of the hanging portion <b>70</b> abuts the longitudinal end <b>34</b> of the shaft <b>12</b> to preclude insertion of the end cap <b>30</b> into the cavity <b>42</b> of the shaft <b>12</b> beyond the retainer <b>90</b> (e.g., the retainer <b>90</b> may not be deformable and/or is dimensioned to prevent insertion of the end cap <b>30</b> into the cavity <b>42</b> beyond the retainer <b>90</b>). In this example of implementation, the adjustment mechanism <b>94</b> comprises a filling member <b>96</b> configured for filling the opening <b>86</b> of the hanger <b>72</b>. In the hanging state of the hanger <b>72</b>, the opening <b>86</b> is unfilled such that the hockey stick <b>10</b> can be hanged by the hanger <b>72</b>. In the non-hanging state of the hanger <b>72</b>, the opening <b>86</b> of the hanger <b>72</b> is filled by the filling member <b>96</b> such that the hockey stick <b>10</b> is not hangable by the hanger <b>72</b>. It is noted that in this variant, the hanger <b>72</b> is exposed both in the hanging state and in the non-hanging state of the hanger <b>72</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">In this specific example of implementation, the filling member <b>96</b> of the adjustment mechanism <b>94</b> is integrally made with the end cap <b>30</b>. That is, the filling member <b>96</b> of the adjustment mechanism <b>94</b> and the end cap <b>30</b> are a one-piece component. For instance, the filling member <b>96</b> may be connected to the remainder of the end cap <b>30</b> (e.g., to the body portion <b>84</b> of the hanger <b>72</b>) by an arm <b>98</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">In another variant, the end cap <b>30</b> may not be removable from the hockey stick <b>10</b>. That is, in some embodiments, the end cap <b>30</b> may be a permanent component of the hockey stick <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">In another variant, the end cap <b>30</b> may comprise components that are movable relative to one another and interact to allow the end cap <b>30</b> to be hangable and non-hangable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">For instance, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 to 20</figref> show an end cap <b>130</b> that is similar to the end cap <b>30</b> but functions differently. The end cap <b>130</b> comprises a hanging portion <b>171</b> and a base <b>178</b> that are separate from one another. The base <b>178</b> is such that it fits tightly into the cavity <b>42</b> of the shaft <b>12</b> to prevent the end cap <b>130</b> from being accidentally removed from the hockey stick <b>10</b> when used by the player. As such, the base <b>178</b> is configured to engage the internal surface <b>45</b> of the shaft <b>12</b>. To that end, the base <b>178</b> comprises an attachment portion <b>179</b> configured in a similar manner to the attachment <b>78</b> described above in respect of the end cap <b>30</b>. Notably, in this example of implementation, the attachment portion <b>179</b> of the base <b>178</b> comprises a plurality of attachment members <b>180</b> <sub>1</sub>-<b>180</b> <sub>A </sub>that are spaced apart from one another in a longitudinal direction of the end cap <b>130</b>. Each attachment member <b>180</b> <sub>i</sub>; engages the internal surface <b>45</b> of the shaft <b>12</b>. The attachment portion <b>179</b> also comprises a core <b>182</b> from which the attachment members <b>180</b> <sub>1</sub>-<b>180</b> <sub>A </sub>project outwardly (in use, towards the internal surface <b>45</b> of the shaft <b>12</b>). The core <b>182</b> is similar to the core <b>82</b> described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">In this example, the base <b>178</b> also comprises an end portion <b>176</b> that is enlarged relative to the core <b>182</b> and the attachment members <b>180</b> <sub>1</sub>-<b>180</b> <sub>A</sub>. More specifically, the end portion <b>176</b> is sized such that it abuts the longitudinal end <b>34</b> of the shaft <b>12</b> to preclude insertion of the base <b>178</b> into the cavity <b>42</b> of the shaft <b>12</b> beyond the end portion <b>176</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">The hanging portion <b>171</b> comprises a hanger <b>172</b> that is configured similarly to the hanger <b>72</b> described above in many respects, notably comprising a body portion <b>187</b> and an opening <b>186</b> in the body portion <b>187</b> for receiving the support <b>74</b> for the hockey stick <b>10</b>. The hanger <b>172</b> also comprises an end portion <b>190</b> that defines the longitudinal end <b>32</b> of the hockey stick <b>10</b>. The hanger <b>172</b> is adjustable between a hanging state in which the hockey stick <b>10</b> is hangable by the hanger <b>172</b> and a non-hanging state in which the hockey stick <b>10</b> is not hangable by the hanger <b>172</b>. The hanging state of the hanger <b>172</b> is for displaying the hockey stick <b>10</b> while the non-hanging state of the hanger <b>172</b> is for using the hockey stick <b>10</b> to play hockey.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">The hanger <b>172</b> is movable relative to the base <b>178</b> in the longitudinal direction of the end cap <b>130</b> to be adjusted. Thus, a position of the hanger <b>172</b> relative to the base <b>178</b> is different in the hanging state of the hanger <b>172</b> and in the non-hanging state of the hanger <b>172</b>. In particular, the hanger <b>172</b> is movable relative to the base <b>178</b> between a hanging position in which the hockey stick <b>10</b> is hangable by the hanger <b>172</b> and a non-hanging position in which the hockey stick <b>10</b> is not hangable by the hanger <b>172</b>. To that end, the hanger <b>172</b> is disposed in a cavity <b>184</b> of the base <b>178</b> that extends in the longitudinal direction of the end cap <b>130</b>. The cavity <b>184</b> is defined by an inner surface <b>186</b> of the base <b>178</b> and, in this example, traverses an entirety of the base <b>178</b>, including the core <b>182</b> and the end portion <b>176</b> thereof. In the hanging position, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 20</figref>, the hanger <b>172</b> is exposed such that the hanger <b>172</b> is accessible. In the non-hanging position, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the hanger <b>172</b> is concealed such that the hanger <b>172</b> is inaccessible. More specifically, the hanger <b>72</b> extends deeper into the cavity <b>184</b> of the base <b>178</b> when in the non-hanging position than when in the hanging position.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">The hanger <b>172</b> is configured to be retained in the cavity <b>184</b> of the base <b>178</b> such as to resist movement of the hanger <b>172</b> relative to the base <b>178</b>. For instance, the body <b>187</b> of the hanger <b>172</b> comprises an exterior peripheral surface <b>188</b> that engages the inner surface <b>186</b> of the base <b>178</b> such that a frictional engagement between the exterior peripheral surface <b>188</b> of the body <b>187</b> of the hanger <b>172</b> and the inner surface <b>186</b> of the base <b>178</b> retains the hanger <b>172</b> in the cavity <b>184</b> of the base <b>178</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">In this embodiment, the hanger <b>172</b> is movable relative to the base <b>178</b> by applying an insertion force on the end portion <b>190</b> of the hanger <b>172</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. The insertion force that is applied to move the hanger <b>172</b> relative to the base <b>178</b> must be sufficient to overcome a frictional force generated between the external peripheral surface <b>188</b> of the body <b>187</b> of the hanger <b>172</b> and the inner surface <b>186</b> of the base <b>178</b>. Thus, by applying the insertion force, the hanger <b>172</b> can be pushed further into engagement with the base <b>178</b>. Alternatively, the hanger <b>172</b> can be pulled away from the base <b>178</b> by applying a pulling force that will overcome the frictional force generated between the external peripheral surface <b>188</b> of the body <b>187</b> of the hanger <b>172</b> and the inner surface <b>186</b> of the base <b>178</b>. The resistance to movement of the hanger <b>172</b> relative to the base <b>178</b> provided by the interaction between the surfaces <b>186</b>, <b>188</b> may prevent removal of the hanger <b>172</b> from the base <b>178</b> or may make it sufficiently difficult to remove such as to prevent accidental removal of the hanger <b>172</b> from the base <b>178</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">In this example of implementation, the hanger <b>172</b> is also configured to be prevented from entering too far into the cavity <b>184</b> of the base <b>178</b>. To that end, the hanger <b>172</b> comprises a protrusion <b>191</b> at the end portion <b>190</b> of the hanger <b>172</b>. The protrusion <b>191</b> is configured to engage the base <b>178</b> such as to prevent insertion of the hanger <b>172</b> into the cavity <b>184</b> beyond the protrusion <b>191</b>. This may be achieved by sizing the protrusion <b>191</b> such that it does not fit within the cavity <b>184</b> of the base <b>178</b>. Furthermore, in this example, the protrusion <b>191</b> is configured to engage a recess <b>192</b> of the base <b>178</b> that is sized such as to receive the protrusion <b>191</b>. Thus at least a portion of the protrusion <b>191</b> is received within the recess <b>192</b>. In some cases, this may allow the end portion <b>190</b> of the hanger <b>172</b> to be flush with a top surface <b>175</b> of the base <b>178</b> when the hanger <b>172</b> is in its non-hanging position.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">Although in this embodiment the sports implement <b>10</b> is a hockey stick, in other embodiments, the sports implement <b>10</b> may be any other implement used for striking, propelling or otherwise moving an object in a game of another sport.
