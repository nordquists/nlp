<div class="description-paragraph"> My invention relates to improvements in the art of play balls, designed to provide an article of manufacture deviating from the common unbroken spherical ball body used for play, and which can be manufactured of any suitable substance other than rubber as well. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The principal object of my invention is to b n 0 young, the diameter of the ball being regulated strictly by the purpose of its use. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> At present there are few lawn games of easy and practical application, and with few exceptions, cement or other specially preared courts or grounds are necessary. ne </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> object in this invention is to provide the means for a game that can be played on any lawn or yard or any suitable place without special preparation or change. Furthermore to provide such a means that anyone may play without undue strain or effort and, what is of utmost importance, without the necessity of stooping common to practically every outdoor game. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Ball games particularly for lawns have been of two major types, first, where the ball is rolled by hitting it, as in croquet, and second, where it is released by an underhand throw similar to a low long swing of the arm 0 as in bowling. In my invention neither of these methods is used, the ball rests on the ground and is rolled toward the goal by means of a pusher that gives it a rotary motion from the start. It is not a blow, nor a throw or a sliding force, but a continuous rolling motion from start to finish, and exceedingly effective with very little effort. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> I attain this object by means of the combination illustrated in the accompanying drawing, in which surface on which it rests, and, if desired, pro- 1929. Serial No. 351,648. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Figure 1 is a ball in elevation, and having a circumferential groove or recess, and shows a form ,oftransverse axle. I </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Figure 2 is an elevation on line X2-X2 Figure 1, showing the axis, through the body of the ball. I </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Figure 3 is a side elevation showing one form of pushing rod, one end of which is forked to straddle the outwardly extending axle ends. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Figure 4a is a mid-sectional elevation showing another form of pushing rod, the forked end of which straddles the circumferential groove of the ball body. 1 </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Figure 5 shows a further modified form of push rod, 2. turned-under member or hook being incorporated in combination with the forked end, and serves to provide an ade quate means for lifting the ball from the vides also a ready means for pulling the ball. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Figure 6 is a plan view of a solid ball indicating both the appearance and position of the engaging push rod of the type shown in Figures 3 and 5. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Similar numerals refer to similar parts throughout the several views. 1 </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 1 indicates a ball having convex sides 2 and 3, 4 indicates a transverse axle that extends beyond said sides 2 and 3 and which terminate in flanged ends 5. Disposed on the circumferential body of the ball and intermediate said convex sides is a recess or groove 6. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> As a means of rotating the ball I provide a pushing rod 7 having a handle 8, and as-indicated in Figure 6, a forked end 9 having members 11 and 12 which in one form of pushing rod terminate in forks 13 and 14 adapted to straddle the axle 4 as is shown in Figures 3 and 6. 90 </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> As a modification of the pushing rod, said members 11 and 12 are provided with hooks 15 and 16 as shown in Figure 5, and for all practical purposes, a pushing rod may be employed of either type, that is, with or with- '95 out the hooks. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Referring now to Figure 4, a further modification of the pushing rod is employed when the play-er elects to cause the ball to roll by means of contact with the circumferential groove in place of the axle ends, the handle 8 terminating into a fork comprising members 10 adapted to engage said groove. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As a practical article of manufacture, the </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> ball can be produced either as a solid or holloW object and While the drawing shows the ball With the axle extending beyon'd'its sides, it is obvious that it can be made With or Without an axle or in combination .asishown, either type of ball as may be preferable, serving the purpose alike. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> As a means for formulating a game, iny-device oflers a practical and most efficient combination. It will be found equallyinteresting for indoor-games as for out-door games; requires. similar skill "for prOpelling the ball in a 'given' direction as in' croquet and billiards, the rolling or forwardmo-vement of lthe-baill b eingas'rpracticahas it is new. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">i I am awaa'elthat 'slighlt modifications amay from time to time be made in the details of construction without departing, however, fromthe'ascope of the present invention-as herein :setrfdrth, and as defined in the cl aims which are appended hereto. Hence, I do not limit :my present invention to the' exact description" of construction herein disclosed, but-whatl *do claim as new and .novel is 1. The combination 10f a ball having means 3 projecting therefrom for engagement by a propellingmember, the latter consisting of a grip :member and hook means, :said hook means ha ving a part: opening forwardly for engagement with the firstrmentioned means for pu-shimgthe balland a part opening re ar- Wardly for'engagement With thesame means for drawing the ball backWardly. </div>
