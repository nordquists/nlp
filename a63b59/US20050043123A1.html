<li> <para-num num="[0001]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0001" num="0001"> This invention relates to lacrosse sticks. </div>
</li> <heading id="d0e166">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0002" num="0002"> In the game of lacrosse, players use sticks to receive and shoot a ball. Lacrosse sticks generally include an elongated stem and a head portion. The player grips a handle located toward the butt end of the stem, and utilizes the head portion, which includes mesh, to receive and shoot the ball during play. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0003" num="0003"> Decades ago, some lacrosse sticks were manufactured as one-piece, integral wooden structures. Such sticks were not only difficult and costly to fabricate, but owing to their unitary mechanical properties, also limited the maneuvers that a player could execute. For example, the stiff wood, while necessary for handle strength, was poorly suited to the head portion; the lack of flexibility would, for example, limit the player's ability to scoop up the ball from the ground or make it more difficult for a player to receive a hard pass without feeling excessive vibrations. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0004" num="0004"> As a result, it has become commonplace to fabricate lacrosse sticks using a stem element formed of straight grained wood, or wood laminate, or a tough, lightweight metallic or reinforced plastic tubular element and to affix to the forward end of the stem a flexible head frame (composed, for example, of a tough synthetic thermoplastic material such as high impact-strength nylon). Indeed, most lacrosse sticks today are sold as separate head and stem portions. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0005" num="0005"> A typical head frame for a lacrosse stick includes a socket to receive the forward end of the stem. The stem is then coupled to the head frame by a fastener, such as a screw. One problem with such a construction is that the connection between the head frame and stem may loosen during play, compromising the player's ability to effectively control his stick. Worse, in some instances the head frame may detach entirely from the stem. </div>
</li> <heading id="d0e192">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0006" num="0006"> The invention provides a novel lacrosse stick having a continuous stem and head frame. The stem of the lacrosse stick is stiffer than at least a distal end of the head frame and provides a player with a superior stick for the game of lacrosse. Because of its unitary structure, the lacrosse stick of the present invention is more durable than prior art devices. Moreover, because of the differential stiffness between the stem and head frame portions, a player will be able to scoop balls from the turf more easily, receive hard passes with comfort, and generate hard shots because of the whip like action of the stick. </div>

At least a distal end of the head frame is flexible. The lacrosse stick further includes an elongated stem portion extending from a proximal end of the head frame, and the stem and head frame share at least a common continuous exterior material so as to define a unitary structure. </div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0009" num="0009"> In a different embodiment, the head frame and the stem are integrally continuous portions of a single mechanical structure. The head frame and stem may be integrally fabricated by injection molding. Also, the head frame may contain a progressively reduced amount of reinforcing material. Moreover, the combination of materials injected to form the stem may provide greater rigidity than materials injected to form the head frame. </div>

A variety of handles <b>15</b> can be used in accordance with the invention. For instance, in one embodiment, the handle <b>15</b> is a hollow rubber knob that slides onto and caps the butt end <b>18</b> of the lacrosse stick <b>10</b>. In another embodiment, the handle <b>15</b> is an injection-molded plastic grip with grooves designed to accommodate a player's fingers that slides onto the lacrosse stick <b>10</b>.

The distal end <b>23</b> of the wall members <b>30</b> forms a generally arcuate nose element <b>38</b>, which bridges the sides that converge towards the stem <b>14</b>. The wall member <b>30</b> includes an upper rim <b>37</b> and a lower rim <b>39</b>. The lower rim <b>39</b> may have a plurality of apertures <b>43</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) spaced about its periphery to receive a mesh (not shown). In use, the mesh is suspended from the apertures <b>43</b> to define a bottom closure of the head frame <b>26</b>. In another embodiment, the mesh is coupled to the head frame <b>26</b> by fasteners (not shown). In general, the mesh can be coupled to the head frame <b>26</b> using any suitable means. </div>

The mouth <b>46</b> is generally divisible into two functional portions. The first is a throat portion <b>50</b> adjacent the juncture of the wall member <b>30</b> with the distal end <b>22</b> of the stem <b>14</b>. The mesh suspended from the throat <b>50</b> of the head frame <b>26</b> defines a pocket <b>52</b>, where the lacrosse ball resides during the player's retention of the ball in the lacrosse stick <b>10</b>. The throat portion <b>50</b> of the head frame <b>26</b> terminates in an arcuate contour <b>54</b>, the radius of curvature of the contour <b>54</b> being selected to define an accommodating surface against which the lacrosse ball rests while retained in the pocket <b>52</b>. Typically, the contour <b>54</b> is lined with a soft, resilient padding which assists a player in maintaining the ball in the throat portion <b>50</b>. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0022]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0022" num="0022"> The mouth <b>46</b> also includes a receiving and shooting portion <b>58</b> defined by the portion of the mesh distally to the throat portion <b>50</b> and extending to the nose element <b>38</b> of the head frame <b>26</b>. The receiving and shooting portion <b>58</b> is the location at which the lacrosse ball is initially received and entrapped by the player and from which the ball is ultimately passed or shot. </div>

The wall portion <b>61</b> is angled such that the upper rim <b>37</b> of the head frame <b>26</b> protrudes distally of the lower rim <b>39</b>. The angle a of the wall <b>61</b> can range from about 10 degrees to about 80 degrees (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The thin, angled wall portion <b>61</b> of the nose element <b>38</b> assists a player in scooping a ball off the turf, since the flexibility of the wall portion <b>61</b> allows it to yield without excessive effort, sparing the player the need to excessively lean forward. Moreover, the wall portion <b>61</b> of the nose element <b>38</b> facilitates the fielding of ground balls since there is less of a lip for the ball to pass over before reaching the receiving and shooting portion <b>58</b>. </div>

In some embodiments, the stem <b>14</b> has greater rigidity than the entire head frame <b>26</b>. At least the exterior of the stem <b>14</b> and head frame <b>26</b> are preferably made from composite materials, which generally consist of a thermoplastic or thermoset polymer-based resin matrix impregnated with a material, such as a fiber, to reinforce the matrix. Preferred fibers include glass, polymer arimides such as KEVLAR, carbon, boron, or ceramics. A composite may include two or more different types of fibers in a single matrix. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0026]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0026" num="0026"> In one embodiment which has a unitary structure, the lacrosse stick <b>10</b> is molded (typically by injection molding) from a plastic material, for example, CAPRON polymer produced by Honeywell Plastics (Morristown, USA). To provide greater stiffness to the stem <b>14</b> than the head frame <b>26</b>, the composite material used to form the stem <b>14</b> can contain a greater concentration of fiber than the material used to form the head frame <b>26</b> (which may, particularly toward the distal end <b>23</b>, lack fiber altogether), or can contain a reinforcing material providing reduced stiffness. Techniques for varying the composition of a polymer during the course of molding operations are well-understood in the art. In one exemplary embodiment, the stem <b>14</b> is formed from CAPRON polymer containing fiberglass (also provided by Honeywell Plastics) while the head frame <b>26</b> has a progressively reduced amount of reinforcing material. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0027]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0027" num="0027"> In another embodiment, the lacrosse stick <b>10</b> is manufactured by co-injection molding, where materials are injected sequentially to create a core surrounded by a skin. In this embodiment, the core and skin combination in the head frame <b>26</b> is fabricated to be less rigid than the stem <b>14</b>. In another embodiment, the lacrosse stick <b>10</b> is fabricated through the process of bi-injection molding, where different materials are injected through different gates. Using this technique, the combination of materials injected to form the stem <b>14</b> provide greater rigidity than the materials injected to form the head frame <b>26</b>. In general, any injection molding process can be used that results in the stem <b>14</b> having greater rigidity than the head frame <b>26</b>. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0028]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="P-0028" num="0028"> In still another embodiment of a continuously formed stem <b>14</b> and head frame <b>26</b>, the stem <b>14</b> is formed around a metal rod or mandrel, which acts as a stiff backbone for a composite sheath, and which continues in extent to form the head frame <b>26</b>. For example, KEVLAR in either unidirectional pre-preg tape, or bidirectional prepreg fabric forms may be used. In this embodiment, a plurality of composite material layers are rolled in a stacked fashion around a mandrel having the desired shape of at least the stem <b>14</b>. Each of the layers may be similar, or may differ with respect to one or more of the included materials and/or properties. During the fabrication of the laminate, plies of unidirectional tape or fabric plies may be selectively oriented in the direction that provides the cured lacrosse stick <b>10</b> with the properties desired. The layers also may be of similar size and shape and stacked one on top of another, or may be of different size and shape. In addition, the stacking of the layers may be performed by using a plurality of pieces of composite material for a layer, or using only a single piece for a layer. The layers of composite materials may also be of any suitable thickness, or thicknesses. The laminate is then cured by heating, for instance in an autoclave, to form the finished product. It will be appreciated that by varying the method of construction of the stem <b>14</b> and the head frame <b>26</b>, lacrosse sticks <b>10</b> with stems <b>14</b> having greater stiffness than the head frame <b>26</b> may be fabricated. </div>

For example, the stem <b>14</b> of the lacrosse stick <b>10</b> may be fabricated from aluminum or another lightweight metal, wood, a composite material, etc. The stem <b>14</b> may also be tubular in construction throughout the longitudinal length of the stem <b>14</b> to reduce weight. The stem <b>14</b> may further have a circular, rectangular, octagonal or any other cross section desirable. The head frame <b>26</b> in this embodiment is preferably fabricated from a composite material that has a reduced stiffness is comparison to the stem <b>14</b> of the lacrosse stick <b>10</b>. The stem <b>14</b> is then coupled to the head frame <b>26</b> by any suitable means. For example, the stem <b>14</b> may be attached to the head frame <b>26</b> by an adhesive bonding. Alternatively, the head portion may have a shape that facilitates attachment to the stem. For instance, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the head frame <b>26</b> may terminate in a plug <b>60</b> that is received in a socket <b>64</b> formed within the distal end <b>68</b> of the stem <b>14</b>, so that when so joined, the outer surface of the stem <b>14</b> is substantially flush with the outer surface <b>76</b> of the head frame <b>26</b>. After the head frame <b>26</b> (which may be made, for example, from a flexible plastic such as polyethylene or copolymers of polypropylene) is attached to the stem <b>14</b>, a sheath, for example, fabricated from a composite material like KEVLAR is layered onto the head frame <b>26</b> and stem <b>14</b> and cured to produce a lacrosse stick <b>10</b> with a unitary external structure.
