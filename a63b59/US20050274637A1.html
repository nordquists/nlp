<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div html="" itemprop="content"><abstract lang="EN" load-source="patent-office" mxw-id="PA49254755">
<div class="abstract" id="p-0001" num="0000">A croquet mallet-carrying basket includes a basket body of an elongate rectangular hollow shape. The basket body has a front side hinged with a lower side to function as a cover and hooks on the upper side swinging open or shut for taking out balls placed therein. The two opposite sides of the basket body have plural handle holes vertically located not to be aligned to one another for the shanks of croquet mallets to be inserted through into the basket body so that the head of a croquet mallet needs not to be separated from the shank before the croquet mallet is placed in the basket body for carrying along. Croquet balls may be also placed into the basket body through the shank holes into the basket body for storing therein. </div>

Therefore, the head and the shank of each mallet have to be combined together in playing or storing away in the basket, making use of the croquet mallet rather troublesome by repeating assembly and disassembly of the mallet. </div>

Then each mallet can be placed in the hollow of the body by inserting the shank of each mallet through each shank hole of one side into the interior of the body, with the head of each mallet remained blocked and contacting the outer wall of each shank hole. Thus the head of each mallet needs not to be separated from the handle for placing each mallet and carried along therein. In addition, croquet balls can also be placed in the body through the shank holes.</div>
