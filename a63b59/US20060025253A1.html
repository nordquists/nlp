<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002"> When a baseball bat or softball bat impacts a ball, energy is transferred from the ball to the bat, in the form of deformation (radial and transverse), noise, and heat. When the ball strikes a location of the bat that is in the proximity of a primary vibration node, and/or at the intersection of a primary vibration node and the center of percussion (COP) of the bat, the bat experiences little or no vibration. This is known as a “sweet spot” hit. Alternatively, when the ball strikes a location of the bat that is not in the vicinity of a primary vibration node or the COP, the bat deforms into its fundamental and harmonic mode shapes. The magnitude of this deformation is a direct function of the mode that is excited and the distance from the vibration node and the COP to the impact location. If the acceleration of the bat into its mode shapes is significantly high, and is at a specific frequency, the bat will vibrate and produce shock waves. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003"> Shock waves travel at a high velocity and, depending upon their energy, can actually sting a player's hands. Sting typically results from displacements in the bat handle caused by rigid body rotations resulting from impact away from the COP, and/or from modal vibrations caused by impact away from the primary vibration nodes of the ball bat. Impacts of this nature are commonly referred to as “off-center hits,” because the “sweet spot” of a bat barrel is typically located at approximately the center of its length where the COP and the first primary vibration node are in close proximity to one another. The sting resulting from off-center hits may be distracting and painful to the player, and is therefore undesirable. To minimize sting, and improve the “feel” of the bat, shock waves resulting from off-center hits must be absorbed or otherwise attenuated prior to reaching the bat's handle. </div>

The free end of the handle <b>12</b> includes a knob <b>18</b> or similar structure. The barrel <b>14</b> is preferably closed off by a suitable cap, plug, or other end closure <b>20</b>. The interior of the bat <b>10</b> is preferably hollow, which facilitates the bat <b>10</b> being relatively lightweight so that ball players may generate substantial bat speed when swinging the bat <b>10</b>. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0016]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0017" num="0016"> The ball bat <b>10</b> preferably has an overall length of 20 to 40 inches, more preferably 26 to 34 inches (a 34 inch bat is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> by way of example only). The overall barrel diameter is preferably 2.0 to 3.0 inches, more preferably 2.25 to 2.75 inches. Typical bats have diameters of 2.25, 2.625, or 2.75 inches. Bats having various combinations of these overall lengths and barrel diameters, as well as any other suitable dimensions, are contemplated herein. The specific preferred combination of bat dimensions is generally dictated by the user of the bat <b>10</b>, and may vary greatly between users. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0017]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0018" num="0017"> The bat barrel <b>14</b> may be a single-wall or a multi-wall structure. If it is a multi-wall structure, the barrel walls may optionally be separated by one or more interface shear control zones (ISCZs), as described in detail in incorporated U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/903,493. Any ISCZ used preferably has a radial thickness of approximately 0.001 to 0.010 inches, more preferably 0.005 to 0.006 inches. Any other suitable size ISCZ may alternatively be used. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0018]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0019" num="0018"> An ISCZ may include a bond-inhibiting layer, a friction joint, a sliding joint, an elastomeric joint, an interface between two dissimilar materials (e.g., aluminum and a composite material), or any other suitable element or means for separating the barrel into “multiple walls.” If a bond-inhibiting layer is used, it is preferably made of a fluoropolymer material, such as Teflon® (polyfluoroethylene), FEP (fluorinated ethylene propylene), ETFE (ethylene tetrafluoroethylene), PCTFE (polychlorotrifluoroethylene), or PVF (polyvinyl fluoride), and/or another suitable material, such as PMP (polymethylpentene), nylon (polyamide), or cellophane. </div>

In such a case, the barrel layers at at least one end of the barrel are preferably blended together to form the one-piece/multi-wall construction. The entire ball bat <b>10</b> may also be formed as “one piece.” A one-piece bat design, as used herein, generally refers to the barrel <b>14</b>, the tapered section <b>16</b>, and the handle <b>12</b> of the ball bat <b>10</b> having no gaps, inserts, jackets, or bonded structures acting to appreciably thicken the barrel wall(s). In such a design, the distinct laminate layers are preferably integral to the barrel structure so that they all act in unison under loading conditions. To accomplish this one-piece design, the layers of the bat <b>10</b> are preferably co-cured, and are therefore not made up of a series of connected tubes (inserts or jackets) each having a separate wall thickness at the ends of the tubes. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0020]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0021" num="0020"> The blending of the barrel walls into a one-piece construction, around one or more ISCZs, like tying the ends of a leaf spring together, offers a stable, durable assembly, especially for when impact occurs at the extreme ends of the barrel <b>14</b>. Bringing multiple laminate layers together assures that the system acts as a unitized structure, with no one layer working independent of the others. By redistributing stresses to the extreme ends of the barrel, local stresses are reduced, resulting in increased bat durability. In an alternative multi-wall embodiment, the bat and/or barrel layers are not blended together at either end. </div>

The composite materials that make up the plies are preferably fiber-reinforced, and may include fibers of glass, graphite, boron, carbon, aramid (e.g., Kevlar®), ceramic, metallic, and/or any other suitable structural fibrous materials, preferably in epoxy form or another suitable form. Each composite ply preferably has a thickness of approximately 0.002 to 0.060 inches, more preferably 0.005 to 0.008 inches. Any other suitable ply thickness may alternatively be used. </div>

For example, the barrel may include one or more walls made of composite material(s), and one or more walls made of metallic material(s). Alternatively, composite and metallic materials may be interspersed within a given barrel wall. In another embodiment, nano-tubes, such as high-strength carbon nano-tube composite structures, may alternatively or additionally be used in the barrel construction. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0023]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0024" num="0023"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an interior section of one embodiment of a bat barrel <b>14</b> including one or more vibration dampening elements, or dampeners <b>30</b>, incorporated into the composite layers <b>32</b> of the bat barrel <b>14</b>. The one or more dampeners <b>30</b> may be made of any suitable vibration attenuating or dampening material(s), i.e., any material(s) having a lower axial elastic modulus than that of the neighboring or surrounding materials in the ball bat. In one embodiment, one or more of the dampeners <b>30</b> may have an axial elastic modulus that is 0.01 to 50%, or 0.02 to 25%, or 0.05 to 10%, or 0.10 to 5.0%, or 0.50 to 2.5%, or 0.75 to 1.25%, of the axial elastic modulus of the neighboring or surrounding materials in the ball bat <b>10</b>. Any material having a lower elastic modulus than the neighboring or surrounding materials in the ball bat <b>10</b> may be used, however. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0024]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0025" num="0024"> In one embodiment, one or more of the dampeners <b>30</b> are made of one or more viscoelastic and/or elastomeric materials, such as elastomeric rubber, silicone, gel foam, or other similar materials. The dampeners <b>30</b> may alternatively or additionally be made of any other suitable dampening materials, including but not limited to PBO (polybenzoxazole), UHMWPE (ultra high molecular weight polyethylene, e.g., Dyneema®), fiberglass, dacron® (“polyethylene terephthalate”—PET or PETE), nylon® (polyamide), certran®, Pentex®, Zylon®, Vectran®, and/or aramid, that are effective at dissipating or otherwise attenuating vibrational energy relative to the neighboring or surrounding materials in the ball bat <b>10</b>. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0025]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0026" num="0025"> Thus, depending on the one or more materials that are used to form the structural layers of the ball bat <b>10</b>, a wide variety of dampening materials (relative to those neighboring or surrounding structural materials) may be used in the ball bat <b>10</b>. For example, a soft rubber dampening material may have an axial elastic modulus of approximately 10,000 psi, whereas a “dampening” material such as aramid may have an axial elastic modulus of approximately 12,000,000 psi. While the dampening effect of aramid is significantly less than that of a typical soft rubber material, it may still have an appreciable dampening effect on surrounding or neighboring structural bat material(s) having an even higher axial elastic modulus, and it may provide increased durability relative to softer materials. Accordingly, materials having a relatively high axial elastic modulus, such as aramid, may be used as effective dampeners in some ball bat constructions. </div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0038]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0039" num="0038"> The ends of the material layers are preferably “clocked,” or offset, from one another so that they do not all terminate at the same location before curing. Additionally, if varying layer orientations and/or wall thicknesses are used, the layers may be staggered, feathered, or otherwise angled or manipulated to form the desired bat shape. Accordingly, when heat and pressure are applied to cure the bat <b>10</b>, the various layers blend together into a distinctive “one-piece,” or integral, construction. Furthermore, during heating and curing of the composite layers, the dampeners <b>30</b> preferably fuse with the surrounding composite material and become an integral part of the overall bat structure. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0039]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0040" num="0039"> Put another way, all of the layers of the bat are “co-cured” in a single step, and blend or terminate together at at least one end, resulting in a single-piece structure with no gaps (at the at least one end), such that the barrel <b>14</b> is not made up of a series of tubes each with a separate wall thickness that terminates at the ends of the tubes. As a result, all of the layers act in unison under loading conditions, such as during striking of a ball. One or both ends of the barrel <b>14</b> may terminate together in this manner to form a one-piece barrel <b>14</b>, including one or more barrel walls (depending on whether any ISCZs are used). In an alternative design, neither end of the barrel is blended together, such that a multi-piece construction is formed. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0040]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0041" num="0040"> The described bat construction, incorporating one or more dampeners at or near vibration anti-node locations of the ball bat, significantly decreases the vibrational energy transmitted to the bat handle and the batter's hands. Accordingly, sting felt by the batter is significantly reduced or eliminated, and the “sweet spot” of the ball bat may be effectively increased. Dampeners may additionally be located in specific regions of the ball bat to provide increased flexure in those regions. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0041]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0042" num="0041"> Thus, while several embodiments have been shown and described, various changes and substitutions may of course be made, without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The invention, therefore, should not be limited, except by the following claims and their equivalents. </div>
