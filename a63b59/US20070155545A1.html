</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005"> A lacrosse stick, also known as a “crosse,” comprises a head used for throwing or catching the ball, which is mounted on the top end of an elongated handle or shaft, which is used for grasping the stick by the player. In the U.S., the crosse must be an overall length of 40-42 inches for attackmen and midfielders, or 52-72 inches for defensemen. The head of the crosse must be 6.5-10 inches wide, except a goalie's crosse which may be 10-12 inches wide. International rules also stipulate that the stick of the designated goalkeeper can be up to 15 inches (38.1 centimeters) and the goalkeeper's stick shall be an overall length of between 40 inches and 72 inches. The pocket of a crosse shall be deemed illegal if the top surface of a lacrosse ball, when placed in the head of the crosse, is below the bottom edge of the side wall. The rules for the size of the lacrosse stick in men's lacrosse in the U.S. is generally the NCAA Lacrosse Rules Book (The NCAA Lacrosse Rules Book (2005), Page 15, Section 17). The boys lacrosse stick dimensions rules are generally governed by the U.S. Lacrosse—Boys Youth Lacrosse Rules (U.S. Lacrosse—Boys Youth Lacrosse Rules, Rule 2, Section 2(b)). For boys, the length of the crosse may be 37 to 42 inches for offensive players, and defensive players in such divisions may use a stick with a length of 37 to 72 inches, depending on the league and the age of the boy. International lacrosse rules allow a head to be from four to ten inches wide. In lacrosse, the stick head is used for throwing the ball and using different stick heads can result in different throws. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006"> Currently, different offensive and defensive sticks are used, requiring the player to leave the playing field to switch sticks when changing from offense to defense. Switching the sticks will also result in the players' throwing accuracy being compromised. Also, some international rules prohibit switching of sticks during the game. </div>

<li> <para-num num="[0014]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0015" num="0014"> The present invention is drawn to lacrosse stick with a main shaft and a secondary shaft that telescopes in and out of the main shaft. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0015]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0016" num="0015"> In executing game skills in lacrosse, players must be able to grip and control the sports equipment and is referred to as “stick handling.” Effective stick handling requires a player to constantly reposition his hands along the sports equipment handle to move the operational portion of the sports equipment. By “operational portion,” is meant the head of a lacrosse stick and refers to the part or parts of the sports equipment that is/are controlled by the handle. As used herein, “handle” refers to the part of the sports equipment on which a player's hand(s) is/are placed, which does not include the operational portion. The handle is comprised of a shaft and optionally, accessories or overlays to improve a player's grip. A “shaft” is therefore a component of the handle. As used herein, “stick” refers to the sports equipment as a whole, including the operational portion and the handle. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0016]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0017" num="0016"> The shaft of the invention can be made of, but not limited to wood, plastic, metals including aluminum or titanium, carbon/aramid, graphite or any other synthetic material, or combination or alloy thereof. The net on the head of the stick includes, but is not limited to leather, cord and nylon. The pocket on the stick may not “sag” to a depth where the top edge of the ball is below the bottom edge of the side of the head. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0017]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0018" num="0017"> The shaft of the invention optionally includes a plurality of ridges and trenches which extend along substantially the entire length of the elongated member and which are substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis. Lacrosse stick handles of the invention can be hollow having an octagonal cross-section along substantially the entire length of the handle, from the portion of the handle which is inserted into and attached to the lacrosse stick head, to a plastic or rubber cap at the end of the handle opposite from the head. This octagonal configuration provides improved grip over handles having a round or oval cross-section. Asymmetrical orientation of the ridges and/or trenches of the handle, or asymmetrical thickness of the walls of the shaft may be incorporated to allow the player to more easily orient the stick by feel. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0018]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0019" num="0018"> The present invention optionally includes a handle having overlays that improve stick handling. The overlays can be located and structured to provide the shaft with structural and tactile features that correspond to and accommodate the way in which a player moves his hands along the shaft and grips the shaft. The structural and tactile features are located on the shaft to enhance a player's control of the shaft when performing various skills. The overlays are not positioned on the handle so as to impede the function of the telescoping members of the handle. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0019]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0020" num="0019"> The overlays can be manufactured from a material that is soft, pliable, deformable, and tacky in places, so as to provide a player with an increased grip friction, and can be deformable to provide cushioning and shock absorption, to alleviate stress and injury caused by the vibration of the stick and contact between the shaft and players'body parts. The overlay can be positioned proximate to the end of the lacrosse stick handle and may have a conical shape that assists a player in gripping the end of the handle, or the lacrosse stick handle may have a continuous overlay applied to the entire length of the lacrosse stick shaft. The overlay is preferably structured with ribs and grooves to increase grip friction and resist the twisting of the shaft, while also enhancing control of the head and thereby, the movement of the shaft and head as one unit. The overlay may have a variable hand placement that improves a player's hold on the handle. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0020]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0021" num="0020"> The locking mechanism envisioned aides in the retention of the segments of the handle in their extending positions. By implementing a twist to engage/disengage structure in the locking system, the manual extension and securing of the telescopic handle is significantly enhanced. To this end, the present invention generally comprises a plurality of segments including a bottom segment, and at least a top segment; a plurality of sleeve assemblies each positioned between an associated pairing of a relatively lower segment and a higher segment, toward the head; and optionally, a plurality of biasing means each urging an associate one of the segments toward an extended position. The lacrosse handle may also include a plurality of retaining means. Each one of the plurality of retaining or locking means is associated with one of the segments for selectively securing the segment in a non-extended position. The locking mechanism also secures the handle in the collapsed position to prevent inadvertent extension during a game. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0021]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0022" num="0021"> The locking mechanism includes a sleeve assembly to facilitate telescopic movement of said tubes, said sleeve assembly being positioned between said bottom segment and said top segment; an upper sleeve member positionable to abut a top edge of said outer tube segment; and a lower sleeve member positionable to abut a lower edge of said inner tube segment; wherein said upper sleeve member and said lower sleeve member are configured to selectively engage each other such that said lower sleeve member is capable of being maintained in a static position relative to said upper sleeve member, such that rotating said upper sleeve member with respect to said lower sleeve member in a first direction engages said locking mechanism and rotating said upper sleeve member with respect to said lower sleeve member in a second direction disengages said locking mechanism. </div>
