<li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004"> Practice bats for baseball and softball have been previously provided. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,246,894 and 5,014,984. In the U.S. Pat. No. 3,246,894 a training bat is disclosed which uses a handle portion connected to a barrel portion by a reduced diameter central section. The bat of the '894 patent is intended to teach a batter to hit the ball with the barrel portion or sweet spot of the bat. It, however, has disadvantages. It requires absolute rigidity that renders such device easily breakable. A further disadvantage is shown by the requirement that its reduced diameter central section to be constructed of a more dense material than its barrel or handle sections. By having this requirement, the weight balance of this device is offset which in turn has an adverse effect on the user's ability to use this device. The batting apparatus of the U.S. Pat. No. 5,014,984 is also intended to teach a batter to hit the sweet spot of the bat. It is believed that neither of the devices of the '894 and '984 patents has met with success since neither is of regulation weight and may not have regulation diameters and the critical areas of the bat. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005"> Another example is U.S. Pat. No. 6,949,036 issued to Ciesar. This device includes a shaft; two handgrip portions wherein on is a permanently fixed “handle” at one end of the shaft and the second being a “slide” being configured to slide along the shaft; and a head portion secured to the other end of the shaft. This training device has disadvantages in that it is not to be used with actual balls or is of regulation weight and may not have regulation diameters and the critical areas of the bat. </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006"> Accordingly, there is a need for a new practice bat that more accurately resembles an actual bat. </div>

<li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007"> A baseball or softball training bat is disclosed which is of regulation weight. The training bat includes a regulation diameter wood bat can handle having a shaft extending there from to a regulation diameter wood barrel portion. The shaft is preferably comprised of fiberglass material and has a diameter less than the diameter of the bat handle. The ends of the shaft are embedded in the bat handle and barrel. A ferrule is mounted on the shaft adjacent the handle portion to strengthen the bat. In the preferred embodiment, the bat is of regulation weight and approximately 1″-3″ shorter then regulation. In practice, if the batter hits a baseball with the shaft, rather than the sweet spot, it will be very noticeable and will encourage the batter to focus on hitting the baseball with the barrel or sweet spot. </div>
