In one embodiment, only the front surface <b>26</b> of the blade may be formed of a thermoplastics layer. Indeed, it is known that the front surface of the blade is more subject to impacts. In another embodiment, only specific regions of the front surface <b>26</b> may be formed of a thermoplastic layer (only the heel and middle regions of the blade <b>10</b> for example). </div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0046]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0047" num="0046"> Because the front and rear surfaces <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> of the blade <b>10</b> comprises the layer of thermoplastic material <b>70</b>, the impact resistance of the blade <b>10</b> is greater than that of a blade having no external layer of thermoplastic material. For example, for the same blade construction, drop tests shown that the impact resistance increases of at least 50% for a blade having an external layer formed of a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) sheet sold by Isosport IS under the name ISOCAP and at least 70% for a blade having an external layer formed of a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) sheet sold by Dow Chemical (density of 1.15-1.25 gr/cc and hardness of 73 D). </div>
