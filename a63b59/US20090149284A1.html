<li> <para-num num="[0001]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to a hockey stick blade and, more particularly to, a hockey stick blade having a fiber reinforced high density foam core.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">Typical current hockey stick blades or replacement blades are generally made of a core material reinforced with one or more layers of synthetic material, such as fiberglass, carbon fiber or graphite. Traditionally, the core of the blade has been made of natural materials, such as wood or a wood laminate. Traditional wood constructions, however, are expensive to manufacture due to the cost of wood and the manufacturing processes employed. Further, wood sticks and blades are relatively heavy and have somewhat limited durability. Finally, due to variabilities relating to wood construction and manufacturing techniques, wood sticks are difficult to manufacture with consistent tolerances, and even the same model and brand of sticks and blades may have differences in terms of mechanical properties, such as stiffness and curvature.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Recently, in an attempt to decrease the weight of the stick and blade, and to improve upon the durability and mechanical properties associated with the performance of the stick or blade, alternative core materials, such as synthetic materials reinforced with layers of fiber material, have been utilized. The fiber layers are usually made of woven filament fibers, typically soaked in a resin and glued to the surfaces of the core of the blade. Expandable fiber braids have also been used for covering the core of the blade. These composite sticks and blades have proven to have improved durability versus traditional wooden sticks and blades and have many of the mechanical attributes desired by hockey players. Further, these composite sticks and blades have less variability in terms of tolerances related to curvature and stiffness.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Nevertheless, these sticks and blades still have disadvantages. For example, conventional foam core materials form blades are formed of polymeric materials that are limited in strength and durability by a combination of factors, including the type and density of the polymeric material forming the foam core, the thickness of the foam core, and the amount of curing of the foam core during processing.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, there is a demand for a composite blade having improved strength and durability, and hence improved playability characteristics, that utilizes conventional polymeric foam core materials and conventional forming techniques. These playability characteristics include improved response while handling and/or shooting a puck, the prevention of puck “flutter” that may occur when a player shoots or passes the puck, and the twisting of the blade as a puck is passed or shot.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">It is therefore an advantage of the present invention to provide a composite blade for a hockey stick with improved response while handling and/or shooting a puck.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">It is still another advantage of the present invention to provide a composite blade for a hockey stick that has decreased weight without adversely affecting the performance or mechanical characteristics of the blade.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with the above and the other advantages, the present invention provides a composite hockey stick blade having a high density foam core paddle coupled overlaid with, or coupled within, a plastic wrap. In addition, reinforcing materials such as chopped fibers are introduced to the high density foam core material to increase the toughness and durability of the blade to better withstand the rigors of play. The presence of the high density foam and fiber reinforcement allows the thickness of the plastic wrap to be decreased along the front face and rear face of the paddle while maintaining the desired performance and mechanical characteristics of the blade. The result is a durable, stiff, and light blade that can be formed as a part of a hockey stick or as a separate replacement blade for a hockey stick.</div>

It should be understood that while the preferred blade is intended for use in the sport of ice hockey, it can also be utilized in other sports, including roller hockey and field hockey. In general, the blade <b>10</b> comprises a hosel <b>12</b>, a heel section <b>14</b>, and a paddle (blade portion) <b>16</b>. The heel section <b>14</b> is located at the junction of the hosel <b>12</b> and the paddle <b>16</b>. The hosel <b>12</b> includes a tenon <b>18</b>, or insert, adapted to be inserted into a hollow hockey stick shaft (not shown) made of aluminum, composite or graphite. It will be understood that the hockey stick shaft can be made of a variety of other materials, including but not limited to wood or wood laminate. The paddle <b>16</b> includes a front face <b>20</b> and a rear face <b>22</b> and further comprises a top edge <b>24</b>, a tip region <b>26</b> and a bottom edge <b>28</b>.</div>

The hosel <b>12</b> and tenon <b>18</b> are preferably formed having one or more layers of the plastic wrap (shown as a plurality of plies <b>197</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) that are wrapped around a hollow cavity and may include an inner foam core (shown as <b>199</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0017]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0018" num="0017">The inner foam core <b>100</b> and foam core <b>199</b> (when present) are constructed of formulations of syntactic foam or non-syntactic polymeric foam, with syntactic foams preferred. A syntactic foam is formed by filling a polymeric matrix material with hollow particles called microballoons. The presence of microballoons results in lower density, higher strength, and lower thermal expansion coefficient core materials, which is desirable for hockey stick blades. The microballoons used in the present invention are typically glass microballoons or polymeric microballoons such as polypropylene microballoons.</div>

Preferably, the high-density polymeric matrix material is non-expandable foaming material. The term high-density, in the context of the present invention, is meant to describe a foam material having a density of at least about 30 pounds per cubic foot. The term non-expandable, in the context of the present application, is meant to describe a polymeric material that maintains its general shape after curing. Thus, in the present invention, a non-expandable foam core blade will maintain its general shape after being removed from the mold in which it is formed, regardless of the temperature at which it is removed (i.e. the polymeric matrix material will not expand after it is cured and removed from the mold). One such non-expandable polymeric material is high-density epoxy, which foams and cures to form a blade <b>10</b>. However, other polymeric materials, or blends of polymeric materials, or different forms of the general polymeric composition, and having one or more of these characteristics, is specifically contemplated by the present invention.</div>
