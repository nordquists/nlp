</li> <li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to lacrosse sticks, and, more particularly, to a shaft for a lacrosse stick.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Traditional lacrosse shafts were constructed of wood. These wooden shafts suffered from a variety of disadvantages. The first is that they were susceptible to damage from excess exposure to water. The second is that these prior wooden shafts were heavy and somewhat cumbersome. Further, the wooden shafts were also susceptible to breakage.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">To solve the disadvantages of the traditional wooden lacrosse shafts, shafts of metallic construction were developed to replace the wooden lacrosse shafts, particularly in the men's game. The advantage of such construction was that the metal shafts could be mass produced with uniform quality, strength and weight, and were generally stronger than wood shafts.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">However, these metal shafts still have some drawbacks. For example, the rigid metal construction can transmit shock to a player's hands when the lacrosse stick is subjected to a sudden impact, e.g. slashing by an opponent. Further, if the external force is great enough, the shaft can even break.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, U.S. Pat. No. 7,621,832 introduces an improved shaft which includes an outer surface having one or more predetermined portions with a coating coupled thereto. The coating is utilized for strengthening the tubular member, preventing damage thereto, and decreasing vibrations therein. However, when putting to use, the expecting advantages can not be found because it is difficult to prepare a suitable thickness for the coating coupled to the outer surface of the shaft.</div>
