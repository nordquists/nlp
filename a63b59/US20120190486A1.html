<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div html="" itemprop="content"><abstract lang="EN" load-source="patent-office" mxw-id="PA98252309">
<div class="abstract" id="p-0001" num="0000">An athletic training implement is provided. The implement has a light emitting device, such as a laser, affixed thereto such that a beam of narrow light is emitted from the training implement that is indicative of the path of movement of the implement. In a training method, a chart is provided having a pattern thereon. As such, the user can be trained in the use of the athletic implement by repetitively causing the beam of light to follow the pattern on the chart so that a smooth, consistent movement of the athletic training implement can be learned by the user. The pattern on the chart may have a plurality of lines which may be straight or curved and can be horizontal vertical, or diagonal depending on the movement desired to be taught the user. While particularly adapted for training for the use of a lacrosse stick, other athletic implements may be used.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0001]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an athletic implement useful in the training of a person for an athletic event and, more particularly, to a device that allows a user to perform specific training for an event concerning the movement of the athletic implement and to a method for performing that training.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">In general, there are many athletic implements used in various athletic events that require a rather specific pattern of movement by the user. Typically, the implements include lacrosse sticks, baseball bats, ice hockey sticks, field hockey sticks, tennis racquets and the like.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">The achieving of a smooth, consistent movement of a sporting implement is important and an instructor is often needed to teach the particular movement dictated by a specific athletic implement and then observe the student who continues to carry out repetitive duplications of the instructed movement to achieve the smooth, consistent movement needed for that athletic implement.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">One of the difficulties with teaching a user the movements of an athletic implement, however, is that it requires a fairly constant watch by the instructor to made sure that the user is faithfully carrying out the desired, instructed movement for the particular athletic implement such that the time of the instructor is taken up by continuous or at least semi-continuous observation of the student and correction of the movements of that student.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">It would therefore be advantageous to have an athletic implement that could be employed by the user to carry out repetitive movements of the athletic implement along the desired path of movement such that the user could carry out the repetitive moves alone and without or at least with only minimal actual observation by an instructor so that the instructor can teach multiple users at the same time and yet be assured that each user was faithfully carrying out the instructed movement of the athletic implement.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, the present invention overcomes the aforesaid problems and difficulties by providing an improved athletic implement that includes an athletic implement having a light emitter affixed thereto such that the light emitter directs a narrow beam of light outwardly from the athletic implement. The athletic implement is generally of the type that has a handle with a longitudinal axis such that the beam of light directed by the light emitter is in a direction generally parallel to the longitudinal axis of the handle of the athletic implement.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">As will be appreciated, the present invention can be directly incorporated into an athletic implement by the manufacturer thereof, or, alternatively, can be produced separately and added onto or retrofitted to existing or currently marketed athletic implements.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">In an exemplary embodiment, the light emitter can be a laser and the athletic implement can be a lacrosse stick such that the beam of light is emitted along the longitudinal axis of the handle, past the basket and there is a simple bracket system used to affix the light emitter to the lacrosse stick to direct the light beam along that path.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">In the method of the invention, there is a chart having a pattern that mimics the desired movement of a lacrosse player such that the user can direct the beam of light along a particular line on the pattern and make repetitive moves that track that line to develop a smooth and consistent movement of the lacrosse stick. Thus, the method can be used to train a user in the proper motion of a lacrosse stick in playing the game of lacrosse.</div>

The basket <b>14</b> itself has a webbing <b>16</b> to hold the ball and that webbing <b>16</b> is supported by a rim <b>18</b> having a forward edge <b>20</b>. Normally, the handle <b>12</b> is a modified octagonal cross sectional shape; however other cross sectional shapes may be utilized consistent with the spirit of the present invention.</div>
