<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Cricket is a bat-and-ball team sport, and it is a popular sport in many parts of the world. The sport is governed by the International Cricket Council (ICC), and the ICC currently has 105 member countries. Of these countries, 10 are full members of the ICC. These countries are: England, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Zimbabwe, and the West Indies (an amalgamation of over 20 countries and territories from the Caribbean). The remaining <b>95</b> member countries are either Associate Members or Affiliate Members of the ICC.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">The fundamental nature of cricket involves a bowler delivering the cricket ball from one end of a cricket pitch towards a batsman, who is provided with a cricket bat, at the other end of the cricket pitch. The batsman endeavours to hit the ball (with the bat) around the ground in order to score runs, whereas the bowler (and his/her team mates) endeavour to get the batsman out.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">The cricket ball is generally a hard, leather-seemed ball which can be delivered at speeds of more than 140 km/h. As a result most batsmen wear protective clothing to prevent injury from being struck with the ball.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">The laws of cricket stipulate that the bat must be made of wood (usually White Willow), and the bat has the shape of a blade topped by a cylindrical handle. The blade must not be more than 108 mm wide, and the total length of the bat must be not more than 970 mm.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">In general, when facing up to a bowler, the batsman will grip the bat handle with both hands and stand slightly side on to the bowler, and with a slightly crouched (or knees slightly bent) stance.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">The art of successful batting depends to a large extent on the correct placing of the batsman's hands around the cricket bat handle, both prior to and during the playing of a cricket shot. In this regard, each of the batsman's hands have quite different roles when gripping a cricket bat handle, and when playing a batting stroke.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">For a right handed batter, the batter should grip the bat by first placing his/her left hand towards the top of the handle, with the palm facing down. This is often referred to as the batsman's top hand (which would be the right hand for a left handed batter).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0010">During the playing of a batting stroke, it is very important that the top hand remains fixed and stationary. If the top hand moves during the playing of a shot, then the batsman has less control over the shot played. This renders it more likely that the ball will not be struck in the intended fashion or direction, and furthermore there is more likelihood that the batsman will be dismissed or struck by the ball. Keeping the top hand fixed at all times requires focus and discipline, and this is something that people learning the game often lack.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0011">Furthermore, given the pace at which some bowlers bowl it may be appreciated that it is not always possible for the top hand to remain fixed. For example, the act of the ball impacting against the bat may serve to dislodge the top hand. Moreover, some less accomplished batsmen may move the top hand as a reflex response to receiving a particularly fast ball or a ball directed at the body of the batsman.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0012]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0013" num="0012">It may therefore be of advantage if there was available a cricket bat handle which was provided with a means for locating the top hand of a batsman to a desired position on the cricket bat handle and/or which restricted the top hand from moving prior to and/or during the playing of a batting stroke.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0013]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0014" num="0013">For a right handed batter, the batter should grip the bat by placing his/her right hand towards the bottom of the handle, with the palm facing up. This is often referred to as the batsman's bottom hand (which would be the left hand for a left handed batter).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0014]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0015" num="0014">A common mistake made by batsmen, especially those that have not played much cricket, is that the bottom hand grips the handle too hard—also known as over gripping. This means that the batsman is essentially gripping the cricket bat handle like a golf club or a baseball bat. This is a very ineffective way to hold a cricket bat and severely limits the ability of the batsman to be able to play a successful or proper batting stroke.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0015]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0016" num="0015">It may therefore be of advantage if there was available a cricket bat handle which was provided with a means for ensuring that the bottom hand of a batsman was less susceptible to over gripping.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0016]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0017" num="0016">During the playing of a batting stroke, and particularly when the batsman is driving or cutting the ball, it is important for the bottom hand to pivot and move slightly down the handle, in the region of where the fleshy part of the bottom hand between the thumb and index finger meets the handle. This often proves difficult for a batsman to learn as it is a somewhat unusual way to swing a sporting club (most other sporting clubs require both hands to grip the club firmly and/or to remain stationary during the swinging of the sporting club).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0017]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0018" num="0017">It may therefore be of advantage if there was available a cricket bat handle which was provided with a means for locating the bottom hand of the batsman and/or for guiding the bottom hand through this pivoting motion during the playing of a batting stroke.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0018]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0019" num="0018">There are several prior art inventions which claim to assist a batter when gripping a cricket bat.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0019]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0020" num="0019">AU2008100243 DiNoia describes a cricket bat handle which includes an attachment such as a ring which fits around the cricket bat handle. The ring is designed to force the batter to grip the bat higher up than normal, with the intention being that this higher grip offers the batter better control and an increased arc when the bat is swung. The ring is also designed to provide a point of leverage against which to exert rotational force. However, the invention described in AU2008100243 requires the batter's hand to grip the bat handle adjacent to the ring, rather than being placed over it. Hence, the ring is ineffective is correctly locating either the top hand or the bottom hand on or about the cricket bat handle. Furthermore, the invention described does not assist in guiding either the top hand or bottom during the playing of a batting stroke, and nor does it address the issue of a batsman over gripping the bat.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0020]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0021" num="0020">GB 2396563 Larsen describes a cricket bat handle which has a series of undulations for dampening the vibrations which occur when the ball is struck by the bat. However, the invention described in Larsen does not provide any means for correctly locating the hands of a batter on a cricket bat handle and/or which serve to guide the hand(s) of the batter during the playing of a batting stroke. Nor does Larsen address the issue of over gripping of the bat handle by the batsman.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0021]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0022" num="0021">GB 2202153 Curtis describes a cricket bat handle which has indentations to accommodate the fingers of the batter. However, the indentations appear to encourage a batter to grip the cricket bat like a baseball bat, which is not the correct way for either the top hand or the bottom hand to grip a cricket bat. Furthermore Curtis does not describe any means for guiding the hand(s) of the batter during the playing of a batting stroke and nor does Curtis address the issue of over gripping.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0022]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0023" num="0022">WO 2010/118460 Brady describes a resiliently deformable protuberance formed either on a cricket bat handle or within the glove of the batter. The protuberance is designed to modify the grip of the batter, and Brady states that a preferred advantage of the invention is to dampen vibrations. However, the invention described in Brady does not allow for the correct positioning of the top hand of the batter and nor does it allow for the any guiding of either the top hand or bottom hand during the playing of a batting stroke. Furthermore, because the invention utilises a deformable protuberance, it does not properly address the issue of over gripping of the bat handle.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0023]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0024" num="0023">There are also prior art devices available which claim to assist a person when gripping other sporting objects such as a golf club or a baseball bat. Examples include U.S. Pat. No. 7,572,198 Bleeker, U.S. Pat. No. 5,299,802 Bouchet-Lassale, and JP8-243201 Tsujimoto.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0024]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0025" num="0024">However, these inventions are more suited to sporting implements which require a player to grip the sporting implement tightly with both hands and/or with the fingers curled tightly around the sporting implement (for example, by providing finger grooves—as in Bleeker and Tsujimoto). As such, the inventions described are quite unsuitable for use with cricket bats—which require a totally different gripping technique, as described previously.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0025]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0026" num="0025">Finally, GB 2386326 Llewellyn-Jones describes a collar which may be fitted to the handle of a sporting implement such as golf club for accommodating one of a person's fingers. An embodiment is described in relation to use with a cricket bat. However, the invention described does not assist in locating the top and/or bottom hands of a batter or guiding either the top hand or bottom of a batter during the playing of a batting stroke. Nor does it address the issue of a batsman over gripping the bat handle.</div>

That is, the thumb <b>18</b> of the bottom hand <b>15</b> of the batter is correctly located in the gap or channel <b>22</b> formed between the third raised portion <b>16</b> and the fourth raised portion <b>21</b>.</div>

After the batter has played a batting stroke, and the bottom hand <b>15</b> has gone through the pivoting motion, as described previously, the thumb <b>18</b> lies within the channel <b>25</b> formed between the third raised portion <b>16</b> and the fifth raised portion <b>23</b>. Furthermore, the thumb <b>18</b> is prevented from slipping further down the grip <b>1</b> (in the direction of the blade <b>24</b> of the bat <b>3</b>) by virtue of the thumb <b>18</b> (or end of the thumb) butting up against the fifth raised portion <b>23</b>. If the thumb <b>18</b> was otherwise to slip down the grip <b>1</b>, the batter may end up losing control of the bat <b>3</b> or the batting stroke.

This is because a cricket bat is not supposed to be gripped tightly by the fingers, as is the case for, say, baseball bats, tennis racquets or golf clubs. It is therefore important, especially for those learning the game, that the cricket bat handle <b>2</b> is not gripped tightly by the fingers of the batter, and hence having the grip <b>1</b> devoid of any finger grooves (or like protrusions) may help to discourage such incorrect batting techniques.</div>

The grip <b>1</b> may therefore serve as a very useful means by which to attract more people to the game as it simplifies the teaching of how to grip a cricket bat handle <b>2</b>, and furthermore the grip <b>1</b> is very simple and user friendly to use and manufacture.</div>
