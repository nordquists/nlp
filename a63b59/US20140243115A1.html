<li> <para-num num="[0001]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0002" num="0001">The game of croquet is typically played as a backyard lawn game. It can be played in many different ways, but is usually played with teams, with two or three players per team. The object of croquet is to use a mallet to hit colored balls through a course of wickets arranged on a yard or “court”. A typical croquet game with six players (three players per team) is played with nine wickets and six colored balls (blue, red, black, yellow, green and orange). The nine wickets are arranged on the court in a double diamond configuration with a double wicket and stake at each end of the double diamond configuration. One team plays the balls colored blue, black and green. The opposing team plays the balls colored red, yellow and orange. The order of play throughout the game is blue, red, black, yellow, green then orange. Each player must pass his/her respective ball through the course of wickets. Each player gets one shot per turn, but can earn extra shots if the player scores a wicket (i.e., hits the ball through a wicket) or strikes another ball (called a “roquet”). Scoring a wicket earns one bonus shot and “roquetting” earns two bonus shots. The first team to get all of their balls through the course of all nine wickets with each of the balls hitting the stake at each end of the course is the winner. As identified above, the game may vary depending on the number of players and whether the players are playing as teams and whether the game is played with six or nine wickets.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">It should be appreciated, therefore that a typical croquet game set will include six colored balls, six mallets, nine wickets and two stakes. Thus, there is a need for a caddy that may be used for carrying and storing all of the game components in a convenient manner which will keep all of the game components together.</div>

In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the croquet caddy <b>10</b> is shown holding a typical complete set of croquet game components, which typically includes six different colored balls <b>12</b>, six mallets <b>14</b>, nine wickets <b>16</b> (shown in dashed lines in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and two stakes <b>18</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is the same perspective view of the croquet caddy of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, but with the croquet game components removed for clarity and is partially exploded to better view and illustrate the elements of the caddy <b>10</b>.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the caddy <b>10</b> comprises a main frame <b>20</b> which includes two substantially parallel posts <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, a handle support <b>30</b> and a base <b>40</b>. Comparing <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, and as described in more detail below, it can be seen that the posts <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> operably support an upper retainer <b>50</b>, lower stake holders <b>100</b>, and mallet head retainers <b>110</b>.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">The posts <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> are constructed of material that is sufficiently rigid to support the weight of the game components during transport, but yet are preferably lightweight to minimize the overall weight of the caddy <b>10</b> to reduce shipping costs and so that it is more easily transportable by players of all ages. For example, the posts <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may be constructed of thin walled hollow metal tubing or other sufficiently rigid, lightweight material of a desired cross-sectional configuration. The posts <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> are received within bores <b>26</b> disposed on the underside of the handle support <b>30</b> and bores <b>28</b> disposed on the top side of the base <b>40</b>. The posts <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may be retained in the bores <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> by tapping screws (not shown).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0010">The handle support <b>30</b> serves as a lateral brace for the upper end of the frame <b>20</b> and may be constructed of any suitably rigid and preferably lightweight material such as thermoformed plastic or other desirable material. The handle support <b>30</b> includes a handle grip <b>32</b> which may be telescopically received within the handle support <b>30</b> such that the handle grip <b>32</b> may move between an upwardly extended position and a downwardly collapsed position (as shown in dashed lines in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In the upwardly extended position, the handle grip <b>32</b> is sufficiently raised to an elevation that avoids or reduces the need for a player to bend over or lean when pulling the caddy <b>10</b>. The downwardly collapsed position provides the advantage of permitting the caddy <b>10</b> to be shipped in a shorter box than if the handle was fixed in the fully extended position. Thus, while a telescoping handle as embodied herein provides ergonomic advantages while pulling the caddy and the advantage of being able to ship the caddy in a shorter box, it should be appreciated that the handle grip <b>32</b> need not be telescoping and may be fixedly attached or formed integral with the handle support <b>30</b>.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0011">The base <b>40</b> includes a laterally extending cross-member <b>42</b> and a pair of fore and aft extending legs <b>44</b> secured to the underside of the cross-member <b>42</b> to stabilize and support the caddy in an upright position such that it does not easily tip over. As identified in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the cross-member <b>42</b> includes recesses <b>43</b> into which the legs <b>44</b> are received and secured in place by a threaded connector <b>45</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). Alternatively, the legs <b>44</b> and the lateral brace <b>42</b> may be molded or otherwise formed as a unitary member. One end of the legs <b>44</b> support rollers or wheels <b>48</b> or alternatively one end of the legs <b>44</b> may support a wheeled axle extending between the legs so that the caddy may be pulled behind a player as he or she walks so the player does not need to lift and carry the caddy <b>10</b> which, when fully loaded with a complete set of the croquet game components, can be quite heavy for younger players.</div>

Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, each mallet head retainer <b>110</b> has an inner face <b>112</b> and an outer face <b>114</b>. The inner face <b>112</b> includes a cross-member recess <b>116</b> to receive the respective ends of the cross-member <b>42</b> of the base <b>40</b>.

The pyramid stacking of the mallet heads allows for a more narrow or compact caddy than if the mallet heads were arranged in side-by-side arrangement. Thus the pyramid stacking of the mallet heads reduces packaging size and it also allows individual mallets to be selectively removed from the caddy <b>10</b> without having to remove several mallets. For example, if the mallet heads were arranged whereby some mallet heads were stacked in a configuration in which the mallet heads overlapped one another, individual selective removal of the mallets from the caddy could not be achieved. While some may not appreciate the advantage of this configuration, parents will readily appreciate that children often have a favorite color mallet. If the individual mallets cannot be individually, selectively removed from the caddy without removing other mallets that may be stacked on top of the child's desired mallet, then inevitably, several mallets will end up laying on the ground before the child is able to remove the desired mallet. Thus, the croquet caddy <b>10</b> with the foregoing arrangement, promotes individual removal of all of the game components, thereby reducing effort in having to pick up after children or others, and provides an aesthetically pleasing and orderly arrangement of all the croquet game components.</div>
