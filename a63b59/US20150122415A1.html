<li> <para-num num="[0001]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to baseball and softball bats. More particularly, the present invention relates to a bat having a composite bat body of variable thickness and a sleeve.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">Baseball and softball are very popular sports in the United States and many other countries. Due to the competitive nature of these sports, players are constantly seeking ways of improving their performance. An important aspect of baseball and softball is the ability to effectively hit the ball.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Metal (aluminum) bats are allowed in baseball amateur play from Little League to College levels. Metal bats are also typically used in slow and fast pitch softball. Metal bats are advantageous over wood bats in that they do not break and splinter like wood bats and thus can be used repeatedly with consequent cost savings.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">However, metal bats have certain disadvantages, including vibrating upon impact and sending painful vibrations into the hands and arms of the batter if the ball is not hit within the “sweet spot” of the bat. Metal bats, particularly aluminum bats, may also dent or otherwise deform due to forceful impacts with the ball. Metal bats also emit an undesirable high-pitched metallic sound, as opposed to the traditional sound heard when a wood bat contacts the ball.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">Various attempts have been made to overcome the problems associated with metal bats, including coating or wrapping the exterior of the metal bat with material such as carbon reinforcing fibers to enhance batting performance. Other attempts have been made to insert internal layers or compartments within the metal bat to improve performance. Bats that incorporate composite materials tend to be much lighter than metal bats. However, while providing benefits, these designs also have drawbacks in that they can be expensive to manufacture and are prone to structural failure.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">Notwithstanding the disadvantages of metal and composite bats, these bats are very popular at the amateur level as not only can they be used repeatedly with consequent cost savings, but they also have a larger “sweet spot” hitting area or power zone than wood bats. Furthermore, the ball comes off a metal bat faster than a wood bat, resulting in longer hits.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">In fact, over the years there have been many injuries and near misses attributed to the speed from which the ball comes off a metal and/or composite bat. Several years ago the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) for college baseball and the National Federation of High School Association (NFHS) for high school baseball began to regulate the batted-ball speeds of baseball bats indirectly by regulating the Ball Exit Speed Ratio (BESR) and controlling the bat swing speed by limiting the moment-of-inertia (MOI) of non-wood baseball bats. This complicated standard measured the ratio of the ball exit speed to the combined speeds of the pitched ball and the swung bat.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">More recently, a new standard was set forth by the NCAA and NFHS which measures bat performance and replaces the previous BESR standard. This new standard is referred to as the BBCOR Bat Standard, or the Batted-Ball Coefficient of Restitution, sometimes referred to as Bat-Ball Coefficient of Restitution. Instead of measuring the speed of the ball after it is batted, BBCOR measures the “bounciness” of the ball and bat or the “trampoline” effect. A pitched ball holds a lot of energy, and with solid wood bats much of that energy is lost as the ball compresses on impact. With hollow metal and composite bats, the ball distorts less, retaining its pitched energy, and adds to it the power of the bat speed. Hence, traditionally non-wood bats have hit balls faster. BBCOR is calculated using the inbound and rebound speeds of the ball. The loss of energy at impact is what BBCOR measures, and the new standard ensures that performances by non-wood bats are more comparable to those of wood bats.</div>

<heading id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0030]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0034" num="0030">As shown in the accompanying drawings, for purposes of illustration, the present invention is concerned with a bat <b>10</b> for use in baseball or softball. With reference now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the bat <b>10</b> comprises a composite bat body <b>12</b> which includes a handle portion <b>14</b> at one end thereof and a barrel portion <b>16</b> at a generally opposite end thereof. The handle <b>14</b> and barrel <b>16</b> portions are integrally connected to one another, such that the barrel portion <b>16</b> extends from the handle <b>14</b>. Typically, as illustrated, the handle portion <b>14</b> is of a much smaller diameter than the barrel portion <b>16</b>, and thus there can be considered to be a generally tapered portion <b>18</b> intermediate the handle <b>14</b> and barrel <b>16</b> portions.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0031]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0035" num="0031">The bat body <b>12</b> is preferably made from a composite material, e.g., fiberglass, carbon fibers, or a combination of glass and carbon fibers. For example, 80% glass to 20% carbon will make a very flexible bat, whereas 20% glass to 80% carbon makes a very stiff bat, or any other ratio of glass to fiber in order to obtain a desired flex in the bat <b>10</b>.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0032]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0036" num="0032">The bat body <b>12</b> is comprised of a number of laminate layers. An aspect of the present invention is that the number of laminate layers, and thus the thickness, of the bat body along a length thereof varies. This is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>. With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, towards an end of the barrel section <b>16</b> there are a number of laminate layers <b>20</b> of the composite material. However, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, there are fewer laminate layers <b>20</b> of the composite material in a mid-section of the barrel <b>16</b> so as to create a thinner portion of the barrel which defines a ball striking portion of the bat <b>10</b>. With reference now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it can be seen that the handle portion <b>14</b> also has a large number of laminate layers <b>20</b>.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0033]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0037" num="0033">It will be appreciated that the number of laminate layers <b>20</b> along the length of the bat body can be varied as needed to meet the desired characteristics of the bat. For example, with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>, the end of the barrel <b>16</b> and the handle portion <b>14</b> may have up to forty laminate layers of the composite material <b>20</b>. The ball striking portion <b>22</b> of the bat body, intermediate the end of the bat barrel <b>16</b> and the handle portion <b>14</b> can have up to twenty layers of laminate material <b>20</b>. Typically, the ball striking portion <b>22</b> of the bat <b>10</b> will have fewer laminate layers <b>20</b> than that of the end of the barrel <b>16</b> and the handle <b>14</b> (or even the tapered section <b>18</b>) of the bat body <b>12</b>. However, the number of laminate layers of composite material can be selected and created during the manufacturing of the bat <b>10</b> to meet the desired characteristics of the bat <b>10</b>. Thus, while the handle portion <b>14</b> is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> as having more laminate layers <b>20</b> than the end of the barrel <b>16</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, this is not necessarily the case. These sections <b>14</b> and <b>16</b> can have as few as a single laminate layer or more, typically up to forty layers of laminate composite material. However, in a particularly preferred embodiment, at least a portion of the barrel comprises fewer layers of the composite material <b>20</b> than the handle <b>14</b> and the end <b>24</b> of the barrel. In fact, the ball striking portion <b>22</b> of the barrel <b>16</b> may be comprised of five or fewer layers of the composite material, and in some instances only one or two layers of the composite material, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</div>

The sleeve <b>26</b> is comprised of a metal or composite material which has greater impact absorption and resistance characteristics than the composite bat body <b>12</b>. For example, the sleeve <b>26</b> may be comprised of a lightweight yet durable metal, such as aluminum, titanium, magnesium, or alloy thereof which has a different impact absorption and resistance than the material forming the bat body <b>12</b>. The sleeve <b>26</b> may be formed of an aluminum alloy or even a composite material, including fiberglass, carbon fibers, or a combination of glass and carbon fibers so long as the sleeve <b>26</b> has a greater impact absorption and resistance characteristics than the composite material forming the bat body <b>12</b>. Typically, the sleeve is comprised of a 6,000 or 7,000 series of aluminum alloy in which zinc is the major alloying element coupled with a smaller percentage of magnesium, resulting in a heat-treatable alloy of very high strength.</div>

For example, the exposed end portion <b>24</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be two inches to three inches in length, whereas the exposed portion in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may only be one-half of an inch. This will also give the bat different characteristics, including the bat of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> being of a lighter weight than that of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> due to the smaller sleeve and thus a lighter weight.</div>
