<heading id="h-0001">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0001]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0002" num="0001">The modern sport of fencing is hundreds of years old. Historically, referees and bout directors awarded points (or touchesâ€”where one opponent's weapon blade or tip makes contact with the target area of the other opponent) by visually observing two opponents and determining whether a touch occurred and whether the fencer scoring the touch should be awarded a point based on existing rules. The object of saber fencing, based on cavalry fencing on horseback, is to score touches by contacting a blade or tip of a fencer's weapon with an opponent's target area (above that opponent's waist including his arms and head). The object of foil fencing is to score touches by contacting the tip of a fencer's weapon with an opponent's target area (the opponent's torso). The object of epee fencing, based on first-blood duels, is to score touches by contacting the tip of a fencer's weapon with an opponent's target area (any part of the opponent's body). Each form of modern sport of fencing is very rapid. Often actions, contacts, and target areas are difficult to visually see. Modern fencing weapons are so light that skilled fencers can manipulate them with extreme speed in flurries of action. This speed renders it difficult to determine when touches are scored. Even where several officials are employed to judge a match, visual identification of scoring maneuvers is difficult. Disagreement between officials often occurs, due to the inconsistency in the quality of perspective enjoyed by the various officials. Moreover, judgment by visual observation is a subjective criterion, and the acuity of vision may vary among officials, and even in the same official.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">In the 1970s electronic circuits were used to aid in awarding touches. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts the current state of the art fencing scoring system. Each fencer X, Y holds a weapon <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> which includes a blade <b>20</b> connected to a wire running down each fencer's sleeve (not shown) and connected behind each fencer to a reel wire <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> affixed to a retractable reel <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>. Each fencer X, Y wears a jacket <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> which can be made of a conductive material, a mask <b>30</b> which can be made of conductive material, and a wire <b>31</b> connecting the mask to the jacket <b>21</b>. The terminal of the reel wire <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> is also connected electrically to the fencer's jacket <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>. Each reel <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> is connected to an electrical scoring apparatus <b>10</b> that has indicators Wx, Cx, Wy, Cy which alternately illuminate to indicate a touch. If the weapon being fenced is saber, then when fencer Y in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> contacts fencer X with any portion of the blade <b>20</b> of weapon <b>14</b> on a conductive area of either jacket <b>22</b> or mask <b>33</b>, a circuit connects and indicator light Wy indicates fencer A scored a touch. A referee or director D will use this information and his or her visualization of the action to decide whether fender Y's touch should be awarded a point. When fencer X in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> contacts fencer Y with the blade <b>16</b> of saber <b>12</b> on fencer Y's conductive area of either jacket <b>22</b> or mask <b>33</b>, a circuit connects and indicator light Wx illuminates. Often both lights Wy and Wx will illuminate and a director or referee will need to determine to which fencer, if any, a touch should be awarded according to the rules of saber fencing.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Foil fencing includes a similar configuration to the saber configuration of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, except each fencer X, Y hold a foil and jackets <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> have a conductive target area comprising the fencer's torso. A valid touch signal in foil includes the breaking of a first circuit and completing a second. A foil has a movable contact on its tip, which is depressed whenever the tip <b>16</b> touches an object, breaking the first electrical circuit. Each contestant wears a vest-like garment which covers the valid target portion of his body. The vest has a conductive surface, and is connected in a second circuit between the electrical scoring apparatus <b>10</b> and the opponent's foil. The movable contact on each foil is itself conductive. When the movable contact of one fencer's foil touches the opponent's conductive vest, the second electrical circuit is completed, and the first circuit is broken, producing a valid touch signal (thus illuminating respective indicator Wx or Wy). An invalid touch in foil is indicated merely by the breaking of the first circuit (thus illuminating respective indicator Cx, Cy), since in an invalid touch, the foil fails to contact the opponent's vest.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Epee fencing includes a similar configuration to the saber configuration of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, except each fencer X, Y hold an epee and wear a jacket <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> that need not include a conductive area. A touch signal in epee constitutes simply the making of one circuit. The movable contact in the epee touch sensor assembly completes the circuit on depression in the course of a touch. Errant touches on the piste <b>35</b> or on the opponent's weapon body are not scored. Accordingly, if a fencer's epee tip touches the piste <b>35</b>, or his opponent's weapon, the electrical scoring apparatus <b>10</b> disables the scoring indicators, preventing the registration of a touch in response to such errant touches. The movable contact on the epee tip is conductive as in the case of the foil. It is connected to a portion of the electrical scoring apparatus <b>10</b> which, if grounded, prevents actuation of the valid touch indicators. The piste <b>35</b> is grounded, as is the body of each weapon <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, so that errant touches on the weapon body or the piste <b>35</b> are not counted as scores.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">A problem associated with the state of the art fencing system is that electrical scoring apparatuses are often difficult to see for fencers and referees who must rapidly turn their attention from the fencing action to observe indicator lights on the apparatus. They can be confusing to spectators who have to associate one color light with each fencer and often are unsure which light represents which fencer. One way to combat this to include indicator lights in a fencer's mask. When a touch is scored, lights or LED arrays situated in a fencers mask illuminate based on control signals from electrical scoring apparatus <b>10</b>. Control signals can be sent wirelessly or via a wired connection. Illuminating masks are helpful in that they allow easy viewing when touches are scored by fencers, referees, and observers. However, they are often costly and may require after market electronics and batteries in order to function properly. Also, each fencer is only able to see the mask of the other which indicates a touch scored. They are unable to see the indicator contained in their own mask or may not have a mask that contains indicators. Thus they may have to look to an external scoring apparatus <b>10</b> to determine whether they also scored a touch which requires altering a field of view away from the fencing action.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">Alternatively an external device situated either on the fencers' garments or connected to a socket on the underside of a fencer's weapon guard may emit a signal indicator such as a light or sound. These devices are often less costly, however, they are of limited use in that they can easily be misheard and do not offer a convenient vantage for fencers, referees, and observers.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">Further, many other sports could benefit from equipment having indicator feedback where presently the equipment for engaging in the play of the sport has none.
