<li> <para-num num="[0001]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to baseball and softball bats. More particularly, the present invention relates to a vibration damper end knob for a baseball or softball bat.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">Baseball and softball are very popular sports in the United States and throughout many countries in the world. Due to the competitive nature of these sports, players are constantly seeking ways of improving their performance. An important aspect of baseball and softball is the ability to effectively hit the ball.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Wooden bats are well known, and exclusively used at the professional level in the United States. However, metal and composite bats are allowed in baseball amateur play from Little League to Collegiate levels. Metal and composite bats are also typically used in slow and fast pitch softball. Metal and composite bats are advantageous over wood bats in that they do not break and splinter like wood bats and thus can be used repeatedly with consequent cost savings.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">However, metal and composite bats have certain disadvantages. These bats can send painful vibrations into the hands and arms of the batter if the ball is not hit within the “sweet spot” of the bat. There have been many attempts to control or even eliminate such painful vibrations. However, many of these attempts reduce the effectiveness of the bat, are complicated and expensive to manufacture or implement, or are not very effective in controlling or eliminating the vibrations.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, there is a continuing need for a baseball or a softball bat with a vibration damper or control. Such a vibration damper should be relatively simple and cost-effective while effectively dampening the vibration caused by mishits. The present invention fulfills these needs, and provides other related advantages.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0019]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0020" num="0019">As shown in the accompanying drawings, for purposes of illustration, the present invention resides in an assembly which functions as an end knob for a baseball or softball bat while also dampening vibrations caused when the bat hits a ball.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0020]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0021" num="0020">With reference now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a bat <b>10</b>, such as a baseball or softball bat, is illustrated. The bat <b>10</b> includes a barrel portion <b>12</b>, which is typically used to hit a ball, such as a baseball or softball. Generally opposite the barrel <b>12</b> is a handle portion <b>14</b>, which is used to grasp the bat <b>10</b> and swing it in order to hit a ball, as is well known. The barrel <b>12</b> and the handle <b>14</b> portions of the bat <b>10</b> may be comprised of a metal, such as an aluminum or titanium alloy or the like, composite materials, wood, or any other suitable material or combinations of materials. The barrel <b>12</b> and the handle <b>14</b> may be formed of two distinct sections which are later interconnected to one another to form the bat <b>10</b>. For example, the handle section <b>14</b> may be comprised of a composite material while the barrel section <b>12</b> is comprised of a metal alloy material.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0021]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0022" num="0021">Typically, an otherwise open end of the barrel portion <b>12</b> is enclosed, such as by attaching an end cap <b>16</b> thereto, as is known in the art. Alternatively, the end of the barrel portion <b>12</b> may be formed integrally and closed off so as not to require a separate end cap <b>16</b>.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0022]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0023" num="0022">The type of material selected for the barrel portion <b>12</b> and handle portion <b>14</b>, or the entire bat <b>10</b> is not critical to the present invention. The present invention can be incorporated into many differing types of baseball and softball bats, whether they be sectional, hybrid, a single composite material, a single metal alloy, etc. So long as the bat <b>10</b> has a handle portion with a free end thereof substantially hollow, the present invention can be incorporated into such a bat. It is quite common for metal and/or composite bats to have a hollow handle <b>14</b>, as illustrated. Instead of attaching or forming a traditional end knob to the end of the handle <b>14</b>, the assembly of the present invention is installed instead which forms an end knob and also dampens and controls vibrations experienced by the bat <b>10</b> when it strikes an object, such as a ball.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0023]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0024" num="0023">With particular reference now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an open end <b>18</b> of the handle <b>14</b> is shown, with components of the end knob assembly of the present invention shown exploded therefrom. The vibration damper end knob assembly of the present invention generally comprises a core <b>20</b>, a sleeve <b>22</b> and a sheath <b>24</b>.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0024]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0025" num="0024">The core <b>20</b> is typically comprised of a rigid material, such as plastic, wood, a composite material, or a metal, such as aluminum. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the core <b>20</b> includes a base <b>26</b> having a shaft <b>28</b> extending therefrom. The shaft <b>28</b> has an outer diameter and configuration suitable for being inserted into the open end <b>18</b> of the handle <b>14</b> of the bat <b>10</b>. As such, the outer diameter of the shaft <b>28</b> is less than the inner diameter of the hollow handle <b>14</b>.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0025]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0026" num="0025">With reference now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 6</figref>, the sleeve <b>22</b> is disposed between the shaft <b>28</b> of the core <b>20</b> and an inner wall or surface <b>30</b> of the handle <b>14</b>. The sleeve <b>22</b> may be a generally cylindrical distinct item, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which is insertable over the shaft <b>28</b> of the core <b>20</b>, or may be directly applied to the shaft <b>28</b> of the core <b>20</b>. For example, the sleeve <b>22</b> may comprise two-sided tape which is wrapped around the shaft <b>28</b> of the core <b>20</b> before insertion into the open end <b>18</b> of the handle <b>14</b>. Other multi-layer materials, such as a polymer material, may be wrapped around the shaft <b>28</b> of the core <b>20</b> to form the sleeve <b>22</b> as well. The sleeve <b>22</b> could also be comprised of a thermoplastic material, resin, or other adhesive which is disposed in a liquid form between the core shaft <b>28</b> and the inner wall of the handle <b>30</b> during manufacturing, and which later sets to a solid or semi-solid material. Preferably, the sleeve is comprised of a material which has vibration dampening characteristics, such as a polymer, plastic, or elastomeric material.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0026]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0027" num="0026">In the case when the sleeve <b>22</b> comprises a distinct cylindrical member or is formed by wrapping multiple layers of material around the shaft <b>28</b> of the core <b>20</b>, a layer of adhesive may be applied to the outer surface of the sleeve <b>22</b> to both act as a lubricant when inserting the sleeve <b>22</b> and shaft <b>28</b> of the core <b>20</b> into the open end <b>18</b> of the handle <b>14</b>. The use of the adhesive on the outer surface of the sleeve <b>22</b> also serves to lock the core <b>20</b> and sleeve <b>22</b> in place within the handle <b>14</b> of the baseball bat <b>10</b> after the adhesive sets.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0027]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0028" num="0027">Alternatively, or in addition to using an adhesive, apertures <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, and <b>36</b> may be formed through the handle <b>14</b>, sleeve <b>22</b>, and core shaft <b>28</b>, respectively, which are generally alignable with one another when the sleeve <b>22</b> and shaft <b>28</b> of the core <b>20</b> is inserted within the handle <b>14</b>. A pin <b>38</b> is inserted through the aligned apertures <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> and <b>36</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, so as to fasten and lock the shaft <b>28</b> of the core <b>20</b> and the sleeve <b>22</b> to the handle <b>14</b> of the bat <b>10</b>. It will be appreciated that when incorporating the insertion of the pin <b>38</b> into the aligned apertures <b>32</b>-<b>36</b>, the use of an adhesive to fasten the sleeve <b>22</b> and shaft <b>28</b> of the core <b>20</b> in place within the handle <b>14</b> is not required. However, the adhesive may still be beneficial in the sense that it acts as a lubricant to help the sleeve <b>22</b> fit into the handle <b>14</b> of the bat <b>10</b>, and after hardening hold it in place securely.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0028]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0029" num="0028">Although the core <b>20</b> may be solid, in a particularly preferred embodiment, as illustrated, the shaft <b>28</b> of the core is tubular so as to form a passageway <b>40</b> therein, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The base <b>26</b> of the core <b>20</b> is at least partially hollow and includes one or more apertures <b>42</b> formed therein. The apertures <b>42</b> extend into the base <b>26</b>, so as to form the hollow portion of the base <b>26</b>, or are in communication with the hollow portion of the base <b>26</b>, such that the core shaft passageway <b>40</b> and the one or more apertures <b>42</b> of the base <b>26</b> are in communication with one another. In one embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the core <b>20</b> includes a plurality of apertures <b>42</b> spaced from one another about a periphery of the base <b>26</b>.

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0029]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0030" num="0029">The formation of the passageway <b>40</b> in the core shaft <b>28</b> as well as the plurality of apertures <b>42</b> within the core base <b>26</b> can serve multiple purposes. One of these purposes is the removal of material in order to control and lessen the weight of the end knob assembly, and thus the overall weight of the bat <b>10</b>. It is very desirable to have bats <b>10</b> weigh as little as possible. This is beneficial in the sense that a lighter bat <b>10</b> can be swung more quickly than a heavier bat. Also, swinging a lighter bat <b>10</b> does not require as much strength or physical exertion on behalf of the player. This can be particularly important with younger players.</div>

This elastomeric material <b>44</b> would help to dampen vibration when the bat <b>10</b> hits a ball. The material <b>44</b> may also be selected for weight control purposes.</div>

This is so that at least a portion of the base <b>26</b> does not extend into the handle <b>14</b>, but instead is abutted adjacent to the end of the handle <b>14</b> and extends outwardly from the end of the handle <b>14</b>. In fact, in an embodiment as illustrated, the base <b>26</b> includes a landing portion or shoulder <b>46</b> to which the open end of the handle <b>18</b> rests upon, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>. It will be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> that the diameter <b>26</b> of the base is greater than the diameter of the handle section <b>14</b> at the end of the bat <b>10</b>.

In the present invention, such vibrations are dampened by the sleeve <b>22</b> and the sheath <b>24</b>, which are comprised of vibration dampening materials, such as elastomeric materials. Thus, as the vibrations travel along the length of the bat <b>10</b> towards the end of the handle <b>14</b>, these vibrations are dampened when they encounter the sleeve <b>22</b> and the sheath <b>24</b>, which absorb the energy of the vibrations. In the embodiment wherein a vibration dampening material, such as a neoprene, rubber, or other elastomeric material <b>44</b> is disposed within the core <b>20</b>, that material <b>44</b> also serves to dampen and eliminate the vibrations and the energy otherwise imparted from such.</div>

However, the cover shell <b>58</b> of the sheath <b>24</b> can extend over a greater portion of the handle section <b>14</b> of the bat, such as up to an entire length of the handle section <b>14</b>. Bats typically include a grip <b>60</b> comprised of leather, rubber, cushioned material, or other gripping and comfortable surfaces which are grasped by the hands of the batter. In the present invention, the grip <b>60</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, could be placed immediately adjacent to the top of the cover shell <b>58</b> of the sheath <b>24</b>. However, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the grip <b>60</b> can also be wrapped around or otherwise extend over the cover shell <b>58</b> of the sheath <b>24</b>. In this manner, the batter can comfortably and securely grasp the handle <b>14</b> of the bat <b>10</b>. The sheath <b>24</b>, and particularly the cover shell <b>58</b> could be comprised of an elastomeric material which is tacky and provides a good grip. Alternatively, the outer surface of the cover shell <b>58</b> could be textured so as to present a tacky gripping surface. This can particularly be useful when the cover shell <b>58</b> extends over a significant length of the handle section <b>14</b>, so as to be gripped directly. In this case, the cover shell <b>58</b> would either completely replace the grip <b>60</b>, or be placed over the grip <b>60</b> which would primarily serve as a cushion between the cover shell grip <b>58</b> and the handle section <b>14</b>.</div>
