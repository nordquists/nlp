</li> <li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to ball bats and more particularly to a ball bat body made of fiber-reinforced resin materials and a method to produce it.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">It was known that the conventional ball bats are generally made of wood, metal, fiber-reinforced resin material or a combination of them. Yet for having good performance and durability, the bat constructed entirely with fiber-reinforced resin materials predominated over the other conventional ball bats. The traditional fiber-reinforced resin ball bats, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,848,745 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,395,108, normally included multiple sleeves and each of sleeves is formed by a single sheet of fiber-reinforced resin materials through the roll wrapping process.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">As is known, a typical ball bat usually includes a hitting section, a tapered section and a handle section. Based on prior experience, for having a preferred performance, each of sections must have its own property for serving different function. For example, the hitting section should be more stiff than the other sections and the tapered section should be more flexible than the hitting section. However, for each of sleeves of the prior art ball bat body is formed by a single sheet of fiber-reinforced resin materials so that all of sections of the prior art ball body have a uniform property. In other words, the prior art fiber-reinforced resin ball bat body can not reflect such demand perfectly.</div>

Here, the fiber-reinforced resin material means a material of fiber reinforcement impregnated in a resin matrix. The resin matrix can be a thermoplastic resin or a thermosetting resin.
