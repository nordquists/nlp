<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">Baseball and softball bats have conventionally included a knob at the end of the bat handle primarily to reduce the risk of the bat being thrown from a player's hands during a swing, particularly when the player loses grip on the handle. While conventional batting technique involves a player grasping the bat handle just above the knob, batters are increasingly adopting a different technique in which they grasp the knob with the palm of one hand and up to three fingers. This technique essentially provides a longer effective length of the bat, and, in turn, increased leverage for additional velocity and force against a batted ball. But grasping the knob while swinging a bat can increase the risk of wrist and palm injuries, and it also largely defeats the safety purpose of the knob because one hand is already partially off of the handle portion of the bat. Indeed, the knob-grasping technique puts added pressure on the hypothenar region of the palm, and, specifically, on the ulnar nerve, which can result in temporary failure of the ulnar nerve during the swing, resulting in injury or a thrown bat.</div>

The technology may also be used in other sporting-good implements. The present technology allows a user to maximize velocity and force of a bat barrel during a swing while also reducing the risk of injury to the user and reducing the risk of a thrown bat. Examples of this technology are illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>.</div>

The bat <b>100</b> may be a baseball or softball bat, or it may be another suitable batting or hitting implement. The bat <b>100</b> is collectively referred to herein as a “ball bat” or “bat.” The ball bat <b>100</b> may include a transitional or taper region <b>130</b> in which the larger diameter of the barrel region <b>110</b> transitions to the narrower diameter of the handle region <b>120</b>. The barrel region <b>110</b> may be closed with an end cap <b>140</b>. In some embodiments, an end cap may be excluded, for example, in bats generally formed from solid wood or other solid materials.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0021]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0022" num="0021">An integral or attached knob <b>150</b> is positioned at a distal end of the handle region <b>120</b>. The knob <b>150</b> may have a generally circular configuration extending circumferentially about the end of the handle region <b>120</b>, or it may have another suitable configuration.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0022]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0023" num="0022">The ball bat <b>100</b> may have any suitable dimensions.

Typical ball bats have diameters of 2.25, 2.625, or 2.75 inches. Bats having various combinations of these overall lengths and barrel diameters, or any other suitable dimensions, are contemplated herein. The specific preferred combination of bat dimensions is generally dictated by the user of the bat <b>100</b>, and may vary greatly between users.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0023]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0024" num="0023">At least a portion of the handle region <b>120</b> and the knob <b>150</b> may be covered with a grip <b>160</b>. In some embodiments, the grip <b>160</b> is an integral, single-piece grip <b>160</b>. In other embodiments described in further detail below, the grip <b>160</b> is formed from multiple pieces or multiple grips. In some embodiments, the grip <b>160</b> covers the entire knob <b>150</b>. The grip <b>160</b> may extend from the knob <b>150</b> up to a distance of approximately 10 inches along the handle region <b>120</b>. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the grip <b>160</b> may accommodate both of a player's hands. In other embodiments, the grip <b>160</b> may extend a shorter distance from the knob <b>150</b> (for example, approximately 0.5 inches) along the handle region <b>120</b>. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the grip <b>160</b> may accommodate only the portion of the player's hand that grasps the knob <b>150</b>. In yet other embodiments, the grip <b>160</b> may extend from the knob <b>150</b> to other distances along the handle region <b>120</b>, such as a distance in the range of 0.5 inches to 10 inches, or other suitable distances, depending on user preference.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0024]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0025" num="0024">The grip <b>160</b> may be formed with a different degree of hardness (i.e., durometer measurement) in a handle portion <b>170</b> of the grip <b>160</b> than in a knob portion <b>180</b> of the grip <b>160</b>. For example, the knob portion <b>180</b> of the grip <b>160</b> may exhibit a softer degree of hardness in order to allow the knob portion <b>180</b> to temporarily deform slightly during the period of the swing that is most often associated with injury. Such deformation may temporarily result in increased contact surface area of the grip <b>160</b>, which results in less pressure on the hypothenar region of the hand, and therefore less risk of injury or risk of a thrown bat. Accordingly, a user can use a technique that involves gripping the knob <b>150</b> for higher barrel velocity during a swing, while the grip <b>160</b> reduces the risk of injury or a thrown bat.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0025]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0026" num="0025">The handle portion <b>170</b> of the grip <b>160</b> may be configured to have a higher degree of hardness than that of the knob portion <b>180</b> so that the upper hand (closest to the barrel region <b>110</b>) can grip the bat <b>100</b> without causing much deformation of the handle portion <b>170</b>. This higher degree of hardness in the handle portion <b>170</b> may be desirable to players wanting their top hand to feel more connected to the bat <b>100</b> so that they receive the sensory input necessary to make fine adjustments to better position the barrel region <b>110</b> to impact a ball during a swing.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0026]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0027" num="0026">Accordingly, a bat <b>100</b> using a grip <b>160</b> of the present technology can provide enhanced safety for the user, and for other players and spectators, when the user employs a gripping technique that involves grasping the knob <b>150</b>, while also maintaining proper feel for the upper hand on the handle portion <b>170</b> for control of the swing. A grip <b>160</b> of the present technology may also be advantageous for a player using a standard or traditional batting grip (in which both hands are positioned on the handle region <b>120</b> above the knob <b>150</b>) because, in such a traditional grip, the bottom hand (closest to the knob <b>150</b>) still receives the most force, particularly when the user decelerates the bat.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0027]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, the grip <b>160</b> may be formed from silicone, urethane, rubber, or polyurethane foam. In other embodiments, the grip <b>160</b> may be formed from other suitable materials, including other elastomers. The grip may be formed from multiple, different materials, for example, one material may form the handle portion <b>170</b> while another material may form the knob portion <b>180</b>. In other embodiments, the grip material may be generally uniform throughout the grip <b>160</b>. In such embodiments, the grip material may be provided with different degrees of hardness in various locations by curing the material in various locations at different temperatures. For example, the handle portion <b>170</b> may be cured at a different temperature than the knob portion <b>180</b> to provide the handle portion <b>170</b> with a higher degree of hardness (or a lower degree of hardness, if desired).</div>

The hardness of the handle portion <b>170</b> and the knob portion <b>180</b> may vary according to user preference. For example, in some embodiments, the handle portion <b>170</b> may have a degree of hardness between approximately Shore 60 A and Shore 60 D. And in some embodiments, the knob portion <b>180</b> may have a degree of hardness between approximately Shore 40 A and Shore 70 A. In other embodiments, other suitable degrees of hardness may be used.</div>

For example, in some embodiments, the handle portion <b>170</b> may have a thickness of 0.05 inches. The knob portion <b>180</b> of the grip <b>160</b> may have a thickness within the range of approximately 0.125 inches to 0.400 inches. For example, in some embodiments, the knob portion <b>180</b> may have a thickness of approximately 0.4 inches. In other embodiments, other suitable dimensions may be used.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0030]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0031" num="0030">During testing, the inventors were surprised to observe that batters using embodiments of the present technology achieved increased exit velocities relative to similar ball bats that did not include a knob-and-handle grip <b>160</b>. These increased exit velocities generally occurred even after the batter took over <b>100</b> swings, which is surprising because exit velocities typically decrease as a batter's hands become fatigued and damaged from such a high number of swings. And a batter will generally produce approximately the same exit velocity when swinging bats having a given barrel, but the inventors were surprised to observe that batters experienced increased exit velocities when using bats having the same barrel but incorporating grips <b>160</b> of the present technology.</div>

For example, the knob portion <b>180</b> and the handle portion <b>170</b> may be separate pieces contacting or attached to each other at an interface <b>190</b>. The interface <b>190</b> may be located at any suitable position along the handle region <b>120</b> to accommodate various sizes of user hands and/or user preferences. In some embodiments, one or more additional grips may be included on the handle region <b>120</b> to accommodate a player's upper hand (and potentially a portion of the player's lower hand, depending on the size of the grip <b>160</b>). In such embodiments, an upper grip may be formed and/or positioned similar to that of the handle portion <b>170</b>, while a lower grip may be formed and/or positioned similar to that of the knob portion <b>180</b>.
