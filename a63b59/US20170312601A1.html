<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div html="" itemprop="content"><abstract lang="EN" load-source="patent-office" mxw-id="PA208627308">
<div class="abstract" id="p-0001" num="0000">A game stick and game are disclosed. The game stick includes a shaft with a head at one end. A channel wide enough for a game ball is defined in the head. The ball is placed in the channel and when the game stick is swung, the ball rides along the channel and is released therefrom to fly through the air. The head may be adjustable to affect the way in which the ball is thrown. The game is similar to golf except that instead of hitting the ball, the ball is thrown toward a target location at the end of a fairway. When the target location is reached, the game stick may be used as a putter to push or putt the ball to sink it into a sunken cup in the ground.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">As is well known in the art, golf is a game that is played on a golf course which includes nine or eighteen holes. Each hole includes a tee-off location, a fairway and a green, with the tee-off location being situated some distance from the green. A cup (a depression in the ground) is located somewhere on the green and is marked by a flag so that the golfer has a visual aid at which to aim during play. The golfer positions his or her ball at the tee-off location on a particular hole and strikes the ball with the head of one of a group of clubs to move the ball through the air to some distance down the fairway. The fairway is of a sufficient length to require the golfer to strike the ball one or more times to move the ball from the tee-off location to the remote green. Once at the green, the golfer selects a putter (a specially designed club) to strike the ball so that it rolls across the surface of the green toward the cup and drops into the same. Depending on the skill of the golfer, the putter may need to be used more than once to sink the ball in the cup. Each strike of the ball with a club or with a putter is counted as a single stroke. Each hole on the golf course is rated so that the golfer will know a desired number of strokes to play for that particular hole. Scoring is based on how many strokes it takes the golfer to get the golf ball from the tee-off location to the point he or she sinks the ball in the cup. Thus, a hole is a par-three (three strokes), par-four (four strokes) or par-five (five strokes). The fairway will typically include one or more obstacles such as sand-traps or water hazards to increase the difficulty of play. Penalties can be accrued on a hole if a golfer makes a miss-step during play.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Golfers are required to play in accordance with a standard set of procedures and rules. The rules are dependent upon the country in which the game is played with the majority of the world playing in accordance with the rules set out by The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews in Scotland. In the United States golfers have to adhere to rules administered by the United States Golf Association (USGA).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">While there are a vast number of golfers in the world it has become apparent over recent years that fewer younger people are taking part in this well-loved sport. The reasons for this are not entirely clear but several studies have suggested that the game is too slow for the younger generation, requires too much time, skill, and effort, and is too costly from the point of view of equipment needed, lessons that have to be taken, as well as for the play of a single round of the game. Because of this situation, golf courses, particularly at the local level, are struggling to stay afloat financially.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition to this situation, there is growing evidence that younger people are not as active as they should or could be and this lack of activity is posing a serious risk to their long-term health.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">There is therefore a need in the art for a game that encourages younger people to become more active, is fun, quick to learn and relatively inexpensive to play.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">A game and a game stick for playing this new game are disclosed. The game is a new athletic sport that can be played on a course which includes one or more ‘holes’. Preferably, the course is outdoors and each hole includes a starting location, a remote target location and a fairway between the start and target locations. The course could be a grassy course or a sandy course (such as on a beach), or could even be an indoor course. Existing golf courses may act as suitable courses for playing the new game but it is contemplated that dedicated courses for the game could also be utilized. It is still further contemplated that players could set up their own course at any desired location, such as a beach for example, and play a “pick-up” version of the game that will be described further herein.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">A specially designed game stick is used for play and this game stick includes a shaft with a grip at one end and a head at the other end. The game ball may be played in at least two different ways using this game stick. In a first aspect, the invention may provide a game stick having a shaft with a first end and a second end; a head provided at the second end of the shaft; a channel defined in the head and configured to receive the game ball therein and from which channel the game ball is thrown during play. The game stick also may include a striking or pushing surface provided on the stick for pushing or putting the game ball when the ball is resting on a ground surface during play.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0010">The game ball may be a specially designed ball for a particular game stick and game, or the game ball can be a golf ball and the game stick configured consistent with golf ball dimensions. In embodiments, the channel can be configured to be only slightly larger than the ball which is to be used for the game, for example only 0.5 mm to 10 mm bigger than the diameter of the ball at the mid-point of the ball when the ball is in the channel. So, if a regular golf ball is used, the channel will be sized at the mid-point of a golf ball as it travels along the channel to be marginally wider than the diameter of a regular golf ball (which in the Unites States is 42.67 mm and in Britain is 41.15 mm). In embodiments where a golf ball is used, the width of the channel is less than 50 mm, 49 mm, 48 mm, 47 mm, 46 mm, 45 mm, 44 mm, 43.5 mm, 43 mm, 42.5 mm or even 42 mm. In embodiments, the channel size can be less than 120%, 115%, 110%, 108%, 106%, 105%, or even 104% wider than the width of the ball at the mid-point of the ball when the ball is in the channel. In embodiments where a U.S. golf ball is used, the width of the channel can be between 43.17 and 46.67 (inclusive), 43.67 and 45 mm (inclusive), or about 44 mm.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0011">During play on a course like a golf course, the player will place the ball in the channel of the head and throw the ball a distance down a fairway of a particular hole on the course. Throwing is accomplished by swinging the game stick through the air such as, for example, when throwing with a lacrosse stick, and then finishing the swing in such a way that the ball flies out of an opening at one end of the channel. The ball is retained in the head by centrifugal force during the swing and is propelled in part by that same force as it exits the channel. The game stick may be swung in pretty much any manner so that the player is able to throw the ball therefrom in a variety of different ways including but not limited to an overhand throw, underhand throw, forehand throw, backhand throw, a lob or any other manner that suits the player. The game stick may also be utilized to put a spin on the ball. The player may take a running start when throwing the ball.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0012]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0013" num="0012">The game begins at a starting location. If the course being utilized is a golf course, the starting location may be an area on a particular hole where traditional golfers tee off. Alternatively, the starting location may be an area that is specially designated and set up for players of this new sport and may be marked in any suitable fashion.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0013]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0014" num="0013">A player swings his or her game stick through the air to throw the ball down the fairway of the course and toward a target location. This may be with a running start, where the ball is released prior to crossing a start position. The player will then move to the position on the fairway where the ball landed after the throw, pick up the ball by hand (or using the stick) and place the ball in the channel of the game stick (or pick up the ball with the game stick) and then make a second throw of the ball toward the target location. One or more throws may be required to move the ball from the starting location to the target location. When the ball reaches the target location, such as a green surrounding a flagged cup of a golf course, the player will change their grip on the game stick from a throwing grip to a putting/pushing grip. The player will then use the dedicated striking surface on the game stick to push or putt the ball in a direction toward the sunken cup in order to try and sink the ball in the cup. One or more putts or pushes may prove to be necessary to accomplish this play. Alternatively, the player could use a conventional putter when the player reaches the green.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0014]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0015" num="0014">The head of the game stick may further include a recessed region on one of the side walls, rear wall or front wall thereof. The ball may be placed in this recess for throwing or chipping the ball shorter distances. Still further, the head may include a surface on one or both side walls, end wall or in some instances the front wall for hitting the ball. In this type of play, the ball may be tossed in the air and then struck with this hitting or striking surface.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0015]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0016" num="0015">Still further, the head may be adjustable relative to the shaft so that the player is able to make changes to the angle at which the channel extends relative to the shaft. This enables the player to change an arc through which the ball is thrown and also to affect the spin on the ball as desired. Alternatively, a player may have more than one game sticks, each with a different angle at which the channel extends relative to the shaft.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0016]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0017" num="0016">Still further, the head has a length which is measured from a front end to a back end thereof; and the channel generally extends along the majority of this length. It is contemplated that a hinge may be provided somewhere between the front and back ends which allows a front region of the head to pivot relative to a back region thereof. This feature could also be used to impart increased speed and/or spin to the ball. The hinge may alternatively be placed between the head and the shaft of the game stick.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0017]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0018" num="0017">During play on any particular hole, the player may mark the ball's position on the fairway (as is done in golf games) and then placing the ball in the game stick move several steps or paces back toward the starting location from the mark, move rapidly or run toward the target location, and throw the ball no later than when they reach the mark. This action obviously increases the velocity with which the ball is thrown from the head. It is contemplated that the rules and scoring of this new game will generally follow the rules and scoring of golf, with some exceptions that are set out later herein. It should be understood, however, that vastly different rules may be fashioned.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0018]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0019" num="0018">As indicated previously, the game stick itself has a shaft with a head at one end. The head defines a channel on its upper surface and into which the ball is placed. A grip preferably is provided at the opposite end of the shaft so that the game stick may be more easily held onto during the throwing movement when playing the game. The head may include a stop at a rearward first end of the channel which limits movement of the ball in a first direction. An opening is defined at a second end of the channel and it is through this opening that the ball exits the head during a throw.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0019]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0020" num="0019">In one aspect, the invention may provide a channel that together with the back wall is substantially J-shaped along their entire length from the first end thereof to the second end. This shape of the channel affects spin on the ball and creates an arc of flight for the ball.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0020]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0021" num="0020">In another aspect, the orientation of the head relative to the shaft may be adjustable. This feature enables the player to set the channel at a desired orientation relative to the shaft and to thereby manipulate the arc of flight for a ball thrown therefrom. The adjustment assembly is of such a nature as to enable the player to make quick and easy adjustments on the golf course during play. The player therefore does not need to carry a hole range of game sticks to play the game as one will suffice.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0021]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0022" num="0021">In another aspect, the game stick may be used as a putter when the player reaches the target location. To this end, at least a portion of the bottom edge of the head, at its outermost surface, can be straight, such that the head can rest flat on the ground and travel easily across the surface of the ground or grass when pushing or putting the ball at the target location. Additionally, a least a region of an exterior surface of a side region of the head proximate the straight portion can be planar in nature so that it can be used to strike or push the ball during a putting/pushing stroke.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0022]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0023" num="0022">The game stick can be configured so that during play the player will receive at different times a sensation similar to a perfect stroke in golf, the acceleration of throwing a jai-alai ball, and the power of a hockey slap-shot. The fun and challenge of the sport comes from the ability of the player to manipulate the spin, trajectory and distance of the ball in order to achieve precision, to avoid hazards, and to push/putt accurately, thereby getting to the target location and the hole in as few shots as possible.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0023]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0024" num="0023">It should be noted that the game is contemplated to be played by a group of players all throwing their balls down the fairway or by a group of mixed players some of whom are playing traditional golf using traditional clubs and some of whom are playing the new throwing sports using the game stick disclosed herein.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0024]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0025" num="0024">The new sport is more active and includes a more natural and athletic swing for the player than is the case in traditional golf. Additionally, the new sport is easy to learn, has a lower cost of entry, has quicker rounds and increased options for shots, and has simplified rules relative to traditional golf. For these reasons it is contemplated that the new sport will appeal to the younger generation.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0025]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0026" num="0025">It is further contemplated because of the looser swing and more athletic nature of the presently disclosed new sport and because there is no need to strike the ball on the ground as in traditional golf, the new sport could extend the season of a golf course in cooler climates, thus providing additional revenue to the golf course owners.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0026]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0027" num="0026">In one aspect of the invention, a game stick for use with a game ball is provided. The stick includes a shaft having a first end and a second end, where the first end is for gripping a shaft and the second end is attached to a rigid head. The head has (i) a neck for attachment to the shaft, (ii) a back wall extending from the neck curved in a radius to seat a golf ball, (iii) a bottom wall extending from the back wall along which the golf ball may travel from the back wall without interruption when the golf ball is thrown from the game stick, and (iv) side walls extending from the back wall. The bottom wall and side walls define a channel with an open end distal from the back wall through which the golf ball is released when the golf ball is thrown from the game stick. The shaft defines an shaft axis along its length and the channel defines a channel axis along its length, and the shaft axis and channel axis intersect at an obtuse angle. The channel can be between 42 and 50 millimeters in width along its length which is between 2 and 12 inches. The shaft is between 30 and 70 inches long, and the bottom wall extends from the back wall in a path toward the open end along a distance of at least 2 inches that is straight or concave, whereby the ball when under centrifugal force can move uninterrupted along the bottom wall at least three inches before leaving the open end of the channel. In this manner, spin is provided when throwing the ball.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0027]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0028" num="0027">In embodiments, then channel is preferably at least between 3 inches long.

The game is contemplated to be played upon a course which includes a plurality of discrete locations for play, with the discrete locations being referred to herein as “holes”. Each hole includes a starting location and a target location that is positioned a distance away from the starting location. A fairway extends between the starting location and the target location. The course for this new game may be an existing golf course where each hole includes a tee-off location and a flagged cup on a green a remote distance down the fairway from the tee-off location. Alternatively, the course may be a specially-dedicated and/or designed location for the new game.</div>

It will be understood, however, that other differently dimensioned game balls could be utilized, with the general dimensions of the game stick being selected to be complementary to the game ball utilized. The general objective of the game is to engage the game ball with the game stick and to use the game stick to throw the game ball from the starting location to the target location down the fairway. The distance from the starting location to the target location may require one or more throws of the game ball. Once the target location is reached, the game stick is used to sink the game ball into a cup. A plurality of these holes will be played during the course of a single game. The game stick and the method of playing this new game will be further described herein.</div>

Apertures <b>440</b> are provided for a number of purposes. Firstly, they reduce the overall weight of head <b>414</b> and thus of game stick <b>410</b>. Secondly, they permit airflow therethrough and this aids in moving a game ball <b>48</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) through channel <b>438</b> as will be later described herein. The placement, size and shape of the various apertures <b>440</b>, in general, may be changed as desired and the placement, size and shape thereof should not be considered to be limited to the exact configuration shown herein.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0073]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0069" num="0073">Two apertures, however, serve an additional purpose. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 4, and 6</figref>, apertures <b>440</b> <i>a </i>is located on side wall <b>432</b> and a corresponding aperture <b>440</b> <i>b </i>is located on side wall <b>434</b>, each aperture near the back wall <b>430</b>. These apertures <b>440</b> <i>a</i>, <b>440</b> <i>b </i>can stabilize the game ball when the game ball is seated against the back wall and the head <b>414</b> is tilted from side to side. The apertures <b>440</b> <i>a </i>are round and define an axis running there between that passes through the center of the ball when the ball is seated in the ‘cradle’ defined by the back wall, which back wall matches the curvature of the game ball. The apertures <b>440</b> <i>a</i>, <b>440</b> <i>b </i>effectively widen the channel at the back wall, such that when the game ball is in the ‘cradle’, the ball can roll from side to side extending into aperture <b>440</b> <i>a </i>when the device is tilted toward the side wall <b>432</b> and can roll into the aperture <b>440</b> <i>b </i>when the device is tilted toward the side wall <b>434</b>. This aspect of the invention yields results that are surprising. It was expected that a tight channel just slightly larger than the diameter of the game ball would minimize lateral movement of the ball in the channel. However, it was discovered that in use, the ball would tend to ‘rattle’ in the channel when seated at the back wall. Although the apertures <b>440</b> <i>a</i>, <b>440</b> <i>b </i>widen the channel along the axis between the apertures, these apertures themselves tend to cradle the game ball and inhibit movement of the ball when the head is tilted to the left or right. In one embodiment using a golf ball as a game ball, the aperture is approximately 25 millimeters in diameter. It can, however, be smaller or larger, such as between 2 mm and 35 mm, or between 5 mm and 30 mm. It will be understood that the ideal size apertures <b>440</b> <i>a</i>, <b>440</b> <i>b </i>will depend at least on the size of the game ball.</div>

The channel in cross-section is somewhat irregular. As a result, when the head is tilted to one side at an angle of, for example, 45 degrees, the game ball is in contact with two points of the channel, one along the interior surface of the bottom wall and one along the interior surface of a side wall. This has worked well in practice, although a channel with a more regular radius can result in the game ball only contacting a single point in the channel, also contemplated to be within the scope of the invention.</div>

As indicated previously herein, the course could be a dedicated course or an existing golf course. Furthermore, the game stick and game ball <b>48</b> are configured to be complementary to each other. For the purposes of this description only, play will be described with reference to play on an existing golf course with a standard golf ball being used as game ball <b>48</b>. Since golf courses are well known, the layout of the course and of holes on the course will not be further described or illustrated herein. Suffice to say that the starting location for the new game will be the equivalent of a tee-off location on a golf course, the target location will be the equivalent of a green on a golf course which includes a cup into which the golf ball is to be sunk; and a fairway separates the target location from the starting location.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0090]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0086" num="0090">The new game is similar in nature to golf in that the player starts play at the starting location at a first hole of the golf course. The player will complete the first hole and then play a second hole and so on until they have played a particular, set number of holes on the course—such as nine holes or eighteen holes, for example. (It will be understood that any other desired number of holes may constitute play of this new game.). Instead of the player standing at a tee-off location at any respective hole, placing ball <b>48</b> on a tee and then striking the game ball <b>48</b> with the head of a golf club to cause the ball to move down the fairway toward the target location, the player stands at the tee-off location and places game ball <b>48</b> into channel <b>438</b> of game stick <b>410</b>. The player may swing or otherwise move the head of game stick <b>410</b> backwardly in a first direction. The stick may be swung or moved in any manner, including, but not limited to, that similar to a swing of a golf club, lacrosse game stick, jai-alai game stick, hockey game stick, or even a tennis racquet. In other words, the player may move stick <b>410</b> to a position for an overhand throw, an underhand throw, or a throw similar to a backhand, a forehand, a slice, or a volley, in motions similar to strokes played in tennis. In any of these motions game stick <b>410</b> is typically initially swung in a first direction and then subsequently swung in a second direction. Typically, if the player <b>52</b> is standing at the tee-off starting location and is facing the target location, the first movement will place the head of game stick <b>410</b> behind the player's back and the second swing will move the head of game stick <b>410</b> to a position generally in front of the player.</div>

The player will then use stick <b>410</b> to throw the ball in a direction represented by arrow “B” (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-8C</figref>). If the stick has been swung rearwardly prior to making the throw, then the rearward motion will have been more or less in an opposite direction to arrow “B”. As game stick <b>410</b> is swung forwardly, ball <b>48</b> moves, by way of centrifugal force, along channel <b>438</b> from a first position proximate first end <b>438</b> <i>a </i>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) of channel <b>438</b> toward a second end <b>438</b> <i>b </i>thereof and passing through positions in channel <b>438</b> intermediate first and second ends <b>438</b> <i>a</i>, <b>438</b> <i>b </i>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B, 8C</figref>). Second end <b>438</b> <i>b </i>of channel <b>438</b> is not obstructed by any walls or fasteners extending between first and second sides <b>432</b>, <b>434</b>. Thus, when ball <b>48</b> reaches second end <b>438</b> <i>b </i>of channel <b>438</b>, it exits head <b>14</b> through an opening defined by front edges <b>432</b> <i>c</i>, <b>436</b> <i>c</i>, <b>434</b> <i>c</i>. Because game stick <b>410</b> is being swung in the direction of arrow “B”, motion in the direction of arrow “B” is imparted to ball <b>48</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>). Ball <b>48</b> thus travels down the golf course fairway for a distance. The distance may be substantial, for instance, a couple of hundred yards.</div>

When starting play on a hole—the player may take several steps to throw the ball but they cannot release the ball if their feet cross the line between the tee blocks (i.e., the tee-line) at the starting location. In the case where the tee blocks do not permit at least a fifteen foot area for the player to take several steps, a mark will be placed fifteen feet from the back of the tee box. This will become the new tee-line which the player's feet cannot cross when they make their first throw for the hole.</li> <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0098">2. Where rules apply to the lie of the ball—in the new sport the ball is marked and picked up to be placed in the channel of the head. The player is permitted to walk back along the line that the ball was thrown (i.e., toward the starting location on the hole) up to five paces, i.e., five steps. The play can then take a number of steps (five or less) back toward the mark but not beyond the mark (i.e., toward the green), and throw the ball. The steps taken back toward the mark can be walked or run.</li> <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0099">3. Where the ball comes to a stop in a sand trap on the golf course—in the new sport this can be an automatic one stroke penalty. The player may then remove the ball from the sand trap, step back five paces from the edge of the trap along the line that the ball entered the trap and in the direction of the starting location, and then throw the ball using game stick <b>410</b>.

The player is able to remove the ball from the water hazard (or select a new ball), step back five paces from the edge of the water hazard and along the line that the ball entered the same, (in the direction of the starting location) and then throw the ball from the club. The player may move toward the water hazard while throwing the ball but must throw before the edge of the hazard.</li> <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0101">5. Where the ball comes to a stop out of bounds this is an automatic one stroke penalty. The player may mark the location up to five paces laterally (i.e., in a direction that is generally across the width of the fairway) from where the ball entered the out of bounds area, and then step back five paces from that mark (in the direction of the starting location), and then move forward toward the mark in order to throw the ball. The player cannot throw at a point past the mark in the direction of the green.</li> <li id="ul0004-0006" num="0102">6. When throwing the ball—the player must remain on a line between any mark that has been placed and the five paces back toward the starting location. The player can throw in any desired direction but must themselves travel along the line that was paced. In other words, the player cannot approach the mark from a different angle than the angle they initially moved away from the mark.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>

In this embodiment the shaft <b>312</b> and head <b>314</b> are an integral single unit that is injection molded or comprises components parts that are fixedly secured together by heat welding for example. Head <b>314</b> includes side walls <b>330</b>, <b>332</b> which define a channel <b>346</b> between them. The channel <b>346</b> has a substantially continuous bottom wall <b>345</b> and a hooked region (not shown) at the end proximate shaft <b>312</b>. An opening <b>354</b> to channel is defined in a front end <b>314</b> <i>a </i>of head <b>314</b>. Head <b>314</b> may be configured with a flattened bottom region so that game stick <b>310</b> may be utilized as a putter. In accordance with another aspect, game stick <b>310</b> may further define a depression <b>349</b> in an exterior surface of one or both sides <b>330</b>, <b>332</b>. Depression <b>349</b> may be of any suitable configuration to receive game ball <b>48</b> therein. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, depression <b>349</b> is generally elliptical in shape. It may, alternatively, have a raised lip which surrounds the depression or the depression may be formed in a raised region on the side wall of head <b>14</b>. In use the player will rotate game stick <b>310</b> in such a way that side wall <b>330</b> is facing upwardly away from the ground upon which the player stands and will set game ball <b>48</b> in depression <b>349</b>. In order to throw ball <b>48</b> using game stick <b>310</b>, the player will rapidly swing game stick <b>310</b>, rotating the same as he or she does so in such a way that side wall <b>330</b> is caused to face the direction in which ball <b>48</b> is to be thrown. This combination swinging/rotating motion will cause ball <b>48</b> to be thrown from game stick <b>310</b>. This depression <b>349</b> and maneuver may be utilized when the distance the ball <b>48</b> needs to travel is relatively short, perhaps in the order of 10 to 20 yards. Depression <b>349</b> may also optionally be provided with an aperture therein which is in communication with channel <b>346</b> as the aperture will more securely anchor ball <b>48</b> in depression <b>349</b> prior to the throwing action. It will be understood that game stick <b>310</b> is used to play the new game in the manner described with reference to game stick <b>410</b>. However, the player may additionally turn the shaft so side wall <b>330</b> faces upwardly. The player will then position ball <b>48</b> in depression <b>349</b> in side wall <b>330</b> and will gently swing game stick <b>310</b> in a first direction to ready game stick <b>310</b> for the throw. The player will then swing game stick <b>310</b> in a second direction in a more vigorous fashion in order to throw the ball a shorter distance than if ball <b>48</b> was located in channel <b>346</b>.</div>
