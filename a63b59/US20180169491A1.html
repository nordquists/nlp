<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">Baseball and softball are very popular sports in the United States, Japan, Cuba, and elsewhere. Many ball bats contain a prescribed amount of “casting” or dead weight to influence the balance point and the weight of the bat. The deadweight is typically added to one of two locations: the knob or the endcap of the bat.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention provides a ball bat that offers a greater degree of freedom for the location of the “casting” or deadweight, facilitating customization of a bat to the preferences of individual users. The present invention utilizes an inner tube that extends within the barrel portion of the bat in which contains at least one weight. Use of the inner tube may provide at least two advantages. First, the inner tube allows the weight to be provided at locations other than just the knob or endcap. As a result, the inner tube allows the weight to be located at the location along the barrel portion such that during a swing, weight may be focused behind the ball at impact, driving more the available energy into the ball. Second, the inner tube supports the weight within the barrel portion without touching the barrel walls, maintaining and/or improving the performance of the barrel portion and facilitating energy transfer to the ball.</div>

Alternatively, the handle portion <b>24</b> can be formed of other materials such as an aluminum alloy, a titanium alloy, steel, other alloys, a thermoplastic material, a thermoset material, wood or combinations thereof. As used herein, the terms “composite material” or “fiber composite material” refer to a plurality of fibers impregnated (or permeated throughout) with a resin. In one preferred embodiment, the fibers can be systematically aligned through the use of one or more creels, and drawn through a die with a resin to produce a pultrusion, as discussed further below. In an alternative preferred embodiment, the fibers can be co-axially aligned in sheets or layers, braided or weaved in sheets or layers, and/or chopped and randomly dispersed in one or more layers. The composite material may be formed of a single layer or multiple layers comprising a matrix of fibers impregnated with resin. In particularly preferred embodiments, the number layers can range from 3 to 8. In other implementations, more than 8 layers can be used. In yet other implementations, the layers may be thinner, wherein the number of layers ranges from 20 to 30 layers, nominally 25 layers. In multiple layer constructions, the fibers can be aligned in different directions (or angles) with respect to the longitudinal axis <b>32</b> including 0 degrees, 90 degrees and angular positions between 0 to 90 degrees, and/or in braids or weaves from layer to layer. For composite materials formed in a pultrusion process, the angles can range from 0 to 90 degrees. In some implementations, the layers may be separated at least partially by one or more scrims or veils. When used, the scrim or veil will generally separate two adjacent layers and inhibit resin flow between layers during curing. Scrims or veils can also be used to reduce shear stress between layers of the composite material. The scrim or veils can be formed of glass, nylon, thermoplastic, rubber, rubberized materials, and combinations thereof. In one particular embodiment, the scrim or veil can be used to enable sliding or independent movement between layers of the composite material. The fibers are formed of a high tensile strength material such as graphite. Alternatively, the fibers can be formed of other materials such as, for example, glass, carbon, boron, basalt, carrot, aramid, Spectra®, poly-para-phenylene-2,6-benzobisoxazole (PBO), hemp and combinations thereof. In one set of preferred embodiments, the resin is preferably a thermosetting resin such as epoxy or polyester resins.</div>

In one implementation, barrel portion <b>26</b> is formed from aluminum. In another implementation, barrel portion <b>26</b> may be formed from a fiber composite material. For example purposes only, one example composite barrel portion <b>26</b> may be manufactured by rolling multiple layers of parallelogram-shaped pieces of pre-preg, each layer having a height of about 0.005 inches (0.127 mm), onto a mandrel, thereby making a tube with an outer diameter appropriately sized for a ball bat barrel portion. In other implementations, barrel portion <b>26</b> can be formed of other materials, such as, for example, aluminum, other alloys, wood, and combinations thereof. The parallelograms can be rolled up such that each layer has a butt joint with itself and such that on one end all the layers stop at the same longitudinal station but on the other end, each layer can be about one centimeter shorter than the previous layer, creating a tapered end <b>16</b>. In other implementations, the layers of pre-preg can be laid up such that a portion of one of the layers overlaps a portion of another layer. In one implementation, the layers are angled +/−37 degrees from the longitudinal with each layer orientated at a negative angle to the previous layer. In other implementations, other lay-ups of composite materials with other angles and combinations of angles can be used.
