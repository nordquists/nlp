<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">Pickleball is a fast-growing sport, with roots in badminton, tennis and table tennis. Pickleball is played in a pickleball court, where a perforated ball is hit over a net using paddles, similar to table tennis paddles. Originally, pickleball was played with table tennis or ping-pong paddles, but as the sport evolved the paddle size and materials also evolved, such that pickleball paddles are now unique to the sport. The paddles may be formed using wood or composite materials.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0018]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a pickleball paddle handle grip according to a first embodiment of the invention is shown generally at <b>10</b>. The pickleball paddle <b>9</b> is a substantially flat planar member with a handle portion <b>8</b>, as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>. It is commonly known that the paddle <b>9</b> is co-formed with the handle portion <b>8</b> such that they are one piece. The grip <b>10</b> is secured over the handle portion <b>8</b> to form a gripping surface <b>20</b>.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0019]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 4</figref>, the grip <b>10</b> is formed using two sleeve portions <b>12</b>, which fit together to form the gripping surface <b>20</b>. The sleeve portions <b>12</b> each extend between first and second ends, <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>, respectively, and between first and second sides, <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>, respectively, with a widened, tapered end cap portion <b>18</b> proximate to the first end <b>14</b>. The end cap portion <b>18</b> is formed in any shape, as is commonly known, and allows for a firm hold on the gripping surface <b>20</b> while reducing slippage within the user's hand. The gripping surface <b>20</b> may be formed in any desirable shape, such as, by way of non-limiting example, oval, hexagonal, rectangular, or ridged surface, although other surface shapes may be used, as well.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0020]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0021" num="0020">Each sleeve portion <b>12</b> has a mating surface <b>22</b> which joins together with the mating surface <b>22</b> on a second sleeve portion <b>12</b> to form a unitary handle grip. Upright walls along the first and second sides <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> and along the first end <b>14</b> form a central cavity <b>28</b> with an inside surface <b>30</b>. The inside surface <b>30</b> may be a solid continuous surface, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, or it may be a ribbed or textured surface, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. When two sleeve portions <b>12</b> are joined together along the mating surface <b>22</b>, the central cavities <b>28</b> cooperate to surround the handle portion <b>8</b>, with the inside surface <b>30</b> engaging upon the handle portion <b>8</b>.</div>

As illustrated, each sleeve portion <b>12</b> may be formed in the same manner with both pins <b>40</b> and bores <b>42</b> on the mating surfaces <b>22</b> such that they line up on either side of the handle portion <b>8</b>. It will be appreciated that two different sleeve portions <b>12</b> may be formed, with one sleeve portion <b>12</b> including the pins <b>40</b>, while the other sleeve portion includes the bores <b>42</b>.
