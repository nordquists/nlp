<heading id="h-0002">1. Field of the Invention</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0001]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a bat structure for hitting baseballs which has a high structural strength and a shock-proof effect.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">Baseball game, a ubiquitous sport, is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each. No matter what an official race or a friendly match is, it often brings contestants or spectators lots of enjoyment. In general, baseball equipment belongs to a professional sport equipment. The conventional bat structures can be roughly divided into two kinds of wood rods and metal rods, in which the wood rods are solid rods and the metal rods are hollow rods.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">In terms of wood bat structure, it is directly made of a solid piece of wood with a gripping portion, an extension portion and a hitting portion, which conforms to standard specifications. The sound generated by a solid wood bat due to colliding with a baseball is low and short. However, the solid wood bat usually having much weight than others may hinder the speed of swinging the solid bat by a batter. Moreover, the hardness and stiffness of the solid wood bat make it hard to absorb vibration for buffering. Namely, when the solid wood bat collides with a baseball, it is prone to break or cause hand numbness to a batter due to the violent vibration. Therefore, some hollow bats are developed for solving the abovementioned problems.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">For instance, a Taiwan patent No. M526424 U, issued on 1 Aug. 2016, has disclosed a bat structure. It comprises a main body having a gripping portion, an extension portion, a hitting portion in sequence, and a hollow chamber extended from the hitting portion to the extension portion in the main body. The hollow chamber further comprises an inner chamber having a diameter less than that of the hollow chamber, an opening at a terminal of the hitting portion, and a block having a perforation along an axis thereof for correspondingly engaging with the opening. However, the rigidity of the hitting portion of the hollow bat structure is reduced so that the hollow bat structure is prone to crack or break due to serious deformations of the hitting portion.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">A Taiwan patent No. M520395 U, issued on 21 Apr. 2016, has also disclosed a bat structure. It comprises at least one damping device therein. The damping device comprises a low elastomer disposed on the inner annular wall of a hitting portion of the bat structure, and the low elastomer comprises an accommodation space and a high elastomer accommodated in the accommodation space. An outside surface of the high elastomer contacts to an inner surface of the accommodation space of the low elastomer. However, it is difficult to assembly the damping device to the hollow bat structure which has different materials from each other, and the bonding site with heterogeneous material is easily damaged, displaced or dropped by the hitting force.</div>
