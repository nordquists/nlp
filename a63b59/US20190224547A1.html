</li> <li> <para-num num="[0029]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0030" num="0029">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2, 3A and 3B</figref> and according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, the stick-handling training system <b>001</b> is shown. The hockey stick-handling system <b>001</b> includes a plurality of cross members <b>100</b> and height adjustable bases <b>500</b>. In operation, the height adjustable bases <b>500</b> are vertically adjustable and elevate the cross members <b>100</b> from the ground at optimum heights that can vary based on the object used for stick-handling (such as a hockey puck or ball) to pass underneath them. The height adjustable bases <b>500</b> also have multiple insertion points (cavities) <b>521</b> for cross members connectors <b>110</b> that allows a modular approach where more than one cross member <b>100</b> may be connected to a height adjustable base <b>500</b> and the cross members <b>100</b> can rotate about the cavities <b>521</b>. The connection interface between the two parts is such that it easily enables the assembly to be lengthened or shortened as needed and collapses for easy transportation. The cross member <b>100</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is characterised by its elongated body that has, at both ends, cross member connectors <b>110</b> pointing downwards that effectively act as the pivot and connection point with the height adjustable base <b>500</b>. These connectors <b>110</b> are further characterised by two distinctive features, the first one being the addition of a resistive member <b>111</b>, which may be made of a soft-type material, that slightly extends past the side surface of the cylinder <b>110</b> up to a point where it creates a small resistance against unwanted rotational movement when inserted in the height adjustable base cavity <b>521</b>. A worker skilled in the art would appreciate that a user may want some rotational movement of the cross members relative to the height adjustable bases; however, effortless and frictionless pivoting is not desired. The said feature is particularly useful where it allows for the user to effortlessly place the cross-member <b>100</b> at a desired angle in relation to the height adjustable base <b>500</b> but also provide for a locking force strong enough to keep the connectors <b>110</b> in place, was the object used for stick-handling training to come in contact with one of the members of the system <b>001</b>. The second feature on the said connector <b>110</b> is the semi-circular shaped groove <b>115</b> around its axis that works in conjunction with a locking feature (that will be further detailed) intended to keep the cross-member <b>100</b> and height adjustable base <b>500</b> together in such a way that it prevents disassembly caused by a vertical motion. For example, if the system <b>001</b> is picked up by the user grabbing the cross-members <b>100</b> only, this locking feature will prevent the height adjustable bases <b>500</b> from falling down or being otherwise detached from the system <b>001</b>.</div>

The height adjustable base <b>500</b> can be raised up to increase clearance between the training ground and the cross-member <b>100</b>, thus allowing a user to train with a wide variety of objects; whether it be low-laying (e.g. a hockey puck) or requiring additional clearance (e.g. ball). The height adjustable base <b>500</b> also features more than two cavities <b>521</b> where the cross-members <b>100</b> can be docked, allowing for a modular approach and enabling users to develop more intricate training patterns than when using a traditional chain-type product. The exploded view shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> specifically displays the individual components making up the height adjustable base <b>500</b>: the outer shell <b>510</b>, the inner core <b>520</b>, the base feet <b>530</b> and ice spikes <b>540</b>.</div>

Those cavities <b>521</b> are each featuring a tab <b>522</b> that includes a protrusion <b>523</b> which, when a cross-member <b>100</b> is inserted, sits within the locking groove <b>115</b> of the cross-member connector <b>110</b>, effectively preventing both the cross-member <b>100</b> and the height adjustable bases <b>500</b> to be separated when a force is applied along the axis of the cylindrical cavity <b>521</b> while still allowing for rotational movement about the said axis. The shape of the protrusion <b>523</b> corresponds to the cylindrical cavity wall <b>525</b>, and slits <b>524</b> positioned on each side of the tabs <b>522</b> grant independent movement of the tab <b>522</b> from the cylindrical wall <b>525</b>. The tab <b>522</b> also extends beyond a bottom surface of the cavity <b>526</b> so that the user can release the cross-member <b>100</b> from the height adjustable bases <b>500</b> by pushing the tab <b>522</b> away from the center of the cavity <b>521</b>. The inner core <b>520</b> also features at least two buttons <b>527</b>, located on opposite sides of the inner core <b>520</b>, that extend slightly beyond the vertical sides <b>528</b> of the inner core <b>520</b>. The buttons <b>527</b> are used to lock the inner core <b>520</b> in position in relation to the outer shell <b>510</b> in either the raised position (as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>) or the lowered position (as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>). When in the raised position, the button <b>527</b> of the inner core <b>520</b> sits atop of an upper edge <b>511</b> of the outer shell <b>510</b>. In the lowered position, the openings <b>512</b>, which are positioned on either side of the outer shell <b>510</b> and have a corresponding shape to that of the buttons <b>527</b>, are pivotable about an axis and biased outwardly to allow for the buttons <b>527</b> to spring back in the rest position, keeping the inner core <b>520</b> in place in relation to the outer shell <b>510</b>.</div>
