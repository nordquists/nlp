<li> <para-num num="[0001]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present patent application claims the benefits of priority of commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application No. 62/436,839, entitled “Kit for extending the shaft of a hockey stick” and filed at the USPTO on Dec. 20, 2016. This is also a continuation-in-part of International Application PCT/CA2017/051546, with an international filing date of Dec. 20, 2017.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0002">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to sport gear, and in particular to a kit for adjusting the length of a hockey stick. More particularly, the present invention relates to kit for extending the shaft of a hockey stick for kids when the kids are growing up.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">An adequate length for a hockey stick consists in having the end of the shaft of the hockey stick facing around the nose of the user when the stick is vertical on the floor. When a kid playing hockey is growing up, the length of its hockey stick needs to be regularly adapted. Conventionally, the stick is replaced by a new longer stick, which can be costly. Another method consists in adjusting the length of a hockey stick by replacing the shaft with a new shaft that has a longer length. This method is not always convenient in that the longer of the shaft is not adjustable in view of the kid's size.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Furthermore, other methods for adjusting the length of a hockey stick require some adjustments and modifications to be done on the shaft of the hockey stick to render it adapted to receive extension components. Thus, such a method makes the shaft of a hockey stick confronted to many risks of deterioration and damage during machining operations.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">Some devices are known for extending the length of a golf stick. For instance, the device disclosed in the U.S. Pat. No. 8,814,718, uses complex extension components to prevent the undesirable sudden detachment of the extension system from the shaft of a golf stick. These components are considered complex since they also comprise extending structural elements in order to prevent the inter-module rotation. Generally, the machining of such components is demanding and costly.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">Finally, the devices for extending the length of a golf stick disclosed in the US patent application no 2011/0159982, do not allow having an optimal length of the stick since the extension components have all the same length.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">There is a continuous need for extension systems for hockey sticks.</div>
