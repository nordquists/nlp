<li> <para-num num="[0001]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to bats and more particularly, to a bat which is reduced in weight and improved in batting effect.</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0003">2. Description of the Related Art</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">In general, bats are primarily categorized into wooden bats and aluminum bats. As to the wooden bat, because the wooden bat has relatively higher weight, it is strenuous for the general batter to swing the wooden bat. Besides, the speed of swinging the wooden bat is relatively lower, so the ball is usually batted with insufficient power. As to the aluminum bat, it is lighter than the wooden bat in weight, and has higher coefficient of rebound than the wooden bat, thereby capable of batting the ball relatively farther through the great elasticity. But the aluminum bat has a disadvantage of relatively lower rigidity strength, so a hollow is liable to occur at the region of the aluminum bat where the ball is hit. For solving the aforesaid problem of the traditional bats, the bat made of composite material is developed in the recent years. But at present the composite bat is hard to strike a balance between being reduced in weight and being improved in batting effect, thereby not widely used.</div>

The handle portion and the connecting portion are both made of fiber composite material. The connecting portion has a small radius end and a large radius end. The small radius end of the connecting portion is connected with the handle portion integrally. The large radius end of the connecting portion has a first slope section. The hitting portion has a fiber composite material layer and a metal layer. The fiber composite material layer has an end wall and a peripheral wall. An end of the peripheral wall is connected with the end wall integrally. Another end of the peripheral wall has a second slope section. Two ends of the metal layer have a third slope section and a fourth slope section respectively. The third slope section of the metal layer is connected with the first slope section of the large radius end of the connecting portion. The fourth slope section of the metal layer is connected with the second slope section of the peripheral wall of the fiber composite material layer. As a result, the hitting portion of the bat of the present invention has the arrangement using two different materials, that enables the bat of the present invention to be effectively improved in the batting effect thereof under the condition of being reduced in weight, thereby attaining the objective of the present invention.</div>
