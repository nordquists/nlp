<div class="abstract" id="p-0001" num="0000">An adjustment device for use in adjusting walls of athletic equipment includes an adjustment member, a base bracket secured to one end of the adjustment member and a secondary bracket secured around an opposed end of the adjustment member. Both the base bracket and the secondary bracket includes a receiving portion that has a projection radially extending from the brackets. The receiving portion of each bracket is configured to receive and lock opposing walls of the athletic equipment such that pressure from the base bracket and the secondary bracket is applied to and plastically deforms inner surfaces of the walls of the athletic equipment.</div>

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Modern lacrosse sticks, also known as crosses, include a plastic molded head which is attached to a metal shaft. Some components of the head include a neck, nylon or leather strings to form a pocket, and sidewalls in which the strings are attached. Lacrosse league rules have established dimensional requirements for crosses and are governed by organizations such as the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) for collegiate players or the Federation of International Lacrosse (FIL) for international players. For example, in men's lacrosse, the NCAA requires the distance between the sidewalls of the head to be at least 3 inches at the narrowest point and at least 6 inches at the widest point. In women's lacrosse, the NCAA requires the distance between the sidewalls of the head to be at least 3 inches at the narrowest point and at least 7 inches at the widest point.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the distance between the sidewalls may narrow, such as for example during face-off from pushing the lacrosse stick against the ground. The pressure compresses the lacrosse head and may cause the dimensions to be non-compliant with the league rules. Random inspections are performed to ensure compliance with the dimensional requirements and a player may be disqualified if those requirements are not met. Therefore, it is important to keep the head at the proper width in order to avoid disqualification.</div>
