<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div html="" itemprop="content"><abstract lang="EN" load-source="docdb" mxw-id="PA414489970" source="national office">
<div class="abstract">A robotic manipulator is used to control the forces and angles applied on the strings during stringing of a lacrosse head. Precise string lengths may be implemented for certain features of the pocket. In some embodiments, the manipulator attaches the pocket to a lacrosse head and produces a strung head which has precise ratios of tension when comparing various strings within the pocket. One or more robot arms with end effectors such as grippers may be used. The forces used when tying each knot can be consistent throughout the pocket, or vary according to which particular knot is being tied. The tension of shooting strings and/or runners may be finely tuned in some embodiments.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0013]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0014" num="0013">It should be understood that aspects of the invention are described herein with reference to certain illustrative embodiments and the figures. The illustrative embodiments described herein are not necessarily intended to show all aspects of the invention, but rather are used to describe a few illustrative embodiments. Thus, aspects of the invention are not intended to be construed narrowly in view of the illustrative embodiments. In addition, it should be understood that aspects of the invention may be used alone or in any suitable combination with other aspects of the invention.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0014]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0015" num="0014">Lacrosse players become accustomed to the shape and feel of their lacrosse head pocket, and replacing the pocket can change the shape and feel because a new pocket is not as broken-in as the pocket being replaced. Additionally, the new pocket may not be strung in the same manner as the old pocket, further altering the feel of the pocket. In an attempt to maintain as much consistency as possible, the player may have the same person string the new pocket, though restricting the stringing to a single person may cause scheduling difficulties.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0015]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0016" num="0015">Even if the same person strings the new pocket and uses the same materials as the old pocket, there can be variation in the results because many aspects factor into the final pocket configuration. For example, the distances between knots, the force applied when tying each knot, and/or the tension in the strings connecting the pocket to the head may play a role in the final pocket configuration. Additionally, explaining particular desires to a stringer with the necessary level of precision can be difficult, and a stringer may have difficulty remembering how a pocket was previously strung for a given person.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0016]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0017" num="0016">When manufacturing a new pocket and/or attaching a pocket to a lacrosse head, consistency from pocket-to-pocket can be important. For example, if a particular line of lacrosse heads has three different models, each with a different level of pocket tension, controlling the amount of tension in each of the models to within certain tight tolerances may be important. Additionally, controlling tension and/or string lengths within a single pocket may be important for producing a strung lacrosse head that is tuned in a desired manner. For example, it may be desirable to produce a head/pocket combination that is symmetric about a longitudinal axis of the head. Or, for some lacrosse heads, an asymmetry in the tension of certain areas of the pocket may be desired, and the desired tensions are achievable to within certain limits by using a robotic manipulator.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0017]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0018" num="0017">According to the present disclosure, by using a robotic manipulator, such as robotic arms, the forces and angles applied on the strings during stringing of a lacrosse head may be controlled, and precise string lengths may be implemented for certain features of the pocket. In some embodiments, the manipulator attaches the pocket to a lacrosse head and produces a strung head which has precise ratios of tension when comparing various strings within the pocket. The forces used when tying each knot can be consistent throughout the pocket, or vary according to which particular knot is being tied. The tension of shooting strings and/or runners may be finely tuned in some embodiments.</div>

The first gripper pulls the string all the way through the sidewall opening until a knotted end abuts an exterior of the sidewall. The first gripper then passes the string end through an opening in a lacrosse pocket (such as a mesh pocket) and then around a bottom side of the sidewall, and pushes the first string end through a second sidewall opening from the outside to the inside. At this point, the second gripper grips the string portion that is abutting the bottom of the sidewall and pulls the string portion away from the sidewall to form the space between the string of the sidewall.
