<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">Baseball and softball bats (hereafter “bats”) are currently made from aluminum alloys, composite materials, or some combination thereof. The bats are tubular (hollow inside) and have a relatively narrow handle and a larger barrel which is the striking surface. Current bat technology suffers from a number of disadvantages. One disadvantage is the excessive wear and tear that results from normal use, leading to cracking, chipping, and the like. When bats become too worn, they can be deemed illegal in sanctioned play. Another disadvantage of prior art bats is excessive vibration. In normal use, the batter may feel a buzzing in the arms at contact. This is known colloquially as “bees in the bat” and is an unpleasant feeling, and affects performance as well.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">One prior art attempt to improve durability is to develop flexible shells of the bat by redesigning the composition of the bat. Another attempt is to use more durable clear coatings in an attempt to prevent damage to the actual material of the bat while the clear coat is in place. The durable composition material may be at odds with bat performance, resulting in a compromise between durability and performance. In addition, the bats still develop cracks, seam splits, and chips. Such damage may render the bat illegal for use in sanctioned play.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Attempts to cure the vibration of the bat have included the use of dampening materials such as sorbothane, silicone, rubber, cork and other vibration dampening materials. These solutions have yet to sufficiently reduce vibration of the bat upon impact with the ball.</div>

<heading id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0012]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0013" num="0012">The system adds a shrink wrap material to a bat to improve appearance, performance, and durability. The bat may be designed to maximize performance, without the need to balance performance and durability. The durability is proved by the application of a shrink wrap material to the bat. In addition to providing durability, the shrink wrap material also provides appearance advantages.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0013]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0014" num="0013">In the prior art, paint is often applied to a bat for appearance purposes. This may be to identify the type of bat, the manufacturer, and/or the team or player using the bat. This is a multistep process comprising prepping, painting, curing, and decal application. This adds to the complexity of bat manufacture, and introduces another possible point of failure that can render a bat unusable during the production process.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0014]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0015" num="0014">Currently bats can only be painted and cured at certain (high) temperatures and conditions. The process requires many steps to prepare the bat for painting, to paint the bat and/or apply decals, and to cure the paint/decals. One problem with current techniques is that it is difficult to know for certain if the paint or decals have cured properly.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0015]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0016" num="0015">Even after production, paint adhesion remains a problem during normal use of the bat. The logos are marred over time and become unreadable, and the materials used are still subject to cracking and chipping.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0016]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0017" num="0016">The current system uses a shrink wrap material as an end step in the bat manufacturing process. In one embodiment, color, logos, and/or graphic images may be pre-printed on the shrink wrap material. Such printing is well understood and is resistant to damage, fading, cracking, tearing, and other problems associated with current approaches. The use of the shrink wrap material allow for protection and decoration to be accomplished in a single step. There are no issues with curing, and the performance of the bat is not impacted by the need for prepping for painting or other processes.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0017]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0018" num="0017">Unwanted vibration has also been an ongoing problem for batters. Vibrations are a transfer of energy in an inefficient manner that detracts from bat performance. In addition, the vibration may cause stinging in the hands of the batter, which will impact the batter's performance during play. The batter may be hesitant to swing as hard on subsequent pitches because of the fear of additional stinging. The present system solves that problem with the application of shrink wrap material to the bat.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0018]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0019" num="0018">Some bats use Floating Inner Barrel (FIB) technology, such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,005,056 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. This may increase the vibration problem noted above. In one embodiment, the inner barrel insert is encased in a shrink wrap material to insulate it and to prevent the hard surface of the insert from directly contacting the inside of the bat barrel. This has drastically reduced vibration.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0019]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0020" num="0019">An example of an FIB bat is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. This embodiment discloses bat <b>10</b> comprising of frame <b>12</b> that contains a relatively large-diameter hitting portion <b>14</b>, an intermediate tapering portion <b>16</b>, and a relatively small-diameter handle portion <b>18</b>. A knob <b>24</b> closes the opening at handle portion <b>18</b>. Tube <b>38</b> is attached to knob <b>24</b> and extends through handle portion <b>18</b>, tapering portion <b>16</b>, and through insert <b>20</b>. Foam <b>32</b> is a high-density foam that has a diameter greater than the diameter of insert <b>20</b>, is longer than insert <b>20</b>, and along its axis contains channel <b>34</b>. Foam <b>32</b> is compressed and then inserted into insert <b>20</b>. Tube <b>38</b> is then passed through channel <b>34</b>. Cap <b>26</b> closes the opening at hitting portion <b>14</b>. Tube <b>38</b> positions insert <b>20</b> so that it will not come into contact with frame <b>12</b> when the bat is at rest; allowing insert <b>20</b> to freely move within the hitting portion <b>14</b> to both absorb energy by elastic deformation and to dampen vibrations by compressing against the wall of hitting portion <b>14</b> on the side opposite to the point of impact.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0020]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0021" num="0020">The insert may be of any suitable shape such as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 9,005,056 and in pending application Ser. No. 16/733,232 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. In addition, the insert may be single wall or double wall.</div>

FIB insert <b>100</b> comprises an inner barrel <b>101</b> with foam sections <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> used to float the inner barrel <b>101</b> within the barrel of a bat. The entire assembly is covered with a shrink wrap material <b>104</b> as shown in the upper portion of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The shrink wrap coating provides a dampening effect on vibrations as well as providing durability to the FIB assembly. The shrink wrap is applied by heating the shrink wrap material, causing it to contract and form tightly to the insert.</div>

The bat may be of any type, including metal or wood. Referring first to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the shrink wrap material <b>201</b>, such as polyolefin in one embodiment, is formed into a tube shape and includes a ring <b>202</b> at one end. The shrink wrap material may have a logo and/or other graphics formed therein already as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The bat <b>801</b> has a shrink wrap material <b>802</b> applied to the barrel and the material <b>802</b> has a pre-printed logo <b>803</b> applied thereon. The shrink wrap material itself may be of any desired color or colors. In one embodiment, the shrink wrap may be applied first and then a decal may be applied to the shrink wrap. The decal adheres better to the shrink wrap material than to the bat barrel.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0023]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0024" num="0023">The shrink wrap material is applied to bat <b>203</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and heated, causing the material to seal to that bat and to itself, eliminating the seam.

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0024]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0025" num="0024">In some cases, a batter prefers a grip to be added to the bat for more secure handling. In the past this has been accomplished using tape or other adhesive material, or by forming a grip material and stretching it onto the handle of the bat. Such prior art grips wear out, can be loose, and do not perform as intended. In an embodiment of the system, a bat <b>400</b> having a handle <b>401</b> is prepared (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) by applying a series of rings <b>402</b> to the handle <b>401</b>. The rings may be affixed via adhesive or simply by elastic pressure. The rings will be held in place by action of the shrink wrap material when the material is added to the handle.</div>
