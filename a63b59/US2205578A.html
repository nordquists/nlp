<div class="description-paragraph">William V. Schnur, Glencoe, `1.11.', assignor to P. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">. Becker &amp; Company, Chicago, Ill., a corporation of Illinois Application February 7, 1940, Serial No. 317,675 </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">2 Claims. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> This invention is directed to new and useful improvements in bat and is particularly directed to the type of bat or racket generally used in playing the game known as table tennis. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The usual type of such bat is provided with a solid handle and flat striking surface. In playing the game of table tennis the action is extremely fast due to the resiliency of the Celluloid balls used and the relative small size of the table on which played. The speed of the game requires that the handles of the bats or paddles be constructed in such a manner that a sure grip may easily be had thereon to prevent the bats slipping from the grasp. Furthermore the speed of the game causes the players to perspire easily and frequently the hand perspiration is such that the handle of the bat becomes wet and slippery so that a good grip cannot be had. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> This invention is directed to the construction of a bat handle to overcome these diiiiculties by Ventilating the handle. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The primary object of this invention is to provide a bat having a handle formed with air apertures therein to aid in the evaporation of hand perspiration and to keep the hand of the player cool and dry. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Another object of this invention is to provide such a bat that will afford an improved grip. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Still another object is to provide such a bat of simple and inexpensive construction. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Other advantages and improvements provided by this invention will become apparent by an examination of the following detailed description. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the drawing: </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Fig. l is a side elevation View of a bat embodying the present invention. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Fig. 2 is an enlarged end view of the handle of the-bat shown in Fig. 1. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Fig. 3 is an enlarged cross-section view taken along line 3--3 of Fig. 1. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Fig. 4 is an enlarged vertical section view taken along line 4-4 of Fig. 1. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Fig. 5 is a side elevation view of the lower part of a bat embodying an alternate form of the invention. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Fig. 6 is a side elevation view of the handle portion shown in Fig. 5 taken in the direction of arrow 6 in Fig. 5; and </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Fig. '7 is a cross-section view taken along line 'I-'I of Fig. 6. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In detail the bat is constructed of laminated wood that forms the body of the striking portion I and the central portion of the handle as at 2. Each surface of the striking portion is covered with a pebbled rubber sheet 3 to provide non-slip surfaces for striking the ball. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Wooden strips 4 curved on their outer surfaces 5, and beveled at their inner ends 6 and of substantially the same length and width of the handle portion! are positioned on each side of portion 2 and are secured in that position by means of adhesive and rivet members 1. The inner surfaces of these strips 4 are grooved to provide channels B extending lengthwise of the strips from the outer ends to a point short of the inner ends as shown at Il and a plurality of apertures Ill extend from the outer curved surfaces 5 through the strips to open into grooves Il. Thus are formed two channels 8 opening through the outer end of the handle 2 and connecting with the apertures I0. In this manner air is admitted through the end of the bat handle and out the apertures IB to evaporate perspiration on the hand of the player and keep his hand cool and dry. Furthermore the apertures I0 afford an improved gripping surface on the handle. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The other embodiment shown in Figs. 5, 6 and 7 of the drawing utilizes a bat of the same basic construction as above described.` All except the handle construction is as above described and like characters are thus used. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> However in this form of therv invention the handle strips Il are of different construction.A The inner surface of these strips II is provided with a plurality of grooves I2 extending from one side to the other. When these strips are secured to each side of the handle portion 2 of the bat these grooves I2 provide a plurality of apertures I3 extending completely through the kbat in a direction parallel to the striking `surface of the bat. To aiord a better grip on the handle and freer air circulation the handle 2 is grooved as at I4 to connect the pairs of apertures. Likewise those portions of the handle strips Il adjacent the outer ends of the grooves I2'are slightly channeled as at I5. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The specific arrangement of the apertures in the handle of the bat is immaterial to this invention and they may be of any form such as slots or squares. This invention is `directed to a bat construction in which air is directed to the hand of the player through the handle of the bat and the speciic forms herein 'shown and described are merely illustrative. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> It is obvious that the novel and improved handle construction described herein may be utilized in forming handles for other striking de-' vices with the same advantages herein set forth. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Such a handle is adaptable for rackets of any type such as tennis, squash, badminton, and will even prove desirable in golf clubs or any device of such type in which a sure, cool, dry grip is needed. It is with this understanding that the following claims are drawn and the Word bat as used therein is to be interpreted in the broad sense to include such articles. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">I claim: </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 1. A hat handle comprising a solid central portion, air conduits positioned at opposite sides of said central portion and opening through the outer end of the handle and extending length- Wise thereof but short of the inner end of the handle, the outer portion of said handle being provided with a plurality of apertures extending from the outer surface of said handle to said air conduits. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 2. A bat comprising a body portion forming the base for the striking surfaces and the central part of the handle, handle strips each grooved on its inner surface from one end to a point short of the other and provided with a plurality of apertures connecting the outer surface with said grooved portion and means securing said strips to said handle portion whereby said grooved portions form air channels through the outer end of the bat handle so that air may be directed through the end of said bat to the gripping surface of the handle. </div>
