<div class="description-paragraph">W. E. DILL THROWING TOY April 6, 1965 Filed Aug. 2, 1962 INVENTOR. MAL/AM DIAL BYi i A razA/evs United States Patent 3,176,673 TIHZOWING TOY William E. Dill, 4625 Sycamore Ave., Sacramento, Calif. Filed Aug. 2, 1962, Ser. No. 214,373 3 Claims. (Cl. 1245) This invention relates to a throwing toy, and has as its primary object the provision of a hoop or ring, and a throwing stick to be utilized therewith, the arrangement being such that rotation of the ring or hoop on the shank of the throwing stick i-mpels the same to fly over a disc-like beveled member at the end of the throwing stick, while rotating, and fly through the air. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> An additional object of the invention is the provision of such a device wherein the hoop is imbalanced, by the insertion of a weight at the juncture of two juxtaposed ends thereof, so that eccentricity is imparted to the rotation thereof, rendering the same more diflicult to catch on the throwing stick on its return. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> A further object of the invention is the provision of a hoop and throwing stick therefor which may be employed in the playing of a game by two or more players, each of whom has a throwing stick, and there being only one hoop which may be tossed alternately between two or more players. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Still another object of the invention is the provision of a game embodying a hoop and one or more throwing sticks which provides a game of relatively high entertainment value, and which requires a certain amount of skill in the use thereof, the eccentric behavior of the thrown hoop or ring adding difficulty and entertainment to the game played therewith, and which may be enjoyed by one or more players. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Still other objects reside in the combinations of elements, arrangements of parts, and features of construction, all as will be more fully pointed out hereinafter, and shown in the accompanying drawing wherein: </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> FIGURE 1 is a composite side elevational view showing the hoop of the instant invention and the throwing stick associated therewith, different positions of rotation, and throwing of the hoop as well as the hand of the player being indicated in dotted lines; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> FIGURE 2 is an enlarged sectional view taken substantially along the line 22 of FIGURE 1 as viewed in the direction indicated by the arrows, the ring being omitted. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> FIGURE 3 is a sectional view taken substantially along the line 3-3 of FIGURE 1 as viewed in the direction indicated by the arrows; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> FIGURE 4 is a side elevational view of the hoop comprising an element of the instant invention; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> FIGURE 5 is an enlarged detail sectional view taken substantially along the line 5-5 of FIGURE 4 as viewed in the direction indicated by the arrows; and </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> FIGURE 6 is a fragmentary view, partially in elevation and partially in section, showing a constructional detail. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Similar reference characters refer to similar parts throughout the several views of the drawing. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Having reference now to the drawing in detail, there is generally indicated at 10 a throwing stick, which comprises one component of the instant invention, and which includes a dowel or shank 11 which is circular in cross section and which may be of any desired length, but which for practical purposes is approximately inches in length. One end 12 of the dowel 11 seats in a central ice bore 13 in a handle member 14, which is also circular in cross-section, and affords a convenient grip for the hand H of the player. The dowel or shank 11 may be fitted in the bore 13 and secured thereto by adhesive, or in any other desired manner. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The other end of the dowel or shank 11 is provided with a circular disc 15, the dowel extending into and being secured in a central bore 16, and being held in position as by means of glue, adhesive, or other desired securing means. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The inner edge of disc 15 is beveled as at 17, in a direction toward the shank or dowel 11, the angle of the bevel being approximately 45, for a purpose to be more fully described hereinafter. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The other element of the invention comprises a hoop or ring generally indicated at 24), which is comprised of a circular tubular member 21, the ends of which are juxtaposed as at 22 to provide a perfectly circular lightweight ring or hoop. Connection between the juxtaposed ends is provided by a dowel or connector 23 which is of the same radius of curvature as circular hoop 2t), and which is adhesively secured in the opposite juxtaposed ends of the ring or hoop. Dowel 23 which, in conventional hoops, is constructed of the lightest possible material in order to avoid imbalance in the ring, is, in this instance purposely constructed of a heavier material, such as wood, or metal, to impart an imbalance to the ring, and hence provide eccentricity in the rotation thereof. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In the use and operation of the device the handle 14 is firmly grasped in the hand and the hoop 23 positioned as in FIGURE 1 over the shank or dowel 1 1. The shank is then vigorously rotated, which imparts rotation to the ring 20 in the direction indicated by the arrows, or reversely, if desired, and the rotation of the ring or hoop 29 causes the same by centrifugal action to approach the disc 15, and ride up the bevel 17 thereof until it is ultimately freed and thrown upwardly as indicated in FIG- URE 1, the height of the throw being governed by the speed of rota-tion at the time of release. On the return of the ring or hoop, an object of the game is to catch the same on the throwing stick 10, the disc 15 being of a diameter less than that of the ring 20, obviously, to permit such catching, but at the same time being of sufficient size as to require a certain amount of skill in the recovery thereof. The size of the disc 15 and the hoop 29, is immaterial to the instant invention, although in actual practice a hoop of about 18 inches in diameter has been found to be easily handled. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The game may be played by one individual, or more than one individual, each of whom is equipped with a throwing stick 10, and one or more hoops or rings may be employed as desired. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> From the foregoing it will now be seen that there is herein provided an improved toy, which accomplishes all the objects of this invention, and others, including many advantages of practical utility and high entertainment value. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> As many embodiments may be made of this inventive concept, and as many modifications may be made in the embodiment hereinbefore shown and described, it is to be understood that all matter herein is to be interpreted merely as illustrative, and not in a limiting sense. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">I claim: </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 1. In combination, a throwing stick and a circular hoop, said throwing stick comprising an elongated shank, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">an outstanding disc secured to one end of said shank, said disc having a bevel at its inner side toward said shank whereby rotation of said hoop about said shank causes said hoop to ride over said bevel and be thrown, said hoop comprising a circular member having a smooth continuous inner surface in contact with said throwing stick, and a member carried by said hoop at one point of the same, said member being sufiicient in weight to impart a marked eccentricity to the throwing of said hoop. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 2. The combination of claim 1 wherein said bevel defines an angle of approximately 45 degrees. </div>
