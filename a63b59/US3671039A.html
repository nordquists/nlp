<div class="description-paragraph">saw 2 or 2 I N VENTOR. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">AT'TO RNEYS BAT AND SPHERE GAME PIECES This invention relates to stick and sphere games and, more particularly, to a game wherein a stick or bat is used to strike a sphere having capturing means which, if the sphere is struck properly, will capture a length of the bat and thereby be held to the bat. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Stick and sphere games are, in general, very well known. Foremost among these is the game of baseball. In addition to baseball, many other games utilizing a stick or bat and a sphere or ball are played around the world including cricket, croquet, polo, field hockey, etc. Yet, the present invention incorporates a new principle never before used in previously known stick and sphere games. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Accordingly, it is an object and feature of this invention to provide a new stick and sphere game in which the sphere will capture and hold the stick or bat when struck properly. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Another object and feature of this invention is to provide a new and different sphere construction which is sturdy, strong and resilient, yet flexible. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A still further object and feature of this invention is to provide a stick and sphere game which may be played by one or more persons. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Other objects and attendant advantages of the instant invention will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings wherein: </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> FIG. 1 is a picture of a preferred embodiment of the present invention as it is used in a game; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> FIG. 2 is a horizontal front elevation of both the stick and the sphere; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 3 is a cross-section of the sphere takenalong line-33 of FIG. 2; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> FIG. 4 is a side elevation of the sphere taken along line.44 of FIG. 3, but without the bat; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 5 is a cross-section taken along line 55 of FIG. 4; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 6is a back elevation of the sphere; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 7 is a cross-section of the bat striking the sphere; and </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> FIG. 8 is an end view, partly in cross-section, of the .bat striking the sphere. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In reference to the drawings then, and more particularly to FIG. 1, the invention includes a sphere 20 and striking means, which comprises an elongated stick or bat 10 which may be used by a batter to strike or hit at the sphere 20. The sphere may be thrown toward the batter by anotherperson or tossed up by the batter with one hand while grasping the bat with the other. Thus, the game may be played by one or more-persons. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> As shown in FIG. 2, the elongatedbat or striking means 10 has at least one striking portion therealong and adjacent one end and an enlarged means atone end which prevents sphere 20 from sliding off the end of bat 10. More particularly, bat 10 has a constantdiameter shaft 12 with enlarged means taking the shape of hemispherical. knobs 14 attached at each end thereof. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The sphere 20 has capturing means which define at least one opening in the sphere for receiving and retaining the bat 10. More particularly, the preferred. embodiment of the sphere 20 has four openings, quadrants or sectors 22, 24, 26 and 28 in which a striking portion of shaft 12 may be captured. Each opening or sector 22, 24, 26 or 28 has tabs 30 extending toward one another from opposite sides of the opening. The preferred embodiment of the sphere has tabs 30 disposed along the greatest circumference orthe equator of the sphere. The tabs 30 are flexible and define entrances 32 to openings 22, 24, 26 and 28 such that if the sphere is struck properly with the bat 10, as will be describedbelow, the shaft 12 will be captured in one of the four openings 22, 24, 26 or 28. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The preferred embodiment of sphere 20, as shown in the drawings, comprises several components which together define the openings 22 through 28. As is best seen in FIGS. 3 </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">and 4, sphere 20 comprises two hoops 34 and 36 joined at diametrically opposite points 38 and 40 such that the planes in which said hoops lie are perpendicular to each other. As seen in FIG. 5, the hoops are T-shaped in cross section, having ribs 35 which provide dimensional stability. Tabs 30 extend laterally from said hoops on the greatest circumference or equator of the sphere, the plane of which is generally perpendicular to the planes of hoops 34 and 36. Tabs 30 are actually 5 joined to the hoops along hoop edges 37, also seen best in FIG. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">5. A connection means such as a rod 42 extends through the interior of sphere 20 to interconnect the hoops. In the preferred embodiment rod 42 is disposed along the axis of the sphere between points 38 and. 40 thereby adding structural rigidity to the completed sphere. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The width of entrances 32 formed by tabs 30 is slightly less than the diameter of the shaft 12 of bat 10. As mentioned above, tabs 30 are flexible, and as shown in FIG. 7, the entire hoop-tab combination will rotate if the tab is struck sufficiently close to the hoop. If the bat 10 hits the entrance 32 squarely, tabs 30 will be forced to flex, as shown in FIG. 8, if the bat is to pass through and be captured. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Each tab 30 is marked with different indicia. In the The value of a hit or score thus depends on the indicia marked on the capturing tabs. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The sphere 20 is made of plastic or rubber such that it is durable and resilient yet flexible enough to allow the tabs to bend repeatedly and return to their normal positions. The bat 10 may be made of wood, plastic, metal or rubber such that it is hard enough to flex the tabs of the sphere and strong enough to withstand repeated blows against thesphere. The shaft 12 need not necessarily be solid since a sufficiently strong, hollow tube will perform just as well. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> To play the game, the bat and sphere are used in the following manner. The bat 10 is held by the batter at either end. The sphere 20 is then either pitched toward the batter by another player or tossed in the air by the batter himself. The batter then swings at the sphere 20 while it is in the air. If struck properly, as defined below, the shaft 12 of the bat I0'will flex tabs 30and.force its way through entrance 32 into one of the four openings or sectors 22, 24, 26 or 28. As the batter follows through after the shaft has been captured, the hemispherical knobs 14 on either end of the shaft will keep the sphere from sliding off the bat. If not properly struck, the sphere will be knocked away. Only if the batter succeeds in having the bat 10 be captured by the sphere 20 will a score or hit," equal to the value of the indicia on the tabs 30 enclosing the bat, be made. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> A proper strike at the sphere 20 is one which causes the shaft 12 of bat 10 to strike one of the entrances 32 approximately parallel to and aligned with a line connecting the points 38 and 40 at which the hoops 34 and 36 are joined. In the preferred embodiment this line coincides with rod 42. Some leeway is allowed here since tabs '30 are flexible enough to compensate for small variations in the striking position of the shaft 12. However, any great variation in alignment with rod 42 will not allow the shaft to pass through entrance 32, and sphere 20 will rebound away. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Thus, it is clear that the bat 10 and sphere 20 may be used to simulate the actual game of baseball. A certain number of swings, say 10 or 12, may be designated as a players time at bat in any one inning, and depending on the number of hits made, three or more persons may bat in an inning. A single ciency improves, he may wish to determine the number of hits, </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">or extra base hits, he can obtain in succession. These examples of competitive uses for the game areintended to be representative only and not exhaustive of the many varied and imaginative games that can be played with this invention. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The invention has been described in an illustrative manner and it is to be understood that the terminology which has been used is intended to be in the nature of words of description rather than of limitation. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Obviously, many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. it is, therefore, to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described. </div>
