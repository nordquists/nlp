<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">1. Field of Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This invention relates to the structure of the blade of a hockey stick.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">2. Description of the Previous Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The basic form of a hockey stick with rigid blade construction is well known and appears to have been relatively unchanged.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is known that longitudinally curved blades are provided for handling a puck to overcome the tendency of the puck to slide off of the end of the blade. Such a structure of the blade makes it necessary to have separate hockey sticks for righthand and lefthand use, but even with such blade curvature there does not appear to be a desired degree of control of the puck.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is the purpose of the invention herein to provide a hockey blade construction suitable for both righthanded and lefthanded use and which will provide improved control of the puck.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">More specifically, it is the purpose and object of the invention herein to provide a blade structure for a hockey stick which will provide for such frictional engagement with a hockey puck as to permit sufficient control of the puck in aiming it to achieve the intended line of travel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is an object of the invention herein to provide a blade structure for a hockey stick which has a resilient body portion for either a righthand or lefthand operation and is such as to overcome the tendency of the puck to slide along the length of the blade and over the end of the blade in being moved along the ice and particularly to prevent the sliding movement of the puck along the blade as the puck is in the process of being aimed and shot.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is another object of the invention herein to provide a blade structure for a hockey stick which embodies a resilient insert which yields sufficiently with engagement of a hockey puck to hold the puck in a given longitudinal position of the blade for accurate aim and drive of the puck.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">More specifically, it is an object of the invention herein to provide a hockey blade structure comprising a planar member having an open bottom recess having a replaceable insert portion thereof, said insert portion being sufficiently resilient to yield upon engagement with a puck to flex and retain the puck for its positive control and for an accurate aim in shooting the puck to achieve the intended line of travel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">These and other objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the following description made in connection with the accompanying drawings in which like reference characters refer to similar parts throughout the several views.</div>

<heading>DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring to FIGS. 1-3, a hockey stick 10 is shown which embodies the invention herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Said hockey stick comprises a handle 12 and a blade 14, said handle blade having an integral construction in a conventional manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The structure of the blade 14 represents the novelty of the invention. Said blade has an open bottom cut out or recessed portion 16 as indicated, said recess having a top wall 17 and end walls 18 and 19 having lower stepped portions 20 and 21.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Said stepped portions are shown having upward vertically extending bores 23 and 24 with respective companion bores 25 and 26 extending inwardly vertically of said top wall and forming pairs with said bores 23 and 24.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">An insert member 30 is disposed within said recess 16. Said insert member is suitably made of a tough yielding material which will yield sufficiently upon engagement with a hockey puck to flex somewhat and just sufficiently to overcome the tendency of the puck to slide off of the end of the blade and to be retained sufficiently for a positive control of the puck in moving it on ice and for accurate aiming and shooting purposes. Rubber or a rubber composition of a suitable durometer and suitable plastic materials may be used to form said insert member.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the embodiment here described, said insert member is indicated as being formed of an endless strip of material having looped end portions 32 and 34 and having a height or width substantially that of the side walls 18 and 19 whereby its bottom will be above the plane of the bottom of said blade 14.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Removably holding said insert members in operating position are the U-shaped staple-like fasteners or retaining members 36 and 38. A leg of each fastener will be inserted within the loop and said fasteners are respectively disposed into and frictionally held within said pairs of bores 23-25 and 26-24.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In operation, the insert member 30 will be understood to flex or yield as indicated in FIG. 4 upon engagement with the puck P. Thus a sufficient pocket or recess is formed to overcome the tendency of the puck to slide off of the end of the blade in being moved on the ice in the play of the game and said pocket permits the operator to have sufficient control of the puck from its fairly contained position to have a good deal of accuracy in shooting it and to achieve an accurate line of drive in keeping with his aim in directing the puck.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Considerable accuracy is required on straight-in or head-on shots as well as with angle shots to direct the puck through a generally very small opening of the cage entrance which is not covered by the goal tender.</div>
<heading>MODIFICATION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring to FIGS. 6 and 7, a modification of the above described structure is shown in which the blade portion 42 of the hockey stick 40 has a lower open bottom recessed portion 44 having a depending leg portion 46 forming its outer end portion. An inner leg portion 48 is formed spaced somewhat from the inner end portion 50 of said recess 44.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Adapted to be positioned about said leg portions 46 and 48 is the blade insert 30 above described having its ends looped about said leg portions as shown. Said insert is shown having a width less than the length of said leg portions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Said leg portions 48 and the blade portion 42 have bores as at 52 and 54 to removably receive a staple-like retaining pin 56 to secure an end of said insert 30.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A horizontal pair of spaced bores 58 and 59 are formed inwardly of the outer end of said leg portion 46 with the base 59 being shown angled upwardly and said bores have a staple-like retaining pin 62 removably disposed therein.</div>
<heading>MODIFICATION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">A second modification is shown in FIGS. 8 through 10 in which a hockey stick 65 has a blade portion 66 having a lower open bottom recessed portion 68 therein having a leg portion 70 defining one end thereof and having a leg portion 72 spaced inwardly of the inner end wall 74 of said recess. Said leg portion 70 has small vertically spaced projections 76 and 78 outwardly end-wise thereof and the leg portion 72 has a like lower projection 80.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The member 30 is disposed over said leg portions 70 and 72 and retained by said projections.</div>
<heading>MODIFICATIONS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">A third modification is shown in FIGS. 11-13 in which the hockey stick 85 is shown having a blade portion 86 with said blade portion having depending leg portions 88 and 90 defining an open bottom recess 92 therebetween.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Said leg portions are shown having lower opposed end-wise projections 93 and 94.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Disposed over said leg portions 88 and 90 is the above described insert member 30.</div>
<heading>MODIFICATION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">A fourth modification is shown in FIGS. 14-18 in which a hockey stick 95 is shown having a blade member 96 having a throat portion 97 longitudinally slotted at 98 to receive therein the lower portion of a handle 99.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The blade portion 96 has a lower open bottom cut out recess 103 having end walls 104 and 105 which also form leg portions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Said leg portions are shown having open ended slots 107 and 108 at their facing or opposed edges. An insert member 106 which differs from the member 30 in form only in having a solid body portion 109 with end portions 110 and 111 being substantially cylindrical projections to respectively be disposed into the open ended slots 107 and 108. The insert portion 109 is well shown in the composite view of FIG. 18 and is shown in operating position in FIG. 15.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the above description of the insert members 30 and 106, they are shown as extending for substantially the full length of their respective blade portions. It is to be understood that within the scope of this member the length of the insert member is a matter of choice and it may extend over only one half or one third of the blade length, as may be desired.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The hockey stick as can be readily seen, has equal utility for left hand or right hand use. The insert member has just sufficient resilience to flex or yield when engaging a puck to give the operator more effective control over the handling of the puck than is deemed possible with prior art hockey sticks and such control that the operator may aim and shoot to achieve a desired line of drive or travel of the puck.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The insert members 30 and 106 in providing improved control of the puck provide substantial advantage to an operator in permitting him to have a better and more successful application of his skills in addressing the puck.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It will of course be understood that various changes may be made in form, details, arrangement and proportions of the parts without departing from the scope of the invention herein which, generally stated, consists in an apparatus capable of carrying out the objects above set forth, in the parts and combinations of parts disclosed and defined in the appended claims.</div>
