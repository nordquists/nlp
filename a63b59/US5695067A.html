<heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 1 shows a perspective view of the bag in the opened position.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 2 shows a partial sectional view of the bag.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 3 shows a perspective view of an alternate embodiment of the device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 4 shows a perspective view of the bag in the closed position.</div>
<heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring now to the drawings, there is shown in FIG. 1 a view of the present invention I comprising two regions 2A/2B of a continuous piece of fabric material. The upper portion of the device 2B has on it provisions for securing baseball and softball bats 3,4, including a VELCRO hook and loop fastener 3 and a cup shaped pocket 4. The two portions of the device 2A, 2B can be brought together by folding along a width wise recess 7 and joined at a handle portions 8A, 8B. The two part handle portions 8A, 8B can be secured together by a latch 23. The bat bag can be further secured in the closed position by using a metal fastener 13, such as a zipper, to join the tracks of metal teeth 14A and 14B. As with a standard metal fastener system, the rows of metal teeth 14A and 14B are interlocked by the fastener 13. As the metal teeth 14A, 14B are sowed into the main fabric portions 2A, 2B, fastening them together brings the two portions 2A, 2B together, as shown in FIG. 4, thereby closing the bag.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The continuous fabric portion of the bag 2A/2B can be composed of canvas or woven nylon fabrics, however other materials can be used without departing from the scope of the invention. The bag may be made using stitching 12 used to sew an inner fabric layer 9 to an outer fabric layer 10, with a padding layer 11 in between the two, as shown in FIG. 2. The inner 9 and outer fabric layers 10 do not have to be of the same type of fabric material, but each should be strong enough to resist tearing or puncture. The outer layer 10 should also be easily cleaned.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The padding layer 11 could be made of any material that is sufficiently loosely packed to allow easy compression, as are many foam paddings. By using these materials, namely fabrics and foams, the bag is created to be extremely lightweight.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In use, the bag is left in the opened position, as shown in FIG. 1, and bats 5 are stored in the bag, so that the barrel of the bat rests in the pocket/cup 4, and the handle is secured using VELCRO hook and loop fasteners 3. A plurality of bats may be inserted, in a mutually parallel relationship. For proper insertion, the bat's barrel should be inserted into the pocket/cup 4 first, thus deforming the padding 11 underneath the bat. Then the handle of the bat can be secured using the Velcro hook and loop fasteners 3. Of course other types of fasteners, such as but not limited to elastic straps, can be used without departing from the scope of the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When the bag is in the open position, baseballs and softballs may also be stored in the bag, withinin the recess 7 between the two portions 2A/2B. The recess 7 contains a stiffener 6 of any suitably stiff and sturdy material, such as thick cardboard, which allows for a plurality of indentations 22 in the shape and size of a baseball or softball. In use, balls are placed in the indentations 22 while the bag is in the open position. The fabric material in this region lacks the foam core 11 of the other areas, thereby allowing the balls to fit close to the outer layer of fabric 10, thereby allowing the bag to be closed without disruption or distortion of its shape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As the bag is closed, the latch 23, composed of a continuous fabric piece, is drawn through both handles 8A/8B. The latch 23 is then secured into a position of a closed loop by a snap 24A/24B. In this way, the two handle pieces 8A/8B are secured together, so that the bag may be carried by the handle 8 when closed. The handles may be made of any material which is sufficiently strong to withstand the weight of the bag in its fully loaded condition. One possibility for the handle is injection molded plastic.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Injection molding is a plastic molding procedure whereby heat softened plastic material is forced under very high pressure into a metal cavity mold which is relatively cool. Acceptable metals for the mold are aluminum and steel. The inside cavity of the mold is comprised of two or more halves, and is the same desired shape as the product to be formed. High pressure hydraulics are used to keep the mold components together during the actual injection phase of the molding process. The injected plastic is allowed to cool and harden. The hydraulics holding the multiple component cavity together are released, the halves of the mold are separated and the solid formed plastic item is removed. Injection molding can be a highly automated process and is capable of producing extremely detailed parts at a very cost effective price. The latch may be of any durable fabric, and the snap should be a metal alloy which is suitably durable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Alternatively, in the closed position, the bag can be carried by a shoulder strap 15. The strap 15 is composed of a length of fabric, joined to two eyelets or rings 16A,16B. This attachment is accomplished by feeding the strap 15 through the eyelet or rings 16A,16B, and then stitching the ends over the rings. In this way, the strap 15 is stitched into a loop containing the eyelet 16A/16B. By thus attaching the strap to both eyelets, it is securely affixed to the bag. As with the fabric for the bag's casing, the strap may be of nearly any material, so long as it is strong and durable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The materials involved in the bag's construction are not required to be of any particular composition or shape. Instead, it should be understood that the materials will be chosen only on their ability to meet the aforementioned criteria. The bag's construction also requires the use of numerous stitching processes. A few of these methods and techniques are commonplace and easily understood by all. Easestitching is a technique used to join a longer fabric edge to a slightly shorter one. This technique is similar to the type used for gathering, but there should be no folds or gathers visible on the outside of the bag once the seam is stitched. Edgestitching is a technique forming an extra row of regulation-length stitches appearing on the outside of a bag. It is placed approximately 1/8" (3 mm) or less away from a seam-line or a fold-line, or close to a finished edge. This type of stitch is similar to a topstitch but is less noticeable because it is closer to the edge and is always performed in matching thread.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Reinforcement stitching is a technique for strengthening the stitching areas that will be closely trimmed, such as corners or along deep curves that will be clipped or notched at frequent intervals. The basic premise is that a shorter stitch length is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Staystitching is a line of regulation stitching preventing curved or bias edges, such as necklines, shoulders and waistlines, from stretching out of shape as they are handled. Staystitching requires a regulation length stitch of one half inch from the cut edge of the fabric.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Stitch-in-the-ditch is a technique which allows a quick way to hold layers of fabric in place at the seams. It is an effective way to secure neckline, armhole, or waistband facing as well as fold up cuffs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Topstitching is a technique forming an extra row of stitching on the outside of the bag along or near a finished edge. Although topstitching is usually added as decoration, it can also be functional. Understitching is a technique forming a row of stitching which prevents an inside layer of fabric, usually a facing, from rolling to the outside of the bad.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Understitching is performed after the seam allowances are trimmed, graded and clipped or notched. Seams are the backbone of a finished manufactured product. A seam is basically a line of stitching that joins two or more layers of fabric. Seams are stitched on the seam line. The seam allowance is the distance between the seam line and the cut edge. There are several types of seams. The double-stitch seam is a combination seam and edge finish that creates a narrow seam especially good for sheer fabrics and knits. This seam prevents the fabric from raveling and is stitched twice. A plain seam consists of right sides together, stitched along the seam line, which is usually 5/8" from the cut edge, with a regulation length stitch. Stretch knits need seams that are supple enough to give with the fabric. These fabrics may be manufactured with straight stitches, zig zag stitches or one of the stretch stitches which are found in many factories.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Flat-felled seams are frequently used on sportswear, men's wear and reversible bags. These seams are accomplished by bringing wrong sides of the fabric together and stitching a plain seam, pressing the seam allowances to one side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The French seam adds a contour look to the inside of bags made from sheers and lightweight silks. The finished seam which is very narrow, completely encloses the raw edges of the seam allowances.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Lapped seams are frequently used on non-woven fabrics, such as synthetic suede and leather, as well as real suede and leather, because their edges do not fray.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Topstitched seams accent seam lines. They also help keep the seam allowances flat--a great benefit when working with crease resistant fabrics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As an alternate embodiment, the bag can store bats on both sides of the case, thereby storing a greater number of bats. As shown in FIG. 3, the device's alternate embodiment has the same continuous fabric design, again folded in the center 7'. A stiffener 6' is inserted with holes 22' for balls to be stored. However, in this embodiment, the protective pockets 4' for the barrel and the VELCRO hook and loop fastener straps 3' for the handle of a bat to be stored are located on both the upper 2B' and lower 2A' pieces of the bag. The handle mechanism 8A'/8B', strap 15' and handle lock 23' are the same as in the original embodiment, as is the closure system employing tracks of metal teeth 14A', 14B' connected by a metal fastener 13'.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The materials for the alternate embodiment have the same requirements as those in the original embodiment. As such, they will be similar and, likely, identical, to those in the original embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Although the bat bag and the means of using the same according the present invention have been described in the foregoing specification with considerable detail, it is to be understood that modifications may be made to the invention which do not exceed the scope of the appended claims, and modified forms of the present invention done by others skilled in the art to which the invention pertains will be considered infringements of the invention when those modified forms fall within the claimed scope of this invention.</div>
