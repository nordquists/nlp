<div class="description-paragraph">TOY. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">SPECIFICATIONformingpart of Letters Patent No. 578,491, dated March 9, 1897. Application filed July 3. 1896. Serial No. 598,028. (No model.) </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">T 0 all whom, it may concern; </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Be it known that I, DANIEL KNoWLEs,a citizen of the United States, residing at Norfolk, in the county of Norfolk and State of Virginia, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Toys; and I do declare the following .to be a full, clear, and exact description of the invention,such as Will enable others skilled in the art to which it appertains to make and use the same, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, and to the letters of reference marked thereon, which form a part of this specification. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Figure 1 is a perspective view of my improvements. Fig. 2 is a side elevation and partial section of the bat. Fig. 3 is a sectional View on the line 0c of Fig. 2, showing the dart in position in the holder on the bat. Fig. 4 is a perspective view of another form of dart. Fig. 5 is a perspective View showing the bat in position for striking the dart. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In the drawings, A designates a bat provided at one end with ahandle A. .As shown, the bat is formed from a single piece of wood or other suitable material and has the body portion thereof widened out to form a relatively large surface. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> B designates the dart, which may be made of any suitable material and of any of several forms. In the drawings Ihave'illustrated it as made substantially conical and as provided with a weight cl at its smaller end. To the dart are secured feathers or guiding-blades O, which serve to direct the flight of the dart when propelled by a blow from the bat. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> On the bat A, Isecure a receptacle or holder B, havingasocket adapted to receive the body portion of the dart D. This receptacle or holder is shown as being attached to the body of the hat by means of screws 79, but may be secured in any other desired and suitable manner. To insure that the dart will be held in position when within this holder, I prefer to provide an annular elastic or yielding ring 0, which is firmly secured to the upper edge preferably projects therein. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In using my improved toy it is intended that the player shall dislodge the dart from its position in the holder B, and after keep- -ing it in motion by striking it with the side of the bat opposite the holder B a number of seat itself in the said holder. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Preferably I provide the dart with a bell E. In the forms shown in Figs. 1 and 3 this bell ring e, which is engaged with a staple d, secured in the bottom of a socket formed in the larger end'of the body of the dart. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In Fig. 4 I have shown a modified form of dart. In this form a rod F is extended out from the larger end of the dart, the bell E being fitted around said rod, and to the outer end of this rod'are secured a series of cords f, the other ends of which are connected to the body of a small parachute G. It will also be seen that two of the devices herein described can be used in the playing of a game of the general character of that known as battledore and shuttlecock. In such case the bats and use is made of one, two, or more darts, the latter being, as will be observed, shuttlecock like in their action; but the game and the devices therefor differ materially from the ordinary battledore and shuttlecock in that it is requisite to catch the dart or shuttlecock in a certain specific manner and at one particular point. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> By having the cup or socket formed with aconical cap and correspondingly shaping the body part of the dart I provide, first, for guiding the dart readily in the socket, and, second, for having it fit comparatively snugly; but the cavity is somewhat larger at the upper part than the body of the dart, so as to avoid the latter being wedged tightly in place. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">What I claim is 1. A toy consisting of a bat, a holder or receptacle secured to one side of said bat, a yielding ring secured about the open end of said holder, and a dart adapted to fit within said holder and be held therein by the said ring, substantially as set forth. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 2. A toy consisting of a bat having on one side a plane face, whereby it is adapted for use in striking, and having on the opposite face a cup or socket, and a dart or projectile adapted to be propelled by a blow from the times (see Fig. 5) shall cause the dart to again is loosely connected to the dart, it having a each of two players is provided with one of In testimony vhereof I affix my signature plane side of the bat and to be seated Within in presence of twowitnesses. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">the said cup, substantially as set forth. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 3. A toy consisting of a bat having a hold er 1 or receptacle with a conical cavity, and a dart, DANIEL KNOWLES conical in form and narrower at its larger end Witnesses: </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">than the Wider part of the cavity in the holder, substantially as set forth. </div>
