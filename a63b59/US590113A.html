<div class="description-paragraph">DEVlCE FOR USE OF BASE-BALL PITCHERS. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">SPECIFICATION forming part of Letters Patent No. 590,113, dated September 14, 1897. Application filed ovember 5, 1896. Serial No, 611,163. (No model-) To crZZ whom it may concern: </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Be it known that I, EDWARD J. PRINDLE, a citizen of the United States, and a resident of Torrington, in the county of Litchfield and State of Connecticut, have invented certain new and useful Improvements in Devices for the Use of Base-Ball Pitchers; and I do declare the following to be a full, clear, and exact description of the invention, such as will enable others skilled in the art to which it appertains to make and use the same, reference being had to the accompanying drawings, and to letters of reference marked there on, which form a part of this specification. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Figure 1 of the drawings is aview showing the application of the invention. Fig. 2 is a perspective view of invention. Fig. 3 is a plan view of same. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> This invention is designed toprovide means which will enable ball-players to pitch what are termed curved balls with greater facility and with a greater deviation or degree of curvature than has heretofore been possi ble. The curve, as it is termed in baseball parlance, is produced by giving the ball a rotary motion around an imaginary axis just as it leaves the hand of thepitcher, which axis may be horizontal or perpendicular or at any angle between the two, but always at right angles to the line of flight. The rapidity of this rotation determines the degree of deviation from a straight line-the more rapid the rotation the greater being the deviation. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This invention consists, broadly, in a de-" vice capable of being attached in any suitable manner to the hand or finger which imparts the rotation and having a surface adapted to positively engage the covering of the ball to the end that when the peculiar movement of the hand or fingers necessary to pitch a curved ball is practiced such engagement will pre-- vent the ball from slipping or turning with relation to the hand until the moment it leaves the hand, whereby, as will be readily understood, its rotation will be greatly accelerated. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In the accompanying drawings I have shown a simple form of a device embodying my invention which I have found to be pracgers of different sizes, the said band has an opening a at the back, the edge portions to thereof being bent or flared outwardly. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Upon theopposite side the surface of the band is provided wit-h an aggregation of small points or projections, such as indicated at b, and which may be conveniently formed by a small punch operated from the inside of the band before it is bent into circular form. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> In use the device is slipped on the first or finger-nail joint of the middle finger with the projecting points on the inside. On grasping the ball for a curve these points are pressed firmly into the leather of the cover. throw is then made in the usual manner. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> The device should fit the finger tightly, being adjusted until a properly snug fit is obtained. After a little practice it will be found that a player can pitch a ball with the same accuracy as Without the device and with a much greater degree of curve. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> Having thus described my invention, what I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">- 1. A device for the use of baseball players in pitching curved balls, said device having The means whereby it may be secured upon the ing of a ball, substantially as specified. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph"> 3. A device for the use of base-ball players in pitching curved balls, said device having means whereby it may be secured-upon a finger of the hand, and having also a surface tion of metallic points or projections adapted 10 to positively engage the covering of the ball, substantially as specified. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">provided with a plurality of sharp points i which are designed to positively engage the covering of a ball, substantially as specified. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">4. A device for the use of ball-players in I In testimony whereof I aflix my signature pitching curved balls, said device comprising i in presence of two witnesses. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">a circular band of material having some elas- -EDWARD J. PRINDLE. </div>
