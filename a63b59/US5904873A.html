<heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">With reference now to the drawings, and in particular, to FIGS. 1 through 6 thereof, the preferred embodiment of the new and improved hockey stick blade removal system embodying the principles and concepts of the present invention and generally designated by the reference number 10 will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Specifically, it will be noted in the various Figures that the device relates to a hockey stick blade removal system for removing and replacing broken hockey stick blades. In its broadest context, the device consists of a housing, a timer controlled heat gun, a coin activated power source and a plug remover. Such components are individually configured and correlated with respect to each other so as to attain the desired objective.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The housing 12 has a top wall 14, a front wall 16, a rear wall 18, a pair of side walls 20 and a downwardly tapering opened lower end 22. The rear wall 16 is secured to wall surface 24. The top wall 14 has vented openings 26 therethrough. The front wall 14 has an opening 28 therethrough. The opening 28 is dimensioned for receiving a hockey blade and associated stick therein for positioning within the housing 12. The opening 28 is defined by a wide upper portion 30, a narrower intermediate portion 32 and a downwardly tapering lower portion 34. One of the side walls 20 has a recess 36 formed therein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The timer controlled heat gun 38 is secured to an interior surface of the front wall 16 of the housing 12 disposed above the opening 28 therethrough with the vented openings 26 being disposed thereabove. Note FIG. 4. The heat gun 38 is used to heat the joints where the shaft of the hockey stick meats the blade thoroughly and evenly. Once the heating has finished, the stick is lowered into the "jaws" or lower portion 34, and the user can pull backward on the stick to release the blade from the shaft whereupon the separated blade will fall outwardly of the housing 12 through the downwardly tapered open lower end 22 of the housing 12.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The coin activated power source 40 is secured to the top wall 14 of the housing 12. The power source 40 has a cord 42 extending within the housing 12 for electrical coupling with the timer controlled heat gun 38. The power source 40 has a power cord 44 extending downwardly for coupling with an electrical outlet (not illustrated). The power source 40 is provided with a coin slot 46, a coin return slot 48 and a removable access door 50 for removal of coins.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The plug remover 52 is positioned within the recess 36 in the side wall 20 of the housing 12. The plug remover 52 comprises a corkscrew 54 pivotally secured within the recess 36. The corkscrew 54 is used in order to remove broken blade ends out of the shaft of the hockey stick.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A second embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIGS. 5 and 6 and includes substantially all of the components of the present invention except that the coin activated power source 40 is replaced by a simple activation power button 56 with a power cord extending directly from the heat gun 38 to be coupled with the electrical outlet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Aluminum hockey sticks were invented for the consumer. The idea is a reusable aluminum or graphite shaft with inexpensive replaceable blades, wooden for ice hockey, plastic for street or roller hockey. The aluminum shaft of the stick is hollow and the wooden blade slides inside. Heat is required to expand the aluminum to allow the blade to be quickly inserted before the shaft contracts. The contracting of the aluminum around the wood holds the blade in place. The blade also has a small amount of glue on the area that is inserted into the shaft to help hold the joint together. This glue becomes malleable when heat is applied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is inconvenient to have to change a blade during a game as heat is required to do so. Directions on the shaft may state that a hair/hand dryer will provide sufficient heat. This is not the case. The only way to remove a blade is with a torch. Owners of aluminum sticks should have a torch in their bag, but may not always be able to find a light as not many hockey players smoke. These torches are used by players of all ages including minor hockey players. The fire potential is a major safety concern in many areas as most hockey equipment is composed of synthetic materials. A torch in a dressing area full of nylon is dangerous. Open flame in any public facility should be avoided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention is a wall-mounted unit that contains a commercial heat source powerful enough to expand the aluminum. The heat source is simply an industrial heat gun or paint stripper. Once the shaft is expanded and the glue has softened, the blade is wedged into the blade jaws wherein a quick pull will eject the blade and a new blade can then be inserted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">On the newer graphite shafts an open flame cannot be used as it will damage the hockey stick. The present invention will not damage hockey sticks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Should a blade break or shear off at the joint making it impossible to wedge into the blade jaws for removal, then the plug remover on the side housing is used. The butt end with the sheared-off blade plug inside is heated as is normally done and then can be twisted onto the plug remover and pulled out.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention can also be used to alter the "curve" of a blade on any stick. This is a popular art among players. Plastic blades soften when heated to allow bending to be possible. A conventional wooden blade is actually veneered with fibre glass so it can be molded and formed when heated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention is convenient and safe. It is less time consuming and requires no tools. It is mounted on a wall behind a players' bench and would allow any player to perform the change between shifts without having to go on a scavenger hunt for a torch, matches, etc. Thus, the present invention is now user friendly. The present invention would prevent aluminum shaft owners from reverting back to conventional sticks due to the inconvenience in changing a blade. The present invention would also be a good advertisement for the stick producer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The use of open flames can now be banned from public facilities, thus lowering the fire and potential burn risk. There is also less risk of vandalism, as torches can be used to deface property resulting in loss of property value. The present invention will reduce the number of requests for torches, matches, screwdrivers, long screws, pliers and the like in order to remove sheared-off blades. Facility owners may remove signs that state the arena no longer provides torches, as the number of requests is overwhelming.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Once the initial purchase of an aluminum or graphite shaft is made, the costs of replacing a blade versus a stick can be as low or lower than 25% of the cost of a stick. The average cost of a stick is about $30 so an aluminum stick can be a great advantage. Another advantage is that one shaft and several compact blades that fit in a player's equipment bag are easier to transport that several bulky sticks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As to the manner of usage and operation of the present invention, the same should be apparent from the above description. Accordingly, no further discussion relating to the manner of usage and operation will be provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and the manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention. Further, since numerous modification and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modification and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention.</div>
