<heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates to a ball bat with tailored flexibility 10 for allowing for improved swing characteristics. In its broadest context, the present invention includes a cylindrical handle zone at a first end of the ball bat. The cylindrical handle zone has a knob disposed on a free end thereof. A generally cylindrical hitting zone is at a second end of the ball bat remote from the first end. An essentially frustoconical transition zone is between the handle zone and the hitting zone. The transition zone includes an inboard portion of a first length and an outboard portion of a second length together forming a flex control zone. The flex control zone modifies normal flex characteristics of the ball bat. The various components of the present invention, and the manner in which they interrelate, will be described in greater detail hereinafter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The ball bat 10, in the preferred embodiment, as illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 3, is fabricated of a hybrid composite/aluminum material. The ball bat 10 includes a cylindrical handle zone 12 at a first end of the ball bat 10. The cylindrical handle zone 12 has a knob 14 disposed on a free end thereof. The cylindrical handle zone 12 has a length of about one-third of an overall length of the ball bat 10. The length of the cylindrical handle zone 12 is long enough to accommodate both hands of a user whereby the user can adjust the positioning of his/her hands along the length of handle zone 12 so as to comfortably manipulate the ball bat 10.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A generally cylindrical hitting zone 16 is at a second end of the ball bat 10 remote from the first end. As illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 3, the hitting zone 16 has a length of about one-third of the overall length of the ball bat 10 and essentially equal to the length of the cylindrical handle zone 12.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">An essentially frustoconical transition zone 18 is between the handle zone 12 and the hitting zone 16. The transition zone 18 has a length of about one-third of the overall length of the ball bat 10. The transition zone 18 includes a frustoconical region 20 and a flex control region 22. The flex control region 22 includes an inboard portion 24 of a first length in a frustoconical configuration. The inboard portion 24 has a lower end integral with and having an essentially equal diameter as an upper end of the cylindrical handle zone 12. The flex control region 22 includes an outboard portion 26 of a second length in a frustoconical configuration. The second length is about five times greater than the first length. An upper end of the inboard portion 24 and a lower end of the outboard portion 26 integrally form an enlarged annular ring 28. The flex control region 22 modifies normal flex characteristics of the ball bat 10. The flex control region 22 has a diameter at a widest portion thereof greater than 2.5 times a diameter of the cylindrical handle zone 12.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 3 illustrates the composite layer 30 as the outer layer and the metal layer 31 as the interior layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 4 illustrates a second embodiment of the present invention that is fabricated of a metal, preferably aluminum, material. The second embodiment is a bat 32 of the same dimensions as that of the preferred embodiment.</div>
