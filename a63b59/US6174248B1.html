<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates to training devices and in particular to a hockey stick training device.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">In many sports such as ice hockey, ball hockey and field hockey, a player is required to control a puck, ball or the like with the blade of a stick. During game play or practice, it is desired that players keep their heads up and control the puck, ball or the like with the stick by feel rather than sight primarily for two reasons. One reason is that many of these sports are contact sports. If a player plays with their head up, the likelihood of an injury resulting from an unforeseen collision is substantially reduced. Also, by keeping their head up, a player is better able to see a developing play allowing the puck, ball or the like to be passed or shot to the most appropriate player or location.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Unfortunately, at many levels, players are not taught to play with their heads up even though a player who learns to do so will play at a higher level and will reduce the chance of injury. To deal with the above-identified problem and to instil in a player's mind that their head should be kept up during game play or practice, hockey training tools have been developed. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,022,466 to Kaiser discloses a hockey helmet attachment to obstruct the downward vision of a hockey helmet wearer. The attachment is in the form of a flat arcuate member formed of flexible opaque material. The arcuate member is attached to the helmet so that it extends forwardly of the helmet in a generally horizontal plane and below the eye opening of the helmet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">U.S. Pat. No. 4,653,753 to Scarry discloses a hockey stick training device to be attached to the shaft of the hockey stick intermediate the handle and the blade to obscure the blade from vision. The hockey stick training device includes a planar rectangular, opaque member to obscure the entire hockey stick blade from vision. A connector to secure the hockey stick training device to the shaft extends upwardly from the rectangular member and is integrally formed therewith.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Although the Scarry patent discloses a hockey stick training device to be attached to the shaft of a hockey stick to teach a player to play hockey with their head up, problems exist. In particular, the configuration and dimensions of the planar rectangular member adversely affect the weight and balance of the hockey stick to which the hockey stick training device is attached. Also, the connector used to attach the hockey stick training device to the hockey stick shaft has been found to be unsatisfactory resulting in movement of the hockey stick training device along the hockey stick shaft during use. Accordingly, an improved hockey stick training device is desired.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a novel hockey stick training device.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a hockey stick training device to be attached to the shaft of a hockey stick adjacent the blade thereof comprising:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">a connector to attach releasably said training device to said shaft;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">a shield extending from said connector to block a player's view of a portion of said blade; and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">a spacer to space said shield above said blade.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a preferred embodiment, the connector and the shield are integrally formed. The connector depends from the shield and includes a lower edge to bear against a portion of the hockey stick and inhibit downward movement of the hockey stick training device along the shaft when the hockey stick device is subjected to centrifugal forces during use thereby to space the shield above the blade and constitute the spacer. The connector and the shield form an acute angle such that in use, the shield angles towards the blade and forms an angle with the horizontal in the range of from about 20 to 30 degrees.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Preferably, the connector includes a connecting flange defining a tube to surround and accommodate a portion of the shaft. A passage is provided in a wall of the connecting flange through which the shaft can pass. It is preferred that the passage widens at its ends. The connecting flange acts as a handle for grasping when the hockey stick training device is being placed on the shaft and removed from the shaft. The connecting flange includes spaced grooves on its sidewalls to provide corrugated surfaces that facilitate gripping. A strap of hook and loop fabric is threaded through a loop on the connector and is windable around the connecting flange and over itself to engage the hook and loop fabric.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a hockey stick training device to be attached to the shaft of a hockey stick adjacent the blade thereof comprising:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">a connector to attach releasably said hockey stick training device to said shaft; and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">a shield extending from said connector over said blade to block a player's view of a portion of said blade, said shield being shaped and dimensioned to obscure at least the heel to about the midpoint of said blade while exposing the tip thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to still yet another aspect of the present invention there is provided a hockey stick training device to be attached to the shaft of a hockey stick adjacent the blade thereof comprising:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">a connector to attach releasably said hockey stick training device to said shaft; and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">a shield extending from said connector over said blade to block a player's view of a portion of said blade, said connector depending from one end of said shield and being integrally formed therewith, said connector including a connecting flange defining a tube to surround and accommodate a portion of said shaft, a wall of said connecting flange having a passage therein, said passage widening at its ends to facilitate opening of said passage as said shaft passes therethrough.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention provides advantages in that the configuration and dimensions of the hockey stick training device are selected to inhibit the weight and balance of the hockey stick from being adversely affected when the hockey stick training device is attached to the shaft of the hockey stick. The configuration and dimensions of the hockey stick training device are also selected to obscure at least the heel to the midpoint of the hockey stick blade while keeping the tip of the hockey stick blade visible to the player holding the hockey stick. By keeping the tip of the hockey stick blade visible, a player is better able to set up to receive a puck while ensuring the puck is obscured by the hockey stick training device when the player handles or shoots the puck.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In addition, the present invention provides advantages in that the hockey stick training device can be easily attached to and removed from the hockey stick shaft. When the hockey stick training device is attached to the hockey stick shaft, it is held securely in place inhibiting the hockey stick training device from moving along the hockey stick shaft during use. Furthermore, the provision of the spacer allows the hockey stick training device to be positioned at basically the same position on virtually all hockey sticks thereby providing consistency during use.</div>

<heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring now to FIGS. 1 to <b>7</b>, a hockey stick training device in accordance with the present invention is shown and is generally indicated to by reference numeral <b>10</b>. The hockey stick training device <b>10</b> is designed to be attached to the shaft S of a hockey stick H adjacent the hockey stick blade B (see FIG. <b>7</b>). The hockey stick training <b>10</b> device is designed to obscure from vision, most of the hockey stick blade to force a player holding the hockey stick H to handle and shoot a puck by feel rather than by sight. In this manner, the hockey stick training device <b>10</b> teaches a player to handle and shoot a puck while keeping their head up during game play. Specifics of the hockey stick training device <b>10</b> will now be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The hockey stick training device <b>10</b> is preferably formed of flexible, opaque plastic material and includes a shield <b>12</b> to overlie a hockey stick blade and obscure most of the hockey stick blade from vision. A connector <b>14</b> depends from one end of the shield <b>12</b> to allow the hockey stick training device to be attached to the shaft of the hockey stick. The shield <b>12</b> and the connector <b>14</b> form an acute angle such that when the hockey stick training device <b>10</b> is properly positioned on the shaft of a hockey stick, the shield forms an angle Î¸ with the horizontal in the range of from about 20 to 30 degrees.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As can be seen in FIGS. 1 to <b>4</b> and <b>6</b>, the shield <b>12</b> is generally delta-shaped in top plan defining a pair of wings <b>12</b> <i>a</i>. The shield <b>12</b> includes a top member <b>16</b> and a peripheral skirt <b>18</b> depending from the top member <b>16</b>. The corners of the shield <b>12</b> are rounded and the peripheral edges of the top member <b>16</b> and skirt <b>18</b> are bevelled so that no sharp edges are exposed. The shield <b>12</b> is dimensioned and shaped to conceal the portion of the hockey stick blade most often used to carry or shoot a puck (i.e. the portion of the blade extending from the heel of the hockey stick to midway along the length of the blade) while keeping the tip of the hockey stick blade visible. Specifically, the wings <b>12</b> <i>a </i>are offset from the midpoint of the shield <b>12</b> so that the shield is wider near the heel of the hockey stick. The wings <b>12</b> <i>a </i>also curve downwardly toward to hockey stick blade. The lengthwise dimension of the shield <b>12</b> in the present embodiment is selected so that approximately one (1) inch of the hockey stick blade remains visible to a player holding the hockey stick.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The connector <b>14</b>, best shown in FIGS. 1 to <b>3</b> and <b>5</b>, includes a connecting flange <b>20</b> integrally formed with the shield <b>12</b> and defining a rectangular tube <b>22</b> to accommodate the shaft of the hockey stick. The connecting flange <b>20</b> functions as a holder as will be described and has spaced grooves <b>20</b> <i>a </i>formed in its sidewalls to provide corrugated surfaces that facilitate grasping. A passage <b>24</b> is formed in the rear wall <b>26</b> of the connecting flange <b>20</b> and extends along its length to provide an opening in the tube <b>22</b>. Opposite ends of the passage <b>24</b> are V-shaped defining widened end portions. A strap holder <b>30</b> is integrally formed on one of the connecting flange sidewalls. The strap holder <b>30</b> is generally U-shaped to define a gap <b>32</b> between its bight and the connecting flange sidewall. A strap <b>40</b> formed of hook and loop type fabric and having a buckle <b>42</b> at one end (see FIG. <b>8</b> <i>b</i>) passes through the gap <b>32</b> and can be wrapped around the connecting flange <b>20</b> and over the strap holder <b>30</b>. The connecting flange <b>20</b> has a lengthwise dimension equal to about 5 inches. This length has been found to be sufficient to space properly the shield <b>12</b> above the hockey stick blade as well as to accommodate the strap holder <b>30</b> and the strap <b>40</b> while keeping the amount of material required to form the hockey stick training device <b>10</b> within an acceptable range. As will be appreciated, extra material increases manufacturing costs as well as increases the weight of the hockey stick training device <b>10</b> which may adversely affect the balance of the hockey stick during use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A pair of spaced triangular ribs <b>44</b> is provided on the undersurface of the shield <b>12</b> to enhance the structural rigidity of the shield <b>12</b>. The ribs <b>44</b> extend from the connecting flange <b>20</b> and terminate intermediate the shield length.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Turning now to FIGS. <b>8</b> <i>a </i>and <b>8</b> <i>b</i>, the manner in which the hockey stick training device <b>10</b> is attached to the shaft of a hockey stick will now be described. To attach the hockey stick training device to the shaft of the hockey stick, the hockey stick H is held upside-down by the player. The hockey stick training device <b>10</b> is then grasped by the connecting flange <b>20</b>, which acts as a holder, so that the hockey stick training device is also upside-down with the shield <b>12</b> bearing against the player's arm. The V-shaped end of the passage <b>24</b> nearest the shield <b>12</b> is then placed over the hockey stick blade B generally at the point where the hockey stick blade curves to join the shaft S. With the hockey stick training device <b>10</b> being pushed towards the hockey stick blade, the hockey stick training device is slid along the hockey stick blade towards the shaft S. By sliding the hockey stick training device around the curved portion of the hockey stick blade, the passage <b>24</b> opens up to accommodate the wider shaft. When the shaft is surrounded by the connecting flange <b>20</b> with the lower edge of the connecting flange at the point where the shaft curves toward the blade, the free end of the strap <b>40</b> is threaded through the buckle <b>42</b>. The strap <b>40</b> is then pulled back and wound around the connecting flange <b>20</b> and the strap holder <b>30</b> before being secured to itself. The hockey stick training device <b>10</b> is then ready for use. If the connecting flange <b>20</b> is loose, tape can be wrapped around the hockey stick shaft about 4 inches above the blade to provide a secure fit between the connecting flange and hockey stick shaft.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">With the hockey stick training device <b>10</b> secured to the hockey stick, a player can learn to control the puck by feel and therefore, learn to play with their head up. Since the tip of the hockey stick blade remains visible, the player is better able to set up to receive a puck even though the puck will be obscured once carried using the hockey stick. Contact between the lower edge of the connecting flange <b>20</b> and the curved portion of the shaft inhibits further downward movement of the hockey stick training device <b>10</b> when the hockey stick training device is subjected to centrifugal forces during use. Thus, the connecting flange <b>20</b> acts as a spacer to position properly the shield <b>12</b> above the hockey stick blade. As a result, the hockey stick training device <b>10</b> is basically positioned at the same place relative to the hockey stick blade regardless of the hockey stick type thereby ensuring consistency during use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">To remove the hockey stick training device, the strap <b>40</b> is unattached from itself and is unwound from the connecting flange <b>20</b>. The free end of the strap <b>40</b> is then removed from the buckle <b>42</b>. After the strap <b>40</b> has been freed, the hockey stick training device <b>10</b> is removed from the hockey stick by reversing the process used to attach the hockey stick training device to the hockey stick described above. Thus, the connecting flange <b>20</b> is grasped with the hockey stick upside-down and the hockey stick training device <b>10</b> is slid down the shaft along the curved portion towards the blade while pulling the hockey stick training device away from the hockey stick. The V-shaped end of the passage <b>24</b> furthest from the shield <b>12</b> opens allowing the hockey stick to pass through the passage removing it from the connecting flange <b>20</b>. As will be appreciated, during placing and removing of the hockey stick training device <b>10</b> on and from the hockey stick, the widened V-shaped end portions of the passage <b>24</b> facilitate opening of the passage as the hockey stick shaft passes through the passage during installation and removal. This of course makes it easier to place the hockey stick training device <b>10</b> on the hockey stick shaft and subsequently remove the hockey stick training device from the hockey stick shaft.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As will be appreciated, the hockey stick training device <b>10</b> can be easily attached to and removed from a hockey stick allowing players of virtually all ages to use the hockey stick training device. Its design does not adversely affect the weight and balance of the hockey stick to which the hockey stick training device is attached and is sufficiently strong to withstand forces applied to it during use. Also, because the connecting flange <b>20</b> spaces the shield <b>12</b> above the hockey stick blade at a desired height, the desired portion of the hockey stick blade is obscured from the player's vision generally regardless of the type of hockey stick to which the hockey stick training device is attached.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It will also be appreciated by those of skill in the art that modifications and variations may be made to the present invention without departing from the spirit and scope thereof as defined by the appended claims.</div>
