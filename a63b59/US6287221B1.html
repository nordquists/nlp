<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The invention is directed to a baseball bat article. More particularly, the invention is related to a baseball bat article having a decorative image thereon.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Professional baseball has been considered America's favorite pastime for decades. Not only do baseball fans enjoy the performance of the professional baseball players but also imbibe in stadium refreshments and consume popcorn, peanuts and hotdogs. Sometimes, fans commemorate their attendance at a baseball game by buying souvenirs. One popular souvenir is a miniature baseball bat.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Miniature souvenir baseball bats have been sold in baseball parks for many years. One manufacturing company, Coopersburg Handle Works, had manufactured miniature souvenir baseball bats and sold them in ballparks during the 1940's and 1950's. Typically, these miniature souvenir baseball bats were sold in professional baseball parks with different variations of team logos or other decorative art, such as animations or cartoons. Usually, these miniature souvenir baseball bats were manufactured using either one color screen printing or foil stamping.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Presently, full-color logo designs are being applied to miniature souvenir baseball bats. Although these designs are greatly enhanced over the traditional one-color or foil-stamped miniature souvenir baseball bats, not many miniature souvenir baseball bats have been sold with a baseball player's image on the bat, until lately.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">One company manufactures a miniature souvenir baseball bat with a baseball player's image formed thereon. The image is transferred onto the bat via a conventional non-contact image transfer (ncit) process. Generally, this process is an ink-jet process that sprays the image onto the bat using colored ink. The image generated by the ncit process reasonably portrays the image of the baseball player. However, the colors tend to lack luster i.e. dull in appearance and the quality of the image is significantly less than a photographic image, particularly in the image sharpness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The invention overcomes these problems.</div>
<heading>OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is an object of the invention to provide a baseball bat having the image transferred thereon with substantially photographic quality colors and photographic quality sharpness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Yet another object of the invention is to provide a baseball bat with an image transferred thereon using a transfer element that is imperceptibly affixed to the baseball bat.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Accordingly, a baseball bat article of the invention is hereinafter described. The baseball bat article of the invention includes a baseball bat, a glossy finish coating material and an image-carrying transfer element. The baseball bat has a grip portion, a barrel portion and an intermediate portion interposed between the grip portion and the barrel portion. The baseball bat extends along a central axis to define a bat length.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The glossy finish coating material is applied to the baseball bat to form a glossy finish, at least along the bat length. The image-carrying transfer element is fabricated from a transparent sheet material which is defined by an outer periphery and has a first surface and an opposite second surface. A photographic image is formed on either the first surface or the second surface. The image-carrying transfer element is affixed to the baseball bat at a selected location along the bat length with one of the first and second surfaces in contact with the baseball bat.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Another embodiment of the invention is a baseball bat article that is fabricated from a method that includes the steps of providing a baseball bat having a glossy finish coating and a blank, glossy transfer element fabricated from the transparent material; transferring a photographic image on to the transfer element; and, affixing the transfer element with the transferred photographic image onto the baseball bat in a manner such that the transfer element appears to be integrally formed with the baseball bat.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Other objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description of the embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">A baseball bat article <b>10</b> of the invention is introduced in FIGS. 1-3. The baseball bat article <b>10</b> includes a baseball bat <b>12</b>, a glossy finish coating material <b>14</b> and a transfer element <b>16</b>. The baseball bat <b>12</b> is fabricated from any suitable material, such as wood or metal. Typically, ash is selected for wooden baseball bats while aluminum is selected for metal baseball bats. Further, although the description proceeds using an American baseball bat, other bats, such as cricket bats, can also be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In FIG. 3, the baseball bat <b>12</b> has a grip portion <b>18</b>, a barrel portion <b>20</b> and an intermediate portion <b>22</b> interposed between the grip portion <b>18</b> and the barrel portion <b>20</b>. Also, the baseball bat <b>10</b> includes a knob <b>24</b> connected to an end of the grip portion <b>18</b>. As shown in FIGS. 1 and 3, the baseball bat <b>12</b> extends along a central axis “C” to define a bat length “L”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As best shown in FIG. 4, the glossy finish coating material <b>14</b> is applied to the baseball bat <b>12</b> in a liquid form. The glossy finish coating material <b>14</b> is contained in a tank <b>26</b> and is applied to the baseball bat <b>12</b> via a conventional dipping process. As is commonly known in the art, the baseball bat <b>12</b> is submersed in the tank <b>16</b> filled with the glossy finish coating material <b>14</b> and, thereafter, the dipped baseball bat <b>12</b> is hung on a drying rack (not shown) to cure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In FIGS. 1 and 2, the transfer element <b>16</b> is fabricated from a transparent sheet material such as plastic or polyester film. Preferably, the transparent sheet material is Mylar® which is a registered trademark of E.I. Du Pont De Nemours and Company located in Wilmington, Del. However, it is preferred that the transparent sheet material is glossy coated. Also, the Mylar® is coated with an acrylic solution as discussed below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Again, with reference to FIGS. 1 and 2, the transfer element <b>16</b> is defined by an outer periphery <b>30</b> and the transfer element <b>16</b> has a first surface <b>32</b> and an opposite second surface <b>34</b>. Additionally, a photographic image <b>36</b> is formed on either the first surface <b>32</b> or the second surface <b>34</b>. The term “photographic image” is defined as an image having similar qualities of color and sharpness of a conventional photograph. SiCal Inc. of Natick, Mass., is one vendor that provides the transfer element <b>16</b> with the photographic image <b>36</b> formed thereon and uses conventional photographs to produce the transfer elements for the invention. As best shown in FIG. 3, the transfer element <b>16</b> is affixed to the baseball bat <b>12</b> at a selected location along the bat length “L”. Either the first surface <b>32</b> or the second surface <b>34</b> contacts the baseball bat <b>12</b>. Preferably, the photographic image <b>36</b> is formed on the surface that contacts the baseball bat <b>12</b>. With the transfer element <b>16</b> affixed to the baseball bat <b>12</b>, the transfer element <b>16</b> appears integrally formed with the baseball bat <b>12</b>. Further, the outer periphery <b>30</b> of the transfer element <b>16</b> is imperceptible, visually or tactilely.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in FIG. 3, the transfer element <b>16</b> is affixed to the baseball bat <b>12</b> on the barrel portion <b>20</b>. However, one of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that any selected location along the bat length “L” can be used to affix the transfer element <b>16</b>. Particularly, the transfer element <b>16</b> can be affixed to the grip portion <b>18</b>, to the intermediate portion <b>22</b>, to partially the grip portion <b>18</b> and partially the intermediate portion <b>22</b> and to partially the barrel portion <b>20</b> and partially the intermediate portion <b>22</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Preferably, the glossy finish coating material <b>14</b> is a conventional laquer, preferably, water-borne. One of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that the glossy finish coating material <b>14</b> can also be a polyethylene, varnish or other suitable glossy finish coating material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The transfer element <b>16</b> is affixed to the baseball bat <b>12</b> by a heated roller process discussed in more detail below. Generally, the heated roller process heats the transfer element <b>16</b> and the baseball bat <b>12</b> to a temperature sufficient to cause the transfer element <b>16</b> to adhere to the baseball bat <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">With reference to FIGS. 1 and 3, the photographic image <b>36</b> includes a person and alpha-numeric characters. However, a skilled artisan would appreciate that the photographic image can include a cartoon character or only a person or only alpha-numeric characters. However, for the embodiment of the baseball bat article of the invention, the photographic image <b>36</b> is a uniformed baseball player in a batting stance. Further, although not by way of limitation, the photographic image <b>36</b> of the uniformed baseball player fades adjacent the outer periphery <b>30</b> of the transfer element <b>16</b>. It is theorized that such fading causes the photographic image <b>36</b> to blend into the baseball bat. Mountain Graphix Inc. of Glenndale Heights, Ill., is a vendor that provides the graphic appearance of the transfer element with the photographic image.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In FIG. 5, a conventional photographic transfer process device <b>38</b> is used to transfer the photographic image <b>36</b> from a conventional photograph <b>40</b> onto a blank transfer element <b>16</b>′. Preferably, the blank transfer element <b>16</b>″ is fabricated from a transparent glossy material. Further, it is preferred that the photographic transfer process device <b>38</b> is capable of transferring a full-color photographic image from the photograph <b>40</b> onto the blank transfer element <b>16</b>′. However, one of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that the photographic transfer process device <b>38</b> would also be capable of transferring black and white photographic images as well as color photographic images onto the blank transfer element <b>16</b>′. Thus, the photographic image <b>36</b> formed on the transfer element <b>16</b> represents either a black and white photographic image, a color photographic image or a full-color photographic image. Further, it is preferred that the photographic image <b>36</b> transferred onto the transfer element <b>16</b> appears substantially identical to the photographic image so that the photographic image <b>36</b> formed on the transfer element <b>16</b> substantially retains the photographic qualities of the photograph <b>40</b>, particularly in lust of color and sharpness of the image itself.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">After the photographic transfer process is completed, the transfer element <b>16</b> with the photographic image <b>36</b> formed thereon is coated with an acrylic solution <b>41</b> to form an acrylic coating <b>43</b> on the transfer element <b>16</b>. A skilled artisan would appreciate that the transfer element <b>16</b> is coated with the acrylic solution <b>41</b> before affixing the transfer element <b>16</b> onto the baseball bat <b>12</b>. Upon heating the acrylic coating <b>43</b> when affixing the transfer element <b>16</b> to the baseball bat <b>12</b>, a permanent bond is formed between the baseball bat <b>12</b> and the transfer element <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Preferably, an ink <b>42</b> is used to form the photographic image <b>36</b> on the transfer element <b>16</b>. Preferably, the ink <b>42</b> is an industrial screen ink.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 6 represents a heated roller process that is used to affix the transfer element <b>16</b> onto the baseball bat <b>12</b>. The baseball bat <b>12</b> is supported by a pair of support rollers <b>44</b>. A high temperature drum <b>46</b> applies heat (represented by the dashes surrounding the high temperature drum <b>46</b>) and a pressure represented by arrow “p” to the baseball bat <b>12</b>. The high temperature is selected from a range between approximately 400° F. and 600° F. and the pressure is selected from a range between approximately 20 and 30 pounds per square inch. A desired combination of temperature and pressure is 420° F. and 25 pounds per square inch, respectively. The transfer element <b>16</b> formed with the photographic image <b>36</b> is fed between the high temperature drum <b>46</b> and the baseball bat <b>12</b> in a direction represented by arrow “D”. Preferably, the high temperature drum <b>46</b> includes an outer surface <b>48</b> having a silicone coating. As the high temperature drum <b>46</b> rotates clockwise as represented by arrow “M” the baseball bat <b>12</b> rotates in a counter-clockwise direction as represented by arrow “N.” As the transfer element <b>16</b> is fed between the high temperature drum <b>46</b> and the baseball bat <b>12</b>, the transfer element <b>16</b>, with the transferred photographic image, is affixed onto the baseball bat <b>12</b>. The affixed transfer element <b>16</b> embeds into and bonds with the glossy finish coating material <b>14</b> which forms a substantially imperceptible interface <b>50</b> between the transfer element <b>16</b> and the glossy finish coating material <b>14</b> as shown in FIG. <b>3</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The heated roller process represented in FIG. 6 can be achieved using a hot stamping machine. Preferably, the hot stamping machine is Acromark Model 73RR from Acromark Industries, Inc., from Berkley Heights, N.J. The serial number for this hot stamping machine is 109422 and the model number is 730R-S.S.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Another embodiment of the invention is a method of fabricating the baseball bat article. One step provides the baseball bat having a glossy finish and a blank, glossy transfer element fabricated from the transparent material. The next step is transferring the photographic image onto the transfer element. Another step is affixing the transfer element with the transferred photographic image onto the baseball bat in a manner such that the transfer element appears to be integrally formed with the baseball bat. Under the affixing step, the transfer element, with the transferred photographic image, is embedded into the glossy finish coating material under a sufficient temperature and pressure, as defined above, to form an imperceptible interface between the transfer element and the glossy finish coating material. The range of temperature and pressure is discussed above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The method might also include the step of causing the photographic image to fade near the periphery of the transfer element. Also, the step of transferring the photographic image on the transfer element can be achieved by a full-color transfer process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, a skilled artisan would appreciate that the transfer element with the photographic image formed thereon could first be affixed to the baseball bat and, thereafter, the glossy finish coating material could be applied to the baseball bat.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The baseball bat article <b>10</b> of the invention results in a baseball bat, whether miniature or regulation size, having a substantially photographic quality image formed thereon that appears integrally formed with the baseball bat. With such a photographic image, the colors have luster and the image itself is sharp.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Although the invention has been specifically described herein, it would be apparent to those skilled in the art to which the invention pertains that other variations and modifications of the invention shown herein may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</div>
