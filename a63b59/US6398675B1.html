<heading>FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">This invention relates to a ball bat, and more particularly to a bat with inner and outer tubular members with an elastomeric interface therebetween, and a method for manufacturing such.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Tubular metallic softball and baseball bats are well known in the art. A familiar example is a tubular aluminum bat. Such bats have the advantage of a generally good impact response, meaning that the bat effectively transfers power to a batted ball. This effective power transfer results in ball players achieving good distances with batted balls. An additional advantage is improved durability over crack-prone wooden bats.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Even though present aluminum bats perform well, there is a continuing quest for bats with better hitting capability. Accordingly, one important need is to optimize the impact response of a bat. Further, it is important to provide a bat with proper weighting so that its swing weight is apportioned to provide an appropriate center of gravity and swing speed and impact components during use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, constraining the design of aluminum bats is the requirement that the elastic deflection not be accompanied by any plastic deformation. Plastic deflection lessens the power transferred to a ball and leaves the bat permanently dented. Thus, it is desirable to be able to provide a reinforcement for the impact region of the bat, which otherwise may be so thin as to be plastically deformed during hitting. But on the other hand, the tubular wall must not be so thick that it is too stiff to elastically deflect appreciably.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In light of the shortcomings of the prior art, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved bat.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is another object of the invention to provide a simple construction for a tubular bat with inner and outer tubular members.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a bat having an elongate impact portion is formed with a first tubular member and a second tubular member substantially concentric with the first tubular member. The first and second tubular members have facing cylindrical surfaces throughout a majority of the length of the impact portion and elastomeric material is interposed between the facing cylindrical surfaces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, an elongate tubular metal member has a circular-striking portion, with the striking portion having an interior surface defining an interior cavity. An elongate tubular metal insert is located within the interior cavity and has an exterior surface complementary to and throughout a majority of its length slightly smaller than the interior of the striking portion. An elastomeric material is interposed between the interior surface and the exterior surface to permit some relative movement between the insert and the surrounding tubular member when a ball is batted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing an improved bat.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring to FIG. 1, tubular ball bat <b>10</b> comprises an elongate tubular metal member <b>11</b> having a ball striking, or impact portion, <b>12</b>, handle portion <b>14</b>, and a tapered transition portion <b>16</b> that extends between the handle portion <b>14</b> and striking portion <b>12</b>. As shown here, the impact, or ball striking, portion <b>12</b> has an elongate cylindrical shape. The impact portion <b>12</b> has a larger diameter that the handle portion <b>14</b>. The transition portion <b>16</b> joins the impact portion <b>12</b> and handle portion <b>14</b> and accordingly tapers in diameter from one end to the other. A knob <b>18</b> is provided at one end of the handle portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The distal end <b>20</b> of the impact portion <b>12</b> is initially open to facilitate manufacture of the bat. However, at the end of the forming process, the distal end portion is formed over as illustrated in FIGS. 1-3 to partially enclose the distal end of the bat. A circular opening <b>20</b> <i>a </i>is provided which will be closed by a plug (not shown).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The tubular metal member <b>11</b> forms the exterior of the ball bat and has a hollow interior, or interior cavity, <b>22</b> that extends the entire length of the bat. The striking, or impact, portion <b>12</b> has an interior surface <b>24</b> defining a portion of the interior cavity extending through the impact portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">To provide improved hitting with the bat, an elongate tubular insert <b>26</b> is disposed within cavity <b>22</b> in impact portion <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The impact portion <b>12</b> has a defined length indicated generally at L. The interior surface <b>24</b> has a substantially cylindrical cross-section having a diameter indicated generally at D<sub>1</sub>. Normally diameter D<sub>1 </sub>would be in a range of from 2 to 2.75 inches.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The insert <b>26</b> has an outer wall, or exterior, surface <b>30</b> complementary to the shape of interior surface <b>24</b>, but of a slightly smaller diameter D<sub>2</sub>. Insert <b>26</b> has a length, which is a majority of the length L of the impact portion, and is shown in the illustrations as substantially equal to length L. Normally length L would be in a range of from 12 to 16 inches.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring to FIG. 4, the thickness of the metal material forming the impact portion <b>12</b> of the tubular metal bat member is indicated generally at T<sub>1</sub>, while the thickness of the material forming insert <b>26</b> is noted at T<sub>2</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring still to FIG. 4, a layer of elastomeric material <b>36</b> is interposed and fills the space between adjacent facing portions of the interior surface <b>24</b> of impact portion <b>12</b> and the exterior surface <b>30</b> of insert <b>26</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A first end <b>26</b> <i>a </i>of the tubular insert, or sleeve, <b>26</b> is inserted within the impact portion to be forcefully lodged in abutment with the diametrically narrowing interior wall of the tapering portion <b>16</b>, which inhibits movement of the insert in the direction toward the handle of the bat. A second, or distal, end <b>26</b> <i>b </i>of the tubular insert, or sleeve, <b>26</b> is adjacent distal end <b>20</b> of the bat. The outermost, or topmost, portion of the impact portion of the bat indicated at <b>20</b> is curled inwardly over end <b>26</b> <i>b </i>to produce a reduced-diameter head, or stop, portion for the bat which inhibits movement of insert <b>26</b> in the direction of the curled over end of the bat.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The interior surface <b>24</b> of the impact portion <b>12</b> is substantially continuously cylindrical, and the exterior surface <b>30</b> of the insert is substantially continuously cylindrical having a shape which is generally complementary to, and of a slightly small diameter than the interior surface of the tubular outer member throughout the majority of the length of the insert. It has been found to be desirable to provide a gap, or space, <b>34</b> between member <b>11</b> and insert <b>26</b>. Space <b>34</b> in a preferred embodiment of the invention may have a width, or thickness, T<sub>3 </sub>in a range of 0.002 to 0.012 inch. This width, or thickness, is important. If it is too small there will be insufficient space for an effective layer of elastomeric material as discussed below. On the other hand, of the space is too large insufficient energy transfer may occur between member <b>11</b> and insert <b>26</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The elastomeric material <b>36</b> between interior surface <b>24</b> and exterior surface <b>30</b> is interposed in the entire space between substantially all adjacent facing portions of these two surfaces of the tubular metal bat member and the insert. The elastomeric material may be any suitable material which is capable of transmitting at least a portion of the ball striking and rebound energy between the tubular bat member and the insert with a degree of deformation occurring in the elastomeric material generally radially of the bat. Further, the elastomeric material must be capable of withstanding shear forces imposed thereon due to shifting of surface portions of the tubular bat member and insert relative to each other longitudinally and/or circumferentially of the bat on hitting. The elastomeric material should be capable of fully recovering its size and shape after such deformation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Examples of materials that may be used are a polymer or urethane material. It is preferable that the elastomeric materials have selected physical and operational characteristics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The hardness and resilience of the elastomeric material will be chosen in relation to the width T<sub>3 </sub>of the gap <b>34</b> between surfaces <b>24</b> and <b>30</b>. It has been found that where the gap is about 0.01 inch the elastomeric material works well by having a durometer hardness rating of 80 Shore A hardness rating and resiliency of 45% per ASTM standard D2632-96. For narrower gaps a softer material may be used, and conversely, for a wider gap a harder material will be required to produce appropriate batting characteristics. For example, the durometer hardness rating may range from 20 to 120 Shore A and the resiliency from 30% to 70% per ASTM standard D2632-96. The elastomeric material also preferably has an adhesive characteristic so that it will adhere to and remain in place between the tubular members.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The narrow gap, or space, <b>34</b> between the tubular outer member and the insert provides sufficient space for a desired amount of elastomeric material, yet does not provide sufficient space for plastic deformation to occur in the tubular outer member upon impact, or striking, forces occurring. The elastomeric material between the two members is adequate to permit a slight amount of elastic deformation of the outer tubular member, yet transmits striking force inwardly toward the insert, such that the insert provides added support and rebound energy during the striking operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In one embodiment, both the tubular outer member, or frame, and the insert are made of aluminum. The outer bat portion is formed by swaging from an aluminum tube to yield an integral weld free frame having the impact portion, handle, and transition portion as previously described. While swaging has been noted as a means of producing the outer member, it should be understood that other methods of manufacturing might work equally as well. As noted, the outer member is formed with a circular cross-section having a striking portion which has a cylindrical interior surface defining an interior cavity of selected first cross-sectional dimension D<sub>1 </sub>when at a normal ambient temperature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The insert <b>26</b> may be formed of a tubular metal material, which may be aluminum, steel, titanium, or other suitable metal material. The insert also may be formed of other materials, such as carbon fiber. The insert is formed into a shape having a cylindrical exterior surface complementary in shape to the interior surface. The insert has a second outer cross-sectional dimension D<sub>2 </sub>at normal ambient temperature, which is slightly less than the first interior dimension D<sub>1 </sub>of the striking portion. The thickness of the material of the impact portion <b>12</b> denoted generally at T<sub>1 </sub>is in a range of 0.04 to 0.08 inches, while the thickness of insert <b>26</b> denoted generally at T<sub>2 </sub>is in a range of 0.04 to 0.08 inches.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The outer diameter of the insert is such that at normal ambient temperature it is slightly less than the interior diameter of the outer member at ambient temperature. The diameter of the interior surface of impact portion <b>12</b> at normal ambient temperature is denoted generally at D<sub>1 </sub>and the exterior surface diameter D<sub>2 </sub>of the insert when initially formed at normal ambient temperatures could be in a range of (D<sub>1</sub>−0.004) inch to (D<sub>1</sub>−0.024) inch to provide a space T<sub>3 </sub>between the two when assembled in a range of 0.002 to 0.012 inch.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In initial forming, the distal end <b>20</b> of the outer tubular member <b>12</b> would not have been curled in as shown. Instead it would be formed to produce a full open cavity mouth into which insert <b>26</b> may be inserted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Prior to assembly either the external surface of the insert <b>26</b> or the interior surface <b>24</b> of the impact area <b>12</b> are coated with an appropriate elastomeric material as discussed above to a thickness at least as great as dimension T<sub>3</sub>. This material may be applied to the insert by spraying, rolling, or hand application, or to the interior surface of the impact portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The impact portion <b>12</b> of the outer member may be heated to a temperature sufficiently above ambient normal temperature to cause the interior cavity to expand. Conversely, the insert could be cooled below ambient temperature to cause it to shrink. In other words, a temperature differential may be produced between the outer member and the insert so that the insert may be slid easily into the outer member, with the layer of elastomeric material therebetween. While the temperature differential exists between the parts the insert is moved into the internal cavity to the position shown in FIGS. 1, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>. The bat parts then are allowed to return to ambient temperature to produce a close fit with the elastomeric material therebetween.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring to FIGS. 5-8, a second embodiment of the bat of the invention is illustrated. A ball bat <b>40</b> comprises an elongate tubular metal member <b>41</b> having a ball striking, or impact, portion <b>42</b>, handle portion <b>43</b> and transition-tapered portion <b>46</b>. The striking, or impact, portion <b>42</b> has an exterior surface <b>44</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">To provide improved hitting with the bat, an elongate tubular member, in the form of sleeve <b>48</b> is disposed about portion <b>42</b> of the tubular member <b>41</b>. The bat thus has an elongate impact portion with a defined length indicated generally at L formed by a combination of portion <b>42</b> of tubular member <b>41</b> and tubular member, or sleeve, <b>48</b>. These bat parts are substantially concentric and have facing cylindrical surfaces throughout a major portion of the length of the impact portion L. Generally the thicknesses of the tubular members would be similar to that previously discussed in relation to the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 1-4 and a similar fit would be provided therebetween.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As is best seen in FIGS. 5 and 6 the distal end of portion <b>42</b> is curled inwardly to form a rounded outer end <b>42</b> <i>a</i>, and the distal end <b>48</b> <i>a </i>of the sleeve also is curled inwardly over the outer end of section <b>42</b> <i>a</i>. Sleeve <b>48</b> is slightly longer than impact portion L the tubular member <b>41</b> and the portion adjacent end <b>48</b> <i>b </i>is formed inwardly to follow the general taper of tapered section <b>46</b> of tubular member <b>41</b>. This generally secures the sleeve <b>48</b> against shifting inwardly or outwardly longitudinally of member <b>41</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring to FIGS. 7 and 8, a layer of elastomeric material <b>56</b> is interposed between the exterior surface <b>44</b> of the impact portion <b>12</b> and the interior surface <b>50</b> of sleeve <b>48</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The interior surface <b>50</b> of sleeve <b>48</b> is substantially continuously cylindrical. The exterior surface <b>44</b> of portion <b>42</b> is substantially continuously cylindrical also, having a shape which is complementary to the interior surface of the sleeve throughout a majority of the length of the impact portion L. Here again, it has been found desirable to provide a space, or gap, <b>54</b> between the members, in a range of 0.002 to 0.012 inch.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Elastomeric material <b>56</b> is interposed between substantially all adjacent parts of these two surfaces and may be of materials similar to and applied similarly as described above. The materials used for the tubular portions also may be similar to those described above with similar thicknesses and other sizes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 5-8, the inner diameter of sleeve <b>48</b> is indicated generally at D<sub>3 </sub>when initially formed at normal ambient temperature. The exterior surface diameter D<sub>4 </sub>of tubular portion <b>42</b> when initially formed at normal ambient temperature could be in a range of (D<sub>3</sub>−0.004) inch to (D<sub>3</sub>−0.024) inch.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Prior to assembly either the external surface of tubular portion <b>42</b> or the interior surface of sleeve <b>48</b> is coated with an appropriate elastomeric material <b>56</b>. Such may be of materials and applied as set out for the previously described embodiment. Either the sleeve <b>48</b> is heated above ambient temperature or the tubular metal impact portion <b>42</b> is cooled sufficiently below ambient temperature, such that a temperature differential exists between the parts to allow the sleeve to be slid over the tubular bat frame <b>42</b> to the position illustrated in FIGS. 5-8. After the parts thus have been assembled they are allowed to return to ambient temperature which produces a close fit with elastomeric material interposed therebetween.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 9 is a partial sectional view similar to a portion of FIG. 6 of a third embodiment. Here tapered portion <b>46</b> has an annular ridge <b>60</b> formed thereon of a height substantially equal to the thickness of sleeve <b>48</b>. The inner end <b>48</b> <i>b </i>of sleeve <b>48</b> rests against the ridge, thus to provide a substantially continuous surface configuration for the tapered portion <b>46</b> and sleeve <b>48</b>, while maintaining the general structural and functional characteristics of the bat thus described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In view of the many possible embodiments to which the principals of the present invention may be put, it should be recognized that the detailed embodiments set out herein are illustrative only and should not be taken as limiting the scope of the invention. I claim as my invention all embodiments as may come within the scope and spirit of the following claims and equivalents thereto.</div>
