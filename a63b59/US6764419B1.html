<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Baseball and softball bats have been in use for many years. These bats typically include a handle, a barrel, and a tapered section joining the handle to the barrel. The outer shell of these bats is generally formed with aluminum or another suitable metal or composite construction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Barrel construction is particularly important in modern bat design. Barrels having a single-wall construction, and more recently, a multi-wall construction, have been developed. Modern bats typically include a hollow interior, such that the bats are relatively lightweight and allow a ball player to generate substantial “bat speed” or “swing speed.”</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Single-wall barrels generally include a single tubular spring within the barrel. Multi-wall barrels typically include two or more tubular springs, or similar structures, that may be of the same or different material composition, within the barrel. The tubular springs in these multi-wall bats are either in contact with one another, such that they form friction joints, are bonded to one another with weld or bonding adhesive, or are separated from one another forming frictionless joints. If the tubular springs are bonded using a structural adhesive, or other structural bonding material, the barrel is essentially a single-wall construction. U.S. Pat. No. 5,364,095, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference, describes a variety of bats having multi-walled barrel constructions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is generally desirable to have a bat barrel that is durable, while also exhibiting optimal performance characteristics. Hollow bats typically exhibit a phenomenon known as the “trampoline effect,” which essentially refers to the rebound velocity of a ball leaving the bat barrel as a result of flexing of the barrel wall(s). Thus, it is desirable to construct a bat having a high “trampoline effect,” so that the bat may provide a high rebound velocity to a pitched ball upon contact.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The “trampoline effect” is a direct result of the compression and resulting strain recovery of the barrel. During this process of barrel compression and decompression, energy is transferred to the ball resulting in an effective coefficient of restitution (COR) of the barrel, which is the ratio of the post impact ball velocity to the incident ball velocity (COR=Vpost impact/Vincident). In other words, the “trampoline effect” of the bat improves as the COR of the bat barrel increases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Multi-walled bats were developed in an effort to increase the amount of acceptable barrel deflection beyond that which is possible in typical single-wall designs. These multi-walled constructions generally provide added deflection without increasing stress beyond the material limits of the barrel materials. Accordingly, multi-walled designs are often preferred to single-wall designs, since they typically produce a better “trampoline effect.”</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In general, as the wall thickness or barrel stiffness is increased in a bat barrel, the COR decreases. It is important to maintain a sufficient wall thickness, however, because the durability of the bat typically decreases if the wall is too thin. Thus, if the barrel wall(s) are too thin, the barrel may be subject to denting, in the case of metal bats, or to progressive material failure, in the case of composite bats. As a result, the performance and lifetime of the bat may be reduced if the barrel wall(s) are not thick enough.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the case of composite bats, moreover, the bat barrels are generally characterized by a very high resin content. This high resin content often limits the elastic properties of the bat barrel. Thus, although these bats have performed relatively well, the “trampoline effect” that they exhibit is generally limited by the high resin content in the bat barrels. Thus, there exists a significant design challenge to construct a bat that exhibits significant “trampoline effect” in conjunction with high durability.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The invention is directed to a ball bat having an interface section having one or more layers of non-resin-impregnated fabric sandwiched between a plurality of resin-impregnated layers in a wall of the bat barrel, and a method of making the same.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a first aspect, a ball bat includes a barrel, a handle, and a tapered section joining the barrel to the handle. The barrel has an outer wall including a substantially cylindrical outer layer, a substantially cylindrical inner layer, and an interface section located between and integral with the outer layer and the inner layer. The interface section includes one or more layers of fabric sandwiched between a plurality of resin-impregnated composite plies, wherein the layer of fabric includes resin that flowed from the plurality of resin-impregnated composite plies during curing of the bat.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In another aspect, a method of constructing a ball bat includes the steps of placing a substantially cylindrical layer of substantially dry fabric between a plurality of resin-impregnated layers to form a substantially cylindrical interface section. The interface section is then placed between a plurality of substantially cylindrical wall sections that each include one or more composite plies. Heat and pressure are then applied to the interface section and the composite plies to induce a flow of resin from the resin-impregnated layers into the fabric layer, and to form an integral bat barrel made up of the wall sections and the interface section.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In another aspect, a method of constructing a ball bat includes the steps of rolling an inner wall section onto a substantially cylindrical mandrel, rolling a bond inhibiting layer onto the inner wall section, and rolling an inner layer of an outer wall section onto the bond inhibiting layer. A first resin-impregnated reinforcement layer is then rolled onto the inner layer of the outer wall section, after which a substantially dry layer of fabric is rolled onto the first resin-impregnated reinforcement layer. Next, a second resin-impregnated reinforcement layer is rolled onto the fabric layer, and an outer layer of the outer wall section is rolled onto the second resin-impregnated reinforcement layer. Heat and pressure are then applied to the layers to induce a flow of resin from the first and second resin-impregnated reinforcement layers into the fabric layer, and to form an integral bat barrel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In another aspect, a ball bat includes a barrel, a handle, and a tapered section joining the barrel to the handle. The barrel includes a substantially cylindrical outer wall. A substantially cylindrical interface section, including one or more layers of previously non-resin-impregnated fabric sandwiched between a plurality of resin-impregnated layers, is located in the outer wall of the barrel. The layer of fabric includes resin that flowed from the plurality of resin-impregnated layers during curing of the bat.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further embodiments, including modifications, variations, and enhancements of the invention, will become apparent. The invention resides as well in subcombinations of the features shown and described.</div>

<heading>DETAILED OF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">A ball bat has an interface section including one or more layers of non-resin-impregnated fabric sandwiched between a plurality of resin-impregnated layers in a wall of the bat barrel. Other steps and features described below may be advantageous but are not necessarily essential to the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Turning now in detail to the drawings, as shown in FIG. 1, a baseball or softball bat <b>10</b>, hereinafter collectively referred to as a “ball bat” or “bat,” includes a handle <b>12</b>, a barrel <b>14</b>, and a tapered section <b>16</b> joining the handle <b>12</b> to the barrel <b>14</b>. The free end of the handle <b>12</b> includes a knob <b>18</b> or similar structure. The barrel <b>14</b> is preferably closed off by a suitable cap <b>20</b> or plug. The interior <b>38</b> of the bat <b>10</b> is preferably hollow about a central axis <b>40</b>, which allows the bat to be relatively lightweight so that ball players may generate substantial bat speed when swinging the bat <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The bat <b>10</b> preferably has an overall length of 20 to 40 inches, more preferably 26 to 34 inches. The overall barrel diameter is preferably 2.0 to 3.0 inches, more preferably 2.25 to 2.75 inches. Typical bats have diameters of 2.25, 2.69, or 2.75 inches. Bats having various combinations of these overall lengths and barrel diameters are contemplated herein. The specific preferred combination of dimensions of a bat <b>10</b> is generally dictated by the user of the bat <b>10</b>, and may vary greatly between users.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention is primarily directed to the ball striking area of the bat <b>10</b>, which typically extends throughout the length of the barrel <b>14</b>, and which may extend partially into the tapered section <b>16</b> of the bat <b>10</b>. For ease of description, this striking area will generally be referred to as the “barrel” throughout the remainder of the description.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As illustrated in FIGS. 2-5, the barrel <b>14</b> is made up of several substantially cylindrical layers. The actual shape of each of the barrel layers may vary according to the desired shape of the overall barrel structure. Accordingly, “substantially cylindrical” will be used herein to describe cylindrical barrel layers, as well as other similar common barrel shapes. An outer barrel wall preferably includes an outer layer <b>22</b> and an inner layer <b>24</b>. Each layer <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> is preferably made up of one or more plies of a composite material. Alternatively, the outer and/or inner layers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> of the outer barrel wall may include a metallic material, such as aluminum or titanium.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 4, each of the outer and inner layers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> includes a plurality of composite plies. The composite material is preferably fiber-reinforced, and may include glass, graphite, boron, carbon, aramid, ceramic, kevlar, and/or any other suitable reinforcement material. The overall radial thickness of each layer <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> is preferably approximately 0.005 to 0.020 inches, more preferably 0.010 to 0.015 inches.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The outer and inner layers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> of the outer barrel wall are separated by and preferably integral with an interface section <b>26</b>. As is best illustrated in FIG. 5, the interface section <b>26</b> includes at least one inner layer <b>28</b> sandwiched between two reinforcing layers <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>. The inner layer <b>28</b> is preferably a fabric or similar material, and has a radial thickness of approximately 0.005 to 0.015 inches, more preferably 0.008 to 0.012 inches. Before curing of the bat <b>10</b> is performed, the inner fabric layer <b>28</b> is preferably substantially dry and not impregnated with resin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The two reinforcing layers <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> preferably each include one or more plies of a composite material impregnated with resin. Each reinforcing layer <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> preferably has a radial thickness of approximately 0.002 to 0.010 inches, more preferably 0.004 to 0.006 inches. In a preferred embodiment, the two reinforcing layers <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> each include one or more plies of resin-impregnated unidirectional composite tape. The composite tape, or other composite material, is preferably fiber-reinforced, and may include glass, graphite, boron, carbon, aramid, ceramic, kevlar, and/or any other suitable reinforcement material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">During curing of the bat <b>10</b>, which is described in detail below, heat and pressure are applied to the barrel structure. This heating and pressurizing process causes resin to flow from the resin-impregnated layers <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> into the fabric layer <b>28</b>. As a result, the interface section <b>26</b> becomes a unified sandwich structure that is integral with the surrounding layers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> of the outer barrel wall. The resulting barrel structure, as a whole, has an extremely low resin content compared to conventional composite barrels that do not employ such an interface section. The integral barrel layers function in a manner similar to that of a typical leaf spring. Accordingly, the barrel <b>14</b> exhibits relatively high elastic properties compared to conventional composite barrels, and, in turn, exceptional elastic performance, “trampoline effect,” and durability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a preferred embodiment, the barrel <b>14</b> also includes an inner barrel wall, giving the barrel a “multi-wall” design. The inner barrel wall is located adjacent to and surrounded by the outer barrel wall. The inner barrel wall may be separated from the outer barrel wall by a bond-inhibiting layer <b>36</b>, which prevents the inner and outer barrel walls from bonding to one another during curing of the bat <b>10</b>. The bond-inhibiting layer <b>36</b> preferably has a radial thickness of approximately 0.001 to 0.004 inches, more preferably 0.002 to 0.003 inches.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The inner barrel wall is preferably made up of one or more layers <b>34</b> of a composite material. The composite material is preferably fiber-reinforced, and may include glass, graphite, boron, carbon, aramid, ceramic, kevlar, and/or any other suitable reinforcement material. Alternatively, the layers <b>34</b> of the inner barrel wall may be a metallic material, such as aluminum or titanium.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a preferred embodiment, the outer layer <b>22</b> of the outer barrel wall has a radial thickness substantially equal to that of the inner layer <b>24</b> of the outer barrel wall. As a result, the interface section <b>26</b> is located substantially at a radial midpoint of the outer barrel wall. Thus, in a single-wall configuration, the interface section <b>26</b> is located at approximately one half the overall radial wall thickness measured from an outer surface of the barrel wall.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a double-wall design, the inner barrel wall preferably has a radial thickness substantially equal to that of the outer barrel wall. Accordingly, when the interface section <b>26</b> is located substantially at a radial midpoint of the outer barrel wall, the interface section <b>26</b> is located at approximately one quarter the combined radial wall thickness of the outer barrel wall and the inner barrel wall measured from an outer surface of the outer barrel wall. The relative thickness of each of the layers, and the resulting relative location of the interface section <b>26</b>, may vary based on design considerations relating to bulk modulus, shear strength of the resin employed, minimum elongation of the fibers employed, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">To construct the bat <b>10</b>, the various layers of the bat <b>10</b> are preferably pre-cut and pre-shaped with conventional machinery. In general, the bat <b>10</b> is constructed by placing one or more substantially cylindrical layers <b>28</b> of substantially dry fabric between a plurality of resin-impregnated layers <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> to form a substantially cylindrical interface section <b>26</b>. The interface section <b>26</b> is then placed between two substantially cylindrical outer wall sections <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, each made up of one or more composite plies.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">If a double-wall construction is desired, the outer wall sections are positioned around a substantially cylindrical inner wall section made up of one or more composite plies <b>34</b>. In a preferred embodiment, a bond-inhibiting layer <b>36</b> may be placed between the inner and outer wall sections.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Once all of the layers are arranged, heat and pressure are applied to the layers to cure the bat <b>10</b>. The heat and pressure induce a flow of resin from the resin-impregnated composite layers <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> of the interface section <b>26</b> into the fabric layer <b>28</b> of the interface section <b>26</b>. This flow of resin occurs because the relative pressure in the resin-impregnated layers <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> is greater than the pressure in the dry fabric layer <b>28</b>. As the resin flows from the reinforcing layers <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, these layers <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> become stiffer. Accordingly, the overall barrel <b>14</b> is generally stiffer than barrels found in conventional composite bats that do not employ such an interface section <b>26</b>. This increased stiffness provides excellent load transfer between the multiple barrel layers, which enhances the “trampoline effect” of the bat barrel <b>14</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The flow of resin into the fabric layer <b>28</b> transforms the interface section <b>26</b> into a unified sandwich structure that is integral with the other barrel layers. This unified sandwich structure, as a whole, has a very low resin content. Accordingly, the overall resin content of the barrel <b>14</b> itself is much lower than that of conventional composite bats that do not employ such an interface section <b>26</b>. As a result, the bat barrel <b>14</b> has improved elastic properties, which further enhances the “trampoline effect.”</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In general, the bat <b>10</b> is constructing by rolling the various layers of the bat <b>10</b> onto a mandrel or similar structure having the desired bat shape. The ends of the layers are preferably “clocked” or offset from one another so that they do not all end in the same location. Accordingly, when heat and pressure are applied to cure the bat <b>10</b>, the various layers blend into a unique single-wall construction. Put another way, all of the layers of the bat are “co-cured” in a single step, resulting in a single wall structure with no gaps, such that the barrel <b>14</b> is not made up of a series of tubes with a wall thickness that terminates at the ends of the tubes. As a result, the interface section <b>26</b> is integral to the barrel structure, and all of the layers act in unison under loading conditions, such as during striking of a ball.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The blending of the layers into a single-wall construction, like tying the ends of a leaf spring together, offers an extremely durable assembly, particularly when impact occurs at the extreme ends of the layer separation zones. By blending the multiple layers, together, the barrel <b>14</b> acts as a unitized structure where no single layer works independently of the other layers. As a result, stress is redistributed to the extreme regions of the interface section <b>26</b>, which reduces localized stress, thus increasing the overall durability of the bat barrel <b>14</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a preferred embodiment, the bat <b>10</b> is constructed as follows. First, the various layers of the bat <b>10</b> are pre-cut and pre-shaped with conventional machinery. An inner wall section, made up of one or more composite plies <b>34</b>, is rolled onto the bat-shaped mandrel. A bond-inhibiting layer <b>36</b> may then be rolled onto the inner wall section, if such a layer is desired. An inner layer <b>24</b>, made up of one or more composite plies, of an outer wall section is then rolled onto the bond-inhibiting layer <b>36</b>, or onto the inner wall section if a bond-inhibiting layer is not employed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, the layers of the interface section <b>26</b> are applied. First, an inner resin-impregnated reinforcement layer <b>32</b> is rolled onto the inner layer <b>24</b> of the outer wall section. One or more layers <b>28</b> of substantially dry fabric are then rolled onto the inner resin-impregnated reinforcement layer <b>32</b>. An outer resin-impregnated reinforcement layer <b>30</b> is then rolled onto the fabric layer <b>28</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Finally, an outer layer <b>22</b> of the outer wall section, made up of one or more composite plies, is rolled onto the outer resin-impregnated reinforcement layer <b>30</b>. Once all of the layers are arranged, heat and pressure are applied to the layers to cure the bat <b>10</b>, as described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The described bat construction, and method of making the same, provides a bat having excellent “trampoline effect” and durability. These results are primarily due to the use of an interface section including one or more dry fabric layers sandwiched between layers of a resin-impregnated composite material in the bat barrel. The resin flow from the composite layers into the fabric layer provides for increased stiffness and trampoline effect. Additionally, the blending of barrel layers in a single curing step provides for increased durability, especially during impact at the extreme ends of the barrel layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In any of the embodiments described herein, one or more layers of non-resin-impregnated fabric may be placed at various other locations within the barrel to increase barrel stiffness and to improve “trampoline effect.” Additionally, the fabric layers may be placed adjacent to one another, or may be separated from one another by a suitable separation means.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Thus, while several embodiments have been shown and described, various changes and substitutions may of course be made, without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The invention, therefore, should not be limited, except by the following claims and their equivalents.</div>
