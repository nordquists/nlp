<heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00002">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00003">The present invention relates generally to lacrosse sticks, and more particularly, to an apparatus and method for dampening the rebound of a lacrosse head pocket after the pocket has been pulled taut by, for example, a caught, thrown, or cradled lacrosse ball.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00004">2. Background of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00005">Since they were first introduced around 1970, double-wall, synthetic lacrosse heads have revolutionized the game of lacrosse. In comparison to the early single-wall wooden lacrosse heads, synthetic heads offer vastly improved feel, balance, lightness, maneuverability, and flexibility. The synthetic heads are also less expensive to manufacture and can be produced with a more consistent level of quality. And, perhaps most importantly, the synthetic heads offer superior durability, withstanding the harsh impacts and bending encountered during play, such as during face-offs and defensive checking.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00006"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a conventional molded-head lacrosse stick. As shown, lacrosse stick <b>100</b> includes a handle <b>102</b> shown in dotted lines, and a double-wall synthetic head <b>104</b>. Head <b>104</b> includes a generally V-shaped frame having a juncture <b>106</b>, sidewalls <b>108</b> and <b>110</b>, a transverse wall (or “scoop”) <b>112</b> joining the sidewalls at the end opposed to juncture <b>106</b>, and a stop member <b>114</b> joining sidewalls <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> at the end nearest juncture <b>106</b>. As shown, handle <b>102</b> fits into and through juncture <b>106</b>, and abuts stop member <b>114</b>. A screw or other fastener placed through opening <b>107</b> secures handle <b>102</b> to head <b>104</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00007">For traditionally-strung pockets (which have thongs and string instead of mesh), thongs (not shown) made of leather or synthetic material extend from upper thong holes <b>116</b> in transverse wall <b>112</b> to lower thong holes <b>118</b> in stop member <b>114</b>. In some designs (such as that of U.S. Pat. No. 4,034,984 to Crawford et al.), upper thong holes <b>116</b> are located on tabs of the scoop <b>112</b>. On other designs, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, upper thong holes <b>116</b> are located within scoop <b>112</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows four pairs (<b>116</b>, <b>118</b>) of thong holes that accept four thongs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00008">To complete the pocket web, the thongs have nylon strings threaded around the thongs and string laced through string holes <b>120</b> in sidewalls <b>108</b> and <b>110</b>, forming any number of diamonds (crosslacing). Finally, one or more throwing or shooting strings extend transversely between the upper portions of sidewalls <b>108</b> and <b>110</b>, attaching to throwing string hole <b>124</b> and a string laced through string hole <b>122</b>. The typical features of a lacrosse stick are all shown generally in Tucker et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,507,495; Crawford et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,034,984; and Tucker et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,566,947 which are all incorporated by reference herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00009">In addition to traditionally strung heads, some heads use mesh pockets or a combination of traditional and mesh stringing. In any case, the mesh or stringing is conventionally attached to the head through holes in the scoop, sidewalls, and stop members, or through holes in rigid tabs attached to the scoop, sidewalls, and stop members. As used herein, thread holes or thread openings refer to the holes that receive the various forms of pocket stringing, such as the holes in the scoop, sidewalls, and stop members, or the holes in tabs attached to the scoop, sidewalls, and stop members. Also, as used herein, a pocket thread refers to any member, such as a thong, string, or mesh, that forms the pocket or attaches the pocket to the lacrosse head.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00010">The traditional double-wall synthetic head is an injection-molded, monolithic structure. Examples of suitable synthetic materials well known in the art include nylon, urethane, and polycarbonate. These materials are generally regarded as superior to wood, offering players improved handling and durability. For example, a lacrosse head constructed of DuPont™ ZYTEL ST-801 nylon resin is able to withstand the bending and harsh impacts inherent to competition far better than a traditional wooden stick. As another example, polycarbonate, though having flexibility similar to wood, is more structurally durable than wood and much lighter, and therefore easier to handle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00011">Although the synthetic materials impart many performance advantages over traditional wooden heads, the synthetic, monolithic double-wall head fails to outperform the wooden heads in one critical aspect: pocket “give.” Specifically, the rigidity required for durability is at odds with the desire for “give” in the pocket when receiving a heavy, hard rubber lacrosse ball. Because the synthetic heads use substantially rigid materials to provide the structural integrity and durability of the head frame, the thong holes in the substantially rigid head provide little deflection against which the pocket strings can pull. In other words, the thong holes in a synthetic head do not deaden the pull of the pocket webbing, as occurs, for example, when a lacrosse ball hits the pocket. This lack of impact absorption is noticeable in comparison to a wooden single-wall head, which fixes the pocket webbing to a pliable gut wall. Thus, there remains a need for a synthetic lacrosse head design that provides the pocket “give” of a wooden head, while maintaining the light weight, durability, and structural integrity of traditional synthetic lacrosse heads.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00012">Notably, this pocket “give” is most critical in the women's game, in which shallow pocket depth rules necessitate tightly strung pockets. Given that the combined height of the sidewall and pocket cannot exceed the size of the game ball (2½ inches), the netting suspended from the women's lacrosse head forms little, if any, pocket and remains substantially in the same plane as the head itself. As a result of the necessary tension, when the lacrosse ball hits the pocket, the impact often causes a trampoline effect that makes the ball hard to catch and control. Indeed, for all but the most skilled players, a lacrosse ball can easily bounce out of the rebounding pocket. In essence, the pocket, strung on a rigid unforgiving frame, acts like the strings of a tennis racquet and rebounds the ball out of the pocket. Although this trampoline effect is more pronounced in the tightly strung women's lacrosse heads, the desire to absorb the impact of an incoming ball is equally applicable to men's lacrosse heads.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00013">The present invention is a method and apparatus for dampening the rebound of a lacrosse head pocket after the pocket has been pulled taut. Unlike the substantially rigid lacrosse head frames of the prior art, which attach pocket threads to unforgiving, rigid structures, the present invention provides a flexible energy-absorbing moveable structure to which a pocket is strung. The moveable structure is part of an otherwise rigid lacrosse head frame. The flexibility of the moveable structure produces a “give” that minimizes the rebound of a pocket after being impacted by a ball. This pocket dampening limits the movement of the ball and makes the ball easier to control and to retain in the pocket. Depending on where the moveable structure is located on the lacrosse head frame, the moveable structure provides the pocket “give” in response to, for example, the pull force on the pocket created by a regulation lacrosse ball impacting the pocket during a catch or swinging in the pocket during cradling.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00014">In one embodiment, the present invention includes a frame having a thread hole and an aperture proximate to the thread hole. The aperture creates a moveable structure of the frame. The moveable structure encompasses at least a portion of the thread hole. The moveable structure is adapted to flex relative to the frame when pulled by a pocket thread attached to the thread hole.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00037">The present invention is a method and apparatus for absorbing the energy of a lacrosse ball moving into and within a lacrosse head pocket. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows an embodiment of the invention, which includes a lacrosse head frame <b>200</b> having a thread hole <b>202</b> and an aperture <b>204</b>. Thread hole <b>202</b> is located anywhere on lacrosse head frame <b>200</b> (e.g., ball stop, sidewalls, or scoop) and receives a string or thong of a pocket that is attached to frame <b>200</b>. Although shown as a circle, thread hole <b>202</b> could, of course, be of any shape (e.g., an oval or slit) suitable for receiving a pocket thread. Aperture <b>204</b> is proximate to thread hole <b>202</b>, such that frame <b>200</b> is separated into a moveable structure <b>206</b> and a rigid frame structure <b>208</b>. Moveable structure <b>206</b> encompasses at least a portion of thread hole <b>202</b> and moves relative to rigid frame structure <b>208</b>. In this example, the boundary between moveable structure <b>206</b> and rigid frame structure <b>208</b> is flex line <b>210</b>, due to the position of aperture <b>204</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00038">Although shown as a triangular notch, aperture <b>204</b> could be any opening in frame <b>200</b> that, by being proximate to thread hole <b>202</b>, creates a moveable structure that moves relative to the remaining portion of lacrosse head frame <b>200</b>. Flex line <b>210</b> is representative of a boundary between the moveable structure and the rigid frame structure, and could, of course, vary depending on factors such as the material from which frame <b>200</b> is made, the width and thickness of frame <b>200</b>, the shape and position of aperture <b>204</b>, and the relative positions of aperture <b>204</b> and thread hole <b>202</b>. Flex line <b>210</b> could also be an actual structural element of frame <b>200</b>, at which frame <b>200</b> is structurally weakened to promote flexing, e.g., by scoring or perforating frame <b>200</b> at flex line <b>210</b>. In addition, as one of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate, the moveable structure and the rigid frame structure may not be separated by a well-defined boundary, such as a flex line. For example, the transition between moveable structure and the rigid frame structure could be gradual as provided by a steadily decreasing material thickness. Thus, it should be understood that this specification uses the term “flex line” for illustration purposes only, and that the present invention is not limited to having a defined flex line between the moveable structure and the rigid frame structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00039"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> illustrates a side view of the frame <b>200</b>, thread hole <b>202</b>, and aperture <b>204</b> shown in FIG. <b>2</b>A. This side view demonstrates the directions in which moveable structure <b>206</b> can flex. Specifically, moveable structure <b>206</b> flexes in the general direction of arrow <b>220</b>, which roughly corresponds to a direction perpendicular to the face of thread hole <b>202</b>. Moveable structure <b>206</b> achieves the movement in the direction of arrow <b>220</b> by bending or twisting along flex line <b>210</b>. Depending on the configuration (e.g., shape and placement) of aperture <b>204</b>, moveable structure <b>206</b> may also move in the general direction of arrow <b>222</b> (which roughly corresponds to a direction parallel to the face of thread hole <b>202</b>) or in any of directions <b>223</b> between arrow <b>220</b> and <b>222</b>. Examples of aperture configurations that achieve these different directions of “give” are described below in reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-18D</figref>. In each case, the configuration of aperture <b>204</b> enables moveable structure <b>206</b> to flex in a desired direction by, for example, bending, compressing, or twisting.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00040"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> illustrates the moveable structure <b>206</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> in a flexed position. In this example, a thong <b>230</b> attached to thread hole <b>202</b> is pulling moveable structure <b>206</b> in the direction of arrow <b>220</b>. This pull would occur, for example, when a ball is caught or cradled, and comes in contact with thong <b>230</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, in response to the pull, moveable structure <b>206</b> flexes (along flex line <b>210</b>) to arrest the movement of the ball and the pocket in a controlled and deadening manner. After moveable structure <b>206</b> stops the movement of the ball and pocket, moveable structure <b>206</b> then gradually recovers to its original non-flexed position, as shown in FIG. <b>2</b>B. To provide this gradual recovery, moveable structure <b>206</b> dampens the energy of the ball and pocket, rather than storing the energy (as would a spring, for example). This dampening prevents a trampoline effect that would propel the ball out of the pocket. In other words, in response to the pull of the pocket, moveable structure <b>206</b> flexes, dampens the pull of the pocket, and then gradually recovers to its original position without excessive rebound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00041">The present invention can be used to attach pocket webbing to any portion of a lacrosse head frame, including the traditional thong and string holes in the scoop, sidewalls, and ball stop. As shown by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B, and <b>2</b>C, in any location, the present invention provides a flexible anchor that deflects in response to the pull of a pocket thread, dampens the pull, and then gradually recovers to its original position to limit pocket rebound. The anchor deflects in any direction from substantially parallel to the face of thread hole <b>202</b> to perpendicular to the face of thread hole <b>202</b>. However, because thread hole <b>202</b> can face in a different direction, depending on where it is located in the lacrosse head frame, the present invention offers different advantages, depending on whether it is applied to the scoop, sidewalls, or ball stop of a lacrosse head frame. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B, and <b>3</b>C illustrate examples of the way in which the present invention can operate in these three different positions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00042"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows the present invention applied to the scoop of a lacrosse head <b>300</b>, as represented by dotted circle <b>302</b>. In this configuration, a thong attached to thread hole <b>202</b> (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) in the scoop provides a dampening flex and gradual recovery in the general direction of arrow <b>308</b> after the pocket is impacted by a ball <b>310</b> entering the pocket substantially perpendicular to the face of head <b>300</b>. Specifically, moveable portion <b>206</b> (as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>) flexes in the general direction of arrow <b>308</b> (and arrow <b>220</b> in FIG. <b>2</b>C). Thus, the present invention provides “give” in the general direction of arrow <b>308</b>, thereby deadening the impact of the ball and the rebound of the pocket. This deadening effect enables a player to more easily control the ball, and keep the ball within the lacrosse head pocket.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00043">Applied to head <b>300</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, moveable portion <b>206</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>) can also provide dampening and gradual recovery characteristics in a direction <b>306</b> parallel to the face of head <b>300</b>, as well as in any of the directions <b>309</b> in between arrows <b>306</b> and <b>308</b>. These directions correspond to situations in which, for example, ball <b>310</b> enters the pocket in a direction other than perpendicular to the face of head <b>300</b>, or after the ball is in the pocket and rattles around during cradling.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00044">Thus, when applied to the scoop of a lacrosse head frame, the present invention dampens the movement of the pocket in any of directions <b>306</b>, <b>308</b>, and <b>309</b>. Furthermore, in gradually recovering from flex in any of these directions, the present invention prevents the pocket from acting like a trampoline and ejecting the ball from the pocket prematurely.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00045"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> illustrates the present invention applied to the ball stop of a lacrosse head frame <b>320</b>, as represented by dotted circle <b>322</b>. In this configuration, a thong attaches to thread hole <b>202</b> (shown in FIG. <b>2</b>A). Moveable portion <b>206</b> (as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) provides a dampening and gradual recovery characteristics in a direction generally parallel to the face of head frame <b>320</b> (as represented by arrow <b>326</b>), in a direction generally perpendicular to the face of head frame <b>320</b> (as represented by arrow <b>324</b>), and in any of the directions in between (as represented by arrow <b>327</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00046">In the direction of arrow <b>324</b>, the dampening and gradual recovery characteristics are helpful when receiving a ball that is traveling in a direction perpendicular to the face of head frame <b>320</b>. After the ball impacts the pocket, the pocket pulls against moveable portion <b>206</b>, which then flexes, dampens the movement of the pocket and ball, and then gradually recovers to its original position to keep the pocket and ball from rebounding out of control.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00047">In the direction of arrow <b>326</b>, the dampening and gradual recovery characteristics are helpful when a ball is moving within the pocket, such as occurs when cradling or when the lacrosse head is jarred during a defensive check. The present invention therefore dampens the pull of the pocket in the general direction of arrow <b>326</b>, thereby minimizing the movement of a ball inside the pocket and enabling a player to more easily control the ball, and keep the ball within the lacrosse head pocket. Specifically, when a ball moves within the pocket, causing the suspended pocket to swing, moveable portion <b>206</b> flexes, dampens the movement of the pocket and ball, and then gradually recovers to minimize rattle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00048">In the directions of arrows <b>327</b>, moveable portion <b>206</b> provides dampening and gradual recovery characteristics for situations in which, for example, a ball enters the pocket in a direction other than perpendicular to the face of head frame <b>320</b>, or after the ball is in the pocket and rattles around in different directions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00049"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> illustrates the present invention applied to one or both of the sidewalls of a lacrosse head frame <b>330</b>, as represented by dotted circles <b>332</b>. In this configuration, pocket strings attach to thread hole <b>202</b> (shown in FIG. <b>2</b>A). Moveable portion <b>206</b> (as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) provides a dampening and gradual recovery characteristics in a direction generally parallel to the face of head frame <b>330</b> (as represented by arrow <b>336</b>), in a direction generally perpendicular to the face of head frame <b>330</b> (as represented by arrow <b>334</b>), and in any of the directions in between (as represented by arrow <b>335</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00050">In the direction of arrow <b>336</b>, the dampening and gradual recovery characteristics are helpful when a ball is moving or swinging within the pocket, such as occurs when cradling or when the lacrosse head is jarred during a defensive check. In this configuration, the present invention therefore dampens the pull of the pocket in the general direction of arrow <b>336</b>, thereby minimizing the movement of a ball inside the pocket and enabling a player to more easily control the ball, and keep the ball within the lacrosse head pocket. Specifically, when a ball moves within the pocket, causing the suspended pocket to swing, moveable portion <b>206</b> flexes, dampens the movement of the pocket and ball, and the gradually recovers to minimize rattle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00051">In the direction of arrow <b>334</b>, the dampening and gradual recovery characteristics are helpful when receiving a ball that is traveling in a direction perpendicular to the face of head frame <b>330</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00053">Although, for simplicity, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B, and <b>2</b>C show aperture <b>204</b> formed in a generally straight line, aperture <b>204</b> could be shaped in a variety of ways to create a flex line between a moveable structure and a rigid frame structure of a lacrosse head frame. For example, instead of forming aperture <b>204</b> as a straight line, aperture <b>204</b> could be formed as a curved line. Alternatively, aperture <b>204</b> could be formed as a straight line that changes direction and proceeds in a straight line in another direction (in other words, a “dogleg”). Moreover, aperture <b>204</b> could consist of two or more doglegs that enable aperture <b>204</b> to surround almost all sides of a thread hole. In this same vein, aperture could be shaped as a long curve that travels around a thread hole, surrounding almost all sides of the thread hole. Of course, aperture <b>204</b> could be formed in any combination of shapes as well. For example, aperture could be formed as a straight line with a curved end, in what could be called a “hook” configuration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00054"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an aperture <b>400</b> having a dogleg shape that encloses an oval thread hole <b>401</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00058"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an aperture <b>600</b> having a multiple-dogleg shape. A first straight section <b>602</b> is positioned substantially perpendicular to the edge <b>604</b> of the lacrosse head frame <b>606</b>. A second straight section <b>608</b> is positioned substantially parallel to edge <b>604</b> and substantially perpendicular to the first straight section <b>602</b>.

The entire length of aperture <b>600</b> therefore surrounds a majority of the perimeter of slit-shaped thread hole <b>612</b>, creating a flex line <b>614</b> between moveable portion <b>616</b> and rigid portion <b>618</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00059">In the configuration of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, moveable structure <b>616</b> provides dampening and gradual recovery characteristics in the general direction of arrow <b>620</b> (generally perpendicular to the face of thread hole <b>612</b>) by bending along flex line <b>614</b>. In addition, moveable structure <b>616</b> provides dampening and gradual recovery characteristics in the general direction of arrow <b>622</b> (generally parallel to the face of thread hole <b>612</b>) by compression and elasticity roughly along flex line <b>614</b>. Specifically, the material of frame <b>606</b> stretches along flex line <b>614</b> at points near section <b>610</b> of aperture <b>600</b> and compresses at the opposite end of flex line <b>614</b> near the edge of frame <b>606</b>. In comparison to apertures <b>400</b> and <b>500</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, respectively, aperture <b>600</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> surrounds a greater portion of thread hole <b>612</b>, thereby creating a shorter flex line <b>614</b> and increasing the tendency of moveable structure <b>616</b> to move in the direction of arrow <b>622</b>. In other words, because the portion of frame <b>606</b> that is joining moveable structure <b>616</b> to rigid structure <b>618</b> is small, moveable structure <b>616</b> is able to flex more (e.g., by compression and elasticity) in a plane parallel to the face of thread hole <b>612</b>. Finally, moveable structure <b>616</b> also provides dampening and gradual recovery characteristics in directions <b>624</b> in between arrows <b>620</b> and <b>622</b> by combinations of bending, compressing, stretching, and twisting along flex line <b>614</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00060"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-10</figref> illustrate a lacrosse head <b>700</b> having apertures <b>702</b> around scoop thread holes <b>704</b>, sidewall thread holes <b>800</b>, and ball stop thread holes <b>900</b>. In this example, each aperture <b>702</b> has a curved shape that circles a majority of the perimeter of thread holes <b>704</b>, <b>800</b>, and <b>900</b>. Each aperture <b>702</b> therefore provides a flex line, a moveable structure, and a rigid frame structure, as described above. In suspending the pocket webbing from thread holes <b>704</b>, <b>800</b>, and <b>900</b>, the moveable structures provide dampening and gradual recovery characteristics in multiple directions, as described above. The moveable structures flex from the pull of strings under tension, as occurs, for example, when a ball impacts the pocket of the lacrosse head and stretches the pocket in the direction in which the ball is traveling. The moveable structures recover gradually to their original positions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00061">In a further embodiment of the present invention, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-10</figref> also demonstrate the different ways in which apertures around adjacent thread holes can be configured. For instance, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows all apertures <b>702</b> of a scoop circling thread holes <b>704</b> in a clockwise direction. However, as one of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate, apertures <b>704</b> could be configured in a counterclockwise direction. Moreover, adjacent apertures <b>704</b> could be configured in alternating directions, such that a first aperture is in a clockwise direction and a second aperture adjacent to the first is in a counterclockwise direction. Essentially, pairs and groups of apertures <b>704</b> could be arranged in any number of clockwise and counterclockwise arrangements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00062"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows two examples for arranging pairs of apertures <b>702</b>. In a first pair <b>802</b> of adjacent apertures <b>702</b>, both apertures circle thread holes <b>800</b> in a counterclockwise direction. In a second pair <b>804</b> of adjacent apertures <b>702</b>, one aperture circles its thread hole <b>800</b> in a clockwise direction, while the second adjacent aperture circles its thread hole <b>800</b> in a counterclockwise direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00063"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> show two adjacent apertures <b>702</b> around ball stop thread holes <b>900</b>. Looking from the back of the ball stop, one aperture circles its thread hole <b>900</b> in a counterclockwise direction, while the second adjacent aperture circles its thread hole <b>900</b> in clockwise direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00064">The various ways in which to configure the directions of adjacent apertures each provide a different degree of flex. In addition to the configuration, the proximity of adjacent apertures also greatly affects the degree of flex. As an example, the widely spaced apertures <b>702</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>9</b>, and <b>10</b> have little effect on each other. In other words, the moveable structure created by each aperture moves in substantially the same manner, relative to the rigid frame structure. In contrast, the closely positioned, opposing-direction apertures of aperture pair <b>804</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> tend to create another flex line <b>806</b>, in addition to flex lines <b>808</b> and <b>810</b>. Thus, in this case, the proximity of the apertures <b>702</b> provides a further degree of flex for both moveable portions <b>812</b> and <b>814</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00065">As another example, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> the closely positioned, same-direction apertures of aperture pair <b>802</b> create an added flex similar to that of pair <b>804</b>, but this time only for one of the moveable structures (moveable structure <b>816</b>). As shown, the proximity of the apertures of pair <b>802</b> provides an additional flex line <b>818</b> for moveable structure <b>816</b>. Thus, moveable structure <b>816</b> flexes along lines <b>818</b> and <b>820</b>. The other moveable portion <b>821</b> is unaffected by the proximity, flexing only along flex line <b>822</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00066"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates another embodiment of the present invention in which two apertures <b>1100</b> are positioned around a thread hole <b>1102</b> on a lacrosse head frame <b>1104</b>. On a line connecting apertures <b>1100</b>, this embodiment creates a flex line <b>1106</b>. On the side of the flex line containing thread hole <b>1102</b>, the two apertures <b>1100</b> create a moveable structure <b>1108</b>, which moves relative to the remaining rigid frame structure <b>1110</b> of frame <b>1104</b>. Thus, moveable structure <b>1108</b> is able to flex or “give” along flex line <b>1106</b> relative to the rigid frame structure <b>1110</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00067">In the configuration of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, by bending along flex line <b>1106</b>, moveable structure <b>1108</b> provides dampening and gradual recovery characteristics in a direction <b>1112</b>, which is generally perpendicular to the face of thread hole <b>1102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00068">Moveable structure <b>1108</b> can also provide dampening and gradual recovery characteristics in a plane <b>1114</b> generally parallel to the face of thread hole <b>1102</b>, depending on the direction in which a thread is pulling thread hole <b>1102</b>. For example, a thread pulling in direction <b>1118</b> would tend to compress the material of frame <b>1104</b> at locations along flex line <b>1106</b> near point <b>1120</b>, and would tend to stretch the material of frame <b>1104</b> at locations along flex line <b>1106</b> near point <b>1122</b>. As a result, moveable structure <b>1108</b> would flex within plane <b>1114</b> in the direction of arrow <b>1118</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00069">Movement in plane <b>1114</b> can also be provided by adjusting the material properties (e.g., thinned, perforated, or scored material) along flex line <b>1106</b> to create different elasticity and compression characteristics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00070">Moveable structure <b>1108</b> can also provide dampening and gradual recovery characteristics in directions <b>1116</b> in between directions <b>1112</b> and <b>1114</b> through combinations of the bending, compressing, and stretching described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00071">In another embodiment of the present invention, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates an aperture <b>1200</b> that is interior to a lacrosse head frame <b>1202</b>. In other words, aperture <b>1200</b> does not reach or open to an edge of lacrosse head frame <b>1202</b>, as do the apertures shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-11</figref>. In this embodiment, aperture <b>1200</b> surrounds a majority of the perimeter of a thread hole <b>1204</b>, in a shape akin to three sides of a square. This configuration creates a flex line <b>1206</b>, which separates lacrosse head frame <b>1202</b> into a moveable structure <b>1208</b> and a rigid frame structure <b>1210</b>. When pulled by pocket webbing <b>1212</b> (which, in this example, is a thong) in a direction generally perpendicular to the face of thread hole <b>1204</b>, moveable structure <b>1208</b> flexes along flex line <b>1206</b> and relative to rigid frame structure <b>1210</b> to provide the dampening of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00072"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates another example of an interior aperture <b>1300</b>. In comparison to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, aperture <b>1300</b> provides a shorter flex line <b>1302</b> because aperture <b>1300</b> surrounds more of the perimeter of thread hole <b>1304</b>, than does aperture <b>1200</b> surround thread hole <b>1204</b>. The shorter flex line <b>1302</b> enables moveable structure <b>1306</b> to flex more easily in response to a pocket webbing <b>1308</b> (which, in this example, is a thong) pulling in a direction generally perpendicular to the face of thread hole <b>1304</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00073"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates an alternate orientation for an interior aperture <b>1400</b>, and the corresponding way in which a pocket webbing <b>1402</b> is attached. As shown, aperture <b>1400</b> surrounds a majority of the perimeter of thread hole <b>1404</b> and creates a flex line <b>1406</b> on a side of thread hole <b>1404</b> opposite the pocket of the lacrosse head frame <b>1408</b>. Moveable structure <b>1410</b> flexes in response to a pull from pocket webbing <b>1402</b> in a direction generally perpendicular to the face of thread hole <b>1404</b>. In addition, depending on the direction in which webbing <b>1402</b> pulls, the configuration of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> provides the same dampening and gradual recovery characteristics discussed with reference to FIG. <b>11</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00074">As one of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate, an interior aperture could be oriented in any number of ways to make the moveable structure flex along a particular flex line. As another example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows an aperture <b>1500</b> that creates a flex line <b>1502</b> that is roughly perpendicular to the edge <b>1504</b> of a lacrosse head frame <b>1506</b>. As another example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows an aperture <b>1600</b> that creates a flex line <b>1602</b> that is at an angle (e.g., a 45 degree angle) to the edge <b>1604</b> of a lacrosse head frame <b>1606</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00075"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates another embodiment of the present invention, which includes a spiral aperture <b>1700</b> and a thread hole <b>1702</b> having a webbing bar <b>1704</b>. Spiral aperture <b>1700</b> surrounds all of thread hole <b>1702</b>, creating an interior spiral moveable structure <b>1706</b> that flexes at flex line <b>1708</b> relative to the remaining rigid frame structure <b>1710</b> of lacrosse head frame <b>1712</b>. Moveable structure <b>1706</b> also flexes along its length by the twisting or bending of the material from which moveable structure <b>1700</b> is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00076">Although <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows spiral aperture <b>1700</b> wrapping around thread hole <b>1702</b> approximately 1½ times, spiral aperture <b>1700</b> could wrap one or more times around thread hole <b>1702</b>, depending on the desired dampening effect. The more times that spiral aperture <b>1700</b> circles thread hole <b>1702</b>, the more that moveable structure <b>1706</b> is able to flex and dampen the pull of pocket webbing <b>1714</b>. Webbing bar <b>1704</b> of thread hole <b>1702</b> provides a member around which pocket webbing <b>1714</b> can be strapped so that it does not interfere with the movement of moveable structure <b>1706</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00077"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A-18D</figref> illustrate an alternative embodiment of the present invention in which a moveable portion <b>1800</b> is specially shaped to provide additional dampening deflection. Specifically, moveable portion <b>1800</b> is curved in its original, non-flexed position. Then, when a force is applied to moveable structure <b>1800</b>, the curved portion <b>1804</b> of moveable structure <b>1800</b> deflects and straightens. This alternative embodiment could be applied to any of the embodiments described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00078"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref> shows moveable portion <b>1800</b> in the scoop of a lacrosse head frame <b>1802</b>. Moveable portion <b>1800</b> has a thread hole <b>1808</b> and is configured similarly to the structure shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-10</figref>, but includes a curved portion <b>1804</b> at the inside edge of the scoop.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00079"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18B and 18C</figref> illustrate a cross-section of moveable structure <b>1800</b> along section A—A of FIG. <b>18</b>A. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref> shows moveable structure <b>1800</b> in its original, non-flexed position, with a thong <b>1806</b> threaded through thread hole <b>1808</b> and over curved portion <b>1804</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C</figref> shows moveable structure <b>1800</b> in a deflected position, with curved portion <b>1804</b> at least partially straightened out by thong <b>1806</b> pulling in direction <b>1810</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00080">As another embodiment, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18D</figref> shows a curved portion <b>1804</b> applied to a moveable structure <b>1800</b> having two apertures <b>1810</b> and <b>1812</b>. In this example, moveable portion <b>1804</b> is configured similarly to the structure shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, but includes a curved portion <b>1804</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00081">As illustrated in the example configurations of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A-18D</figref>, a moveable structure with a deflectable shape (e.g., curved) provides dampening and gradual recovery characteristics beyond those derived from one or more apertures (e.g., in bending, twisting, compressing, or stretching along flex line <b>1814</b>). Deflecting the shape of the moveable structure provides additional dampening against the pull of a pocket thread. In addition, in gradually returning to its original deflectable shape, the moveable structure helps avoid pocket rebound and ejection of a ball.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00082">As discussed above, the present invention provides a beneficial pocket dampening when applied to one or more of the sidewalls, scoop, and stop portions of a lacrosse head. This benefit is particularly useful for a lacrosse head that is made of just one substantially rigid material (e.g., ST-801 nylon manufactured by DuPont), as has been the convention since double-wall synthetic heads were first introduced around 1970. Using apertures that create moveable structures within a lacrosse head frame, the present invention provides a desirable pocket dampening on a frame made of substantially rigid material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00083">Although the present invention works with a lacrosse head made of a single material, lacrosse heads of the present invention can be made of more than one material to enhance the benefits of the invention. As an example, in any of the above-described embodiments, the rigid frame structure could be made of any of the well-known lacrosse head materials (such as nylon or polycarbonate), while the moveable structure could be made of a different, more pliable material, such as an elastomer. In this manner, the moveable structure would not only flex along the flex line created by the aperture, but would itself bend, twist, stretch, etc. (more so than a moveable structure made of the first substantially rigid material) and further absorb energy introduced by the moving ball and pocket.</div>
