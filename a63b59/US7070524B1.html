<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">The present invention is directed toward a hockey stick and more particularly, toward a weighted hockey stick that may be used by a player to strengthen and exercise various muscles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">Strong wrist muscles, arm muscles, and other muscles used in handling and shooting with a hockey stick are important to a hockey player. Hockey sticks that have weights supported thereon are used during practice sessions in order to strengthen various muscles as well as to improve the player's coordination, timing, and rhythm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Prior patents have addressed this concern and provide for various weighted hockey sticks. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,461,479 to Mitchell discloses a hockey stick with a handle where a weighted insert may be inserted in the handle in order to improve the player's swing. U.S. Pat. No. 6,186,904 to Bass discloses a weighted sport training assembly used to exercise various muscles where the assembly may be used on a hockey stick. The assembly includes a plurality of weights that may be added to the stick. U.S. Pat. No. 6,328,666 to Manory discloses an adjustable hockey stick weight that may be added to the stick wherever the player chooses to use it. U.S. Pat. No. 4,364,560 to Gemmel discloses a U-shaped weight that may be secured anywhere along the length of a hockey stick.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">None of these prior patents, however, allows for a plurality of weights to be placed at and secured to various positions along the length of a hockey stick so that several areas of muscles may be exercised simultaneously. Also, none of the prior patents discloses a plurality of weights that may be positioned within the shaft of a practice hockey stick so that the weights are unobtrusive and so that the stick resembles an actual hockey stick that is used during the play of a game. Furthermore, the prior art practice hockey sticks do not provide sufficient flexibility of the stick so as to minimize injury to a player.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">The present invention is designed to overcome the deficiencies of the prior art discussed above. It is an object of the present invention to provide a hockey stick that is weighted and may be used during practice sessions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">It is another object of the present invention to provide a hockey stick that may be used by a player to strengthen and exercise various muscles simultaneously.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">It is another object of the present invention to provide a weighted practice hockey stick that allows the number and type of weight to be used to be changed easily, as desired by the player.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a practice hockey stick that adds a plurality of weights to the stick in an unobtrusive manner so as to simulate an actual hockey stick.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">In accordance with the illustrative embodiments demonstrating features and advantages of the present invention, there is provided a weighted hockey stick that includes an elongated hollow shaft with a bottom end and a top end, at least one weight with apertures formed therethrough, means for releasably supporting the weight thereon, the supporting means adapted to be inserted within the hollow shaft and extend therethrough, and means for securing the supporting means to the shaft. Secured to the bottom end of the shaft is a blade. The supporting means may include an elongated metal rod with a top end, a bottom end, apertures formed along the length thereof, and screws that may be inserted through the apertures of the support and the weight. The top end of the shaft is enclosed by an end piece that fits within the top end of the shaft. The securing means may include a screw that is inserted through the metal rod and the end piece and secured thereto.

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">Referring now to the drawings in detail wherein like reference numerals have been used throughout the various figures to designate like elements, there is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> a weighted hockey stick constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention and designated generally as <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">The hockey stick of the present invention essentially includes an elongated hollow shaft <b>12</b> with a bottom end <b>14</b> and a top end <b>16</b>. Located within the hollow shaft <b>12</b> is at least one weight comprised of two sections <b>18</b> <i>a </i>and <b>18</b> <i>b </i>with apertures <b>20</b> <i>a–</i> <b>20</b> <i>d </i>formed therethrough releasably secured to an elongated supporting member <b>22</b>. As can be seen, the weights <b>18</b> <i>a</i>, <b>18</b> <i>b </i>and the supporting member <b>22</b> are adapted to be inserted within the hollow shaft <b>12</b> and extend the length of the shaft <b>12</b>. As more fully explained hereinafter, means are provided for securing the supporting member to the shaft <b>12</b>. The bottom end <b>14</b> of the shaft <b>12</b> has a blade <b>24</b> secured thereto, as typically found in hockey sticks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">The top end <b>16</b> of the shaft <b>12</b> is enclosed by an end piece <b>26</b> that is inserted into the top end <b>16</b> of the shaft <b>12</b> and fits therein. The end piece <b>26</b> includes a top half <b>26</b> <i>a </i>and a bottom half <b>26</b> <i>b</i>. The top half <b>26</b> <i>a </i>lies flush with the outer surface <b>28</b> of the shaft <b>12</b> when it is inserted within the shaft <b>12</b>. (See <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.) The bottom half <b>26</b> <i>b </i>of the end piece <b>26</b> is smaller than the top half <b>26</b> <i>a </i>and fits within the top end <b>16</b> of the shaft <b>12</b>. (See <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.) In this manner, the outer surface <b>30</b> of the bottom half <b>26</b> <i>b </i>engages the inner surface <b>32</b> of the shaft <b>12</b> and is secured therein. Optionally, fastening means, such as a set screw or the like passing through the wall of the shaft and into the bottom half <b>26</b> <i>b </i>of the end piece may be used to secure the end piece to the shaft of the stick.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">The supporting means <b>22</b> may include an elongated, generally rectangular metal rod <b>34</b> with a generally flat horizontal top end <b>36</b>, a bottom end <b>38</b>, apertures <b>40</b> <i>a–</i> <b>40</b> <i>f</i>, for example, formed along the length thereof, and screws <b>42</b> <i>a–</i> <b>42</b> <i>f</i>, for example, that may be inserted through the apertures of the rod <b>34</b> and the weight in order to secure the weights <b>18</b> <i>a</i>, <b>18</b> <i>b</i>, <b>46</b> <i>a</i>, <b>46</b> <i>b</i>, <b>48</b> <i>a</i>, <b>48</b> <i>b</i>, <b>50</b> <i>a</i>, <b>50</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, <b>52</b> <i>b</i>, for example, to the rod <b>34</b>. (See <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>.) The weight surrounds the rod so that a first section of the weight is attached to one side of the rod and a second section is attached to the opposite side of the rod. The two sections of the weight are directly opposite to each other. The number, weight and position of the weights supported on the elongated metal rod <b>34</b> may be varied. The weights are generally rectangularly shaped metal plates of varying weight. Alternatively, the weights may be attached to the rod via similar types of fasteners known in the art that allow the weights to be easily attached to and removed from the rod. These may include, for example, pins extending from the rod that fit within openings in the weights or vice versa. Alternatively, spring clips or numerous other types of fasteners may be utilized. The only requirement being that any number of weights may be utilized and their position along the length of the rod <b>34</b> must be easily adjustable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">The securing means for securing the rod <b>34</b> to the shaft <b>12</b> may include a screw <b>44</b> or similar type of fastening means that is inserted through the top end <b>36</b> of the metal rod <b>34</b> and the end piece <b>26</b> and secured thereto. (See <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">In order to use the practice hockey stick of the present invention, upward force is applied to the end piece <b>26</b> so that the end piece <b>26</b> is disengaged from the shaft <b>12</b>. The rod <b>34</b> may now be pulled out or removed from the shaft <b>12</b>. Weights <b>18</b> <i>a</i>, <b>18</b> <i>b</i>, <b>46</b> <i>a</i>, <b>46</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>52</b> <i>a</i>, <b>52</b> <i>b </i>for example, can be attached to the rod <b>34</b> by inserting screws, shown for example as <b>42</b> <i>a–</i> <b>42</b> <i>f</i>, through the apertures of the weight and rod. (See <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>.) Any number of weights may be attached to the rod at various locations, depending upon the user's preference. The rod <b>34</b> is then placed back into the shaft <b>12</b> of the stick. (See <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.) The rod <b>34</b> remains in place within the shaft <b>12</b> since the end piece <b>26</b> to which the rod <b>34</b> is secured fits into the top end <b>16</b> of the shaft <b>12</b> as described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">The metal rod may be made from aluminum or similar types of lightweight metal that allows for flexibility of the hockey stick. While metal is preferred, it may also be possible to make the rod <b>34</b> from other strong materials such as fiberglass or the like. Gaps between the weights, when they are secured to the metal rod, also allows for flexibility. (See <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.) The weights may be made from steel, aluminum, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential attributes thereof and accordingly, reference should be made to the appended claims rather than to the foregoing specification as indicating the scope of the invention.</div>
