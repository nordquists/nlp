<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for repairing a broken hockey stick. More specifically, the present invention relates to a repair member adapted to attach and retain a first shaft portion, a first hockey stick shaft portion and a second hockey stick shaft portion in an aligned relation so as to define a repaired hockey stick shaft.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Over the years, advancements in material technology have lead to increased sophistication in the manufacturing and performance of hockey sticks. Traditionally, hockey sticks were manufactured primarily of wood with a fiberglass covering on the blade portion. The wood stick comprised a solid shaft either machined of a single piece of wood or by sandwiching multiple layers of wood together. These solid shafts were typically very durable but suffered somewhat from increased weight as well as limited flexibility.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Through the use of advanced material technologies, modern hockey sticks are often manufactured of a wide variety of materials. In addition to the aforementioned wood and fiberglass, newer materials including lightweight metals, such as aluminum, and high performance polymers and composite materials such as, for example Kevlar®, graphite, ABS, carbon fiber and ceramics are being used either individually or in combination. Using these new materials, stick suppliers such as Hillerich &amp; Bradsby, CCM, Christian Brothers, Cooper, Mission, Hespeller and Bauer/Nike have been able to alter hockey stick performance to alter and tune stick characteristics such as weight and stick flex.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">One way in which these new materials have affected stick construction is through the development of hockey sticks having hollow shafts. These sticks can be manufactured of any of the aforementioned materials and can be either one-piece designs, such as the Easton Synergy™, Louisville Response™, or Mission M1™ models, or they can include removable/replaceable blades and shaft extensions to vary the overall stick length. Representative hollow shaft designs include U.S. Pat. No. 3,934,875 to Easton et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 4,086,115 to Sweet, Jr. et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 4,361,325 to Jansen; U.S. Pat. No. 5,303,916 to Rodger; U.S. Pat. No. 5,419,553 to Rodgors; U.S. Pat. No. 5,447,306 to Selden; U.S. Pat. No. 5,496,027 to Christian et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,549,947 to Quigley et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,628,509 to Christian; U.S. Pat. No. 5,636,836 to Carroll et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,695,416 to Christian; U.S. Pat. No. 5,746,955 to Calapp et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 6,117,029 to Kunisaki et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 6,206,793 to Burger; U.S. Pat. No. 6,224,505 to Burger; U.S. Pat. No. 6,241,633 to Conroy; U.S. Pat. No. 6,267,697 to Sulenta; as well as U.S. Design Pat. Nos. 404,449 to Burger; 430,249 to Burger; 431,273 to Burger; and 458,329 to Clark, Jr. et al. and U.S. Patent Application Publications Nos. 2002/0065154A1 to Goldsmith et al.; and 2003/0119612A1; all of these patents, design patents and patent applications being hereby incorporated by reference to the extent not inconsistent with the present disclosure. With the development of these technologically advanced hockey sticks, suppliers have been able to charge a premium when selling these high performance hockey sticks to the public.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">One drawback to the new shaft designs is that with a hollow shaft, the user has an increased potential to break the stick in the shaft as opposed to more traditional blade breakages. As the new shaft and stick designs often have a significant replacement cost associated with them, this can lead to significant warranty and service issues for suppliers was well as frustration on the part of consumers.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">In one aspect, the present invention comprises a repair member for use in repairing hollow shafted hockey sticks. In one presently preferred embodiment, a shaft repair insert can quickly and safely repair a broken, hollow-shafted hockey stick so as to restore the hockey stick to its prior condition such as, for example, similar performance, appearance and overall usability. The shaft repair insert of the present invention allows suppliers to provide users with a repair option allowing them to substantially decrease and eliminate warranty replacement costs as well as negative perceptions associated with the breakage of expensive hockey sticks.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0083">As depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a hockey stick <b>100</b> is comprised of a shaft <b>102</b>, a blade <b>104</b> and a gripping end <b>106</b>. Hockey stick <b>100</b> can be manufactured from a variety of materials including wood, aluminum, titanium, fiberglass, Kevlar®, carbon-fiber, graphite, ABS, ceramics and other composite fibers and materials, either woven or non-woven, and either individually or in any combination thereof. As depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, shaft <b>102</b> can comprise a pair of elongated sides <b>108</b> <i>a</i>, <b>108</b> <i>b </i>and a pair of shortened sides <b>110</b> <i>a</i>, <b>110</b> <i>b </i>defining a hollow shaft interior <b>111</b>. Each of the various sides is defined by a shaft wall <b>112</b> having a shaft wall thickness <b>114</b>. Depending upon desired performance characteristics such as stick flex, stick weight and the like, shaft <b>102</b> can have varying profiles within a single shaft by varying dimensions such as, for example, varying dimensions for the elongated sides <b>108</b> <i>a</i>, <b>108</b> <i>b</i>, shortened sides <b>110</b> <i>a</i>, <b>110</b> and wall thickness <b>114</b> through the shaft <b>102</b>. Shaft <b>102</b> can be manufactured to include the hollow shaft interior <b>111</b> for a variety of reasons such as, for example, reducing overall stick weight and/or varying the puck handling or shooting characteristics of the hockey stick <b>100</b>. Shaft <b>102</b> can be manufactured in a variety of sizes such as, for example, adult sizes, intermediate sizes, junior sizes and youth sizes. While the use of shafts <b>102</b> having hollow shaft interiors <b>111</b> can be advantageous, there are certain disadvantages as compared to the more traditional solid shafted hockey stick.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0084">One disadvantage of a shaft <b>102</b> that includes a hollow shaft interior <b>111</b> is that shaft <b>102</b> is subject to breaking along the length of shaft <b>102</b> as opposed to the more traditional breaking at the blade <b>104</b>. As depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>, hockey stick <b>100</b> has been broken as indicated at fracture <b>116</b> on shaft <b>102</b>. Fracture <b>116</b> results in the formation of a top shaft portion <b>118</b> <i>a </i>and a bottom shaft portion <b>118</b> <i>b</i>. At fracture <b>116</b>, top shaft portion <b>118</b> <i>a </i>includes a top fracture surface <b>120</b> <i>a </i>while bottom shaft portion <b>118</b> <i>b </i>includes a bottom fracture surface <b>120</b> <i>b</i>. The fracture surfaces <b>120</b> <i>a</i>, <b>120</b> <i>b </i>can be smooth, rough, jagged and/or uneven.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0112">The present invention can also comprise a hollow shaft extension <b>600</b> as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32 and 33</figref>. A hockey stick <b>601</b> is depicted as comprising a hollow shaft <b>602</b> and a hollow shaft extension <b>600</b>. Hockey stick <b>601</b> is depicted as in one-piece composition configuration though it could further comprise a shaft and blade assembly such as previous discussed with reference to hockey stick <b>402</b>. Hollow shaft extension <b>600</b> can resemble blade receiving insert <b>400</b> and can comprise a gripping portion <b>604</b> and an insertion portion <b>605</b>. Gripping portion <b>604</b> could have an exterior surface, for example, a rubberized, roughened or shaped surface to enhance grip. Hollow shaft extension <b>600</b> is further defined by an insertion end <b>606</b> and a gripping end <b>608</b>. Insertion portion <b>604</b> comprises a pair of elongated sides <b>610</b> <i>a</i>, <b>610</b> <i>b </i>and a pair of shortened sides <b>612</b> <i>a</i>, <b>612</b> <i>b</i>. Gripping portion <b>604</b> comprises a pair of elongated sides <b>614</b> <i>a</i>, <b>614</b> <i>b </i>and a pair of shortened sides <b>616</b> <i>a</i>, <b>616</b> <i>b</i>. As depicted, gripping portion <b>604</b> and insertion portion <b>605</b> have rectangular cross-sections. Alternatively, gripping portion <b>604</b> and insertion portion <b>605</b> can have cross-sections resembling other forms typically used with hockey shafts such as ovals, or other alternative geometric configurations and combinations thereof. Gripping portion <b>604</b> and insertion portion <b>605</b> can further comprise cross-sectional arrangements that differ from one another. Hollow shaft extension <b>600</b> can have a hollow interior <b>618</b> extending continuously from the insertion end <b>606</b> to the gripping end <b>608</b>. Alternatively, gripping end <b>608</b> can include a detachable cap or a permanent end surface. In another alternative embodiment, hollow shaft extension <b>600</b> can be solid or only partially hollow such as, for example, a solid insertion portion <b>605</b> and a hollow gripping portion <b>604</b>. Gripping portion <b>604</b> and insertion portion <b>605</b> cooperatively define an abutment flange <b>620</b>. Shaft extension <b>600</b> can be fabricated such that gripping portion <b>604</b> has an extension length <b>621</b>. Extension length <b>621</b> can be any suitable length, such as, for example from one inch in length all the way up to several feet in length. Shaft extension <b>600</b> can be provided having a longer extension length than might be anticipated so as to allow a user to tailor, for example by cutting the gripping portion <b>604</b>, the shaft extension <b>600</b> to the desired length. Hollow shaft extension <b>600</b> can be constructed of any lightweight material compatible with hollow shaft <b>602</b>, for example wood, aluminum, titanium, fiberglass, Kevlar®, a rigid polymer, carbon-fiber, graphite, ABS, ceramics and other composite fibers and materials, either woven or non-woven, and either individually or in any combination thereof.

Hollow shift extension <b>600</b> can also be incorporated with hollow shaft <b>602</b> to tailor stick performance such flex, grip, size and shape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0113">Hollow shaft extension <b>600</b> can be used to properly adjust the overall stick length for a player. For example, hollow shaft extension <b>600</b> can be used when hollow shaft <b>602</b> suffers a fracture requiring the use of an embodiment of a repair insert as previously described in the present application. Often, the repair will require cutting away a portion of the hollow shaft <b>602</b> to create suitable repair surfaces. Through the use of hollow shaft extension <b>600</b> having the correct extension length <b>621</b>, the stick <b>601</b> can be restored to its original length while maintaining similar performance characteristics as that of the original stick <b>601</b>. Hollow shaft extension <b>600</b> can also be used to adjust stick length based on growth of the individual, especially for younger players who may experience growth during a single season, such that the useful life of a hollow shaft <b>602</b> is extended.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0114">In use, hollow shaft extension <b>600</b> is positioned such that the insertion end <b>606</b> is proximate the hollow shaft <b>602</b>. An adhesive such as, for example, chemically or heat activated adhesives, one-part or multi-part adhesives, glues, hot melt, urethanes, polyurethanes, epoxies, acrylics and the like can be applied or activated on insertion portion <b>605</b> to secure the hollow shaft extension <b>600</b> to the hollow shaft <b>602</b>. In the case of a heat activated adhesive, a heat source, for example a hairdryer, is used to activate the adhesive. Once the adhesive is applied or activated, the insertion portion <b>605</b> is slidingly inserted into the hollow shaft <b>602</b> such that the abutment flange <b>620</b> is in contact with the hollow shaft <b>602</b>. Insertion portion <b>605</b> is selected to have an almost identical, albeit slightly smaller, cross-section as hollow shaft <b>602</b> such that the insertion of insertion portion <b>605</b> results in a snug fit. Once the adhesive cures, hollow shaft extension <b>600</b> is attached to hollow shaft <b>602</b> to form an integral hockey stick <b>601</b>. Alternatively, insertion portion <b>605</b> can include various attachment means such as O-rings, barbs, friction enhancers or other surface treatments to promote the coupling of hollow shaft extension <b>600</b> with the hollow shaft <b>602</b>.</div>

A suitable flowable adhesive, such as for example, a two-part epoxy, is directed into the top shaft portion <b>810</b> <i>a </i>so as to fill the open volume of the shaft surrounding the body member <b>802</b>. Other suitable adhesives can comprise chemically or heat activated adhesives, one-part or multi-part adhesives, glues, hot melt, urethanes, polyurethanes, epoxies, acrylics and the like. Top shaft portion <b>810</b> <i>a </i>should be oriented in a substantially vertical disposition so as to avoid spilling the flowable adhesive. Top plug <b>808</b> <i>a </i>acts essentially as a dam so as to substantially prevent the flowable adhesive from passing beyond the top plug <b>808</b> <i>a </i>and down into the remaining portion of the top shaft portion <b>810</b> <i>a</i>. Next, the bottom shaft portion <b>810</b> <i>b </i>is placed above the top shaft portion <b>810</b> <i>a </i>and is directed into a vertically abutted and aligned relation with the top shaft portion <b>810</b> <i>a</i>. While holding the bottom shaft portion <b>810</b> <i>b </i>and top shaft portion <b>810</b> <i>a </i>in aligned relation, the shaft portions <b>810</b> <i>a</i>, <b>810</b> are quickly rotated so as to be in an opposed vertical disposition with the bottom shaft portion <b>810</b> <i>b </i>below the top shaft portion <b>810</b> <i>a</i>. This causes the body member <b>802</b> and flowable adhesive to fall into the bottom shaft portion <b>810</b> <i>a </i>wherein the body member <b>802</b> and flowable adhesive is retained by the bottom plug <b>808</b> <i>b</i>. Because of the positioning of bottom plug <b>808</b> <i>b</i>, approximately half of the body member <b>802</b> and half of the flowable adhesive is located on each side of the interface between the top shaft portion <b>810</b> <i>a </i>and bottom shaft portion <b>810</b> <i>b</i>. In a preferred embodiment, the flowable adhesive begins to cure or set-up within a matter of minutes. Generally, the flowable adhesive conforms to the interior surfaces of the top shaft portion <b>810</b> <i>a </i>and bottom shaft portion <b>810</b> <i>b</i>. As the flowable adhesive can conform to differing hockey shaft shapes, small cross-sectioned, irregular and loose fitting shaft repair inserts <b>800</b> such as, for example, loose fitting versions of shaft repair insert <b>200</b>, can be used to repair a variety of dimensionally and geometrically different hockey sticks. In some embodiments, shaft repair insert can comprise a plurality of body members <b>802</b>. In some embodiments, the flowable adhesive can comprise an expanding material such as, for example, expanding materials commonly used in the packaging and shipment of goods.</div>
