<heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">The present application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/278,532, filed Mar. 23, 2003 entitled “Five Hole Mesh For Lacrosse Head”, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.</div>
<heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates generally to lacrosse sticks, and more particularly to mesh pockets for heads of lacrosse sticks.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Current lacrosse sticks have heads with one of two known conventional pockets. First, traditional pockets typically consist of four adjustable leather thongs that extend between the lacrosse scoop and the base of the head. Soft fabric laces, i.e. nylon laces, are interwoven with the thongs to form the pocket for holding the ball in the head. The laces are held in place by sidewall strings attached to the opposing sidewalls. The stiffness of the leather thongs provides for precise ball control in high velocity throwing and shooting.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Disadvantages of the traditional pockets include the extensive maintenance required of the pocket, the damage to the pocket when the leather thongs are exposed to moisture, and poor ball control while running. Repeated use of the pocket stretches the leather thongs so as to change the shape of the pocket and the performance thereof. The user must adjust the leather thongs to maintain the desired shape of the pocket and its associated performance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Furthermore, the leather thongs stretch and shrink unevenly when they dry after being exposed to moisture, as typically is the case when lacrosse games are held in the rain. The resulting uneven shrinkage requires further adjustment of the thongs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Mesh strung pockets are also known. The mesh pockets are typically formed of a soft fabric material and are comprised of a single unit that attaches to the lacrosse head. Current mesh pockets are configured such that they have ten holes across, sometimes referred to as ten hole mesh. Mesh pockets are looser than traditional pockets thereby providing greater ball control while running. Another benefit of this mesh pocket is that it does not require the extensive maintenance that traditional pockets require. Also, mesh pockets are relatively inexpensive.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">However, the looser netting and smaller holes therein produce comparably poor throwing and shooting results. In particular, the flexible pocket does not have the required stiffness for providing accurate, high velocity throwing and shooting. In addition, the holes in current mesh pockets are so small that no portion of the ball is cupped within any hole. In this regard, the ball merely rests on a top surface of the mesh pocket. This results in less friction between the ball and the pocket thereby reducing ball control.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">Therefore, it would be desirable to provide a lacrosse pocket that provides for accurate, high velocity throwing and shooting, affords sufficient ball control while running, requires minimal maintenance, and is inexpensive.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">The present invention provides a pocket for a lacrosse head. The pocket includes a mesh portion disposed between a pair of opposing sidewalls of the lacrosse head. The mesh portion has a plurality of holes therein and preferably has less than nine holes disposed within a horizontal row between the pair of opposing sidewalls.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">One advantage of the present invention is that the mesh pocket provides the stiffness required for accurate, high velocity throwing and shooting.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">Yet another advantage of the present invention is that minimal maintenance is required to keep the mesh pocket in its desired shape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">Still yet another advantage of the present invention is that material and assembly costs are inexpensive.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">Other advantages of the present invention will become apparent when viewed in light of the detailed description of the preferred embodiment when taken in conjunction with the attached drawings and appended claims.</div>

<heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">In the following figures, the same reference numerals are used to identify the same components in the various views.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, there are shown front and side views, respectively, of a lacrosse head <b>10</b> with a mesh pocket according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The lacrosse head <b>10</b> includes a pair of opposing sidewall portions <b>12</b> connected to each other at their top ends by a scoop portion <b>14</b> and at their bottom ends by a base portion <b>16</b> of the lacrosse head <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">Preferably, sidewall stringing <b>18</b> is laced through a series of apertures within all the portions <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> of the lacrosse head <b>10</b>. These portions generally comprise an integral frame. The sidewall stringing <b>18</b> is interwoven with a mesh portion <b>20</b> so as to secure the mesh portion <b>20</b> to the lacrosse head <b>10</b>. Alternatively, the mesh portion <b>20</b> may be secured to the lacrosse head <b>10</b> by directly stringing it through the series of apertures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">The preferred embodiment further requires that the mesh portion <b>20</b> is a soft fabric material with a plurality of holes <b>22</b> therein. The mesh portion <b>20</b> is preferably composed of a synthetic material. Examples of the synthetic material include nylon and polyester.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">Furthermore, the mesh portion <b>20</b> is preferably treated with a stiffening agent, i.e. polyurethane, for hardening the mesh and providing resistance to moisture absorption. By hardening the mesh portion <b>20</b>, the stiffening agent prevents deformation of the pocket thereby allowing the pocket to retain a more uniform shape. In this regard, a well formed pocket treated with the stiffening agent may consistently provide for desirable performance without the need for maintaining the mesh. Furthermore, the increased hardness of the mesh portion <b>20</b> allows for quick release, as well as accurate throwing and shooting with significant speed, i.e. whip.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">The stiffening agent water-proofs the mesh portion <b>20</b> so as to prevent the mesh portion <b>20</b> from stretching or shrinking. In doing so, the stiffening agent preserves the shape of the pocket and its associated performance. Also, the resistance to moisture absorption prevents damage to the material composing the mesh portion <b>20</b>. Consequently, the strengthening agent increases the life of the mesh portion <b>20</b> and causes it to provide performance similar to traditional stringing without the expense associated with traditional pockets.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">The mesh portion <b>20</b> has less than nine holes <b>22</b> disposed within a horizontal row from one sidewall portion <b>12</b> to the opposing sidewall portion <b>12</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the mesh portion <b>20</b> includes three to six diamond-shaped holes <b>22</b>, which are disposed within a horizontal row. More preferably, the mesh portion <b>20</b> includes five diamond shaped holes <b>22</b> disposed within a horizontal row.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">In an alternative embodiment, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the mesh portion <b>20</b> is integrally formed within the lacrosse head <b>10</b> thereby dispensing with the need for the sidewall stringing <b>18</b>. In particular, the mesh portion <b>20</b> and the lacrosse head <b>10</b> are portions of a single injection molded item. Accordingly, the mesh portion <b>20</b> is composed of the same material, i.e. plastic, as the lacrosse head <b>10</b>. As a result, the mesh portion <b>20</b> is sufficiently rigid so as to keep a consistent pocket shape and to reduce maintenance thereof. Furthermore, the stiffness of the mesh portion <b>20</b> also allows for precise throwing and shooting.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">Turning now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the preferred embodiment requires that the holes <b>22</b> are sized sufficiently large for allowing the mesh portion <b>20</b> to cup portions <b>26</b> of a lacrosse ball <b>24</b> within the holes <b>22</b>. This type of engagement between the lacrosse ball <b>24</b> and the mesh portion <b>20</b> provides substantial friction between the lacrosse ball <b>24</b> and the mesh portion <b>20</b>. Consequently, the user has improved grip on the ball <b>24</b> for greater control in throwing and shooting. In an alternative embodiment, the integral plastic lacing may have a scuffed surface to provide better ball retention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">In an alternative embodiment, the mesh portion <b>20</b> may have less than three holes <b>22</b> in a horizontal row. By decreasing the number of holes <b>22</b> in a horizontal row, the size of each hole <b>22</b> will typically increase. The larger size of holes <b>22</b> may result in the tendency of the ball <b>24</b> to rock from one hole <b>22</b> to another hole <b>22</b> in the pocket. Such an engagement between the ball <b>24</b> and the mesh portion <b>20</b> decreases smoothness in handling and overall ball control.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">In yet another alternative embodiment, the mesh portion <b>20</b> may have seven to nine holes <b>22</b> disposed within a horizontal row. The increase in the number of holes <b>22</b> in a horizontal row will typically decrease the size of the holes <b>22</b>. As a result, smaller portions <b>26</b> of the ball <b>24</b> are cupped within the holes <b>22</b> thereby decreasing the amount of friction between the mesh portion <b>20</b> and the ball <b>24</b>. The reduction in friction may decrease accuracy in throwing and shooting the ball <b>24</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">While particular embodiments of the invention have been shown and described, numerous variations and alternate embodiments will occur to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, it is intended that the invention be limited only in terms of the appended claims.</div>
