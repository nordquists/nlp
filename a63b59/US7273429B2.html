<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">The present invention relates to a ball game device used particularly, but not exclusively, for teaching and learning general co-ordination for racket sports as a precursor to the use of a conventional handled racket.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The device can also be used as leisure equipment or as a toy, having a strong “fun” element. In addition, the device can be used as a physical education training aid (for example, in schools) or as a piece of games apparatus for the disabled or those in rehabilitation.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">For a young child to learn a racket sport, the first obstacle to overcome is that of general co-ordination. The acquisition of the skills required to experience a racket sport as a fulfilling activity requires the development of a high level of neuromuscular co-ordination. Holding a racket and making it connect with a ball to project it with the desired direction and speed is a complex skill which is difficult to learn, especially for a young child. A child learning to do this needs to learn in a way that is not too advanced, which could lead to frustration, and also in a way that will be stimulating so that the child does not get bored.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">At present, equipment for teaching children and allowing them to learn elementary co-ordination and racket skills includes miniature rackets, most commonly made of plastic and provided with soft sponge balls. These rackets feature short handles, which facilitate easier control of the ball than in an adult-size racket because the racket head is nearer the hand of the user in the case of miniature rackets.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Miniature rackets are also lighter than adult-size rackets, thus making it easier in some cases for children to use them. However, difficulties have been encountered with some of these rackets where a shorter handle has been combined with a racket head which is almost as large as that of an adult racket. This resulting imbalance or heaviness in the head impedes learning, in particular the correct learning of basic racket skills. The relative heaviness of the racket head leads a young child to “drop” the wrist, instead of keeping it in the “cocked” position, and to use rotation at the wrist joint to generate racket head speed during stroke execution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">There are many toy products on the market not based on traditional racket design but which require catching and hitting skills for their enjoyment. For example, an option on the market is an arrangement where two discs are supplied with a furry ball. One side of the discs is covered in VELCRO or “suckers” to which the ball adheres, and the other side is supplied with a strap for holding the disc to a hand on its palm side. This device helps a child improve basic catching skills.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">The designs of these currently available learning aids have some shortcomings some of which have been noted above. Another disadvantage of a previously available learning aid is that a child still has to learn how to hold a miniature racket correctly whilst at the same time developing the skills of hand-eye coordination. It can be difficult to learn these skills simultaneously.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">It is an aim of the present invention to facilitate the development of improved methods of teaching and learning general co-ordination and in particular stroke production skills for racket sports.</div>
<heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">The present invention provides a ball game device comprising a body adapted to receive a hand and a wrist of a user, the body presenting a first hitting surface and a second hitting surface, for hitting a ball, the second hitting surface opposed to the first hitting surface, and the body being configured to accommodate the hand and wrist of the user between the first hitting surface and the second hitting surface when the device is in use, to at least partly restrict movement of the wrist.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">The first or each hitting surface is preferably defined by a panel. The panel typically comprises a first panel defining the first hitting surface and a second panel defining the second hitting surface. The first and second panels are preferably substantially planar.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">Either one or both of the panels are preferably conformed to the shape of a racket head so as to simulate a racket and thereby assist in teaching of a racket sport. The two panels may be differently coloured or marked to facilitate learning of forehand and backhand strokes. Either one or both of the panels may be conformed to the size of a conventional racket head such as a squash or tennis racket head so that the or each panel extends beyond the hand and wrist of the user.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">Furthermore, a cavity is preferably defined within the body to receive the hand and the wrist of the user. The cavity may be configured as a mitt or a glove and the cavity is preferably dimensioned so that the hand and the wrist of the user are positioned between the panels when the hand and the wrist are received in the cavity. The cavity may also be dimensioned in such a way that it can receive not only the hand and the wrist but also a portion of the forearm adjacent the wrist so that the hand, the wrist and the forearm adjacent the wrist are positioned between the panels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">The or each panel typically comprises an inner face and an outer face, the or each outer face presenting the hitting surface to hit the ball.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">Further, the or each panel usually comprises an inner layer and an outer layer, the outer layer comprising the outer face and the inner layer comprising the inner face. The outer layer is preferably comprised of a rigid material for striking the ball and the inner layer is preferably comprised of a flexible material to conform to the shape of the hand. Conveniently, the rigid material may be cardboard and/or plastic such as moulded plastic. The flexible material may be foam.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">Preferably, the first panel and the second panel are connected in spaced apart relationship to define the cavity therebetween.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">The device may further comprise connection means for connecting the two panels together. The connection means may be adapted to maintain the panels in spaced apart relationship and to enable adjustment of the distance between the panels to provide a firm but comfortable fit on the hand and wrist.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">The connection means is preferably positioned on the inner face of the first panel and may be adapted for connection to the second panel in an arrangement to allow an opening in the cavity between the first and second panels for insertion of the hand. In an alternative arrangement, the connection means may be positioned on both the first and second panels to allow joining of the panels in a suitable way.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">In some arrangements, the connection means conveniently comprises a plurality of spacers positioned around the periphery of the inner face of the first panel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">Where convenient, the connection means may comprise a snap-fit connector.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">In one arrangement, the connection means is preferably hinged to the inner face of the or each panel for pivotal movement between an operative and a stored condition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">The inner face of the panels may further comprise a flange of rigid material bounding the inner layer to present a solid surface on which to attach the connection means and to assist in retaining the inner layer in a secure arrangement. Conveniently the flange may be connected to the outer layer which is also formed of rigid material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">The connection means preferably comprises a set of first connection elements on the first panel and a set of second connection elements on the second panel, the first and second connection elements preferably being adapted to be connected together to connect the first and second panels together in spaced apart relationship to define the cavity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">The first connection elements may be pivoted between operative and stored conditions and the second connection elements can be similarly pivoted. Pivoting of the connection elements to the stored condition allows the connection elements to lay flat in approximate parallel arrangement with the panels for ease of storage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">The spacers may be dimensioned so that a first end of the first panel is maintained at a first distance from a first end of the second panel and so that a second end of the first panel is maintained at a second distance from a second end of the second panel, the second distance being greater than the first distance. This formation creates a tapering effect which allows the device to conform to the shape of a hand.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">The opening between the first and second panels is positioned at the second ends of the first and second panels so that the device tapers towards the first ends of the first and second panels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">The or each outer face of the panels may be bounded by a raised periphery thus simulating a racket head.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">The connection means may comprise hinge means and a means for drawing the panels together about the hinge. Typically the latter means comprises an adjustable strap system such as an elastic strap. In this form of the invention, the elastic strap allows the panels to move apart to a distance appropriate to accommodate the size of the hand and wrist of the user. In this way, one form of the device may accommodate hands and wrists of differing sizes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">The device may be supplied in kit form.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">The kit typically comprises:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0030">material for forming the panels and spacers;</li> <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0031">a template for cutting out the panels and spacers; and</li> <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0032">instructions for assembly of the device.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">The kit may further comprise instructions for games to be played with the device. Alternatively, instructions may be provided as a separate item from the kit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">The instructions may be in book, CD-rom, video or internet-based form.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">The kit may also comprise a ball or balls for use with the device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">The present invention also provides instructions for games to be played with a ball game device comprising a body adapted to receive a hand and a wrist of a user, the body presenting a first hitting surface and a second hitting surface for hitting a ball, the second hitting surface opposed to the first hitting surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">The present invention also provides a ball game device comprising a substantially racket-head shaped device adapted to fit over a user's hand and wrist in a glove-like manner to provide a teaching device for racket sports which moves directly with the hand and wrist to allow the user readily to hit the ball.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">The device may comprise two panels which are conjoined at a first end by a hinge and at a second end by an elastic strap, the construction allowing the user to slide a hand and wrist in a glove-like manner between the two panels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">The device is ideally light-weight and safe for a child to use. To assist in safety aspects, the device typically has rounded edges and not sharp edges.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">In one form of the invention, the kit may comprise:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0041">thirty 5 mm (0.20 inch) thick cardboard pieces, including two rectangular pieces of width 22 cm (8.66 inches) and length 30 cm (11.81 inches) (from which are cut the panels of the device), and twenty-eight strips of width 2 cm (0.787 inches) and length 6 cm (2.363 inches) (the spacers of the device);</li> <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0042">an instruction booklet for assembly of the device;</li> <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0043">a template for cutting out the panels of the device and for positioning of the spacers; and</li> <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0044">instructions for games to be played with the device.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">The ball game device of the invention provides an easy method for a child to develop the hand-eye coordination and agility required for racket sports. The learning of the proper racket grip is delayed due to the fact that the device does not comprise a handle. The beginner can master the hand-eye coordination required for a racket sport using the device of the invention before at a later stage learning the process of the racket grip. Thus, the device of the invention is designed to encourage the adoption of the correct stroking technique.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">Hand-eye coordination skills are easier to develop using the device when compared to using miniature or adult-sized rackets. This is partly due to the fact that there is a reduced distance from the eyes to the point of impact with the ball in the case of the device when compared to miniature or adult-sized rackets. There is also a greatly reduced distance from the point of application of the hitting force, that is the point at which the hand “holds” the device, and the impact point with the ball in the case of the device of the invention as compared to miniature or adult-sized rackets.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">A further benefit of the invention is that the panels of the device extend over the wrist of the user which encourages proper use of the arm in a swing movement and also encourages proper orientation and movement of the wrist. The rigid nature of the outer layer of the panels assists in preventing movement of the wrist in a plane perpendicular to the plane of the palm (or back) of the hand, resulting in the user adopting the preferred stroke technique by encouraging movement of the arm from the shoulder. The user's hand is held substantially flat to restrict movement of the wrist and to develop the correct orientation of the hand, wrist, forearm and upper arm during stroke production.</div>

<heading>BEST MODE(S) FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067">Referring now to the drawings, the device of the invention comprises a body generally shown by numeral <b>10</b>. The body comprises two panels <b>12</b> which present hitting surfaces <b>14</b> for striking a ball <b>20</b>. A cavity <b>22</b> is present between the panels <b>12</b> for receiving a hand <b>24</b> and wrist <b>25</b> of a user <b>26</b> by means of an opening <b>23</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068">Each panel is formed of an inner layer <b>28</b> and an outer layer <b>30</b>. The panels further comprise an inner face <b>32</b> and an outer face <b>34</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">Connection means <b>35</b> are provided to join the two panels <b>12</b> together which are in the form of spacers <b>36</b> in the first embodiment. The connection means can also be in the form of first connection elements <b>38</b> and second connection elements <b>40</b> as shown in the case of the third to sixth embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0070">Referring to the first embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>, two panels <b>12</b> of appropriate shape are cut out of the cardboard piece <b>15</b>. Spacers <b>36</b> in the form of a number of cardboard pieces are attached to the panels <b>12</b> using sticky tape in an arrangement as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. This arrangement allows one end <b>11</b> of the device to be open for insertion of a hand <b>24</b> and wrist <b>25</b> through the opening <b>23</b> whilst the other end <b>13</b> is partly closed off by the spacers <b>36</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">As can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, varying numbers of cardboard pieces forming the spacers <b>36</b> can be used to adjust the spacing between the panels <b>12</b> to accommodate hands and wrists of varying sizes. For example, as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, four spacers <b>36</b> are positioned at A, five spacers <b>36</b> are positioned at B and six spacers <b>36</b> are positioned at C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0072">Fewer spacers <b>36</b> are positioned at first ends <b>54</b> of the panels <b>12</b> than at second ends <b>56</b> of the panels <b>12</b> so that the body <b>10</b> tapers towards the first ends <b>54</b> of the panels. This results in the cavity <b>22</b> being wider at the opening <b>23</b> of the device than at the front or first end. Thus distance b is greater than distance a in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. This tapering allows for accommodation of the hand <b>24</b> and wrist <b>25</b> since the tapering mimics the shape of the hand.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0073">The device of the first embodiment is provided in an unassembled, kit form comprising cardboard <b>15</b> and cardboard spacers <b>36</b>. Instructions are provided as to how to assemble the device together with a template for cutting out the panels <b>12</b>. The kit also includes an instruction booklet describing various games which may be played with the device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0074">Construction of the device of the first embodiment from cardboard provides an inexpensive, easy-to-use device that can be readily produced on a large scale, for example for use by schools, racket sport coaching organisations, recreation centres and other similarly interested bodies. The assembly of the device can also be used as an art and craft project following which children can use the assembled device for play.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0075"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref> <i>a </i>to <b>4</b> <i>d </i>show a user <b>26</b> using the device of the first embodiment. As can be seen, the device can be used for a forehand movement (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> <i>c</i>) and a backhand movement (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> <i>d</i>). The device can also be used to practice upward hitting of the ball <b>20</b> on either of the two panels <b>12</b> by turning of the hand to present one of the two striking faces <b>14</b> to the ball as appropriate as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref> <i>a </i>and <b>4</b> <i>b</i>. Drawings such as <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref> <i>a </i>to <b>4</b> <i>d </i>together with additional games are included in an instruction booklet relating to the device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0076">The second embodiment as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 to 10</figref> comprises a body <b>10</b> formed of two substantially identical panels <b>12</b> which conform to the shape of a racket head. Each panel <b>12</b> is formed of an inner layer <b>28</b> and an outer layer <b>30</b>. The inner layer <b>28</b> is formed of foam which deforms as necessary to comfortably accommodate the hand <b>24</b> and wrist <b>25</b>. The outer layer <b>30</b> is formed of corrugated cardboard <b>20</b> to provide a firm surface for hitting a ball. As can be seen in the Figures, the outer layer <b>30</b> presents a hitting surface <b>14</b> which is substantially planar and resembles a racket face for striking a ball.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0077">The hitting surface is decorative as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> (but omitted from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 10</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0078">Since a main purpose of the device is as an aid in the teaching of racket sports, the shapes and sizes of the panels <b>12</b> are similar to those of a standard racket which is truncated at the lower end. In other variations, the panels <b>12</b> can be of any convenient shape and size, including in particular the shape and size of various types of squash or tennis rackets or the blade of a table tennis bat.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0079">The device of the second embodiment further comprises at one end a hinge <b>46</b> to connect the two panels <b>12</b> to each other. The hinge <b>46</b> is in the form of cardboard and flexible tape. At the other end of the device an elastic strap <b>48</b> is provided which passes through a pair of apertures <b>50</b> on each panel <b>12</b> to provide a means for drawing the panels together about the hinge <b>46</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> show the device prior to inserting the elastic strap <b>48</b> through the apertures <b>50</b> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows the elastic strap <b>48</b> being passed through the apertures <b>50</b> prior to the ends thereof being secured to form the device ready for use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0080">As can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref> <i>a </i>and <b>10</b> <i>b</i>, the hand <b>24</b> is passed between the panels <b>12</b> by easing the elastic strap <b>48</b> so as to move the panels <b>12</b> away from each other to form the cavity <b>22</b>. As can be noted, the panels <b>12</b> extend over the wrist <b>25</b> of the user which limits rotation at the wrist <b>25</b> perpendicular to the plane of the palm (or back) of the hand. As can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> <i>b</i>, the panels <b>12</b> of the second embodiment also extend over a portion of the forearm <b>27</b> of the user further assisting in encouraging movement of the arm from the shoulder to develop correct stroke technique.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0081">Due to the adjustment of the spacing between the two panels <b>12</b> by means of the elastic strap <b>48</b>, the device of the second embodiment can readily accommodate all sizes and shapes of hands and wrists.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0082">Thus it can be seen that the two substantially planar hitting surfaces formed by the panels <b>12</b> are positioned over the palm and back of the hand and wrist when the device is in use. The hand is held flat with the fingers extended. The planes of the hitting surfaces, the palm and the back of the hand are in almost parallel alignment. Thus the distances from the point of impact with the ball to the point of application of force is minimised (and reduced to nearly zero) by eliminating the handle and making the point of impact almost coincident with the palm and back of the hand.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0083">Furthermore, the panels <b>12</b> extend over the wrist and a portion of the forearm so that rotation about the wrist in a plane along the forearm perpendicular to the plane of the hand is inhibited.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0084">The device of the third embodiment comprises an outer frame of rigid plastic with a flange <b>44</b> bounding the inner layer <b>28</b> and a raised periphery <b>42</b> bounding the outer layer <b>30</b>. The flange <b>44</b> serves the purpose of providing a solid surface on which the connection means <b>35</b> can be attached. Furthermore, the flange <b>44</b> serves the purpose of retaining the foam which forms the major portion of the inner layer <b>28</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0085">As can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</figref> <i>a </i>and <b>16</b> <i>b</i>, the connection means <b>35</b> comprises a set of first connection elements <b>38</b> and a set of second connection elements <b>40</b> which fit together in the device to be used as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> <i>b</i>. The first and second connection elements are connected to the flange <b>44</b> at hinge point <b>37</b>. This allows the first and second connection elements to be folded parallel to the panel for convenient storage. When the device is to be used, the first and second connection elements are raised about the hinge point <b>37</b> and connected together to form the device to be used as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0086">The device of the third embodiment also consists of two panels <b>12</b> which are connected together by means of the connection means <b>35</b>. The connection means <b>35</b> may be height-adjustable so that the spacing between the two panels of the device may be adjusted to accommodate the appropriate hand size.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0087">The first connection elements <b>38</b> and the second connection elements <b>40</b> are snap-fit connectors, the first elements being of male configuration and the second being of female configuration. In an alternative arrangement, the first connection elements may be a combination of male and female configured elements to correspond with matching male and female configured second connection elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0088">The device according to the fourth embodiment is similar in many respects to that of the third embodiment. However the device of the fourth embodiment does not comprise a flange <b>44</b> as in the case of the third embodiment but comprises a wall <b>45</b> on which are positioned the connection elements <b>35</b>. The device of the fourth embodiment is also provided with first connection elements <b>38</b> and second connection elements <b>40</b> which fit together in a snap-fit arrangement as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19</figref> <i>a</i>, <b>19</b> <i>b </i>and <b>20</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0089">The relative thicknesses of the inner layer and the outer layer may be varied so as to vary the overall weight of the device as shown in the fifth and sixth embodiments. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the outer layer <b>30</b> is made of reduced thickness and the inner layer <b>28</b> is made of increased thickness relative to the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. Therefore, given that the outer layer <b>30</b> is provided of rigid plastic and the inner layer is of foam, the overall weight of the device shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> will be less than the weight of the corresponding embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. In another variation as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, portions of the outer layer <b>30</b> adjacent the connection elements <b>38</b> and <b>40</b> in the areas marked <b>52</b> have been reduced in size thereby reducing the overall weight of the device compared with the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0090">Modifications and improvements may be made to the foregoing without departing from the scope of the present invention. Furthermore, it should be appreciated that the scope of the invention is not limited to the scope of the embodiments described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0091">Throughout the specification, unless the context requires otherwise, the word “comprise” or variations such as “comprises” or “comprising”, will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or group of integers but not the exclusion of any other integer or group of integers.</div>
