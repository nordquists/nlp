<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">This invention relates generally to the field of training baseball bats, and more particularly to such a training bat which utilizes a cast-in-place lead within a cavity which spans the sweet spot of the bat and which is permanently held in place by multiple retaining means to insure that the lead does not become dislodged or loose within the bat.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">2. Description of Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">The use of training bats which are weighted to enhance the muscle, speed and coordination skills of the batter are well known. One such well-known technique is the temporary addition of a weighted ring or donut slid over the handle of the bat and which is sized to be retained from slipping off the barrel of the bat while the batter takes practice swings before coming to the plate for either batting practice or during a game.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">Other prior art devices which have been patented are also well known. U.S. Pat. No. 514,420 to Jacobus discloses a bat with an axial perforation longitudinally formed in the body wherein one or more heavy weights are inserted, the outer end of the cylindrical perforation is securely closed with a threaded cylindrical plug. A similar metal bat is disclosed by Shroyer, Jr. in U.S. Pat. No. 1,499,128.</div>

A newly published pending patent application for a training bat and method is disclosed in U.S. Pub. US2005/0096161 in Gallagher.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">The present invention provides a weighted training bat which adds a cast-in-place lead weight into a cylindrical hole bored into a conventional wooden bat and which is secured in place by multiple retaining means including an elongated threaded wooden screw permanently glued in place to insure that the lead does not become dislodged or loose within the bat during batting practice.</div>
<heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">This invention is directed to a weighted training bat formed as a unit of wood and having a handle and a barrel. The barrel has an elongated hollow cavity formed into a distal end of the barrel, an outer or distal portion of the cavity having internal threads formed into the side wall surface thereof. Lead which has been poured into and filling the proximal portion of the cavity, when solidified, adheres to the interior surface of the cavity to resist loosening the lead during use of the bat, the lead adding weight to the sweet spot of the bat. An elongated wooden screw having external threads matably engages with internal threads in the cavity so that a proximal end of the screw is in contact against one end of the lead to further prevent loosening of the lead. The threads are glued to permanently secure the screw in the outer portion of the cavity and an outer end of the screw is formed to mate and blend with the contour of the distal end of the barrel portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a baseball training bat which is weighted at approximately the sweet spot to enhance strength, speed and coordination of the batter during practice.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">Yet another object of this invention is to provide a weighted training bat utilizing cast-in-place poured lead formed into a longitudinal cavity formed into the distal end of the barrel of the bat, the remainder of the cavity tightly filled with a screwed-in-place threaded wooden screw tightened against the lead and form finished to match the distal contour of the bat.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">Still another object of this invention is to provide a weighted training bat incorporating a cast-in-place quantity of lead which is secured from loosening or movement within the cavity formed into the bat by multiple retention means provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">In accordance with these and other objects which will become apparent hereinafter, the instant invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">Referring now to the drawings, the present invention is there shown generally at numeral <b>10</b> formed as a conventional wooden baseball bat in all dimensional aspects and having a barrel portion <b>12</b>, a handle portion <b>14</b>, a knob <b>16</b> and typically a crest or brand <b>18</b>. Again, the training bat <b>10</b> is formed as a unit of well-known hardwood of conventional or regulation size features.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">All baseball bats possess a “sweet spot” shown at <b>36</b> and which is the point along the length of the bat <b>10</b> in the barrel portion <b>12</b> which, when striking a baseball, will cause the bat <b>10</b> to rebound in such a fashion that the rebound force is completely balanced by the turning force of the bat <b>10</b>. The closer to the end of the bat the ball is struck, the more the grip <b>14</b> will rotate forwardly out of the hands of the batter whereas if the ball is struck closer to the handle <b>14</b>, the bat's tip will try to rotate forwardly. There is a small sweet spot <b>36</b> in the region of <b>32</b> where these tendencies cancel one another.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">As a generality, these sweet spots <b>36</b>, although differing somewhat in location along the barrel <b>12</b>, fall within a region <b>32</b> located approximately 5″ to 7″ from the end <b>24</b> of the barrel <b>12</b> where the batted-ball speed is the highest and the sensation to the hands is minimized. It is an object of this invention to enhance the training bat function by placing additional weight into the barrel <b>12</b> of the bat <b>10</b> along and either side of the sweet spot <b>36</b> to maintain the existing sweet spot location of the bat <b>10</b>. To accomplish the weighting feature of this invention, a longitudinal bore is formed longitudinally of the barrel <b>12</b> starting from the distal end <b>24</b> to define a cavity <b>28</b>. This cavity <b>28</b> is typically formed by drilling or machining after which internal threads <b>22</b> are formed to the distal end <b>24</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">The lead weight <b>26</b> is preferably cast in place wherein, with the bat <b>10</b> in the upright orientation shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, molten or liquid lead is poured into the cavity <b>28</b> in a preselected amount, typically 5 to 7 ounces over a length of approximately 3″ to 4″, the cavity diameter <b>28</b>, being approximately 1″. The pourable lead is then allowed to cool and harden, after which a hammering or tapping process is utilized against the exposed end <b>34</b> of the lead <b>26</b> so as to further insure that the lead <b>26</b> has been forced into the interior texture and shape of the cavity <b>28</b> to the fullest extent possible. This second means for lead retention is important so as to help insure that the lead <b>26</b> does not become loosened within the cavity <b>28</b> during batting practice.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">Once the lead <b>26</b> has been fully and compliantly poured, hardened and hammer-forced into the texturing contour of the cavity <b>28</b>, a wooden screw <b>20</b>, having external threads which matably engage into the internal threads <b>22</b>, is threadably engaged into this portion of the cavity <b>28</b>. The wooden screw <b>20</b> is longer than the anticipated length of the internal threads <b>22</b> so that an exposed portion <b>30</b> remains exposed for tightening of the screw <b>20</b> against the end <b>34</b> of the lead <b>26</b>. Once the threaded screw <b>20</b> is tightened sufficiently, the remainder <b>30</b> is machined off so as to matably comply with the existing distal end surface <b>24</b> of the barrel <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">To further insure that the lead weight <b>26</b> remains absolutely stationary within the cavity <b>28</b>, the wooden screw <b>20</b> is coated with a suitable glue before being threadably engaged into the internal threads <b>22</b>. After the tightening of the wooden screw <b>20</b> has been accomplished, the set glue will render the wooden screw <b>20</b> to be an integral permanent part of the barrel <b>12</b> and bat <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">While the instant invention has been shown and described herein in what are conceived to be the most practical and preferred embodiments, it is recognized that departures may be made therefrom within the scope of the invention, which is therefore not to be limited to the details disclosed herein, but is to be afforded the full scope of the claims so as to embrace any and all equivalent apparatus and articles.</div>
