<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/590,333, filed Jul. 23, 2004, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The present invention relates generally to lacrosse sticks, and more particularly, to a lacrosse stick head having a wide catching area and channeled thongs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">2. Background of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">In 1970, the introduction of double-wall, synthetic lacrosse heads revolutionized the game of lacrosse. In comparison to the traditional wooden single-wall heads, the synthetic heads imparted a balance, lightness, maneuverability, and flexibility never-before experienced by lacrosse players. These performance advantages greatly enhanced players' skills such as throwing, catching, cradling, and scooping, and brought the sport of lacrosse to new levels of speed and excitement.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates a conventional lacrosse stick <b>100</b> having a handle <b>102</b> shown in dotted lines and a double-wall synthetic head <b>104</b>. Head <b>104</b> includes a generally V-shaped frame having a juncture <b>106</b>, sidewalls <b>108</b> and <b>110</b>, a transverse wall (or “scoop”) <b>112</b> joining the sidewalls at their ends opposite juncture <b>106</b>, and a stop member <b>114</b> joining sidewalls <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> at their ends nearest juncture <b>106</b>. As shown, handle <b>102</b> fits into and through juncture <b>106</b>, and abuts stop member <b>114</b>. A screw or other fastener placed through opening <b>107</b> secures handle <b>102</b> to head <b>104</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">For traditionally-strung pockets (which have thongs and string instead of mesh), thongs (not shown) made of leather or synthetic material extend from upper thong holes <b>116</b> in scoop <b>112</b> to lower thong holes <b>118</b> in stop member <b>114</b>. In some designs, such as the design shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, upper thong holes <b>116</b> are located on tabs <b>117</b> of the scoop <b>112</b>. In other designs, upper thong holes <b>116</b> are located directly on the scoop <b>112</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows four pairs (<b>116</b>, <b>118</b>) of thong holes that accept four thongs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">To complete the pocket web, the thongs have nylon strings threaded around the thongs and string laced through string holes <b>120</b> in sidewalls <b>108</b> and <b>110</b>, forming any number of diamonds (crosslacing). Finally, one or more throwing or shooting strings extend transversely between the upper portions of sidewalls <b>108</b> and <b>110</b>, attaching to throwing string hole <b>124</b> and a string laced through string hole <b>122</b>. The typical features of a lacrosse stick are shown generally in Tucker et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,507,495, Crawford et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,034,984, and Tucker et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,566,947, which are all incorporated by reference herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">In addition to traditionally strung heads, some heads use mesh pockets or a combination of traditional and mesh stringing. In any case, the mesh or stringing is conventionally attached to the head through holes in the scoop, sidewalls, and stop members, or by tabs attached to the scoop, sidewalls, and stop members. These tabs can have openings through which mesh or stringing is threaded, or can be shaped (e.g., like a hook) to retain loops of the mesh or stringing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">As used herein, thread holes or thread openings refer to the openings that receive the various forms of pocket stringing, such as the holes in the scoop, sidewalls, and stop members, or the openings in tabs attached to the scoop, sidewalls, and stop members. The term “openings” should be construed broadly so as to encompass any hole or structure that retains the pocket stringing, including structures such as hooks. Also, as used herein, a pocket thread refers to any member, such as a thong, string, or mesh, that forms the pocket and/or attaches the pocket to the lacrosse head.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">The traditional shape of a lacrosse head is commonly referred to as generally V-shaped. In other words, looking at the face of a lacrosse head, the width between the sidewalls increases as the sidewalls extend from the ball stop to the scoop, with the widest point being in the area of the transition between the sidewalls and the scoop. Typically, rules applicable to competitive lacrosse dictate the minimum width a lacrosse head must possess (e.g., 6½ inches). According to conventional thinking, providing the greatest width near the scoop enables a player to more easily scoop ground balls and catch thrown balls, and direct the balls down into the pocket of the lacrosse head.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">With respect to scooping ground balls, improvements in the ball retention characteristics of lacrosse heads have changed the modem game of lacrosse such that it is now more difficult to check balls loose and create ground ball opportunities. Simply put, there are less ground balls in the modem game of lacrosse than were typical in years past. Consequently, the modem game emphasizes precise passing and catching over the scooping of ground balls.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">In addition, with respect to catching thrown balls, it is now recognized that most players catch a ball in the center section of a lacrosse head, and not within the widest portion of the head near the scoop. Thus, players are more apt to miss a ball as it bounces off the closely positioned sidewalls in the center area of the head.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">U.S. Pat. No. 5,685,791 to Feeney discloses a lacrosse head having a shape somewhat contrary to this conventional thinking. Feeney discloses a composite lacrosse head in a generally circular, or closed loop, configuration. Viewed from the front face, the central section of the Feeney head is of the greatest width. Starting from the ball stop, the sidewalls of the head immediately diverge away from each other in slightly convex lines to the point at which the central section reaches its greatest width. From that point to the scoop, the sidewalls converge toward each other in concave lines. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a schematic diagram of the Feeney lacrosse head <b>196</b> showing the concave portions <b>197</b> and convex portions <b>198</b> of head <b>196</b>, with dotted lines marking the approximate transitions between each section of the sidewalls.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">As used herein, the terms concave and convex are discussed relative to the interior area defined by the ball stop, sidewalls, and scoop of a lacrosse head. In other words, looking at the front face of a lacrosse head, a convex sidewall bends toward the interior of the lacrosse head, while a concave sidewall bends away from the interior of the lacrosse head. The bending of a sidewall can be judged, for example, relative to a point drawn roughly in the center of the interior area of the lacrosse head.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">Although the lacrosse head of Feeney may provide a larger catching area in the center area of the head, this increased area raises additional drawbacks. For example, the increased area enables a ball to rattle more within the head, making the control and retention of the ball difficult. In addition, the ordinary interwoven string pocket shown and described in Feeney compounds the difficulties in avoiding this ball rattle. In addition, because the sidewalls of Feeney diverge immediately starting from the ball stop, a ball can easily rattle and exit the head at locations very close to the ball stop.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">Thus, in view of the drawbacks of conventionally shaped heads, there remains a need for a lacrosse head that provides a wide catching area, yet maximizes ball retention and control.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">The present invention provides a lacrosse head that, in addition to providing a wide catching area, provides important aspects of ball retention and control.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">An embodiment of the present invention provides an exemplary lacrosse head that includes a stop member, a left sidewall connected to the stop member, a right sidewall connected to the stop member, and a scoop connecting the left sidewall to the right sidewall opposite the stop member. The scoop is disposed about 25.5 cm from the stop member. The widest point of the lacrosse head is in a catching section disposed from about 6 cm to about 17 cm from the stop member. The left sidewall is convex at a portion of the left sidewall between the widest point and the scoop. The right sidewall is convex at a portion of the right sidewall between the widest point and the scoop. The convex sidewalls between the widest point and the scoop provide a narrower, funneled pocket through which a ball exits the head, thereby providing improved ball control and more accurate passing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">In a further aspect of the present invention, the width of the scoop is in a range from about 5 cm to about 15 cm measured perpendicularly to the shaft axis between the left sidewall and the right sidewall. This narrow width contrasts sharply with the wide scoops of traditional heads and with the widest point of the catching section. The narrow scoop funnels a ball out of the pocket during throwing to increase the accuracy of passes and to counteract any reduction in ball control that the wide catching area may cause.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">In a further aspect of the present invention, the sidewalls rise from the plane of the scoop and include thong holes. In one embodiment, the scoop defines two inside thong holes, the left sidewall defines a left outside thong hole, and the right sidewall defines a right outside thong hole. This placement of the thong holes in conjunction with the rising sidewalls provides channeled thongs that help guide the ball in a straight line out of the pocket, and counteract any reduction in ball control that the wide catching area may cause.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">In a further aspect of the present invention, the sidewalls are parallel to each other in the section of the lacrosse head between the stop member and the catching section. This parallel configuration further helps ball control and retention. In a further aspect of the present invention, the width of the scoop is less than the distance between the parallel sidewalls.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">As discussed herein, measurements of the distance between sidewalls are taken from roughly the inside of the sidewalls, i.e., measuring the clear opening between the sidewalls. For example, such a measurement could be taken from the inside top rim of one sidewall to the inside top rim of the other sidewall. The measurements of the distance between sidewalls are also taken roughly perpendicularly to the shaft axis.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an exemplary lacrosse head <b>200</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown, lacrosse head <b>200</b> includes a juncture <b>206</b>, sidewalls <b>208</b> and <b>210</b>, a scoop <b>212</b> joining the sidewalls at their ends opposite juncture <b>206</b>, and a stop member <b>214</b> joining sidewalls <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> at their ends nearest juncture <b>206</b>. A handle (not shown) fits into and through juncture <b>206</b>, and abuts stop member <b>214</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">As shown by the dotted lines <b>298</b> and <b>299</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, lacrosse head <b>200</b> is generally described herein with reference to three sections of the head: a rearward section <b>220</b>, a catching section <b>222</b>, and a forward section <b>224</b>. As shown, rearward section <b>220</b> is nearest the ball stop <b>214</b> and forward section <b>224</b> is nearest the scoop <b>212</b>. Catching section <b>222</b> is disposed in between rearward section <b>220</b> and forward section <b>224</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">In a particular implementation of this embodiment of the present invention, the distance <b>226</b> from the middle of ball stop <b>214</b> to the end of scoop <b>212</b> is approximately 25.5 cm. The distance <b>228</b> from the middle of ball stop <b>214</b> to the line <b>299</b> between rearward section <b>220</b> and catching section <b>222</b> is approximately 6 cm. The distance <b>230</b> from the middle of ball stop <b>214</b> to the line <b>298</b> between catching section <b>222</b> and forward section <b>224</b> is approximately 17 cm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">As one of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate, the dimensions of rearward section <b>220</b>, catching section <b>222</b>, and forward section <b>224</b> could vary as desired for a particular application, such as for a men's or women's lacrosse stick head, for junior lacrosse stick heads, for offensive or defensive lacrosse stick heads, or for recreational or trick lacrosse stick heads. In general, for men's or women's competitive lacrosse stick heads, the distance <b>226</b> could range from about 25 cm to about 31 cm, the distance <b>230</b> could range from about 16 cm to about 23 cm, and the distance <b>228</b> could range from about 3 cm to about 7 cm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the widest distance <b>232</b> between sidewalls <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> is within catching section <b>222</b>. In a particular implementation, this distance <b>232</b> is approximately 16.5 cm. In general, for men's and women's competitive lacrosse stick heads, the distance <b>232</b> could range from about 16 cm to about 26 cm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">An important aspect of the present invention is the manner by which sidewalls <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> transition between ball stop <b>214</b>, the widest point <b>232</b> of catching section <b>222</b>, and scoop <b>212</b>. Preferably, within rearward section <b>220</b>, sidewalls <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> remain substantially parallel. From line <b>299</b> (between rearward section <b>220</b> and catching section <b>222</b>) to near the widest point <b>232</b> of catching section <b>222</b>, sidewalls <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> preferably diverge (i.e., the distance between them increases) along convex lines. From near the widest point <b>232</b> of catching section <b>222</b> to near scoop <b>212</b>, sidewalls <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> preferably converge along convex lines. The net result of this sidewall configuration is that lacrosse head <b>200</b> is pinched above and below the widest point <b>232</b> of catching section <b>222</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating the concave and convex portions of an exemplary head <b>300</b> of the present invention. As shown, head <b>300</b> includes convex portions <b>302</b> and concave portions <b>304</b>. The dotted lines of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> represent the approximate transitions between each convex or concave portion of head <b>300</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in an aspect of the present invention, the pinching (i.e., convex portions <b>302</b>) above the widest point <b>232</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is especially advantageous over conventional lacrosse heads that place their widest point in the catching section but converge the sidewalls along concave lines between the widest point and the scoop, such as the lacrosse head shown in Feeney (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">With continuing reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, providing pinched sidewalls <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> above and below the widest point <b>232</b> decreases ball rattle, increases a player's ability to retain a ball in the pocket, and provides a straight channel through which a ball can rise from ball stop and leave the pocket for a more accurate throw. Thus, a player is able to easily catch a ball through the widest point <b>232</b>, and then hold and cradle the ball within the narrow rearward section <b>220</b>. The proximity of sidewalls <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> in the rearward section <b>220</b> reduces the distance in which a ball can rattle. Then, upon throwing the ball, the narrow distance between sidewalls <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> in the rearward section <b>220</b> and forward section <b>224</b> keeps the ball centered in the pocket as it travels up the pocket and off of either throwing strings or scoop <b>212</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">A further aspect of the present invention provides a dramatic convex transition of sidewalls <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> between near the widest point <b>232</b> of catching section <b>222</b> and the line <b>299</b> between catching section <b>222</b> and rearward section <b>220</b>. This significant decrease in width between sidewalls <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> creates a markedly pinched configuration and quickly brings sidewalls <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> to the minimal distance apart that is held in rearward section <b>220</b>, where sidewalls <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> are substantially parallel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">In one exemplary head, referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the distance <b>234</b> between the widest point <b>232</b> of catching section <b>222</b> and the ball stop <b>214</b> is about 15 cm, the distance <b>228</b> is about 3.5 cm, the widest point <b>232</b> is about 16.5 cm, and the distance between sidewalls <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> at line <b>299</b> is about 7 cm (which is the distance at which sidewalls <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> remain substantially parallel in rearward section <b>220</b>). Therefore, according to this example, the distance between sidewalls <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> at line <b>299</b> would be approximately 43% of the widest point <b>232</b>, with the change in width occurring over 11.5 cm, which is equal to distance <b>234</b> minus distance <b>228</b>. In general, according to embodiments of the present invention, distance <b>228</b> would range from about 3 cm to about 7 cm, distance <b>234</b> would range from about 13 cm to about 18 cm, and the proportion of the width at line <b>299</b> to the width at widest point <b>232</b> would be from about 40% to about 60%. This significant transition enables a lacrosse head according to the present invention to provide a wide catching area, while at the same time providing a narrow rearward section <b>220</b> with closely spaced parallel sidewalls that enhance ball retention and control.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">In a further embodiment of the present invention, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> illustrate an exemplary lacrosse head <b>400</b> having its widest point <b>402</b> in the catching section <b>422</b>, having a small scoop width <b>404</b>, and having a forward section <b>424</b> that changes planes between the sidewalls <b>408</b> and <b>410</b> and the scoop <b>412</b>. Having the widest point <b>402</b> in the catching section <b>422</b> provides the performance benefits discussed above. Having a small scoop width <b>404</b> provides a channel through which the ball can rise on the pocket and exit the lacrosse head <b>400</b>. This channel facilitates more accurate passing, which is the primary focus of the modern game of lacrosse. Having a forward section <b>424</b> that changes planes between the sidewalls <b>408</b> and <b>410</b> and the scoop <b>412</b> enables the placement of thongs at different planes to further create a channel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, lacrosse head <b>400</b> includes a juncture <b>406</b>, sidewalls <b>408</b> and <b>410</b>, a scoop <b>412</b> joining the sidewalls at their ends opposite juncture <b>406</b>, and a stop member <b>414</b> joining sidewalls <b>408</b> and <b>410</b> at their ends nearest juncture <b>406</b>. A handle (not shown) fits into and through juncture <b>406</b>, and abuts stop member <b>414</b>. As shown by the dotted lines <b>498</b> and <b>499</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, lacrosse head <b>400</b> includes a rearward section <b>420</b>, a catching section <b>422</b>, and a forward section <b>424</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">In one implementation, at the line <b>499</b> between rearward section <b>420</b> and catching section <b>422</b>, the distance between sidewalls <b>408</b> and <b>410</b> is about 7 cm and line <b>499</b> is a distance <b>428</b> of about 7 cm from ball stop <b>414</b>. The widest point <b>402</b> of catching section <b>422</b> is about 16.5 cm and is located at a distance <b>434</b> of about 15 cm from ball stop <b>414</b>. At the line <b>498</b>, which is located at a distance <b>430</b> of about 17 cm from ball stop <b>414</b>, the distance between sidewalls <b>408</b> and <b>410</b> is about 14 cm. The distance <b>426</b> from ball stop <b>414</b> to the end of scoop <b>412</b> is approximately 25.5 cm. Finally, the width <b>404</b> of scoop <b>412</b> is about 8 cm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">As represented by the dotted lines <b>413</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, sidewalls <b>408</b> and <b>410</b> rise from the plane of scoop <b>412</b>. The side elevation views of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> show this rise more clearly. In an embodiment of the present invention, two inner thong holes <b>451</b> are disposed in scoop <b>412</b>, one outer thong hole <b>453</b> is disposed in sidewall <b>408</b>, and another outer thong hole <b>455</b> is disposed in sidewall <b>410</b>. Thong holes <b>453</b> and <b>455</b> are disposed in a higher plane than thong holes <b>451</b> because of the rising sidewalls <b>408</b> and <b>410</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">As used herein to describe the higher and lower relative positions of the scoop, the sidewalls, and thongs attached to the scoop and sidewalls, a plane is parallel to the face of a lacrosse head, which is defined generally by the top edges of the stop member and sidewalls. One plane, for example, is defined by the shaft axis and a line that is drawn perpendicularly to the shaft axis and intersects equivalent points of the sidewalls (i.e., the line intersects a point on the first sidewall and a point on the second sidewall that are both a substantially equal distance below the top edge of their respective sidewalls).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>, in an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the width <b>404</b> of scoop <b>412</b> is less than the distance between sidewalls <b>408</b> and <b>410</b> in the rearward section <b>420</b>, where sidewalls <b>408</b> and <b>410</b> are parallel. This narrow scoop <b>412</b>, in conjunction with the thong holes <b>453</b> and <b>455</b> being disposed on a plane higher than thong holes <b>451</b>, positions the thongs in a channel configuration. In this manner, thong holes <b>451</b> contact a lower portion of the lacrosse ball, while thong holes <b>453</b> and <b>455</b> contact a higher, side portion of the lacrosse ball. In an embodiment of the present invention, the distance between thong holes <b>451</b> is about 1¼ inches (equal to half of the diameter of a typical lacrosse ball) so that the thongs contact a bottom portion of the ball. This distance, which is smaller than those found on conventional lacrosse heads, coincides with the narrower scoop and provides the desired channel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates exemplary positions of the thongs created by the narrow scoop <b>412</b> and the thong holes <b>453</b> and <b>455</b> being disposed on a plane higher than thong holes <b>451</b>, according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown, thongs strung to thong holes <b>451</b> contact the lower portion of a lacrosse ball <b>700</b>. Thongs strung to thong holes <b>453</b> and <b>455</b>, which are disposed on the rising sidewalls <b>408</b> and <b>410</b>, are positioned in a plane higher than that of the thongs strung to thong holes <b>451</b> and contact a higher portion (e.g., the sides) of ball <b>700</b>. The thong holes <b>451</b>, <b>453</b>, and <b>455</b> therefore position the thongs in a channel configuration that holds guide ball <b>700</b> in the center of the pocket as it rises in the pocket during a throw.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">Overall, embodiments of the present invention provide many benefits over conventional lacrosse heads. Placing the widest point of the head in the catching section, and not in the forward section, makes it easier for players to catch lacrosse balls. Narrowing the scoop and changing the plane of the sidewalls with respect to the scoop guides the ball so that the ball leaves the pocket in a more funneled manner, thereby improving playability. Further, the reshaped and resized scoop, along with the novel placement of thong holes on the sidewalls, places the thongs, or leathers, in different planes than do conventional heads. The two outside thongs that are disposed on the sidewalls are raised relative to the two inside leathers, which creates a channel effect. Thus, although during a throw the ball has more space in which to rattle in the catching section where the head is wider, the channel prevents this rattling and controls the exiting of the ball. As a result, a lacrosse head of the present invention provides a wider catching area where the ball is intended to be caught, but overcomes the potentially negative consequence of ball rattle via the stringing channel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">The wider catching section provides other benefits as well. For example, the wider area of the catching section allows the stringing to sag more in the pocket across this wider area during cradling, in comparison to conventional heads. This sagging effect increases the centrifugal force while the ball is being cradled, which stabilizes the ball in the pocket. During the throwing motion, however, less centrifugal force is exerted on the pocket, which lessens sag, thereby maintaining the accuracy of the throw.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">The wider catching section and narrower forward section also provide a more favorable center of gravity in comparison to conventional lacrosse heads. The wider catching section shifts more weight of the head toward the player's hand positioned just below the throat of the head. This shift in weight places the center of the gravity of the head closer to the player's hand, giving the player a better feel for the position of the head and providing a greater sense of control. In addition, shifting mass from the forward section to the catching section decreases the radius from center of gravity to the axis of rotation, thereby decreasing the torque on the head and increasing the player's control and feel of the ball in the pocket.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">As another benefit, the present invention pinches the scoop area creating a narrow channel for throwing accuracy. Repeatedly, the ball is released from the center most point on the stick as opposed to a conventional head where there is limited control over the angle the ball is released off the wide scoop. The track that is formed by the forward pinched characteristic of the head of the present invention forces the ball to be released from the center of the scoop, which is the highest point on the head.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">In addition, the invention allows for a greater moment of inertia. The moment of inertia is the sum of all the masses multiplied by the radius squared. When the mass (i.e., the ball) is concentrated farther away from the axis of rotation or higher on the head, the moment of inertia will be greater, thus giving strength to the shot. The greater the moment of inertia, the more difficult it is for an external force to change the position of the head, therefore, providing accuracy to a throw or shot from the head.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">According to an aspect of the present invention, a lacrosse head having a wide catching section, such as head <b>200</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, is an injection-molded, monolithic structure made of a durable synthetic material. Examples of materials suitable for the lacrosse head include nylon, urethane, polycarbonate, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyketone, polybutylene terephalate, acetals (e.g., Delrin™ by DuPont), acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), acrylic, and acrylic-styrene-acrylonitrile (ASA). In one embodiment, the lacrosse head of the present invention is constructed of DuPont™ ZYTEL ST 801 nylon resin.</div>
