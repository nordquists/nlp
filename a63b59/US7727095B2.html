<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">The present invention relates to a composite structure for a hockey stick.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">Hockey stick systems have traditionally been made from wood. Wood has been a convenient and traditional material to use but is limited in strength and weight. The wood stick is solid and can be made from a multi ply lamination in order to improve strength.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Recent developments have improved hockey sticks by making them out of metal such as aluminum. Such sticks are typically made from a one piece extruded aluminum tube to which can be attached a blade and handle. The tubular construction offers a lighter weight and also easy attachment for the blade and handle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">More recent developments have advanced hockey stick performance by using composite materials such as fiber reinforced resins such as carbon fiber in an epoxy resin. These sticks are tubular in form to maximize strength and minimize weight.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Composite materials are attractive alternatives to wood, because there exists a large selection of fiber types and resin types, the combinations of which can produce a multitude of options suitable for replacement to wood. These composite laminates have the advantage of being stiffer, stronger, and less susceptible to environmental changes than wood.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">One of the first patents describing composite materials used for hockey sticks is U.S. Pat. No. 4,086,115 to Sweet which discloses a tubular hockey stick manufactured using fiberglass fibers in a polyester resin made using a pultrusion process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,419,553 and 5,303,916 to Rogers disclose an improved hockey stick made from composite materials, also made using the pultrusion process, with the addition of specific fiber orientation in order to improve the stiffness and strength of the stick.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">The pultrusion process has also been used to create a hockey stick of two tubes with an internal wall in between. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,549,947, 5,688,571, 5,888,601, 6,129,962 to Quigley, et. al., describe a continuous manufacturing operation to produce a hockey stick with continuous fiber reinforcement. The limitations of making a hockey stick using a pulltrusion process are that fiber placement cannot be changed along the length of the structure and the cross-section cannot be varied along its length.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">U.S. Pat. No. 5,636,836 to Carroll, U.S. Pat. No. 5,746,955 to Calapp, U.S. Pat. No. 5,865,696 to Calapp, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,241,633 to Conroy all describe tubular hockey stick systems made from fiber reinforced resin materials with specific fiber orientation in order to achieve desired performance characteristics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">There exists a continuing need for an improved hockey stick system. In this regard, the present invention substantially fulfills this need.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">With greater reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref> of the drawings, the present invention is a composite hockey stick system <b>10</b>. The system features geometric shapes in the shaft for improving the flexibility, strength and other playing characteristics of the system. The system comprises a handle <b>12</b> and a striking end <b>34</b>, i.e., a blade. The stick handle <b>12</b> is fabricated of multiple layers of aligned carbon filaments held together with an epoxy binder, i.e., so-called “graphite” material. The fibers in the various plies are parallel to one another, but the various plies preferably have varying fiber orientations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">The stick handle <b>12</b> has a long generally hollow rectangular configuration with a top end <b>18</b>, a bottom end <b>20</b>, a front face <b>22</b>, a rear face opposite the front face, and a pair side faces <b>26</b>. The stick has a recessed opening <b>32</b> in the bottom end <b>20</b> thereof for attaching the blade <b>34</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">The stick striking end <b>34</b> is preferably also fabricated of multiple layers of aligned carbon filaments held together with an epoxy binder however, the plies of the blade may have different fiber orientations than the handle).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">The stick striking end <b>34</b> has a generally thin rectangular configuration with a first face <b>40</b>, a second face <b>42</b>, an upper edge <b>44</b>, a lower edge <b>46</b>, a near end <b>48</b>, and a far end <b>50</b>. The near end has a bend <b>52</b> at an angle between 45 degrees and 80 degree and being preferably 65 degrees measured between the side faces of the stick handle end and the upper edge and the lower edge. The upper end <b>48</b> of the blade has a male fitting <b>54</b> extending therefrom, with the fitting <b>54</b> being adapted to couple into the opening <b>32</b> in the bottom end of the stick handle end.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">An adhesive <b>56</b> couples the stick handle with the stick striking end between the connecting bar and the opening in the stick handle end.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">The stick handle end and the stick striking end are configured together to form a shaft which is generally linear in shape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">A plurality of “ports” <b>58</b> are formed in the stick handle, preferably near the bottom end <b>20</b>. The ports extend between the front face <b>22</b> and the rear face. Each aperture is preferably oval in shape, with the long axis of the oval in line with the vertical axis of the shaft. Each port includes a peripheral wall that extends between the front face <b>22</b> and the rear face, whose ends are bonded to the tubular handle <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">The ports are preferably in the shape of double opposing arches which allow the structure to deflect, which deforms the ports, and return with more resiliency. The ports also allow greater bending flexibility than would traditionally be achieved in a single tube design. The structure can also improve comfort by absorbing shock and damping vibrations due to the deformation of the ports. Finally, the ports can improve aerodynamics by allowing air to pass through the shaft to reduce the wind resistance and improve maneuverability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">The handle tube is preferably made from a long fiber reinforced prepreg type material. Traditional lightweight composite structures have been made by preparing an intermediate material known as a prepreg which will be used to mold the final structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">A prepreg is formed by embedding the fibers, such as carbon, glass, and others, in resin. This is typically done using a prepreg machine, which applies the non-cured resin over the fibers so they are all wetted out. The resin is at an “B Stage” meaning that only heat and pressure are required to complete the cross linking and harden and cure the resin. Thermoset resins like epoxy are popular because they are available in liquid form at room temperature, which facilitates the embedding process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">A thermoset is created by a chemical reaction of two components, forming a material in a nonreversible process. Usually, the two components are available in liquid form, and after mixing together, will remain a liquid for a period of time before the crosslinking process begins. It is during this “B Stage” that the prepreg process happens, where the resin coats the fibers. Common thermoset materials are epoxy, polyester, vinyl, phenolic, polyimide, and others.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">The prepreg sheets are cut and stacked according to a specific sequence, paying attention to the fiber orientation of each ply.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">Each prepreg layer comprises an epoxy resin combined with unidirectional parallel fibers from the class of fibers including but not limited to carbon fibers, glass fibers, aramid fibers, and boron fibers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">The prepreg is cut into strips at various angles and laid up on a table. The strips are then stacked in an alternating fashion such that the fibers of each layer are different to the adjacent layers. For example, one layer may be 30 degrees, the next layer −30 degrees. If more bending stiffness is desired, a lower angle such as 20 degrees can be used. If more torsional stiffness is desired, a higher angle such as 45 degrees can be used. In addition, 0 degrees can be used for maximum bending stiffness, and 90 degrees can be used to resist impact forces and to maintain the geometric structural shape of the tube.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">This layup, which comprises various strips of prepreg material, is then rolled up into a tube.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, according to the preferred embodiment of the invention, a suitable prepreg tube <b>60</b> is formed in the manner just described, with the various composite plies oriented at the desired angles. Next, a plurality of openings <b>62</b> are formed through opposing walls the tube, perpendicular to the axis of the tube. The openings <b>62</b> may be stamped through the walls. More preferably, a tool is used to separate the carbon fibers from one another, without cutting the fibers, to form the openings <b>62</b>. The openings, at this stage, need not have the final desired shape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, next a pair of inflatable thin walled polymeric bladders <b>64</b>, <b>65</b>, preferably made of nylon, are inserted through the tube <b>60</b> such that their facing walls <b>66</b>, <b>67</b> are aligned with the openings <b>62</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-6</figref>, after the bladders <b>64</b>, <b>65</b> have been inserted, a hollow, tubular plug <b>66</b> is inserted through each of the holes <b>62</b>, between the facing walls <b>66</b>, <b>67</b> of the bladders, i.e., separating the bladders. The ends of the plugs <b>66</b> preferably extend beyond the outer surfaces of the prepreg tube <b>60</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The plugs are preferably tubes of prepreg material. However, if desired the plugs may be made of other materials such as metal or plastic.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">Finally, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, if the plugs <b>66</b> are formed of prepreg material, a mold pin <b>68</b> is inserted through each plug <b>66</b> to form the internal geometry of the ports. This may occur prior to mold packing, or during the mold packing process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">The tube is then packed into a mold which forms the shape of the hockey stick handle. If the mold and tube are longer than the final desired dimension of the hockey stick handle, a final cut to length operation can be performed on the handle <b>12</b> after molding.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">Air fittings are applied to the interior of the bladders <b>64</b> and <b>65</b> at the end of the tube <b>60</b>. Preferably, the bladders are closed on the other end of the handle, or are connected in the shape of a hairpin to form one continuous “U” shaped bladder inside the tube <b>60</b>. The mold is then closed over the tube <b>60</b> and placed in a heated platen press. For epoxy resins, the temperature is typically around 350 degrees F. While the mold is being heated, the tube <b>60</b> is internally pressurized, which compresses the prepreg material and forces the tube <b>60</b> to assume the shape of the mold. At the same time, the heat cures the epoxy resin. The bladders also compress the peripheral walls of the plugs <b>66</b>, so that the inwardly facing surface <b>70</b> of each plug <b>66</b> conforms to the shape of the mold pin <b>68</b> (which is preferably oval). At the same time, the heat and pressure cause the ends of the plug walls to bond to the wall of the prepreg tube <b>60</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">Once cured, the mold is opened in the reverse sequence of packing. The pins <b>68</b> are typically removed first, followed by the top portion of the mold. Particular attention is needed if removing the top portion with the pins <b>68</b> intact to ensure that this is done in a linear fashion. Once the pins <b>68</b> have been removed from the handle <b>12</b>, the handle can be removed from the bottom portion of the mold.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-9</figref>, after molding, the handle <b>12</b> is formed of a single, hollow handle tube <b>72</b>, with a plurality of ports <b>58</b> extending through the tube <b>72</b>. The ends of the port walls <b>74</b> are bonded to the portions of the handle tube <b>72</b> surrounding the ports <b>58</b>, and the inwardly facing surfaces <b>76</b> of the ports <b>58</b> extend completely through the handle tube <b>72</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">The composite material used is preferably carbon fiber reinforced epoxy because the objective is to provide reinforcement at the lightest possible weight. Other fibers may be used such as fiberglass, aramid, boron and others. Other thermoset resins may be used such as polyester and vinyl ester. Thermoplastic resins may also be used such as nylon, ABS, PBT and others.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">The hockey stick system of the present invention becomes unique when the ports are molded into the structure. It is not necessary to change the exterior dimensions of the shaft when molding apertures. Therefore, the shaft becomes much more aerodynamic because the frontal area is significantly reduced. This is a great benefit to a hockey stick system. The hockey stick is long in length and can be difficult to generate fast swing speeds. For example, compared to a golf shaft which is about the same length, the hockey stick system is about four times to about six times greater in frontal area, therefore being much less aerodynamic.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">Having aerodynamic apertures in the hockey shaft can significantly reduce aerodynamic drag. The size and spacing of each aperture can vary according to desired performance parameters. The orientation, or axis of the apertures is in line with the swing direction of the shaft therefore maximizing the aerodynamic benefit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">The size and spacing of the apertures can affect shaft stiffness in a desirable way. These apertures can direct the flexpoint of the shaft toward the lower portion of the shaft if desired. A hockey stick system with a lower flex point is said to provide more velocity to the shot.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">An unexpected benefit of the apertures in the shaft is that they actually improve the durability and strength of the shaft. This is because they act as arches to distribute the stress and strain in a very efficient manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067">During molding, the socket <b>32</b> may be formed using existing methods for forming a hollow graphite hockey stick handle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068">Alternatively, a hockey stick of the present invention can be molded as a one piece structure with the blade portion attached, therefore producing an entire hockey stick. In this case, there is no joint between the shaft and the blade. The stick is made with longer prepreg tubes which are joined to the blade construction prior to molding. The entire stick with all components (shaft and blade) are molded together in one operation. This method provides a means of locating ports closer to the blade portion to achieve even greater aerodynamic advantages</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">It is also possible to have a precured blade, which is then placed in a mold for bonding to the prepreg shaft as it is cured. It is also possible to have a precured (or molded) shaft and blade, then place both into a mold with prepreg reinforcements wrapped around the joint or interface between the shaft and blade in order to make a one piece unit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0070">It is also possible to use a metal material for the main tube such as aluminum, and bond either composite or metal cylindrical reinforcements (ports) to the aluminum in a similar manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">The hockey stick system of the present invention is not limited to ice hockey stick systems. It can also be applied to field hockey stick systems. In fact, the aerodynamic benefits have a greater potential with field hockey because the frontal width of field hockey stick systems is much greater than ice hockey shafts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0072">The hockey stick system can also be applied to lacrosse sticks. Lacrosse sticks are very long in length and therefore carry significant frontal area and would benefit from the improved aerodynamics offered by the ports.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0073">As to the manner of usage and operation of the present invention, the same should be apparent from the above description. Accordingly, no further discussion relating to the manner of usage and operation will be provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0074">With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0075">Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention.</div>
