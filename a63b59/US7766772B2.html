<heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">The present invention claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/403,922, filed Aug. 16, 2002, and entitled “Lacrosse Stick With Increased Strength” and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/415,190, filed Oct. 1, 2002, and entitled “Lacrosse Handle Having Variable Wall Thickness.”</div>
<heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates generally to a lacrosse handle for attachment to a lacrosse head. More particularly, the present invention relates to a lacrosse handle for attachment to a lacrosse head that has increased strength and resistance to breakage or damage.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Original lacrosse handles were constructed of wood. These wood handles were shaped such that the lacrosse handle and the lacrosse head were a single integral wood structure. These wooden lacrosse handles suffered from a variety of disadvantages. Initially, these wooden handles were susceptible to damage from excess exposure to water such as through warping. Further, these prior wooden handles were heavy and somewhat cumbersome and also susceptible to breakage. Moreover, because the wood had to be bent to form the sidewall and the scoop, a significant amount of time was involved in forming or making each of these wooden lacrosse handles, which made them relatively expensive. Because the lacrosse handle and head were a single structure, if any portion of the head or the handle broke or was damaged, the entire wooden handle and head needed to be replaced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Subsequently, plastic lacrosse heads were developed which were intended to be attached to a lacrosse handle. As the lacrosse heads and the lacrosse handles were separate components that could be manufactured separately, if either the lacrosse handle or the lacrosse head became damaged or broke, each component could be replaced individually. The original handles for attachment to these plastic heads were constructed of wood. These handles were also susceptible to water damage and were relatively heavy and cumbersome.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Thereafter, metal lacrosse handles were developed for attachment to the plastic lacrosse heads. The initial metal handles were less expensive than the prior wood handles. However, they were relatively heavy, which provided disadvantages from both a playability and a safety standpoint. Current lacrosse handles are constructed of a lighter metal, such as aluminum or titanium. These lacrosse handles typically take the form of a hollow metal tube, and are formed by extrusion or similar processes. While having a relatively light weight, the hollow handles are susceptible to breakage or damage. Additionally, these conventional handles also are formed with a uniform wall thickness along the entire length of the tube. In other words, the cross-sectional thickness of the handles from one end to the other end is the same. Moreover, the top and bottom halves of these conventional handles are symmetrical. This is disadvantageous in that the handle does not assist a player in determining the orientation of the handle and thus the attached lacrosse head in the player's hand.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Therefore, a need exists for a lacrosse handle that has increased durability without significantly increasing the weight thereof. A need also exists for a lacrosse handle that provides a player with tactile feedback as to the orientation of the handle in the player's hand.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">It is therefore one advantage of the present invention to provide an improved handle for a lacrosse head that provides tactile stimuli or feedback such that a player can sense the orientation of a lacrosse head attached to the handle without the need for visual inspection.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">It is another advantage of the present invention to provide a lacrosse handle having increased strength and durability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">It is a related advantage of the present invention to provide a lacrosse handle for a lacrosse head having increased strength and durability that does not require a significant increase in the weight of the handle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">It is yet another advantage of the present invention to provide a handle for a lacrosse head that yields improved playability and handling.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">It is still another object of the present invention to provide a lacrosse handle for attachment to a lacrosse head that has a varying or non-uniform wall thickness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">In accordance with the above and the other advantages of the present invention, a handle for a lacrosse head is provided. The handle is constructed as a hollow tube having an interior surface and an exterior surface. The hollow tube has a first end for communicating with a throat portion of a lacrosse head and a second end opposing the first end. The hollow tube has a first wall thickness defined by a distance between the interior surface and the exterior surface at one location along the hollow tube and a second wall thickness defined by a distance between the interior surface and the exterior thickness at another location along the hollow metal tube. The first wall thickness has a greater magnitude than the second wall thickness.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">In the following figures, the same reference numerals are used to identify the same components in the various views.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">In the embodiment, illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4</figref>, a lacrosse handle having non-uniform wall thickness is shown. The lacrosse handle <b>10</b> is preferably an eight sided structure that is generally symmetrically shaped on either side of a handle centerline as is well known in the art. It will be understood, however, that the lacrosse handle can take on a variety of different shapes. The lacrosse handle <b>10</b> is preferably constructed of metal, such as aluminum or titanium. However, the handle may be formed of a variety of other materials, such as a variety of alloys. The handle <b>10</b> also is preferably constructed as a hollow metal tube with a top portion <b>12</b> and a bottom portion <b>16</b>. The top portion <b>12</b> and the bottom portion <b>16</b> are generally defined by a centerline <b>14</b> of the handle <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">The top portion <b>12</b> has a first wall thickness (t<sub>1</sub>) and the bottom portion <b>16</b> has a second wall thickness (t<sub>2</sub>). In conventional lacrosse handles, the first wall thickness and the second wall thickness are the same. In fact, in conventional lacrosse handles, the wall thickness is the same along the length of the handle. In accordance with the present invention, the handle <b>10</b> has varying wall thicknesses and, in one embodiment, the second wall thickness (t<sub>2</sub>) is greater than the first wall thickness (t<sub>1</sub>). In other words, at least a portion of the lacrosse handle <b>10</b> has a wall thickness on one side of the centerline <b>14</b> that is greater than the wall thickness of another portion of the lacrosse handle <b>10</b> on the other side of the centerline <b>14</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">As an illustrative example, the wall thickness (t<sub>1</sub>) of the top portion <b>12</b> is approximately 0.040″ while the wall thickness (t<sub>2</sub>) of the bottom portion <b>16</b> is approximately 0.050″. It will be understood that that dimensions of the tube wall may vary and dimensions given are merely for purposes of illustration. More preferably, the lacrosse handle <b>10</b> is configured such that one half of the handle <b>10</b> has a wall thickness that is increased with respect to or greater than the wall thickness of the other half of the handle <b>10</b>. In one embodiment, the increased wall thickness is generally uniform from one end of the handle to the other end. However, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the wall thickness can be different at any two locations along the handle <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows that in the exemplary embodiment of the invention the wall thickness varies about the longitudinal axis of the handle <b>10</b> in a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis. The wall thickness includes a first range <b>34</b> about the longitudinal axis of relatively thicker wall thickness from about the four o'clock position of the cross-section in the clockwise direction to the eight o'clock position, less than one-half around the longitudinal axis and about 120 degrees around the longitudinal axis. The wall thickness is substantially constant about the first range <b>34</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the first range <b>34</b> of relatively thicker wall thickness is disposed on only one side of the longitudinal axis in the plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis (the bottom side of the cross-section based on the orientation of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The thickest portion of the handle, the first range <b>34</b>, is not broken such that portions of relatively thicker wall thickness oppose one another in mirrored relation across the longitudinal axis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">The wall thickness also includes a second range <b>36</b> about the longitudinal axis of relatively thinner wall thickness from about the eight-thirty clock position of the cross-section in the clockwise direction to about the three-thirty clock position, over 180 degrees about the longitudinal axis. Thus, the second range <b>36</b> extends about the longitudinal axis a greater angle than the first range <b>34</b>. The wall thickness is substantially constant about the second range <b>36</b> around the longitudinal axis of the handle <b>10</b>. Thus, the wall thickness of the exemplary embodiment is at a minimum over at least 180 degrees about the longitudinal axis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> also shows that the wall thickness includes two “third” ranges <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> about the longitudinal axis. The third ranges <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> define transition between the relatively thicker wall thickness and the relatively thinner wall thickness. The third range <b>38</b> extends about 9 degrees around the longitudinal axis and the third range <b>40</b> extends about 17 degrees around the longitudinal axis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> also shows that the handle <b>10</b> is polygonal in cross-section in the plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis. The exemplary polygon has ten sides and over half of the sides are in the second range <b>36</b> and therefore have the relatively thinner wall thickness. The relatively thinner walled sides are disposed adjacent to one another about the longitudinal axis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">This increased wall thickness provides a tactile stimuli or feedback such that a player using the handle <b>10</b> can sense in what direction the handle <b>10</b> is configured in the player's hand, i.e. whether the portion having an increased wall thickness is facing upward or downward or somewhere in between. Thus, the first range <b>34</b> and the second range <b>36</b> are operably associated with one another whereby the handle <b>10</b> is operable to provide tactile feedback to a user of the handle <b>10</b> as to the orientation of the handle <b>10</b> in the user's hand. As the lacrosse handle <b>10</b> is attached to a lacrosse head, the player can also sense the direction the lacrosse head is facing, based solely on the feel of the weight of the handle in the player's hands. This feature eliminates the need for a player to look at the lacrosse head to determine its orientation during play thereby allowing the player to focus on the game.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">While one way of varying the handle thickness to provide tactile stimuli or feedback is disclosed above and shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4</figref>, it will be appreciated that the lacrosse handle wall thickness can be varied in other ways to provide this tactile feedback. For example, in the half of the lacrosse head <b>10</b> where the thickness is increased, the thickness need not extend from one end of the handle to the other. Instead, it need only extend along a portion of the length of the handle. It will be understood that that the increased thickness can extend along any portion of the length of the handle as desired. Alternatively, the increased wall thickness does not need to be uniform from one end of the handle to the other, i.e. the magnitude of the increase may vary. Instead, the half of the handle having the greater wall thickness can have deviations in that thickness along the length of the handle. Moreover, a half weight or other similar structure could be secured within the handle <b>10</b> to provide the tactile feedback. It will be understood that the handle <b>10</b> can take on a variety of other configurations to allow a player to sense the direction the attached head is facing, including having a side of the lacrosse handle having larger wall thickness than the other side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">In another embodiment, shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the lacrosse handle <b>10</b> has a varying wall thickness to provide for increased strength. The handle <b>10</b> is preferably comprised of a metal material, however, a variety of other materials may instead be utilized. In this embodiment, the handle <b>10</b> is comprised of a hollow tube, which has a first wall thickness (t<sub>1</sub>) adjacent a first end <b>18</b> and a second wall thickness (t<sub>2</sub>) adjacent a second end <b>20</b> with the wall thickness (t<sub>1</sub>) being larger than the wall thickness (t<sub>2</sub>). As shown, the wall thickness of the tube wall is gradually tapered such that the hollow interior portion becomes gradually wider as it extends from one end to the other end. As an illustrative example, the tube wall thickness gradually tapers from about 0.050″ at the first end <b>18</b> to about 0.040″ at the second end <b>20</b>, which attaches to the head. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the thickness of the tube wall at the portion <b>24</b> is larger than the thickness of the tube wall at the portion <b>26</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">It will be understood that he taper may extend in the other direction. It will also be understood that that dimensions of the tube wall may vary and dimensions given are merely for purposes of illustration. Preferably, the dimension of the outside wall of the tube remains the same, i.e. generally parallel to the centerline <b>14</b>. Put another way, the distance between the exterior surface <b>28</b> across the widest part of the handle at the first end <b>18</b> is the same as the distance between the exterior surface <b>28</b> across the widest part of the handle at the second end <b>20</b>. However, the distance between the interior surfaces <b>30</b> varies from the first end <b>18</b> to the second end <b>20</b>. It will be understood that the taper can be gradual beginning at one end of the handle and tapering along the entire length of the handle. Alternatively, the tapering can begin at the midsection <b>22</b> of the handle <b>10</b> or at any other location such that it tapers only along a larger or smaller portion of the length of the handle <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">Preferably, the thinner hollow portion (thickest part of the tube wall) is inserted into the throat of the lacrosse head such that the thicker portion of the tube wall is adjacent the lacrosse head. In this embodiment, the thicker portion would correspond to the first end <b>18</b>. This taper is intended to provide increased strength to the handle <b>10</b> by providing a thicker portion, which results in a lacrosse handle that is stronger and more resistant to breakage. It will be understood that the taper can alternatively be configured such that the thicker portion is adjacent the butt end of the handle. This increased weight at the butt end acts as a counterweight to provide more force as the handle is brought downward during shooting or passing to yield increased ball velocity due to the resulting “whip” action. In yet another embodiment, the lacrosse handle can have increased wall thickness generally in the areas where a player's hands are primarily intended to contact the handle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, which illustrate another embodiment in accordance with the present invention. In this embodiment, the lacrosse handle <b>10</b> has a varying wall thickness to provide for increased strength. The handle <b>10</b> is preferably comprised of a metal material, however, a variety of other materials may instead be utilized. As shown, the handle <b>10</b> is comprised of a hollow tube, which has a first wall thickness (t<sub>1</sub>) adjacent a first end <b>18</b>, a second wall thickness (t<sub>2</sub>) adjacent a second end <b>20</b>, and a third wall thickness (t<sub>3</sub>) adjacent the middle portion <b>22</b> of the handle <b>10</b>. In this embodiment, the wall thickness (t<sub>1</sub>) and the wall thickness (t<sub>2</sub>) are generally the same and are both larger than the wall thickness (t<sub>3</sub>). As shown, the wall thickness of the tube wall is larger adjacent the first end <b>18</b> and the second end <b>20</b>, but is decreased in the middle portion <b>22</b> of the handle. Thus, the handle has a wall thickness that is decreased in the middle portion <b>22</b> with respect to the end portions <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>. It will be understood that the thickness increases in the wall may be located in a variety of different locations. Again, in this embodiment, the dimension of the outside wall <b>28</b> of the tube remains the same, i.e. generally parallel to the centerline <b>14</b>, while the hollow interior portion <b>32</b> decreases in size. Put another way, the distance between the exterior surfaces <b>28</b> across the widest part of the handle <b>10</b> at the first end <b>18</b> is the same as the distance between the exterior surfaces <b>28</b> across the widest part of the handle at the second end <b>20</b>. However, the distance between the interior surfaces <b>32</b> varies.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">While particular embodiments of the invention have been shown and described, numerous variations and alternate embodiments will occur to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, it is intended that the invention be limited only in terms of the appended claims.</div>
