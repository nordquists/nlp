<heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This application claims priority of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/341,161, filed Mar. 29, 2010, under Title 35, United States Code, Section 119(e), which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</div>
<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention generally relates to sporting good equipment for use as a grip teaching aid or training device. More particularly, the present invention relates to a teaching aid or training device for facilitating and developing the proper grip of a handle of sporting equipment or other devices having a handle, such as a baseball bat handle, for use by either right-handed or left-handed individuals. The present invention could be used as a grip for a handle of sporting equipment, or any other device having a handle.</div>
<heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Many different sports and activities require the use of equipment that is swung to strike an object, such as a baseball bat for baseball, a softball bat for softball or a golf club in golf. The individual's grip on the particular equipment, such as the baseball bat, is typically important for proper swinging motion and striking ability on the object. It is well known in the art of sporting goods to provide gripping aids for encouraging a proper grip of the handle of the equipment, such as the handle of a baseball bat, softball bat or golf club.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">One of the most common and leading causes of inconsistencies in athletic swings in baseball, softball and golf are the grip and grip alignment. In many instances, the positioning of the hand and the pressure applied to the grip will determine the swing path toward the ball. Many individuals are unable to consistently grip the handle properly, which can lead to undesired results in the swing, such as uneven or inconsistent swing paths, or a weaker swing than had the individual used a proper grip.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">In baseball or softball, for example, a proper grip on the bat is important to maximize strength and swinging motion for striking the baseball. A proper grip in baseball or softball is such that the bat is held primarily in the fingers of the hand so that the second row of knuckles (i.e., middle row of knuckles) of the individual are lined up with each other. A baseball or softball bat should not be held in the palm of the hands. Holding a baseball or softball bat in the palm of the hands inhibits the flexion of the wrists during the swing, and decreases the individual's natural power and quickness during the swinging motion. In addition, holding the bat in the palm encourages an improper swinging motion which can facilitate injury to the individual while swinging and can decrease the bat stability while swinging thereby decreasing power.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Various devices are known in the sporting goods art for promoting a proper grip. Many of these devices, for example, wrap around the handle and include a raised surface portion for aligning the hands. One known device in the art provides a bat grip that includes upper and lower separated segments that wrap completely around the bat handle and allow for the use of both hands by a left-handed or right-handed player and has a raised surface portion for knuckle alignment. This type of device, however, maintains a generally artificial feel with respect to the bat handle and prevents the individual from obtaining the natural feel of the bat. It can also be difficult to easily put on the bat or remove from the bat.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">Other devices known in the art comprise baseball grips of a material which enhances the user's hold on the bat, e.g., rubber or neoprene materials. Grips have been formed such that they conform to the hands of the user while other grips have indentions for receiving the user's fingers in such a way that the bat is more easily gripped. These types of grips, however, do not typically allow for the user to maintain a natural feel of the bat handle. These known grips can also be cumbersome and difficult to apply to or remove from a bat handle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">A number of grips exist for instructing a user on how to properly grip a baseball bat, golf club, tennis racket, or other similar such sporting equipment. Grips specifically configured for instructing an individual on how to properly grasp the equipment are generally known in the art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,125,353 (Blount) discloses a baseball bat grip that encourages a user to maintain a proper grip throughout the entire swing of the baseball bat. The grip includes a pair of protrusions that are secured between a V-shaped opening between the user's index finger and thumb on each hand. The grip further includes certain ridges and valleys configured to receive the user's fingers to further maintain an appropriate grip.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">Such grips suffer from a number of disadvantages. In particular, these grips do not properly instruct a user on how to position the baseball bat such that when the user swings the baseball bat, the so-called trademark portion of the bat is positioned correctly with respect to the user's hands and with respect to the batted ball. Further, the grip of the '353 patent suffers other disadvantages, namely, the V-shaped openings formed by the protrusions result in a grip that rests too deeply into the user's hand, thus requiring that the user to control the bat with the palm of the user's hand instead of the fingers of the user's hand. Further, the ridges and valleys do not conform to the user's hand or instruct the user on where to position each of the user's respective fingers on the baseball bat. In addition, the '353 patent is configured to instruct a user on how to achieve a “knocked knuckles” grip throughout the swing. Such a “knocked knuckles” grip, however, can be disadvantageous because the “knocked knuckles” grip significantly reduces a user's ability to securely grasp the baseball bat and swing the bat in a controlled, powerful manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">Other devices known in the art which include grips for sporting equipment cannot be easily installed on the sporting equipment due to the shape of such equipment. Specifically, a baseball bat includes a knob at a first end, a barrel at a second end, and a handle portion between the knob and the barrel. The user grips the baseball bat at the handle portion, and as such training aids for teaching and promoting proper grip are installed on the handle portion. The knob and barrel, however, are typically much larger in diameter than the handle portion. Thus, installing a grip known in the art is difficult, as the grip must be stretched over the knob, yet must retain a tight fit to the handle portion. Such known grips that accomplish this tend to become loose over time due to stretching. They too can be cumbersome to put on and remove.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">Accordingly, there is an unsatisfied need in the art for a training device for encouraging a proper grip of a handle, such as a baseball bat handle, that can be interchangeable for a right-handed or left-handed individual, that is easily applied to and removed from a handle, and promotes as much direct contact between the individual's hands and the handle to allow close to a “natural feel” as possible during use.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">The ability to provide a specific sensation and placement of the grip into the player's fingers during the set-up and the swing helps the player to develop and maintain the proper and most efficient grip for that given sport. The present invention provides the individual with the proper sensation and positioning for the index finger of the hand during the grip, while also forcing the rest of the player's fingers into the proper grip alignment directly on the handle. The index finger is also known as, and will be referred to as, the “trigger finger.”</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">The present invention addresses the various disadvantages of known prior art training devices for promoting proper grip of a handle. The training device of the present invention generally includes a unitary member having a defined area for placement of the trigger finger, while simultaneously forcing the other fingers into proper alignment and which can be easily employed during use and can be adapted for use in any activity requiring a bat, racquet, club, etc., such as baseball, softball, golf, tennis, lacrosse, cricket, etc. It could also be used for non-sport related activities, such as using a scythe, a sledgehammer, a shovel, etc. The training device of the present invention can comprise a single unitary elongated tube-like body for fitting around the handle of a sporting equipment, such as a baseball bat, and can be comprised of any material known in the art such as vinyl, rubber, plastic, neoprene and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">In an embodiment of the present invention, the device includes a protruding saddle (i.e., trigger finger receiving area) defined by a finger groove portion. The player's “trigger finger” securely and comfortably fits into the trigger finger receiving area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">An embodiment of the present includes a device having a visual alignment guide on the rear portion. A visual alignment guide provides the individual with the proper sensation of control and position with the “trigger finger” during use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved device for promoting proper grip and alignment (a gripping aid) of the hands on a baseball bat or other sporting equipment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved gripping aid that can be easily placed onto or removed from a baseball bat or other sporting equipment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">It is yet another object of the present invention to provide an improved gripping aid that can be easily interchangeable for use by a right-handed individual or a left-handed individual.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">It is still yet another object of the present invention to provide an improved gripping aid that allows for a substantial amount of direct contact between a baseball bat or other sporting equipment and the individual's hands.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved gripping aid that is small and easily attached to and detached from different sized ball striking equipment and ball striking equipment varying in cross-sectional diameters of the handle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">Other objects of the present invention will become apparent from the description to follow and from the appended claims.</div>

The placement of the user's trigger finger <b>2</b> at trigger finger receiving area <b>14</b> forces the user's other fingers <b>4</b> into a proper grip formation on the handle of the bat <b>1</b>, such that the remaining fingers <b>4</b> wrap around the handle of the bat <b>1</b> accordingly. As can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the proper grip by the individual on the handle of the bat <b>1</b> includes a substantially straight alignment of the individual's knuckles <b>5</b> of the remaining fingers <b>4</b>. The handle of the bat <b>1</b> is thus not resting in the palm of the hand <b>3</b> of the individual.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">Still referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the user is shown properly gripping the bat with the right hand (i.e., top hand for a right-handed individual). The training grip is slipped onto the handle of a ball-striking device, such as the baseball bat, by sliding the handle of the bat through the open slot or space <b>20</b> <i>c </i>of the body member. The individual would then adjust the training grip to the desired alignment by referring the alignment guide, if present, or by referring the alignment of the slot or space, in relationship to the baseball bat handle. The individual may easily adjust the training grip accordingly to the desired position on the baseball bat handle. The securing device, such as a strap, may then be wrapped tightly around the body member of the training grip and in turn the handle of the baseball bat, and can be tightly secured such as by a hook-and-loop arrangement. By a right-handed swinging player, hooking the right trigger finger, into the finger groove <b>14</b> <i>b </i>while griping the handle <b>1</b>, the player will feel a sensation of the proper grip position of the trigger finger and the rest of the right hand. The player will also feel a sense of control in the grip during the swing because of the grip position that the training grip forces the hand into. With the trigger finger hooked into the proper angle on the handle <b>20</b>, the bottom three fingers of the individual's hand are placed into a position to directly grip the handle and causing the handle of the bat to not rest in the palm portion of the individual's hand. It should be appreciated by one skilled in the art that an individual's grip on the handle of a ball-striking device, such as a baseball bat, should take place in the finger portion of the hand rather than the palm of the hand. The training grip also provides a consistent grip alignment onto the baseball bat handle, which in turn helps the individual produce a consistent swing. The individual would then swing the ball-striking device while keeping the trigger finger hooked in place in the finger groove of the training grip. The player would use the present invention in a manner to practice the grip and swing for his or her respective sport.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">Turning now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref>, <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>, an alternative embodiment of the training grip is shown and described and referred to generally at numeral <b>110</b>. Training grip <b>110</b> comprises the same overall features and dimensions of training grip <b>10</b> described above the details of which are incorporated herein by reference. However, training grip <b>110</b> is modified or adapted specifically for use with a golf club.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref>, <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>, training grip <b>110</b> comprises a securing member <b>112</b>, a trigger finger receiving area <b>114</b>, a curved lip or edge <b>118</b>, a substantially curved or arcuate ridge <b>116</b>, with the edge <b>118</b> and ridge <b>116</b> defining the dimensions of trigger finger receiving area <b>114</b>, an outer surface <b>112</b> <i>a </i>of securing member <b>112</b> and opposing horizontal edges <b>122</b> <i>a</i>, <b>122</b> <i>b </i>defining the opposing edges of securing member <b>112</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">Horizontal edges <b>122</b> <i>a</i>, <b>122</b> <i>b </i>form two opposing curved boot areas <b>130</b> <i>a</i>, <b>130</b> <i>b</i>, each of which in turn curves and extends upwardly towards edge <b>118</b> for defining the curved lip or edge <b>118</b>. The upwardly extending edge in turn defines a curved space or indentation <b>131</b> <i>a</i>, <b>131</b> <i>b </i>for receiving and accommodating the individual's thumb during use of training grip <b>110</b> while playing golf. It should be appreciated that thumb accommodating space <b>131</b> <i>a</i>, <b>131</b> <i>b </i>receives and accommodates the individual's thumb <b>106</b> on the lower hand (i.e., strong hand) depending on whether the individual is employing a right-handed or left-handed swing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">In the same manner as described above, the placement of the individual's trigger finger <b>102</b> in trigger finger receiving area <b>114</b> and the individual's thumb <b>106</b> at the thumb accommodating space <b>131</b> <i>a</i>, <b>131</b> <i>b </i>causes the individual's remaining fingers <b>105</b> to be correctly aligned, thus causing a correct grip on the golf club during use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">It will be evident to one skilled in the art that numerous modifications and other embodiments could be constructed that would be different from that which is herein described and depicted, but that would still fall within the scope of this invention. Thus, this disclosure is not intended to be so limiting, but rather illustrative, of one embodiment of the present invention. The scope of the invention is disclosed in the following claims. What has been described above are preferred aspects of the present invention. It is of course not possible to describe every conceivable combination of components or methodologies for purposes of describing the present invention, but one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that many further combinations and permutations of the present invention are possible.
