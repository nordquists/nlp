<heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This non-provisional application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. §119(e) to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/498,372, filed Jun. 17, 2011, which is incorporated herein in its entirety.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">Stored-value cards and other transaction products come in many forms. A gift card, for example, is a type of transaction product that includes a pre-loaded or selectively loaded monetary value. In one example, a consumer buys a gift card having a specified value for presentation as a gift to another person. In another example, a consumer is offered a gift card as an incentive to make a purchase. A gift card, like other transaction cards, can be “recharged” or “reloaded” at the direction of the bearer. The balance associated with the gift card declines as the gift card is used, encouraging repeat visits to the retailer or other provider issuing the gift card. Additionally, the gift card generally remains in the user's purse or wallet, serving as an advertisement or reminder to revisit the associated retailer. Gift cards and other transaction cards provide a number of advantages to both the consumer and the retailer.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">One aspect of the present invention relates to a transaction product including a paddle, a string, a ball, and an account identifier. The paddle defines an enlarged portion and an elongated handle extending from the enlarged portion. The paddle is formed as a single piece of material. The string defines a first end and a second end opposite the first end. The first end of the string is coupled to the paddle. The ball is coupled to the second end of the string and is configured to bounce on the paddle. The account identifier is statically connected to the paddle and links the paddle to at least one of an account and a record and is machine readable by a point-of-sale terminal. Stored-value cards, methods of providing a transaction card, and other embodiments of stored-value or transaction cards and associated combinations are also disclosed.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">The following detailed description of the invention provides examples and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any theory presented in the preceding background of the invention or the following detailed description of the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">A stored-value card assembly or other transaction product assembly is adapted to facilitate making purchases of goods and/or services at, for example, a retail store or web site. According to one embodiment, an original consumer buys a transaction product assembly to give a recipient who in turn is able to use at least a portion of the transaction product assembly to pay for goods and/or services. A transaction product assembly, according to embodiments of the present invention, provides the consumer and recipient with extra amusement and functionality in addition to the ability to pay for goods and/or services with the associated transaction product assembly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">In particular, according to one embodiment, the transaction product assembly includes a transaction card or other transaction product having both a financial functionality and a novelty or amusing functionality, such as to amuse the bearer of the transaction product trying to hit a ball off a paddle in as many successive times as possible as further described below. In one embodiment, transaction product assembly is packaged in a manner substantially enclosing the transaction product such that the features of the transaction product are displayed to potential consumers in a manner encouraging purchase of the transaction product assembly. In one embodiment, the amusing aspect of the transaction product assembly promotes sale, use, and/or loading of the transaction product by potential consumers and/or bearers of the transaction product assembly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">Turning to the figures, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref> illustrate various views of one embodiment of a transaction product <b>10</b> including a paddle <b>12</b>, a ball <b>14</b>, and a string <b>16</b>. The transaction product <b>10</b> facilitates purchase of retail items and/or is configured to be applied toward use of pre-stored calling minutes, etc. In one embodiment, ball <b>14</b> is rubber or otherwise a bouncy ball coupled to paddle <b>12</b> via string <b>16</b>, which, in one example, is elastomeric. A bearer is able to unsecure string <b>16</b> from around paddle <b>12</b>, as generally illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref>, to move ball <b>14</b> away from paddle <b>12</b> as generally indicated in dashed lines in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The bearer, then, is able to try to hit ball <b>14</b> with paddle <b>12</b> (i.e., bounce ball <b>14</b> off of paddle <b>12</b>) as many times in succession as possible. As such, paddle <b>12</b> is one example of means for deflecting ball <b>14</b> causing ball <b>14</b> to bounce when ball <b>14</b> impacts paddle <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, string <b>16</b> generally prevents ball <b>14</b> from being separated from paddle <b>12</b> by more than a predetermined distance and enhances the difficulty of the game by ensuring ball <b>14</b> returns to paddle <b>12</b> in a quick manner following an impact of ball <b>14</b> on paddle <b>12</b>. As such, string <b>16</b> is one example of means for tethering ball <b>14</b> to paddle <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">A portion of transaction product <b>10</b>, for example, paddle <b>12</b>, includes at least one account activation area or account identifier <b>18</b>, such as a bar code, magnetic strip, a smart chip, or other electronic device, a radio frequency identification (RFID) device or other suitable identifier readily machine readable by a point-of-sale terminal or other account access station or kiosk. Account identifier <b>18</b> indicates an account or record to which transaction product <b>10</b> is linked. The account or record of the monetary or other balance on transaction product <b>10</b> optionally is maintained on a remote database accessible by corresponding point-of-sale terminals, other electronic or manual record-keeping system or, in the case of “smart” cards for example, on a chip or other electronic device(s) on transaction product <b>10</b>, itself. Accordingly, by scanning account identifier <b>18</b>, the account or record linked to transaction product <b>10</b> is identified and can subsequently be activated, have amounts debited therefrom, and/or have amounts added thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">In one embodiment, account identifier <b>18</b> includes a character string or code <b>19</b> (e.g., a number and/or letter string) configured to provide additional security to the user of transaction product <b>10</b> and/or configured to be read by a bearer of transaction product <b>10</b> to facilitate use of transaction product <b>10</b> for web site or other purchases outside of brick-and-mortar type retail establishments. With the above in mind, account identifier <b>18</b> is one example of means for linking transaction product <b>10</b> with an account or record, and scanning of account identifier <b>18</b> is one example of means for activating or loading value on transaction product <b>10</b>. Transaction product <b>10</b>, for example, paddle <b>12</b>, is one example of means for supporting account identifier <b>18</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">In one embodiment, paddle <b>12</b> defines an enlarged portion <b>20</b> and a handle <b>22</b>. Enlarged portion <b>20</b> is sized and configured for interacting with ball <b>14</b>, and in one example, is generally round to form an end similar to an impact portion of a racquet, etc. Handle <b>22</b> extends from a side, e.g., the bottom of, enlarged portion <b>20</b>. Handle <b>22</b> is elongated and narrow relative to enlarged portion <b>20</b> such that users can relatively easily grasp paddle <b>12</b> via handle <b>22</b>. In one embodiment, paddle <b>12</b> is formed as a single piece of wood or plastic including both enlarged portion <b>20</b> and handle <b>22</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">In one embodiment, paddle <b>12</b> defines a first or front surface <b>24</b> and a second or rear surface <b>26</b> opposite front surface <b>24</b> separated by a thickness of paddle <b>12</b>. As illustrated, in one example, each of front surface <b>24</b> and rear surface <b>26</b> are partially formed by each of enlarged portion <b>20</b> and handle <b>22</b>. A perimeter edge <b>28</b> extends around a substantial entirety of paddle <b>12</b>, including enlarged portion <b>20</b> and handle <b>22</b>, between, for example, substantially perpendicular to, each of front surface <b>24</b> and rear surface <b>25</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">Paddle <b>12</b> is formed of any suitable substrate or combination of substrates. More specifically, in one embodiment, paddle <b>12</b> is a substantially planar member formed of plastic (e.g. polycarbonate, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), teslin, polyactide (PLA), or acrylic), a composite, or other suitable material. In one embodiment, paddle <b>12</b> is molded from plastic; while in other embodiments, paddle <b>12</b> is formed in any other suitable planar or non-planar configuration as will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reading this application, e.g., formed of wood.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">Additionally referring to the exploded, cross-sectional view illustration of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> taken along the line X-X in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in one embodiment, front surface <b>24</b> of paddle <b>12</b> includes a major, substantially planar section <b>30</b>, a rim <b>32</b>, and an offset <b>34</b>. Major, substantially planar section <b>30</b> forms the majority of front surface <b>24</b> and is the center of and shaped similarly to, but slightly smaller than, the entire front surface <b>24</b>. Rim <b>32</b> extends around a substantial entirety of the perimeter of major, substantially planar section <b>30</b>. Rim <b>32</b> extends in front of major, substantially planar section <b>30</b> (i.e., farther away from rear surface <b>26</b>) such that offset <b>34</b> is formed extending from an inner edge of rim <b>32</b> rearwardly to an outer edge of major, substantially planar section <b>30</b>. As such, a recess is formed across major, substantially planar section <b>30</b> bound by rim <b>32</b>. In one embodiment, rim <b>32</b> has an outer shape coterminous and substantially identical to the outer shape of paddle <b>12</b> considered as a whole. In one embodiment, each of major, substantially planar section <b>30</b>, rim <b>32</b>, and offset <b>34</b> extend and define a part of enlarged portion <b>20</b> and handle <b>22</b> of paddle <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">Rear surface <b>26</b> is formed similar to front surface <b>24</b>, in one example, and defines a major, substantially planar section <b>40</b>, a rim <b>42</b>, and an offset <b>44</b> similar to major, substantially planar section <b>30</b>, rim <b>32</b>, and offset <b>34</b> of front surface <b>24</b>. As such, a recess is formed across major, substantially planar section <b>30</b> bound by rim <b>32</b>. In one example, paddle <b>12</b> is a first thickness between major, substantially planar section <b>30</b> of front surface <b>24</b> and major, substantially planar section <b>40</b> of rear surface <b>26</b> and a second thickness between rim <b>32</b> of first surface <b>24</b> and rim <b>42</b> of rear surface <b>26</b>, where the second thickness is greater than the first thickness (see, e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). In one example, the first thickness is substantially greater than a difference between the first thickness and the second thickness, for example, at least two times greater, and in one embodiment, at least five times greater.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">In one embodiment, paddle <b>12</b> defines an aperture <b>46</b> extending therethrough via each of major, substantially planar section <b>30</b> of front surface <b>24</b> and major, substantially planar section <b>40</b> of rear surface <b>26</b>. Aperture <b>46</b> is sized just slightly larger than a diameter of string <b>16</b> to facilitate coupling of string <b>16</b> to paddle <b>12</b> as will be described in greater detail below. Paddle <b>12</b> may incorporate other additional or alternative features to facilitate string <b>16</b> attachment to paddle <b>12</b> as will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reading the current application.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">In one embodiment, transaction product <b>10</b> additionally includes a first or front panel <b>50</b> and/or a second or rear panel <b>70</b> each configured to be adhered to paddle <b>12</b>, e.g., as stickers, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9</figref>. More specifically, in one embodiment, front panel <b>50</b> is sized and shaped substantially identical to major, substantially planar section <b>30</b> of front surface <b>24</b> and, therefore, defines an enlarged portion <b>52</b> and a handle portion <b>54</b>. Front panel <b>50</b> is relatively thin and substantially planar defining a first or rear surface <b>56</b> and a second or front surface <b>58</b> opposite rear surface <b>56</b>. Rear surface <b>56</b> is coated in adhesive and/or is otherwise configured to be applied and secured to major, substantially planar section <b>30</b> of front surface <b>24</b> of paddle <b>12</b>. Enlarged portion <b>52</b> and handle portion <b>54</b> of front panel <b>50</b> align with the part of major, substantially planar section <b>30</b> that partially forms enlarged portion <b>20</b> and handle <b>22</b> of paddle <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, front panel <b>50</b> defines or is later punctured to define an aperture <b>64</b> through a center of enlarged portion <b>20</b> that aligns with aperture <b>46</b> of paddle <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">Front surface <b>58</b> of front panel <b>50</b> includes decorative indicia <b>60</b> for paddle <b>12</b>. For example, as illustrated, decorative indicia <b>60</b> are used to depict paddle <b>12</b> as a tennis or other racquet with a handle and webbed portion corresponding with handle <b>22</b> and enlarged portion <b>20</b> of paddle <b>12</b>. Other decorative indicia <b>60</b> are also contemplated such as that indicia linking paddle <b>12</b> to a season, occasion, holiday, celebration, theme, character, movie, book, television show, etc. as will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reading this application. In one embodiment, front panel <b>50</b> includes brand indicia <b>62</b>, which, in one example, includes one or more of a logo, text, trademark, etc. that associate transaction product <b>10</b> with at least one of a product, a brand, a store, department, bank, etc. Front panel <b>50</b> is one example of means for displaying aesthetic enhancements to transaction product <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">In one embodiment, rear panel <b>70</b> is sized and shaped substantially identical to major, substantially planar section <b>40</b> of rear surface <b>26</b> and, therefore, defines an enlarged portion <b>72</b> and a handle portion <b>74</b>. Like front panel <b>50</b>, rear panel <b>70</b> is relatively thin and substantially planar defining a first or front surface <b>76</b> and a second or rear surface <b>78</b> opposite front surface <b>76</b>. Front surface <b>76</b> is coated in adhesive and/or is otherwise configured to be applied and secured to major, substantially planar section <b>40</b> of rear surface <b>26</b> of paddle <b>12</b>. Enlarged portion <b>72</b> and handle portion <b>74</b> align with the parts of major, substantially planar section <b>40</b> that partially forms enlarged portion <b>20</b> and handle <b>22</b> of paddle <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, rear panel <b>70</b> defines or is later punctured to define an aperture <b>84</b> through a center of enlarged portion <b>72</b> that aligns with aperture <b>46</b> of paddle <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">In one example, rear surface <b>78</b> of rear panel <b>70</b> includes account identifier <b>18</b> and/or access code <b>19</b>. In one embodiment, account identifier <b>18</b> includes a bar code printed to rear surface <b>78</b>. As such, rear panel <b>70</b> is one example of means for supporting account identifier <b>18</b> or other means for linking transaction product <b>10</b> to an account or record.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">In one embodiment, rear surface <b>78</b> of rear panel <b>70</b> includes decorative indicia <b>60</b>, for example, decorative indicia <b>60</b> similar to or visually corresponding to decorative indicia <b>60</b> on front panel <b>50</b>. Other decorative indicia <b>60</b> are also contemplated that visually link paddle <b>12</b> to a season, occasion, holiday, celebration, theme, character, movie, book, television show, etc. as will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reading this application. In one embodiment, rear surface <b>78</b> of rear panel <b>70</b> also includes brand indicia <b>62</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">In one embodiment, transaction product <b>10</b> includes redemption indicia <b>80</b>, generally indicated with a dashed box in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, such as on rear surface <b>78</b> of rear panel <b>70</b>. Redemption indicia <b>80</b> indicate that transaction product <b>10</b> is redeemable for the purchase of goods and/or services and that, upon use, a value of the purchased goods and/or services will be deducted from the account or record linked to transaction product <b>10</b>. In one embodiment, redemption indicia <b>80</b> include phrases such as “&lt;NAME OF STORE&gt; GiftCard” and “This GiftCard is redeemable for merchandise or services at any of our stores or at our web site,” and/or provides help or phone line information in the case of a lost, stolen, or damaged transaction product, etc. Notably, in one embodiment, one or more of indicia <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>80</b>, and/or other indicia described as being on one of front surface <b>58</b> of front panel <b>50</b> or rear surface <b>78</b> of rear panel <b>70</b> are additionally or alternatively included on the other one of front surface <b>58</b> of front panel <b>50</b> and rear surface <b>78</b> of rear panel <b>70</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">Ball <b>14</b> is configured to repeatedly bounce off paddle <b>12</b> and, in one embodiment, is formed of rubber. Ball <b>14</b> is sized appropriately relative to paddle <b>12</b>. In one example, where paddle <b>12</b> has a width of about 3.75 inches at its widest dimension across enlarged portion <b>20</b>, ball <b>14</b> is about 1 inch in diameter, however, a similar or smaller diameter ball may be used with the similarly sized, larger, or smaller paddles. Ball <b>14</b> is generally a sphere <b>90</b> in shape and defines a cavity or hole <b>92</b> extending entirely through a center of ball <b>14</b>. In one example, brand indicia <b>94</b> similar to and/or corresponding with brand indicia <b>60</b> are included on ball <b>14</b>, for instance, centered on an end of hole <b>92</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">String <b>16</b>, for example, formed of elastic, preferably has elastic properties allowing string <b>16</b> to stretch when ball <b>14</b> is hit by and travels away from paddle <b>12</b> in a manner that will limit a distance ball <b>14</b> can travel away from paddle <b>12</b>. String <b>16</b> defines a first end <b>100</b> and a second end <b>102</b> opposite first end <b>100</b>. First end <b>100</b> is tied to form a first knot <b>104</b> and second end <b>102</b> is thread through hole <b>92</b> of ball <b>14</b>. First knot <b>104</b> generally prevents first end <b>100</b> of string <b>16</b> from inadvertently traveling through hole <b>92</b>. Second end <b>102</b> of string <b>16</b> is thread through hole <b>92</b> in ball <b>14</b> to paddle <b>12</b> and is coupled thereto in any suitable manner. In one example, second end <b>102</b> of string <b>16</b> is thread through aperture <b>46</b> of paddle <b>12</b> and, in one embodiment, through one or both of apertures <b>64</b> and <b>84</b> in front and rear panels <b>50</b> and <b>70</b>, respectively. In one embodiment, second end <b>102</b> of string <b>16</b> is tied into a second knot <b>106</b> on a rear side of rear surface <b>26</b> of paddle <b>12</b> such that second end <b>102</b> of string <b>16</b> will not pass back through aperture <b>46</b> without untying or otherwise removing second knot <b>106</b>. Since second knot <b>106</b> is on the rear side of paddle <b>12</b>, second knot <b>106</b> will not substantially interfere with ball <b>14</b> bouncing on front surface <b>24</b> of paddle <b>12</b> and/or front surface <b>58</b> of front panel <b>50</b>. Notably, even where front panel <b>50</b> is included, ball <b>14</b> is considered to bounce off of and/or be hit by front surface <b>24</b> of paddle <b>12</b> since paddle <b>12</b>, not front panel <b>50</b>, generally defines the resistive structure capable of deflecting/hitting ball <b>14</b> to cause a bounce of ball <b>14</b> therefrom.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">To facilitate manufacture of transaction product <b>10</b> and/or to facilitate packaging of transaction product <b>10</b>, in one embodiment, string <b>16</b> is tightly secured around paddle <b>12</b>. For example, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref> and the enlarged detail view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, string <b>16</b> is secured to define a first length <b>110</b>, a wrapped portion <b>112</b>, and a free length <b>114</b>. String <b>16</b> is pulled taught to position ball <b>14</b> immediately adjacent and held tightly against front surface <b>24</b> of paddle <b>12</b> or front surface <b>58</b> of front panel <b>50</b>. First length <b>110</b> extends from aperture <b>46</b> in paddle <b>12</b> and extends linearly down toward handle <b>22</b> where string <b>16</b> is wrapped around handle <b>22</b> of paddle <b>12</b> a number of times, e.g., three times, to form wrapped portion <b>112</b>. Once wrapped around handle <b>22</b>, second end <b>102</b> of string <b>16</b> is pulled to a rear of paddle <b>12</b> and threaded from a bottom of wrapped portion <b>112</b> up between wrapped portion <b>112</b> and rear surface <b>26</b> of paddle <b>12</b>, in one embodiment, between wrapped portion <b>112</b> and rear surface <b>78</b> of rear panel <b>70</b>. In one embodiment, second end <b>102</b> extends out of wrapped portion <b>112</b> just before the last wrap of string <b>16</b> around handle <b>22</b> to secure string <b>16</b> in place such that free length <b>114</b> of string <b>16</b> extends from wrapped portion <b>112</b>. To further secure string <b>16</b> in place, in one embodiment, a wrap or sleeve <b>116</b> is placed around both free length <b>114</b> and a lower portion of first length <b>110</b> as illustrated, for example, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 10</figref>. In one embodiment, sleeve <b>116</b> is transparent or translucent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-13</figref>, transaction product <b>10</b> is supported on a carrier or backer <b>130</b> via a blister <b>132</b> to form a packaged transaction product assembly <b>134</b>. Referring, for example, to the front view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> and the rear view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, backer <b>130</b> comprises a single layer or multiple layers of paper or plastic material, for example, generally in the form of a relatively stiff but bendable/flexible card. Use of other materials is also contemplated. In one embodiment, backer <b>130</b> defines a first or front surface <b>140</b> and a second or rear surface <b>142</b> positioned opposite front surface <b>140</b>, where the front as described with respect to backer <b>130</b> refers to a surface configured to face potential consumers when positioned in a retail display. In one example, one or both of front surface <b>140</b> and rear surface <b>142</b> are substantially planar. Backer <b>130</b> displays indicia, graphics or text information including store logo(s), store name(s), slogans, advertising, instructions, directions, brand indicia, promotional information, holiday indicia, seasonal indicia, media format identifiers, characters and/or other information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">For example, in one embodiment, backer <b>130</b> includes decorative indicia <b>144</b>, which makes backer <b>130</b> more aesthetically pleasing to potential consumers, and also ties the visual aesthetic of backer <b>130</b> to the appearance of transaction product <b>10</b>, e.g., to decorative indicia <b>60</b> on front panel <b>50</b> and rear panel <b>70</b>. For instance, decorative indicia <b>144</b> provide background scenery or other related graphics to a common theme of transaction product <b>10</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, where decorative indicia <b>60</b> depict transaction product <b>10</b> as a tennis racquet, decorative indicia <b>144</b> provides a tennis scene with a character playing tennis, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">In one embodiment, backer <b>130</b> includes brand indicia <b>146</b>, which identify a store, brand, department, etc. and/or services associated with transaction product <b>10</b>, and, in one example are similar to brand indicia <b>62</b> and/or <b>94</b>. In one example, backer <b>130</b> includes indicia <b>148</b> including “to,” “from,” and “amount” fields. The fields of indicia <b>148</b> provide areas of backer <b>130</b> configured to be written upon by a consumer to personalize backer <b>130</b> for presentation as a gift to a particular recipient, for a particular purpose, and/or to indicate a value of transaction product <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">In one embodiment, backer <b>130</b> includes redemption indicia <b>150</b>, generally indicated by a dashed box in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, indicating that transaction product <b>10</b> is redeemable for the purchase of goods and/or services and that upon use, a value of the purchased goods and/or services will be deducted from the financial account or record linked to transaction product <b>10</b>. In one embodiment, redemption indicia <b>150</b> include phrases such as “&lt;NAME OF STORE&gt; GiftCard” and “This GiftCard is redeemable for merchandise or services at any of our stores or at our web site,” and/or provides help or phone line information in case of a lost, stolen, or damaged transaction product, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, in one example, promotional indicia <b>152</b> advertise the non-transactional or amusing functionality of transaction product <b>10</b>. In one embodiment, promotional indicia <b>152</b> generally indicate to a bearer of packaged transaction product assembly <b>134</b> that transaction product <b>10</b> can be used as a toy by bouncing ball <b>14</b> on paddle <b>12</b>. As such, promotional indicia <b>152</b> further promote the sale of transaction product <b>10</b> by drawing the attention of a potential consumer to the non-transactional and amusing feature(s) of packaged transaction product <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">Any of indicia <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>80</b>, <b>94</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, <b>148</b>, <b>150</b>, and <b>152</b> and/or other indicia optionally may appear anywhere on backer <b>130</b> or transaction product <b>10</b>. Additional information besides that specifically described and illustrated herein may also be included and/or one or more of indicia <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>80</b>, <b>94</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, <b>148</b>, <b>150</b>, and <b>152</b> may be eliminated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">In one embodiment, backer <b>130</b> includes a window or opening <b>160</b> for displaying account identifier <b>18</b> of transaction product <b>10</b> therethrough as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. As previously described, account identifier <b>18</b> is adapted for accessing an account or a record associated with transaction product <b>10</b> for activating, loading value to or debiting value from the account or record. In one example, transaction product <b>10</b> is coupled with or positioned adjacent front surface <b>140</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>) of backer <b>130</b>, and a bearer viewing rear surface <b>142</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) of backer <b>130</b>, which is opposite front surface <b>140</b>, can view or access account identifier <b>18</b> through opening <b>160</b>. Accordingly, opening <b>160</b> allows viewing or other access to account identifier <b>18</b> to activate and/or load transaction product <b>10</b> without removing transaction product <b>10</b> from backer <b>130</b>. In one embodiment (not shown), a portion of backer <b>130</b> alternatively is configured to be folded away from the remainder of backer <b>130</b> to access account identifier <b>18</b> without removing transaction product <b>10</b> from backer <b>130</b>. Other foldable or non-foldable backers can be used having various sizes and shapes for supporting transaction product <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">In one embodiment, backer <b>130</b> defines a top edge <b>162</b> and an opposite, bottom edge <b>164</b>. Near top edge <b>162</b>, backer <b>130</b> defines an aperture <b>166</b> or hook configured to receive a support rod or similar structure in a retail display such that backer <b>130</b>, and therefore, packaged transaction product assembly <b>134</b> as a whole, can be hung therefrom. In one embodiment, bottom edge <b>164</b> of backer <b>130</b> is defined to substantially follow an outline of decorative indicia <b>144</b> near the bottom of rear surface <b>142</b> of backer <b>130</b> in a non-linear manner. One or more fold lines <b>168</b> are defined by backer <b>130</b> near a lower portion thereof to divide backer <b>130</b> into a first or top section <b>170</b> and a second or bottom section <b>172</b>. Bottom section <b>172</b> of backer <b>130</b> folds up around fold line(s) <b>168</b> to cover a portion of top section <b>170</b> such that a portion of rear surface <b>142</b> defined by bottom section <b>172</b> is viewable along with a portion of front surface <b>140</b> defined by top section <b>170</b> when packaged transaction product assembly <b>134</b> is viewed from the front as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. In one embodiment, the portion of top section <b>170</b> covered by bottom section <b>172</b> when bottom section <b>172</b> is so folded is less than about 75% and, in one embodiment, is less than about 50% (i.e., half) of the top section <b>170</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">In one embodiment, decorative indicia <b>144</b> on the portion of rear surface <b>142</b> defined by bottom section <b>172</b> that is viewable in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> correspond with decorative indicia <b>144</b> on the portion of front surface <b>140</b> defined by top section <b>170</b> and are viewable in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> to form a synergistic scene. In one embodiment, e.g., where two fold lines <b>168</b> are included, folded bottom section <b>172</b> is positioned in front of and spaced from the portion of front surface <b>140</b> visible in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, and the bottom edge <b>164</b> of backer <b>130</b> is positioned so the synergist scene takes on a partially three-dimensional effect, which further contributes to the promotional draw and functionality of the packaged transaction product assembly <b>134</b>. Other variations in the formation of backer <b>130</b> will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reading the present application.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">Blister <b>132</b> is vacuum formed or otherwise molded from transparent and/or translucent plastic (e.g., polyvinyl chloride) or other suitable material to define a cavity <b>182</b> sized and shaped to specifically receive transaction product <b>10</b>. More particularly, in one embodiment, blister <b>132</b> is in the form of a plastic shell defining cavity <b>182</b>, which includes a paddle section <b>186</b> and a ball section <b>188</b>, and a perimeter flange <b>184</b> extending around cavity. Perimeter flange <b>184</b> defines a substantially planar rear surface (not shown) of blister <b>132</b> configured to be adhered or otherwise coupled to front surface <b>140</b> of backer <b>130</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">Paddle section <b>186</b> of blister <b>132</b> defines a relatively thin section of cavity <b>182</b> adjacent to but forwardly offset from perimeter flange <b>184</b>. Paddle section <b>186</b> is sized and shaped to receive paddle <b>12</b> of transaction product <b>10</b> and to generally maintain transaction product <b>10</b> in place within first cavity portion <b>180</b>. In one embodiment, ball section <b>188</b> is centered with respect to an enlarged portion of paddle section <b>186</b> and is sized, shaped, and positioned to receive ball <b>14</b> when it is pulled against paddle <b>12</b> in the position illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref>. As such, ball section <b>188</b> is concave and rounded to generally follow the contour of ball <b>14</b> extending from paddle <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a flow chart illustrating a method of assembling transaction product <b>10</b> as generally indicated at <b>200</b>. At <b>202</b>, transaction product <b>10</b> is manufactured. For example, at <b>204</b>, paddle <b>12</b> is provided via injection molding or other suitable formation process or via receipt from an outside paddle vendor (not shown).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">At <b>206</b>, front and rear panels <b>50</b> and <b>70</b> are secured to major, substantially planar sections <b>30</b> and <b>40</b> of front and rear surfaces <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> of paddle <b>12</b>, respectively, as illustrated, for example, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> via adhesive or other suitable coupling agent. At <b>208</b>, string <b>16</b> is coupled to paddle <b>12</b>, for example, by tying second end <b>102</b> of string <b>16</b> in second knot <b>106</b> on the rear side of paddle <b>12</b> such that string <b>16</b> extends away from second knot <b>106</b> through aperture <b>46</b> in paddle <b>12</b>. At <b>210</b>, which may occur before, after, or simultaneously with operation <b>208</b>, string <b>16</b> is coupled to ball <b>14</b>, for example, by tying first end <b>100</b> of string <b>16</b> in a first knot <b>104</b> on one side of ball <b>14</b> with string extending away from first knot <b>104</b> through hole <b>92</b> in ball <b>14</b>. Other methods of coupling string <b>16</b> to ball <b>14</b> and/or paddle <b>12</b> will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reading this application.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">After string <b>16</b> is coupled to paddle <b>12</b> and ball <b>14</b>, then at <b>212</b>, string <b>16</b> is pulled rearwardly through aperture <b>46</b> of paddle <b>12</b> to position ball <b>14</b> directly adjacent front surface <b>24</b> of paddle <b>12</b> or front surface <b>58</b> of front panel <b>50</b>. At <b>214</b>, string <b>16</b> is pulled downwardly from aperture <b>46</b> toward handle <b>22</b> of paddle <b>12</b> to define a first length <b>110</b> and is subsequently wrapped around handle <b>22</b> a number of times, e.g., three times, to form wrapped portion <b>112</b> of string <b>16</b>. At <b>216</b>, second end <b>102</b> of string <b>16</b> is looped through wrapped portion <b>112</b> of string <b>16</b> to at least partially secure string <b>16</b> in place relative to paddle <b>12</b> and extend away from wrapped portion <b>112</b> to define a free length <b>114</b> extending from wrapped portion <b>112</b> to second end <b>102</b> of string <b>16</b>. In one embodiment, operation <b>216</b> includes further securing string <b>16</b> in place relative to paddle <b>12</b> by placing sleeve <b>116</b> around first length <b>110</b> and free length <b>114</b> of string <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">After string <b>16</b> is secured in place, account identifier <b>18</b> is added to transaction product <b>10</b>. In one embodiment, where account identifier <b>18</b> is a bar code, transaction product <b>10</b> with string <b>16</b> wrapped around paddle <b>12</b> as described above is moved through printing machines to print the bar code, in one example, a different, unique bar code, to each transaction product <b>10</b>. The wrapping of string <b>16</b> and securement of string <b>16</b> around paddle <b>12</b> allows transaction product <b>10</b> as a whole to be moved through printing machines, which, in one embodiment, is more efficient than printing paddle <b>12</b> with account identifier <b>18</b> and then coupling string <b>16</b> with ball <b>14</b> thereto since printing often occurs at a different facility than the facility that assembles paddle <b>12</b>, ball <b>14</b>, and string <b>16</b>. Therefore, printing a fully assembled transaction product <b>10</b> may save the time and expense of sending printed paddles back to the first facility for additional assembly. One of skill in the art will recognize that similar considerations and processes would also apply to the application of RFID tags, magnetic strips, and other forms of account identifier <b>18</b> to paddle <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, account identifier <b>18</b> is alternatively added through opening <b>160</b> in backer <b>130</b> (i.e., after operation <b>220</b> described below) such that no assembly of packaged transaction product assembly <b>134</b> is performed after account identifier <b>18</b> is added.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">At <b>220</b>, transaction product <b>10</b> is packaged for retail sale. More specifically, at <b>222</b>, transaction product <b>10</b> is placed in cavity <b>182</b> of blister <b>132</b>, for example, by placing ball <b>14</b> in ball portion <b>188</b> of cavity <b>182</b> and paddle <b>12</b> in paddle portion <b>186</b> of cavity <b>182</b>. When so positioned, rear surface <b>26</b>, even rim <b>42</b>, is fully positioned within cavity <b>182</b> and offset at least slightly from a rear surface (not shown) of perimeter flange <b>184</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">At <b>224</b>, rear surface (not shown) of perimeter flange <b>184</b> of blister <b>132</b> is positioned on front surface <b>140</b> of backer <b>130</b> and secured thereto. For instance, in one example, heat and pressure are applied to perimeter flange <b>184</b> and backer <b>130</b> to activate heat-seal adhesive on the rear surface of perimeter flange <b>184</b>. Other suitable coupling methods may also be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">In one embodiment, at <b>226</b>, bottom section <b>172</b> of backer <b>130</b> is folded forwardly and upwardly about fold line(s) <b>168</b> to cover a portion of transaction product <b>10</b>, e.g., a portion of paddle <b>12</b>, and blister <b>132</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. In one embodiment, the portion of transaction product <b>10</b> or paddle <b>12</b> covered by bottom section <b>172</b> when bottom section <b>172</b> is so folded is less than about 75% and, in one embodiment, is less than about 50% (i.e., half) of transaction product <b>10</b> and/or paddle <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">When so folded, decorative indicia <b>144</b> on rear surface <b>142</b> of bottom section <b>172</b> is positioned in front of and is visible concurrently with decorative indicia <b>144</b> on front surface <b>140</b> of top portion and decorative indicia <b>60</b> on front surface <b>58</b> of front panel <b>50</b> applied to paddle <b>12</b> to create a synergistic visual presentation with varying levels of depth, thereby, increasing the visual interest of packaged transaction product assembly <b>134</b> and promoting sale of packaged transaction product assembly <b>134</b> to potential consumers who view packaged transaction product assembly <b>134</b>. Once fully assembled, packaged transaction product <b>10</b> is ready for retail display, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a flow chart illustrating one embodiment of a method <b>240</b> of encouraging purchase and facilitating use of transaction product <b>10</b> by consumers and/or recipients. At <b>242</b>, transaction product <b>10</b> is placed on or hung from a rack, shelf, or other similar device to display transaction product <b>10</b> for sale to potential consumers, for example, via backer <b>130</b> where transaction product <b>10</b> is displayed as part of packaged transaction product assembly <b>134</b>. In one embodiment, a depiction of transaction product <b>10</b> is additionally or alternatively placed on a website for viewing and purchase by potential consumers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">At <b>244</b>, a consumer who has decided to purchase transaction product <b>10</b> presents transaction product <b>10</b> alone or as part of packaged transaction product assembly <b>134</b> to a retail store employee, retail store kiosk, remote terminal, or other person or device to scan account identifier <b>18</b> using a point-of-sale terminal or other machine to access an account or record linked to account identifier <b>18</b>. In particular, account identifier <b>18</b> is scanned or otherwise accessed, for example through opening <b>160</b> of backer <b>130</b> to activate packaged transaction product assembly <b>134</b>, more particularly, transaction product <b>10</b> and the account or record linked thereto. Upon accessing the account or record, then, at <b>246</b>, value is added to the account or record in the form of monetary value, points, minutes, etc. Thus, transaction product <b>10</b> is activated and loaded for use toward one or more purchases of goods and/or services.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">In one example, a predetermined value is associated with transaction product <b>10</b> (i.e., associated with the account or record linked to transaction product <b>10</b> via account identifier <b>18</b>) prior to activation and display, but such predetermined value is not initially available for use toward the purchase or use of goods and/or services. In such an embodiment, at <b>244</b>, transaction product <b>10</b> is activated to permit subsequent access to the predetermined value (e.g., subsequent loading on and debiting from the account or record) and no additional value is added during activation such that operation <b>246</b> may be eliminated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">Once transaction product <b>10</b> is activated and loaded, transaction product <b>10</b> can be used by the consumer or any other bearer of transaction product <b>10</b> to purchase goods and/or services at the affiliated retail setting (e.g., a retail store or website) or can be used in exchange for calling minutes, etc. In one embodiment, where transaction product <b>10</b> is displayed on a website at <b>242</b>, then, at <b>244</b>, transaction product <b>10</b> may be activated in any suitable method and may not require the physical scanning of account identifier <b>18</b> to be activated or to otherwise access the associated account or record such as at <b>246</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">In one example, at <b>248</b>, the retail store or other affiliated retail setting or website accepts transaction product <b>10</b> as payment toward the purchase of goods and/or services made by the current bearer of transaction product <b>10</b>. In particular, the value currently loaded on transaction product <b>10</b> (i.e., stored or recorded in the account or record linked to account identifier <b>18</b>) is applied toward the purchase of goods and/or services. At <b>250</b>, additional value is optionally loaded on transaction product <b>10</b> at a point-of-sale terminal, kiosk or other area of the retail store or related setting either during the same or during a subsequent transaction than the transaction in which transaction product <b>10</b> is accepted at <b>248</b>. Upon accepting transaction product <b>10</b> as payment at <b>248</b>, the retail store or related setting can subsequently perform either operation <b>248</b> or operation <b>250</b> as requested by a current bearer of transaction product <b>10</b>. Similarly, upon loading additional value on transaction product <b>10</b> at <b>250</b>, the retail store or related setting can subsequently perform either operation <b>250</b> again or operation <b>248</b>. In one example, the ability to accept transaction product <b>10</b> as payment for goods and/or services is limited by whether the account or record associated with transaction product <b>10</b> has any value stored or recorded therein at the time of attempted redemption.</div>

Upon purchasing transaction product <b>10</b>, a retail store employee, a retail store kiosk or other person or device scans account identifier <b>18</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 12</figref>) through opening <b>160</b> of backer <b>130</b> or otherwise reads or accesses account identifier <b>18</b>. Upon accessing account identifier <b>18</b>, the account or record linked to account identifier <b>18</b> is accessed and activated to load value onto transaction product <b>10</b> (i.e., load value to the account or record associated with transaction product <b>10</b>). In one embodiment, such as where transaction product <b>10</b> is purchased at <b>272</b> via a website, actual scanning or other mechanical detection of account identifier <b>18</b> may be eliminated. Please note that for purposes of this application, the term “purchase” as used with respect to purchasing transaction product <b>10</b> and/or packaged transaction product assembly <b>134</b> does not imply that a price in addition to the value added to the associated account or record must be tendered, but rather completion of the transaction of activating and loading transaction product <b>10</b> such that transaction product <b>10</b> is free to leave the store with the consumer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068">At <b>274</b>, the consumer optionally gives transaction product <b>10</b>, for example, as part of packaged transaction product assembly <b>134</b>, to a recipient, such as a graduate, relative, friend, expectant parents, one having a recent or impending birthday, a couple having a recent or impending anniversary, etc. In one embodiment, a plurality of transaction product <b>10</b> are purchased and given to partygoers, such as at a birthday party, etc. as party favors or gifts. As an alternative, the consumer can keep transaction product <b>10</b> for his or her own use thereby eliminating operation <b>274</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">At <b>276</b>, the consumer, recipient, or other current bearer of transaction product <b>10</b> interacts with the non-transactional features thereof for amusement.
