<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is directed to a material adapted to reduce vibration and, more specifically, to a method of making a material adapted to dissipate and evenly distribute vibrations acting on the material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Handles of sporting equipment, bicycles, hand tools, etc. are often made of wood, metal or polymer that transmit vibrations that can make the items uncomfortable for prolonged gripping. Sporting equipment, such as bats, balls, shoe insoles and sidewalls, also transmit vibrations during the impact that commonly occurs during athletic contests. These vibrations can be problematic in that they can potentially distract the player's attention, adversely effect performance, and/or injure a portion of a player's body.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Rigid polymer materials are typically used to provide grips for tools and sports equipment. The use of rigid polymers allows users to maintain control of the equipment but is not very effective at reducing vibrations. While it is known that softer materials provide better vibration regulation characteristics, such materials do not have the necessary rigidity for incorporation into sporting equipment, hand tools, shoes or the like. This lack of rigidity allows unintended movement of the equipment encased by the soft material relative to a user's hand or body.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Prolonged or repetitive contact with excessive vibrations can injure a person. The desire to avoid such injury can result in reduced athletic performance and decreased efficiency when working with tools.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Clearly what is needed is a method of making a material adapted to regulate vibration that provides the necessary rigidity for effective vibration distribution and for a user to maintain the necessary control of the implement; and that can dampen and reduce vibrational energy.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY</heading>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">Certain terminology is used in the following description for convenience only and is not limiting. The words “right,” “left,” “top,” and “bottom” designate directions in the drawings to which reference is made. The words “inwardly” and “outwardly” refer to directions toward and away from, respectively, the geometric center of the material and designated parts thereof. The term “implement,” as used in the specification and in the claims, means “any one of a baseball bat, racquet, hockey stick, softball bat, sporting equipment, firearm, or the like.” The term “particles,” as used in the claims and in the corresponding portions of the specification, means “small bits or pieces of mass each defining a volume but generally being of insufficient, length to interweave together.” Additionally, the words “a” and “one” are defined as including one or more of the referenced item unless specifically stated otherwise. The above terminology includes the words above specifically mentioned, derivatives thereof, and words of similar import.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8</figref>, wherein like numerals indicate like elements throughout, there are shown preferred embodiments of a material, generally designated <b>10</b>, that is adapted to regulate vibration. Briefly stated, the material <b>10</b> preferably includes a vibration dissipating material <b>12</b> (preferably an elastomer layer). The vibration dissipating material <b>12</b> penetrates a support structure <b>17</b> to embed the support structure <b>17</b> thereon (as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) and/or therein (as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>). The support structure <b>17</b> is preferably semi-rigid (but can be rigid without departing from the scope of the present invention) and supports the vibration dissipating material <b>12</b>. The support structure can be formed by a second elastomer layer of same or differing rigidity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">The material <b>10</b> of the present invention was the result of extensive research and was throughly tested by Villanova University's Department of Mechanical Engineering by a professor having a Ph.D. in vibratory physics. Testing of the material <b>10</b> determined that the material <b>10</b> can reduce the magnitude of sensible vibration by eighty (80%) percent. The material <b>10</b> has verified, superior vibration dissipation properties due to the embedded support structure <b>17</b> that is located on and/or in the elastomer <b>12</b>. In addition to evenly distributing vibration, the support structure <b>17</b> contributes to the absorption of vibration and supports the vibration dissipating material <b>12</b> to prevent the layer of vibration dissipating material <b>12</b> from twisting or otherwise becoming unsuitable for use as a grip or padding.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">While it is preferred that the vibration dissipating material layer <b>12</b> be formed by elastomer, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate from this disclosure that the vibration dissipating material <b>12</b> can be formed by any suitable polymer without departing from the scope of the present invention. For clarity only, the vibration dissipating material <b>12</b> will be often described herein as being an elastomer without any mention of the material possibly being a polymer. However, it should understood that even when the layer <b>12</b> is only described as being an elastomer, that the present invention also includes the material <b>12</b> being a any suitable polymer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">The material <b>10</b> of the present invention can be incorporated into athletic gear, grips for sports equipment, grips for tools, and protective athletic gear. More specifically, the material <b>10</b> can be used: to form grips for a tennis racquet, hockey sticks, golf clubs, baseball bats or the like; to form protective athletic gear for mitts, headbands, mouth guards, face protection devices, helmets, gloves, pads, exercise pads, elevator pads, padding that is stood on, padding that is wrapped around objects to protect people from injury when colliding with such objects, hip pads, shoulder pads, chest protectors, or the like; to form seats or handle bar covers for bicycles, motorcycles, or the like; to form boots for skiing, roller blading or the like; to form footwear, such as shoe soles and inserts; to form grips for firearms, hand guns, rifles, shotguns, or the like; and to form grips for tools such as hammers, drills, circular saws, chisels or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">The elastomer layer <b>12</b> acts as a shock absorber by converting mechanical vibrational energy into heat energy. The embedded support structure <b>17</b> redirects vibrational energy and provides increased stiffness to the material <b>10</b> to facilitate a user's ability to control an implement <b>20</b> encased, or partially encased, by the material <b>10</b>. The elastomer layer <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>A, or <b>12</b>B may include a plurality of fibers <b>14</b> (further described below) or a plurality of particles <b>15</b> (further described below). The incorporation of the support structure <b>17</b> on and/or within the material <b>10</b> allows the material <b>10</b> to be formed by a single elastomer layer without the material <b>10</b> being unsuitable for at least some of the above-mentioned uses. The support structure <b>17</b> may also include a plurality of fibers <b>14</b> or a plurality of particles <b>15</b>. However, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate from this disclosure that additional layers of material can be added to any of the embodiments of the present invention disclosed below without departing from the scope of the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">In the situation where the support structure <b>17</b> is formed by a second elastomer layer, the two elastomer layers can be secured together via an adhesive layer, discreet adhesive locations, or using any other suitable method to secure the layers together. Regardless of the material used to form the support structure <b>17</b>, the support structure is preferably located and configured to support the first elastomer layer (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2B</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">It is preferred that the material <b>10</b> have a single contiguous elastomer body <b>12</b>. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the support structure has first and second major surfaces <b>23</b>, <b>25</b>. In one embodiment, the elastomer <b>12</b> extends through the support structure <b>17</b> so that the portion of the elastomer <b>12</b>A contacting the first major support structure surface <b>23</b> (i.e., the top of the support structure <b>17</b>) and the portion of the elastomer <b>12</b>B contacting the second major support structure surface <b>25</b> (i.e., the bottom of the support structure) form the single contiguous elastomer body <b>12</b>. Elastomer material provides vibration damping by dissipating vibrational energy. Suitable elastomer materials include, but are not limited, urethane rubbers, silicone rubbers, nitrile rubbers, butyl rubbers, acrylic rubbers, natural rubbers, styrene-butadiene rubbers, and the like. In general, any suitable elastomer or polymer material can be used to form the vibration dissipating layer <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">The softness of elastomer materials can be quantified using Shore A durometer ratings. Generally speaking, the lower the durometer rating, the softer the material and the more effective a material layer is at absorbing and dissipating vibration because less force is channeled through the material. When a soft material is squeezed, an individual's fingers are imbedded in the material which increases the surface area of contact between the user's hand and creates irregularities in the outer material surface to allow a user to firmly grasp any implement <b>20</b> covered, or partially covered, by the material. However, the softer the material, the less control a user has when manipulating an implement <b>20</b> covered by the material. If the elastomer layer is too soft (i.e., if the elastomer layer has too low of a Shore A Durometer rating), then the implement <b>20</b> may rotate unintentionally relative to a user's hand or foot. The material <b>10</b> of the present invention is preferably designed a Shore A durometer rating that provides an optimum balance between allowing a user to precisely manipulate and control the implement <b>20</b> and effectively damping vibration during use of the implement <b>20</b> depending on the activity engaged in.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">It is preferable, but not necessary, that the elastomer used with the material <b>10</b> have a Shore A durometer of between approximately ten (10) and approximately eighty (80). It is more preferred that the elastomer <b>12</b> have a Shore A durometer of between approximately fifteen (15) and approximately forty-five (45).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">The elastomer <b>12</b> is preferably used to absorb vibrational energy and to convert vibrational energy into heat energy. The elastomer <b>12</b> also provides a compliant and comfortable grip for a user to grasp (or provides a surface for a portion of a user's body, such as the under sole of a user's foot when the material <b>10</b> is formed as a shoe insert).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">In one embodiment, the material <b>10</b> preferably has a Shore A durometer of approximately fifteen (15). In another embodiment, the material <b>10</b> preferably has a Shore A Shore Durometer of approximately forty two (42). In yet another embodiment, the material <b>10</b> preferably has a Shore A Durometer of approximately thirty-two (32). Of course, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the Shore A Durometer of the material <b>10</b> can varied without departing from the scope of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, the support structure <b>17</b> can include any one (or combination of) of a polymer, an elastomer, particles, a plurality of fibers, a plurality of woven fibers, a cloth, and a plurality of cloth layers. If the support structure <b>17</b> and the layer <b>12</b> are both polymers or both elastomers, then they can be the same or different from each other without departing from the scope of the present invention. If vibration dissipating material is <b>12</b> if formed of the same material as the support structure <b>17</b>, then the support structure <b>17</b> can be made more rigid than the main layer <b>12</b> by embedding fibers <b>14</b> therein. It is preferable that the support structure <b>17</b> is generally more rigid than the vibration dissipating material <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring specifically to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the support structure <b>17</b> may be formed of an elastomer that may but does not necessarily, also have fibers <b>14</b> embedded therein (examplary woven fibers are shown throughout portions of FIG. <b>3</b>). Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the support structure <b>17</b> may be formed by a plurality of woven fibers <b>18</b>. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the support structure <b>17</b> may be formed by a plurality of fibers <b>14</b>. Regardless of the material forming the support structure <b>17</b>, it is preferable that passageways <b>19</b> extend into the support structure <b>17</b> to allow the elastomer <b>12</b> to penetrate and embed the support structure <b>17</b>. The term “embed,” as used in the claim and in the corresponding portions of the specification, means “contact sufficiently to secure thereon and/or therein.” Accordingly, the support structure <b>17</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is embedded by the elastomer <b>12</b> even though the elastomer <b>12</b> does not fully enclose the support structure <b>17</b>. Additionally, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the support structure <b>17</b> can be located at any level or height within the elastomer <b>12</b> without departing from the scope of the present invention. While the passageways <b>19</b> are shown as extending completely through the support structure <b>17</b>, the invention includes passageways <b>19</b> that extend partially through the support structure <b>17</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, in one embodiment, it is preferred that the support structure <b>17</b> be embedded on the elastomer <b>12</b>, with the elastomer penetrating the support structure <b>17</b>. The support structure <b>17</b> being generally along a major material surface <b>38</b> (i.e., the support structure <b>17</b> is generally along the top of the material).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">The fibers <b>14</b> are preferably, but not necessarily, formed of aramid fibers. However, the fibers can be formed from any one or combination of the following: bamboo, glass, metal, elastomer, polymer, ceramics, corn husks, and/or any other renewable resource. By using fibers from renewable resources, production costs can be reduced and the environmental friendliness of the present invention can be increased. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the fibers <b>14</b> can be woven to form a cloth <b>16</b> that is disposed on and/or within the elastomer <b>12</b>. Multiple cloth layers <b>16</b> can be epoxied or otherwise secured together and incorporated into the support structure <b>17</b>. The cloth layer <b>16</b> can be formed of woven aramid fibers or other types of fiber. The aramid fibers <b>14</b> block and redirect vibrational energy that passes through the elastomer <b>12</b> to facilitate the dissipation of vibrations. The aramid fibers <b>18</b> redirect vibrational energy along the length of the fibers <b>18</b>. Thus, when the plurality of aramid fibers <b>18</b> are woven to form the cloth <b>16</b>, vibrational energy emanating from the implement <b>20</b> that is not absorbed or dissipated by the elastomer layer <b>12</b> is redistributed evenly along the material <b>10</b> by the cloth <b>16</b> and preferably also further dissipated by the cloth <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">It is preferable that the aramid fibers <b>18</b> are formed of a suitable polyamide fiber of high tensile strength with a high resistance to elongation. However, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate from this disclosure that any aramid fiber suitable to channel vibration can be used to form the support structure <b>17</b> without departing from scope of the present invention. Additionally, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate from this disclosure that loose aramid fibers or chopped aramid fibers can be used to form the support structure <b>17</b> without departing from the scope of the present invention. The aramid fibers may also be formed of fiberglass or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">When the aramid fibers <b>18</b> are woven to form the cloth <b>16</b>, it is preferable that the cloth <b>16</b> include at least some floating aramid fibers <b>18</b>. That is, it is preferable that at least some of the plurality of aramid fibers <b>18</b> are able to move relative to the remaining aramid fibers <b>18</b> of the cloth <b>16</b>. This movement of some of the aramid fibers <b>18</b> relative to the remaining fibers of the cloth converts vibrational energy to heat energy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">Particles <b>15</b> can be located in either an elastomer layer <b>12</b>, <b>12</b>A, and/or <b>12</b>B and/or in the support structure <b>15</b>. The particles <b>15</b> increase the vibration absorption of the material of the present invention. The particles <b>15</b> can be formed of pieces of glass, polymer, elastomer, chopped aramid, ceramic, chopped fibers, sand, gel, foam, metal, mineral, glass beads, or the like. Gel particles <b>15</b> provide excellent vibration dampening due their low durometer rating. One exemplary gel that is suitable for use the present invention is silicone gel. However, any suitable gel can be used without departing from the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">The material <b>10</b> may be configured and adapted to form an insert for shoe. When the material <b>10</b> is configured to form a shoe insert, the material <b>10</b> is preferably adapted to extend along an inner surface of the shoe from a location proximate to a heel of the shoe to the toe of the shoe. In addition to forming a shoe insert, the material <b>10</b> can be located along the sides and top of the shoe to protect the wearer's foot from lateral and vertical impacts.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">The covering of the proximal end of an implement <b>20</b> by the grip <b>22</b> results</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">in reduced vibration transmission and in improved counter balancing of the distal end of the implement <b>20</b> by moving the center of mass of the implement <b>20</b> closer to the hand of a user (i.e., closer to the proximal end <b>26</b>).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-10</figref> illustrate another embodiment of the present invention. As shown therein a cover in the form of a sleeve <b>210</b> is mounted on the handle or lower portion <b>218</b> of a baseball bat <b>210</b>. Sleeve <b>210</b> is premolded so that it can be fit onto the handle portion of the bat <b>212</b> in a quick and convenient manner. This can be accomplished by having the sleeve <b>210</b> made of a stretchable or resilient material so that its upper end <b>214</b> would be pulled open and could be stretched to fit over the knob <b>217</b> of the bat <b>212</b>. Alternatively, or in addition, sleeve <b>210</b> may be provided with a longitudinal slit <b>16</b> to permit the sleeve to be pulled at least partially open and thereby facilitate snapping the sleeve <b>210</b> over the handle <b>218</b> of the bat <b>212</b>. The sleeve would remain mounted in place due to the tacky nature of the sleeve material and/or by the application of a suitable adhesive on the inner surface of the sleeve and/or on the outer surface of handle <b>218</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">A characterizing feature of sleeve <b>210</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-10</figref>, is that the lower end of the sleeve includes an outwardly extending peripheral knob <b>2220</b>. Knob <b>220</b> could be a separate cap snapped onto or secured in any other manner to the main portion of sleeve <b>210</b>. Alternatively, knob <b>220</b> could be integral with and molded as part of the sleeve <b>210</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">In a broad practice of this invention, sleeve <b>210</b> can be a single layer. The material would have the appropriate hardness and vibration dampening characteristics. The outer surface of the material would be tacky having high friction characteristics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">Alternatively, the sleeve <b>210</b> could be formed from a two layer laminate where the vibration absorbing material forms the inner layer disposed against the handle, with a separate tacky outer layer made from any suitable high friction material such as a thermoplastic material with polyurethane being one example. Thus, the two layer laminate would have an inner elastomer layer which is characterized by its vibration dampening ability, while the main characteristic of the outer elastomer layer is its tackiness to provide a suitable gripping surface that would resist the tendency for the user's hand to slide off the handle. The provision of the knob <b>220</b> also functions both as a stop member to minimize the tendency for the handle to slip from the user's hand and to cooperate in the vibration dampening affect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates the preferred form of multilayer laminate which includes the inner vibration absorbing layer <b>222</b> and the outer tacky gripping layer <b>224</b> with an intermediate layer <b>226</b> made of a stiffening material which dissipates force. If desired layer <b>226</b> could be innermost and layer <b>224</b> could be the intermediate layer. A preferred stiffening material would be aramid fibers which could be incorporated in the material in any suitable manner as later described with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-22</figref>. However, fiberglass or any high tensile strength fibrous material can be used as the stiffening material forming the layer. Additionally, in one embodiment, the stiffening layer is substantially embedded in or held in place by the elastomer layer(s).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> schematically shows what is believed to be the affect of the shock forces from vibration when the implement makes contact such as from the bat <b>212</b> striking a ball. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows the force vectors in accordance with a three layer laminate, such as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, wherein elastomeric layers <b>222</b>,<b>224</b> are made of a silicone material. The intermediate layer <b>226</b> is an aramid layer made of aramid fibers. The initial shock or vibration is shown by the lateral or transverse arrows <b>228</b> on each side of the sleeve laminate <b>210</b>. This causes the elastomeric layers <b>222</b>,<b>224</b> to be compressed along the arc <b>230</b>. The inclusion of the intermediate layer <b>226</b> made from a force dissipating material spreads the vibration longitudinally as shown by the arrows <b>232</b>. The linear spread of the vibration causes a rebound effect which totally dampens the vibration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">Laboratory tests were carried out at a prominent university to evaluate various grips mounted on baseball bats. In the testing, baseball bats with various grips were suspended from the ceiling by a thin thread; this achieves almost a free boundary condition that is needed to determine the true characteristics of the bats. Two standard industrial accelerometers were mounted on a specially fabricated sleeve roughly in positions where the left hand and the right hand would grip the bat. A known force was delivered to the bat with a standard calibrated impact hammer at three positions, one corresponding to the sweet spot, the other two simulating “miss hits” located on the mid-point and shaft of the bat. The time history of the force as well as the accelerations were routed through a signal conditioning device and were connected to a data acquisition device. This was connected to a computer which was used to log the data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">Two series of tests were conducted. In the first test, a control bat (with a standard rubber grip, WORTH Bat—model #C405) was compared to identical bats with several “Sting-Free” grips representing practices of the invention. These “Sting-Free” grips were comprised of two layers of pure silicone with various types of high tensile fibrous material inserted between the two layers of silicone. The types of KEVLAR, a type of aramid fiber that has high tensile strength, used in this test were referenced as follows: “005”, “645”, “120”, “909”. Also, a bat with just a thick layer of silicone but no KEVLAR was tested. With the exception of the thick silicone (which was deemed impractical because of the excessive thickness), the “645” bat showed the best reduction in vibration magnitudes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">The second series of tests were conducted using EASTON Bats (model #BK8) with the “645” KEVLAR in different combinations with silicone layers: The first bat tested was comprised of one bottom layer of silicone with a middle layer of the “645” KEVLAR and one top layer of silicone referred to as “111”. The second bat test was comprised of two bottom layers of silicone with a middle layer of KEVLAR and one top layer of silicone referred to as “211”. The third bat tested was comprised of one bottom layer of silicone with a middle layer of KEVLAR and two top layers of silicone referred to as “112”. The “645” bat with the “111” configuration showed the best reduction in vibration magnitudes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">In order to quantify the effect of this vibration reduction, two criteria were defined: (I) the time it takes for the vibration to dissipate to an imperceptible value; and, (2) the magnitude of vibration in the range of frequencies at which the human hand is most sensitive.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">The sting-free grips reduced the vibration in the baseball bats by both quantitative measures. In particular, the “645” KEVLAR in a “111” configuration was the best in vibration reduction. In the case of a baseball bat, the “645” reduced the bat's vibration in about ⅕ the time it took the control rubber grip to do so. The reduction in peak magnitude of vibration ranged from 60% to 80%, depending on the impact location and magnitude.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">It was concluded that the “645” KEVLAR grip in a “111” combination reduces the magnitude of sensible vibration by 80% that is induced in a baseball bat when a player hits a ball with it. This was found to be true for a variety of impacts at different locations along the length of the bat. Hence, a person using the “Sting-Free” grips of the invention would clearly experience a considerable reduction in the sting effect (pain) when using the “Sting-free” grip than one would with a standard grip.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">In view of the above tests a particularly preferred practice of the invention involves a multilayer laminate having an aramid such as KEVLAR, sandwiched between layers of pure silicone. The above indicated tests show dramatic results with this embodiment of the invention. As also indicated above, however, the laminate could comprise other combinations of layers such as a plurality of bottom layers of silicone or a plurality of top layers of silicone. other variations include a repetitive laminate assembly wherein a vibration dampening layer is innermost with a force dissipating layer against the lower vibration dampening layer and then with a second vibration dampening layer over the force dissipating layer followed by a second force dissipating layer, etc. with the final laminate layer being a gripping layer which could also be made of vibration dampening material. Among the considerations in determining which laminate should be used would be the thickness limitations and the desired vibration dampening properties.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">The various layers could have different relative thicknesses. Preferably, the vibration dampening layer, such as layer <b>222</b>, would be the thickest of the layers. The outermost gripping layer, however, could be of the same thickness as the vibration dampening layer, such as layer <b>224</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> or could be a thinner layer since the main function of the outer layer is to provide sufficient friction to assure a firm gripping action. A particularly advantageous feature of the invention where a force dissipating stiffening layer is used is that the force dissipating layer could be very thin and still achieve its intended results. Thus, the force dissipating layer would preferably be the thinnest of the layers, although it might be of generally the same thickness as the outer gripping layer. If desired the laminate could also include a plurality of vibration dampening layers (such as thin layers of gel material) and/or a plurality of stiffening force dissipating layers. Where such plural layers are used, the various layers could differ in the thickness from each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-10</figref> show the use of the invention where the sleeve <b>210</b> is mounted over a baseball bat <b>212</b> having a knob <b>217</b>. The same general type structure could also be used where the implement does not have a knob similar to a baseball bat knob. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, for example, illustrates a variation of the invention wherein the sleeve <b>210</b>A would be mounted on the handle <b>218</b>A of an implement that does not terminate in any knob. Such implement could be various types of athletic equipment, tools, etc. The sleeve <b>210</b>A, however, would still have a knob <b>2220</b>A which would include an outer gripping layer <b>224</b>A, an intermediate force dissipating layer <b>226</b>A and an inner vibration dampening layer <b>222</b>A. In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the handle <b>218</b>A extends into the knob <b>220</b>A. Thus, the inner layer <b>222</b>A would have an accommodating recess <b>34</b> for receiving the handle <b>218</b>A. The inner layer <b>222</b>A would also be of greater thickness in the knob area as illustrated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows a variation where the sleeve <b>210</b>B fits over handle <b>218</b>B without the handle <b>218</b>B penetrating the knob <b>220</b>B. As illustrated, the outer gripping layer <b>224</b>B would be of uniform thickness both in the gripping area and in the knob. Similarly, the intermediate force dissipating layer <b>226</b>B would also be of uniform thickness. The inner shock absorbing layer <b>222</b>B, however, would completely occupy the portion of the knob inwardly of the force dissipating layer <b>226</b>B since the handle <b>218</b>B terminates short of the knob <b>2220</b>B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows a variation of the invention where the gripping cover <b>236</b> does not include a knob. As shown therein, the gripping cover would be mounted over the gripping area of a handle <b>238</b> in any suitable manner and would be held in place either by a previously applied adhesive or due to the tacky nature of the innermost vibration dampening layer <b>240</b> or due to resilient characteristics of the cover <b>236</b>. Additionally, the cover might be formed directly on the handle <b>238</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, for example, shows a cover <b>236</b>B which is applied in the form of tape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> the cover <b>236</b> includes one of the laminate variations where a force dissipating layer <b>242</b> is provided over the inner vibration dampening layer <b>240</b> with a second vibration dampening layer <b>244</b> applied over force dissipating layer <b>242</b> and with a final thin gripping layer <b>246</b> as the outermost layer. As illustrated, the two vibration dampening layers <b>240</b> and <b>244</b> are the thickest layers and may be of the same or differing thickness from each other.

Other forms of covers could also be applied rather than using a tape. Similarly, the tape could be used as a means for applying a cover to other types of implements.</div>

This illustration is to show that the invention is intended to provide a vibration dampening gripping cover for the handle of an implement and that the cover need not extend beyond the gripping area. Thus, there could be portions of the implement on both ends of the handle without having the cover applied to those portions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">In a preferred practice of the invention, as previously discussed, a force dissipating stiffening layer is provided as an intermediate layer of a multilayer laminate where there is at least one inner layer of vibration dampening material and an outer layer of gripping material with the possibility of additional layers of vibration dampening material and force dissipating layers of various thickness. As noted the force dissipating layer could be innermost. The invention may also be practiced where the laminate includes one or more layers in addition to the gripping layer and the stiffening layer and the vibration dampening layer. Such additional layer(s) could be incorporated at any location in the laminate, depending on its intended function (e.g., an adhesive layer, a cushioning layer, etc.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">The force dissipating layer could be incorporated in the laminate in various manners. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, for example, illustrates a force dissipating stiffening layer <b>258</b> in the form of a generally imperforate sheet. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> illustrates a force dissipating layer <b>260</b> in the form of an open mesh sheet. This is a particularly advantageous manner of forming the force dissipating layer where it is made of KEVLAR fibers. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> illustrates a variation where the force dissipating layer <b>262</b> is formed from a plurality of individual strips of material <b>264</b> which are parallel to each other and generally identical to each other in length and thickness as well as spacing. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> shows a variation where the force dissipating layer <b>266</b> is made of individual strips <b>268</b> of different sizes and which could be disposed in a more random fashion regarding their orientation. Although all of the strips <b>268</b> are illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> as being parallel, non-parallel arrangements could also be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">The vibration dampening grip cover of this invention could be used for a wide number of implements. Examples of such implements include athletic equipment, hand tools and handlebars. For example, such athletic equipment includes bats, racquets, sticks, javelins, etc. Examples of tools include hammers, screwdrivers, shovels, rakes, brooms, wrenches, pliers, knives, handguns, air hammers, etc. Examples of handlebars include motorcycles, bicycles and various types of steering wheels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">A preferred practice of this invention is to incorporate a force dissipating layer, particularly an aramid, such as KEVLAR fiber, into a composite with at least two elastomers. One elastomer layer would function as a vibration dampening material and the other outer elastomer layer which would function as a gripping layer. The outer elastomer layer could also be a vibration dampening material. Preferably, the outer layer completely covers the composite.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">There are an almost infinite number of possible uses for the composite of laminate of this invention. In accordance with the various uses the elastomer layers may have different degrees of hardness, coefficient of friction and dampening of vibration. Similarly, the thicknesses of the various layers could also vary in accordance with the intended use. Examples of ranges of hardness for the inner vibration dampening layer and the outer gripping layer (which may also be a vibration absorbing layer) are 5-70 Durometer Shore A. One of the layers may have a range of 5-20 Durometer Shore A and the other a range of 30-70 Durometer Shore A for either of these layers. The vibration dampening layer could have a hardness of less than 5, and could even be a 000 Durometer reading. The vibration dampening material could be a gel, such as a silicone gel or a gel of any other suitable material. The coefficient of friction as determined by conventional measuring techniques for the tacky and non-porous gripping layer is preferably at least 0.5 and may be in the range of 0.6-1.5. A more preferred range is 0.7-1.2 with a still more preferred range being about 0.8-1. The outer gripping layer, when also used as a vibration dampening layer, could have the same thickness as the inner layer. When used solely as a gripping layer the thickness could be generally the same as the intermediate layer, which might be about 1/20 to ¼ of the thickness of the vibration dampening layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">The grip cover of this invention could be used with various implements as discussed above. Thus, the handle portion of the implement could be of cylindrical shape with a uniform diameter and smooth outer surface such as the golf club handle <b>238</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Alternatively, the handle could taper such as the bat handle shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-10</figref>. Other illustrated geometric shapes include the octagonal tennis racquet handle <b>238</b>A shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> or a generally oval type handle such as the hammer <b>248</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. The invention is not limited to any particular geometric shape. In addition, the implement could have an irregular shape such as a handle bar with finger receiving depressions as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. Where the outer surface of the implement handle is of non-smooth configuration the inner layer of the cover could press against and generally conform to the outer surface of the handle and the outermost gripping layer of the cover could include its own finger receiving depressions. Alternatively, the cover may be of uniform thickness of a shape conforming to the irregularities in the outer surface of the handle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">It is recognized by those skilled in the art, that changes may be made to the above-described embodiments of the invention without departing from the broad inventive concept thereof. For example, the material <b>10</b> may include additional layers (e.g., two or more additional layers) without departing from the scope of the present invention. It is understood, therefore, that this invention is not limited to the particular embodiments disclosed, but is intended to cover all modifications which are within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims and/or shown in the attached drawings.</div>
