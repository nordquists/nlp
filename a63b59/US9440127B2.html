<heading id="h-0002">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to golf clubs and golf club heads. Particular example aspects of this disclosure relate to the golf clubs and golf club heads which may include monitoring devices for monitoring aspects of a golfer's swing or overall golf game.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Golf is enjoyed by a wide variety of players—players of different genders and dramatically different ages and/or skill levels. Golf is somewhat unique in the sporting world in that such diverse collections of players can play together in golf events, even in direct competition with one another (e.g., using handicapped scoring, different tee boxes, in team formats, etc.), and still enjoy the golf outing or competition. These factors, together with the increased availability of golf programming on television (e.g., golf tournaments, golf news, golf history, and/or other golf programming) and the rise of well known golf superstars, at least in part, have increased golf's popularity in recent years, both in the United States and across the world.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Golfers at all skill levels seek to improve their performance, lower their golf scores, and reach that next performance “level.” Manufacturers of all types of golf equipment have responded to these demands, and in recent years, the industry has witnessed dramatic changes and improvements in golf equipment. For example, a wide range of different golf ball models now are available, with balls designed to complement specific swing speeds and/or other player characteristics or preferences, e.g., with some balls designed to fly farther and/or straighter; some designed to provide higher or flatter trajectories; some designed to provide more spin, control, and/or feel (particularly around the greens); some designed for faster or slower swing speeds; etc. A host of swing and/or teaching aids also are available on the market that promise to help lower one's golf scores.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Being the sole instrument that sets a golf ball in motion during play, golf clubs also have been the subject of much technological research and advancement in recent years. For example, the market has seen dramatic changes and improvements in putter designs, golf club head designs, shafts, and grips in recent years. Additionally, other technological advancements have been made in an effort to better match the various elements and/or characteristics of the golf club and characteristics of a golf ball to a particular user's swing features or characteristics (e.g., club fitting technology, ball launch angle measurement technology, ball spin rates, etc.). Further technological advancement in golf club design has also involved the incorporation of various types of monitoring devices or sensors in the golf club. Many such designs, however, have been cumbersome and unreliable. In addition, further processing of the data recorded by the sensors has been limited or not performed in a suitable manner to be most useful to golfers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">While the industry has witnessed dramatic changes and improvements to golf equipment in recent years, there is room in the art for further advances in golf club technology. Thus, while golf equipment according to the prior art provide a number of advantageous features, they nevertheless have certain limitations. The present invention seeks to overcome certain of these limitations and other drawbacks of the prior art, and to provide new features not heretofore available.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0007" num="0000">I. General Description of Example Golf Club Heads, Golf Clubs, and Methods in Accordance with this Disclosure</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">Aspects of this disclosure also relate to golf club shafts and golf club grips. Golf club shafts according to at least some example aspects of this disclosure may include: (a) a grip portion; and (b) a removable section which may include a monitoring device. The monitoring device according to at least some example aspects of this disclosure may also include: (c) one or more sensors and/or (d) a transmitter for transmitting data obtained by the one or more sensors. According to some aspects of the disclosure, the grip portion or other portion of the shaft may be configured to receive the removable section. Further, according to some aspects of the disclosure the golf club shaft (e.g., the grip portion) may be configured to receive the monitoring device directly, without a removable section. Golf club shafts of at least some example aspects of this disclosure may include metal shafts, carbon fiber shafts, etc. and be directed to any type of golf club, including wood-type golf clubs, iron-type golf clubs, putter type golf clubs, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">Additional aspects of this disclosure relate to golf club structures that include golf club shafts, e.g., of the types described above. Such golf club structures further may include one or more of: a shaft attached to the golf club head (optionally via a shaft engaging member (e.g., a hosel) or directly inserted otherwise engaged with the shaft); a grip or handle attached to the shaft; etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">Still additional aspects of this disclosure relate to methods for producing golf club structures in accordance with examples of this disclosure. Such methods may include, for example, one or more of the following steps in any desired order and/or combinations: (a) providing a golf club head e.g., by manufacturing or otherwise constructing the golf club head body, by obtaining it from a third party source, etc.; (b) engaging a shaft of the various types described above (including any or all of the various structures, features, and/or arrangements described above) with the golf club head; and (c) engaging a grip of the various types described above (including any or all of the various structures, features, and/or arrangements described above) with the shaft.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">Given the general description of various example aspects of the disclosure provided above, more detailed descriptions of various specific examples of golf clubs and golf club head structures according to the disclosure are provided below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0008" num="0000">II. Detailed Description of Example Golf Club Heads, Golf Club Structures, and Methods According to the Disclosure</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">As discussed above, it would be advantageous to have the ability to monitor and analyze aspects of a golfer's golf game, such as a golfer's golf swing. Therefore, particular aspects of the disclosure are directed to a golf club which includes a monitoring device. According to aspects of the disclosure, the monitoring device may include one or more sensors for monitoring data related to aspects of a golfer's golf game (such as the golfer's golf swing) and a transmitter configured to transmit such data. It is further understood that the data may be further processed if necessary or desired. According to aspects of the disclosure, the transmitted data may be analyzed (as will be described in below) and used to aid a golfer in improving the golfer's abilities (e.g., the golfer's golf swing). It is noted that in according to particular example aspects of the disclosure, other data (e.g., particular club data, on the course data (such as particular golf swings and the approximate location where the swings were taken on a golf course) may be monitored, transmitted and analyzed as well.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">Further, it would also be beneficial to configure the golf club such that the monitoring device is able to be removable from the golf club. For example, if a golfer wanted to use the monitoring device during practice (e.g., on a driving range) and did not want to use it during play on a golf course, it would be beneficial to have a golf club configured to allow the monitoring device to be easily engageable with, and removable from, the golf club in order to allow the golfer to selectively configure the golf club to their particular preference at a given time. If the golfer did not wish to use the monitoring device during an actual round of golf, the cartridge with monitoring device could be removed from the club and replaced with a replacement member without a monitoring device wherein the monitoring device had characteristics such as weighting and aerodynamic features so as to not change the overall characteristics of the golf club from when the monitoring device was installed on the golf club.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">Therefore, aspects of the disclosure are directed to a golf club which is configured to receive and secure the monitoring device, and is also configured to release the monitoring device. For example, aspects of the disclosure relate to a golf club which includes a golf club shaft which is configured to receive and secure the monitoring device in the golf club shaft. For example, the grip of the golf club shaft may be configured to receive and secure the monitoring device in the grip of the golf club shaft. Further, example embodiments of the disclosure relate to a golf club shaft configured to receive and secure a removable section or a cartridge (e.g., a cartridge containing the monitoring device).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">The following discussion and accompanying figures describe various example golf clubs and golf club shaft structures in accordance with the present disclosure.

In this way, acceleration, velocity, positioning of the golf club may be determined and analyzed in 3 dimensions. Further, some or all of the above data may be leveraged to create a graphical representation (e.g., a picture or video) of the golf swing. For example, a swing path may be graphically represented in 3 dimensions along an X-Y-Z frame of reference. Further, areas of the “3D golf swing” during which acceleration is taking place may be represented differently than areas of constant velocity or deceleration. For example, high acceleration takes place may be shown in red, while areas in the swing path during which constant velocity or deceleration takes place may be shown in yellow.</div>

A wide variety of different activation systems may be used without departing from this disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">For example, input from the activation system may be provided in any desired form or format without departing from the disclosure. As some more specific examples, if desired, the activation system may include a simple button, switch, or other input source that simply provides an activation or deactivation signal to the monitoring device <b>201</b> (e.g., a logical “1” or “0”). If desired, in at least some examples according to this disclosure, the activation system may activate the monitoring device <b>201</b>, based on input it receives from the remote computer <b>400</b> (described below).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">Further, while the above embodiment discussed the structural engagement between the monitoring device <b>201</b> and the golf club <b>100</b> as a means of allowing the monitoring device <b>201</b> to selectively determine which of the IMUs of the monitoring device <b>201</b> to use in capturing data associated with the golf stroke, other methods and means may be used as well, including an RFID chip or other chip, as discussed elsewhere herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">According to aspects of the disclosure, the monitoring device <b>201</b> may be configured to be charged. As described above, the monitoring device <b>201</b> may include a power supply (e.g., a battery). Further, the monitoring device <b>201</b> may be configured to receive a charging cable which will provide power to recharge the power supply. In some embodiments, the monitoring device <b>201</b> may be configured to receive the charging cable while the monitoring device <b>201</b> is in the golf club itself. For example, in embodiments where the monitoring device <b>201</b> is positioned in the shaft/grip of the golf club, the end of the golf club may be removed and the charging cable may be hooked into the monitoring device <b>201</b>. In another embodiment, the cartridge <b>200</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and/or 27-32</figref> may include integral structure to enable charging. Alternatively, according to aspects of the disclosure, the monitoring device <b>201</b> may be configured to be charged via induction charging.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">According to aspects of the disclosure, the monitoring device <b>201</b> is configured to receive information via a charging cable. For example, the charging cable may be a USB cable which is configured to connect the monitoring device <b>201</b> with computer (e.g., the remote computer <b>400</b>) or other data source. Accordingly, during the connected with the computer, the monitoring device <b>201</b> can update firmware, reboot the system, and conduct other diagnostic checks and updates as needed or instructed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A</figref> and B, the removable section <b>200</b> may include a circular portion which forms the top of the shaft and, also, an elongated portion configured to house the monitoring device <b>201</b>. According to aspects of the disclosure, the elongated portion of the removable section <b>200</b> may include guides to aid in positioning and securing the monitoring device <b>201</b> within the removable section <b>200</b>. It is noted that the removable section <b>200</b> may be configured to secure the monitoring device <b>201</b> in such a way that the monitoring device <b>201</b> does not move within the removable section <b>200</b>. For example, the removable section <b>200</b> may be configured to engage with the monitoring device <b>201</b> (e.g., a compartment which includes the exterior of the monitoring device <b>201</b>) via press fitting, snap fit mechanisms (e.g., spring loaded protrusions and corresponding detents), mechanical fasteners, etc. For example, the elongated portion may include a first arched end configured to engage a first rounded end of the compartment, a second arched end configured to engage a second rounded end of the compartment and a back portion which extends between the first arched portion and the second arched portion and is configured to engage a side of the compartment. In this way, the removable section <b>200</b> may be configured to support and stabilize the monitoring device <b>201</b>. For example, the elongated portion may be configured to secure the compartment which may be rectangular with first and second rounded ends and have a length in the range of 1.0-1.5 inches, a width of 0.4-1.0 inches and thickness of 0.2-0.45 inches.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">According to aspects of the disclosure, the elongated portion of the removable section <b>200</b> may be configured to have a particular length such that when the removable section <b>200</b> is engaged with the grip of the golf club, the removable section <b>200</b> positions the monitoring device <b>201</b> within the shaft <b>103</b> such that the monitoring device <b>201</b> is offset by a specified distance from a reference point. For example, according to one embodiment, the elongated portion of the removable section <b>200</b> may include the first arched end configured to engage a first rounded end of the compartment, the second arched end configured to engage a second rounded end of the compartment and the back portion which extends between the first arched portion and the second arched portion and is configured to engage a side of the compartment, but the first arched end, second arched end and back portion are spaced further away from the round portion of the removable section which forms the end cap. For example, the first arched end, second arched end and back portion may be spaced from the round portion by a section of the elongated portion that extends between the round portion and the upper arched end of the guide for receiving the monitoring device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">The section of the elongated portion that extends between the round portion and the upper arched end of the guide may be a particular length such that when the removable section <b>200</b> is engaged with the shaft, of the golf club, the removable section <b>200</b> positions the monitoring device <b>201</b> within the shaft such that the monitoring device <b>201</b> is offset by a specified distance from a reference point. Further, as each different golf club in the set of golf club has a center of mass that is in a different location than the other golf clubs in the set, the removable section <b>200</b> associated with each of the respective, different golf clubs in the set may have to be configured differently in order to ensure the that the respective monitoring device <b>201</b> is positioned within the shaft, such that the monitoring device <b>201</b> is offset by a specified distance from a reference point. For example, the length of the section of the elongated portion that extends between the round portion and the upper arched end of the guide may be a different for each of the respective removable sections <b>200</b> in the golf club set in order to ensure the that the respective monitoring device <b>201</b> is positioned within the shaft, such that the monitoring device <b>201</b> is offset by a specified distance from a reference point.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates embodiments of such removable sections <b>201</b>. As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-12</figref>, according to a particular embodiment of the disclosure, a first removable section <b>200</b> associated with a first golf club of the set of golf clubs may have a first elongated portion that has a first length, while a second removable section <b>200</b> associated with a second, different golf club of the set of golf clubs may have a second elongated portion that has a second length which is different (e.g., longer) from the first length. Further, as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, according to a particular embodiment of the disclosure, a third removable section <b>200</b> associated with a third, different golf club of the set of golf clubs may have a third elongated portion that has a third length, which is different (e.g., longer) than the first or second lengths. For example, a shorter club (e.g., a pitching wedge) may have the removable section <b>200</b> with the elongated portion that has the first length while a longer club (e.g., a long iron or hybrid type golf club) may have the removable section <b>200</b> with the elongated portion that has the second length. Further, an even longer club (e.g., a driver) may have the removable section <b>200</b> with the elongated portion that has the third length. It is noted that while only three embodiments are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, each of the golf clubs in the set could have a removable section <b>200</b> with an elongated portion of a different length (e.g., increasing longer as the length of the club increases) in order to position the monitoring device <b>201</b> in the correct positioning.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">According to other embodiments of the disclosure, the removable sections <b>200</b> may have other structures as well. For example, according to some embodiments of the disclosure, the removable sections <b>200</b> may be a self-locating, conical structure in which the monitoring device <b>201</b> is received. The conical structure may be configured to engage with the interior of the shaft <b>103</b> of the golf club <b>100</b> in order to position the monitoring device <b>201</b> in the appropriate position within the shaft <b>103</b>. For example, the multitude of conical removable sections <b>200</b> for engagement with the different clubs in a set of golf clubs may be longer and wider (e.g., have an increased diameter) to position the monitoring device <b>201</b> in the appropriate position within the shaft <b>103</b>. According to some embodiments of the disclosure, the interior of the golf club shaft <b>103</b> may include a structured (e.g., positioning recesses/protrusions or ledges) which are configured to engage with the removable sections <b>200</b> and position the monitoring device <b>201</b> in the appropriate position within the shaft <b>103</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">While the concept of a set of golf clubs in which each club may be configured such that it secures its respective monitoring device <b>201</b> at a common point respective to each of the golf clubs in the set (e.g., such that the monitoring device <b>201</b> is offset by an identical specified distance from a reference point which is common to each of the golf clubs in the set) has been illustrated with respect to a removable section <b>200</b>, it is noted that other means may be used as well, such as those described in incorporated U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/665,834.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A-C</figref> show illustrative removable sections <b>200</b> according to aspects of this disclosure.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">As seen <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the illustrative monitoring device <b>201</b> includes a plurality of openings <b>201</b> <i>o </i>which are arranged such that the openings <b>201</b> <i>o </i>can accommodate each of the unique arrangements of the protrusions of the various removable sections <b>200</b>. In this example, there are nine opening <b>201</b> <i>o </i>which are configured to receive the protrusions of the various removable sections <b>200</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">It is noted that these embodiments are merely illustrative and not meant to be limiting. For example, while nine openings and 5-7 protrusions are discussed in the illustrative embodiments, it is clear that any combination of openings and protrusions may be used provided the combination will sufficiently allow the monitoring device <b>201</b> to selectively determine the piece of sports equipment with which the monitoring device <b>201</b> has been engaged and, further, select the particular characteristics it will measure and the data it will collect. For example, other protrusions <b>200</b> <i>p </i>(e.g., number of protrusions, arrangements of protrusions) and sets of openings <b>201</b> <i>o </i>(e.g., number of openings, arrangements of openings) may be used in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">It is noted that in some embodiments, the protrusions of the removable sections <b>200</b> may be configured to activate detecting switches within monitoring device <b>201</b> which cause the processor <b>204</b> to determine the piece of sports equipment with which the monitoring device <b>201</b> has been engaged and, further, is configured to select the particular characteristics it will measure and the data it will collect. For example, engagement of the protrusions with the openings of the removable section <b>200</b> may cause the detecting switches within the openings to move from a first position to second position. The processor <b>204</b> may be configured to recognize this movement and depending on which of the detecting switches have been moved, determine the piece of sports equipment with which the monitoring device <b>201</b> has been engaged and, further, is select the particular characteristics it will measure and the data it will collect. Alternatively, there may be electrical connections made between the protrusions and the elements (e.g., leads) within the opening of the removable section <b>200</b>. The processor <b>204</b> may be configured to recognize these connections and depending on which of the elements are contacted and, thereby, determine the piece of sports equipment with which the monitoring device <b>201</b> has been engaged and, further, select the particular characteristics it will measure and the data it will collect. Of course, these are just examples and other methods of selectively determining the piece of sports equipment with which the monitoring device <b>201</b> has been engaged and, further, selecting the particular characteristics it will measure and the data it will collect may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">The protrusions and openings may be arranged such that the monitoring device <b>201</b> can only be engaged with the removable section in an intended orientation. For example, while the “universal” monitoring device <b>201</b> may have nine holes, the protrusions on the removable section <b>200</b> and holes on the monitoring device <b>201</b> are arranged such that they will align only when the monitoring device <b>201</b> is engaged with the removable section <b>200</b> in the intended orientation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">It is noted that as discussed above, according to other aspects of the disclosure, the grip <b>105</b> may be configured to receive and secure the monitoring device <b>201</b> directly, without the inclusion of a separate removable section or cartridge <b>200</b>. As discussed above, the monitoring device <b>201</b> may be configured to be engaged with the grip <b>105</b> in a variety of ways. For example, the grip <b>105</b> may be configured with an opening at its terminal end that is configured to receive the monitoring device <b>201</b>. However, regardless of how the monitoring device <b>201</b> is engaged with the grip <b>105</b>, the grip <b>105</b> itself may be configured with the above discussed protrusions configured to engage with the openings in the monitoring device <b>201</b> to selectively determine the piece of sports equipment with which the monitoring device <b>201</b> has been engaged and, further, select the particular characteristics it will measure and the data it will collect accordingly. For example, the grip <b>105</b> may include a slit that is configured to receive the monitoring device <b>201</b> when the monitoring device <b>201</b> is inserted into the grip along the monitoring device's longitudinal axis. Further, one or both of the rounded ends of the compartment of the monitoring device <b>201</b> may be configured to include the openings which are configured to receive the protrusions and the lower end of the slit may include the one or more protrusions. Additionally, or alternatively, the protrusions may positioned on the sides of the slit and may be spring loaded, flexible, etc. in order to accommodate the insertion and removable of the monitoring device <b>201</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">According to an additional aspect, a club as described herein may be dimensioned to accommodate a larger component, such as a larger monitoring device <b>201</b> or a monitoring device <b>201</b> having a larger sized power supply <b>206</b> (e.g. battery). In one embodiment, the power supply <b>206</b> and/or the device <b>201</b> may be positioned in a receptacle <b>110</b> <i>a </i>proximate the end of the grip <b>105</b>, such as by using a removable section <b>200</b> as described above and shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 9-15</figref>, a configuration as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, or another configuration. The shaft <b>103</b> and/or the grip <b>105</b> may be dimensioned, in such configurations, to have a larger internal dimension (ID) to accommodate the larger power supply <b>206</b>. The shaft <b>103</b> and/or the grip <b>105</b> may also include a larger outer/external dimension (OD) as a result of the increased ID, although in one embodiment, the ID may be increased with either no increase or a proportionately smaller increase in the OD, such as by thinning the wall of the shaft <b>103</b>. It is understood that the ID and the OD referred to herein are dimensions of a cross-section taken perpendicular to the central axis of the shaft <b>103</b>. A typical golf club shaft has a maximum internal dimension of 0.5-0.7 inches (typically an internal diameter). In one embodiment, the shafts <b>103</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-21</figref> may have a receptacle <b>110</b> <i>a </i>with a maximum internal dimension of 0.510-1.0 inches. This increased maximum internal dimension permits a component, such as a battery <b>206</b> or a monitoring device <b>201</b> with an internal battery <b>206</b>, having an external width of between 0.505 and 1.00 inches to be received therein. Other component sizes may be accommodated by using shafts <b>103</b> with different dimensions, according to the principles described herein. Additionally, it is understood that while these accommodation principles are described with respect to a golf club, they are not limited for use with golf clubs and may be used with any of various other striking devices. It is understood that the internal dimension of the shaft <b>103</b> may generally taper outwardly toward the butt end, and in one embodiment, the shaft <b>103</b> may have its maximum internal and external dimensions at the point adjacent the receptacle <b>110</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, a receptacle <b>110</b> <i>a </i>for the enlarged component may be located at the butt end of the shaft <b>103</b> (also referred to as the distal end), and the shaft <b>103</b> may be tapered differently along its entire length in order to create a larger ID and OD proximate the butt end of the shaft <b>103</b>. A typical shaft dimension is illustrated in broken lines in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. In another embodiment, a portion of the shaft <b>103</b> may an ID and/or OD that increase more rapidly than other portions of the shaft <b>103</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, a portion <b>103</b> <i>c </i>of the shaft <b>103</b> may have a different taper angle from the remainder of the shaft <b>103</b> in order to create a larger ID and OD at the receptacle <b>110</b> <i>a </i>proximate the butt end of the shaft <b>103</b>. In another example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the shaft <b>103</b> may have a step or shoulder <b>103</b> <i>a </i>(i.e. a rapid increase in diameter formed by a rapid increase and then a rapid decrease in taper angle) located at some point along the length of the shaft <b>103</b> to create a larger ID and OD at the receptacle <b>110</b> <i>a </i>proximate the butt end of the shaft <b>103</b>. In this embodiment, the portions of the shaft <b>103</b> other than the step <b>103</b> <i>a </i>may have substantially the same taper angle or different taper angles. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> also includes a cap <b>112</b>, which may constitute one example of an access member to permit access to the receptacle <b>110</b> <i>a</i>. The cap <b>112</b> in this embodiment is configured for a snap fit connection, but other configurations may be used as well, including threading, press-fit, flip-top, and other suitable configurations. Other embodiments herein may incorporate similar access members. A removable section <b>200</b> may alternately be used in connection with any of the embodiments of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-21</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">The grip <b>105</b> may be enlarged and otherwise dimensioned to be engaged with the larger end of the shaft <b>103</b> in any of these embodiments. The ID of the grip <b>105</b> may be enlarged substantially similarly to the OD of the shaft <b>103</b>, in order to facilitate engagement. In one embodiment, the OD of the grip <b>105</b> may have a lesser degree of enlargement than the ID of the grip <b>105</b> and/or the OD of the shaft <b>103</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the portions of the grip <b>105</b> located beyond the step <b>103</b> <i>a </i>may have walls that are thinner than some portions of the grip <b>105</b> located closer to the club head. The grip <b>105</b> may have a substantially constant wall thickness in another embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">It is understood that while the shafts <b>103</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-21</figref> are circular in cross-section, shafts <b>103</b> having other shapes may be used as well, such as an elliptical or obround shape. In one embodiment, the relevant ID and OD are the maximum internal dimension and the maximum outer dimension of the shaft. Additionally, the increase in ID or OD may not be constant or proportional around the entire periphery of the shaft <b>103</b>. In other words, the ID and/or OD may increase only along one axis, or to a greater degree along one axis, relative to other axes. For example, a shaft <b>103</b> with a circular cross-section may be disproportionately enlarged to create an elliptical, obround, or other elongated shape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0136">The enlarged ID and/or OD of the shaft <b>103</b> may be created by an extension <b>110</b> connected to the end of a conventional shaft body <b>103</b> <i>b</i>, such as in the embodiment in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-21</figref>. In this embodiment, the extension <b>110</b> defines a housing that includes a receptacle <b>110</b> <i>a</i>, which is configured to receive components such as the monitoring device <b>201</b>, the power source <b>206</b>, and/or other components, and a connector <b>110</b> <i>b </i>configured for connection to the shaft body <b>103</b> <i>b</i>. The connector <b>110</b> <i>b </i>may be configured for connection to the shaft body <b>103</b> <i>b </i>by a variety of different connecting structures, such as press-fit, bonding (e.g. adhesive, cement, etc.), threading connection, snap fit or other interlocking connections, and/or other permanent or releasable connections.

The shaft <b>103</b> and monitoring device <b>201</b> or other sensors are also constructed prior to assembly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0145">The receptacle <b>106</b> is connected to a grip member <b>105</b> to form an integral grip assembly <b>107</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28-32</figref>. The grip member <b>105</b> forms a grip surface on the end of the shaft <b>103</b> that functions as a normal grip. The receptacle <b>106</b> and the grip member <b>105</b> may be made from the same or different materials, and in one embodiment, the receptacle <b>106</b> may be formed from a material that is relatively harder, stronger, and or less flexible than the grip member <b>105</b>, which may be made from a softer and more flexible material. As examples, the grip member <b>105</b> may be made from thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) or other urethanes, natural or synthetic rubber, silicone materials, epoxies, thermoplastic elastomers (TPE), or other polymeric materials. Additionally, as examples, the receptacle <b>106</b> may be made from polypropylene, acetal materials, polycarbonates (PC), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), nylon, or other polymeric materials, which may include reinforcement (e.g., glass or graphite). Alternately, the receptacle <b>106</b> may be formed from a metallic material or other non-polymer based material. In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27-32</figref>, the grip member <b>105</b> completely surrounds the receptacle <b>106</b> except for the exposed top of the receptacle <b>106</b> (where the recess <b>193</b> is located), to provide a continuous outer gripping surface around the receptacle <b>105</b>. The grip member <b>105</b> may have a first portion <b>215</b> near the end of the shaft <b>103</b> that surrounds the receptacle <b>106</b> and a second portion <b>216</b> that is located below the receptacle <b>106</b>, with the first and second portions <b>215</b>, <b>216</b> having different wall thicknesses. In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27-32</figref>, the first portion <b>215</b> has a smaller wall thickness than the second portion <b>216</b>. Additionally, the receptacle <b>106</b> further includes a narrowed portion <b>214</b> having a smaller outer dimension that permits it to be received within the second portion <b>216</b> of the grip member <b>105</b>. The receptacle <b>106</b> and the grip member <b>105</b> both have shoulders <b>218</b> that create a rapid dimensional change at the juncture of the first and second portions <b>215</b>, <b>216</b> in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27-32</figref>, but may have a different structure in other embodiments. It is understood that the grip member <b>105</b> and the receptacle <b>106</b> may have additional portions with different dimensions in other embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0147" num="0146">The grip member <b>105</b> defines an elongated central passage <b>132</b> that is configured to receive the shaft <b>103</b>, such that the interior surface of the grip member <b>105</b> engages the outer surface of the shaft <b>103</b>. The narrowed portion <b>214</b> of the receptacle <b>106</b> contacts the end of the shaft <b>103</b> in this embodiment, and may include a structure that engages the shaft <b>103</b> in another manner. For example, the receptacle <b>106</b> may include a structure that receives a portion of the shaft <b>103</b>, or a portion that fits within the shaft <b>103</b>, similar to the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0148" num="0147">The grip assembly <b>107</b> can be manufactured as a single unit and then connected to the shaft <b>103</b> during manufacturing, as described below. The receptacle <b>106</b> may be connected to the grip member <b>105</b> to form the grip assembly through an overmolding process, as described below and illustrated schematically in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27-32</figref>. As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the receptacle <b>106</b> is formed, such as by an injection molding process, including all the features described above. At least some post-manufacturing machining may be necessary in one embodiment. After the receptacle <b>106</b> is formed, the grip member <b>105</b> is formed by molding a grip material around the receptacle <b>106</b> in an overmolding process. It is understood that an overmolding process may include placing the receptacle <b>106</b> in a mold cavity and molding the grip material in contact with at least a portion of the outer surface of the receptacle <b>106</b>. The over-mold grip material also forms the hollow central passage <b>132</b> configured to receive a shaft. The receptacle <b>106</b> is located at a distal end of the hollow central passage <b>132</b>. The over-mold grip material forms a single, integral piece with the receptacle <b>106</b>. In some embodiments, as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the over-mold grip material has a varying thickness, as described above. In other embodiments, the over-mold grip material may only surround a portion of the outer surface of the receptacle <b>106</b>, and the grip member <b>105</b> may leave at least portions of the sides of the receptacle <b>106</b> exposed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0149" num="0148">During assembly, as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the threaded insert <b>195</b> is inserted into the second opening <b>192</b>, and in one embodiment, the insert <b>195</b> is inserted into the second opening <b>192</b> after completion of the grip overmolding. This connection may be secured by an interference fit, a bonding material, or other means. The shaft <b>103</b> is inserted into the hollow central passage <b>132</b> of the grip member <b>105</b>, as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. The shaft <b>103</b> may be secured to the grip member <b>105</b> by an interference fit, a bonding material, or other connection technique. The shaft is connected to the receptacle <b>106</b> in an exemplary embodiment. The monitoring device <b>201</b> or other sensor is inserted into the cartridge <b>200</b>, as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>. The removable cartridge <b>200</b> is inserted into the receptacle <b>106</b>. The base <b>209</b> and finger <b>210</b> holding the monitoring device <b>201</b> are inserted into the first opening <b>191</b>. The structure of the main body portion <b>190</b> surrounds and securely holds the cartridge <b>200</b> and thereby further protects the monitoring device <b>201</b> from damage due to impact or the elements. It is further understood that the first opening <b>191</b> is generally non-circular in this embodiment, wherein the clip member <b>207</b> holding the monitoring device <b>201</b> must be inserted into the first opening <b>191</b> in a set, fixed orientation. Further, with minimum play around the sensor <b>201</b>, the position of the sensor <b>201</b> is always known. This aids in the ability to record and analyze data in a desired fashion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0150" num="0149">As further shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, the cartridge <b>200</b> and the receptacle <b>106</b> may be configured to be fastened together by a threaded fastener <b>211</b> or other connection member that engages the second opening <b>192</b> (e.g., one or more protrusions, flexible tabs, clamps, anchors, etc., which may be mechanically engageable and/or connected using a bonding material). For example, the cap member <b>205</b> is received in the recessed portion <b>193</b>. The cap member <b>205</b> is generally flush with the end of the cartridge holder <b>106</b>. The orifice <b>208</b> on the cap member <b>205</b> is aligned with the second opening <b>192</b>. A threaded fastener <b>211</b> is inserted through the orifice <b>208</b> and secured in the second opening <b>192</b>. In another embodiment, the second opening <b>192</b> may include integral threading or another connecting structure. Thus, removable cartridge <b>200</b> is secured in the grip of the club by a single fastener. It is understood that other fastening mechanisms could be utilized between the removable cartridge <b>200</b> and the receptacle <b>106</b>, or otherwise the grip <b>105</b>. The other fastening mechanisms include snap-fitting configurations or interference fittings as well as other mechanical configurations. With such configuration, the receptacle <b>106</b> holding the cartridge <b>200</b> is seamlessly integrated into the grip <b>105</b> and is virtually undetectable. The golf club appears like any traditional golf club that does not incorporate any sensor technology.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0150">The embodiments of the cartridge <b>200</b> and grip assembly <b>107</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27-32</figref> can be used to create a mount for a monitoring device <b>201</b> or other component that is concealed within the grip portion and is not externally detectable. These embodiments also provide for removal, reinsertion, and/or interchangeability of the monitoring device <b>201</b> as desired. Further, the grip assembly <b>107</b> provides a single, integral structure that can be easily connected to the golf club shaft <b>103</b> in substantially the same manner as a normal grip, and therefore does not require any specialized assembly. Still further, the use of a co-molding process can decrease the cost and increase the efficiency of manufacturing the grip assembly <b>107</b>, and can create a single, integral structure. Still other benefits and advantages are apparent to those skilled in the art.</div>
