<heading id="h-0001">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/333,498, filed Dec. 21, 2011 and now pending, which is incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">A growing number of baseball and softball players alter bat barrels in an effort to increase the performance of ball bats. Ball players, for example, have been known to remove a bat's cap and to shave or machine away material from the inner surface of the bat barrel to reduce the weight of the bat, which results in increased bat speed—and better bat performance—when the player swings the bat and strikes a ball. Once the cap is replaced on the bat, the tampering with the interior of the bat is generally undetectable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Some ball players have also been known to induce delamination between the composite layers in a composite bat barrel. This delamination lowers the barrel's compression and increases the barrel's flex, which can enhance the bat's performance. The most common method for causing barrel delamination is “rolling,” wherein the bat barrel is placed between two cylinders oriented transversely to the barrel's long axis. The cylinders are then compressed into the bat while being rolled along the barrel to cause extreme deflections in the barrel structure. This process causes micro-cracking in the bat laminate, which eventually leads to delamination between the composite barrel layers. While this process generally reduces the bat's useful life, too many players opt for temporary enhanced performance over durability. As with shaving, alterations in the bat barrel resulting from rolling are typically undetectable by an observer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">In response to these bat-tampering methods, regulatory associations have begun to impose limitations on bat designs. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), for example, has implemented a test that requires all bats to comply with performance limits even after they are rolled an unlimited number of times. Essentially, the bat must either remain below the maximum allowable performance limit or must break during the rolling. Accordingly, it is becoming increasingly challenging to design a high-performance ball bat that meets the requirements of regulatory associations. Nearly all other baseball and softball sports governing bodies, for example, the Amateur Softball Association (ASA), the United States Specialty Sports Association (USSSA), Little League, and so forth have adopted similar regulations.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">A ball bat includes one or more low-durability regions fortified by one or more reinforcing elements, such as a structural patch. If the reinforcing element is altered or removed, the durability of the ball bat is significantly reduced. For example, if the ball bat is subjected to internal shaving or external rolling in an attempt to increase the bat's performance, the reinforcing element would be removed or damaged such that the durability of the bat is reduced to the point that the ball bat's performance remains below a specified limit. Other features and advantages will appear hereinafter. The features described above can be used separately or together, or in various combinations of one or more of them.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Various embodiments of the invention will now be described. The following description provides specific details for a thorough understanding and enabling description of these embodiments. One skilled in the art will understand, however, that the invention may be practiced without many of these details. Additionally, some well-known structures or functions may not be shown or described in detail so as to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the relevant description of the various embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">The terminology used in the description presented below is intended to be interpreted in its broadest reasonable manner, even though it is being used in conjunction with a detailed description of certain specific embodiments of the invention. Certain terms may even be emphasized below; however, any terminology intended to be interpreted in any restricted manner will be overtly and specifically defined as such in this detailed description section.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">Where the context permits, singular or plural terms may also include the plural or singular term, respectively. Moreover, unless the word “or” is expressly limited to mean only a single item exclusive from the other items in a list of two or more items, then the use of “or” in such a list is to be interpreted as including (a) any single item in the list, (b) all of the items in the list, or (c) any combination of items in the list.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">Turning now in detail to the drawings, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a baseball or softball bat <b>10</b>, hereinafter collectively referred to as a “ball bat” or “bat,” will be shown and described. The ball bat <b>10</b> includes a handle <b>12</b>, a barrel <b>14</b>, and a tapered section <b>16</b> joining the handle <b>12</b> to the barrel <b>14</b>. The free end of the handle <b>12</b> includes a knob <b>18</b> or similar structure. The barrel <b>14</b> is preferably closed off by a suitable cap <b>20</b> or plug. The interior of the bat <b>10</b> is preferably hollow, allowing the bat <b>10</b> to be relatively lightweight so that ball players may generate substantial bat speed when swinging the bat <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">The ball bat <b>10</b> may be a one-piece construction or may include two or more separate attached pieces (for example, a separate handle and barrel), as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,593,158, which is incorporated herein by reference. The barrel <b>14</b> may be made of a composite material, such as carbon or glass, or of a metal material, such as aluminum. The bat handle <b>12</b> may be constructed from the same material as, or different materials than, the barrel <b>14</b>. In a two-piece ball bat, for example, the handle <b>12</b> may be constructed from a composite material (the same or a different material than that used to construct the barrel), a metal material, or any other suitable material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">The bat barrel <b>14</b> may include a single-wall or multi-wall construction. A multi-wall barrel may include, for example, barrel walls that are separated from one another by one or more interface shear control zones (“ISCZs”), as described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 7,115,054, which is incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">The ball bat <b>10</b> may have any suitable dimensions. The ball bat <b>10</b> may have an overall length of 20 to 40 inches, or 26 to 34 inches. The overall barrel diameter may be 2.0 to 3.0 inches, or 2.25 to 2.75 inches. Typical ball bats have diameters of 2.25, 2.625, or 2.75 inches. Bats having various combinations of these overall lengths and barrel diameters, or any other suitable dimensions, are contemplated herein. The specific preferred combination of bat dimensions is generally dictated by the user of the bat <b>10</b>, and may vary greatly between users.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">The bat barrel <b>14</b> includes at least one weakened region, or a region having reduced durability relative to other regions of the barrel <b>14</b>. This weakened region may be located at or substantially at the center of percussion or sweet spot of the barrel <b>14</b>, or at one or more other suitable locations. The weakened region is fortified by a reinforcing element that provides durability necessary for the ball bat to withstand impacts associated with competitive play, such as striking a pitched baseball or softball.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in one embodiment the reinforcing element includes one or more ribs <b>22</b> or similar features that protrude radially inwardly from the radially inner surface of the barrel <b>14</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a single inwardly protruding rib <b>22</b> is located over a single weakened region <b>24</b> located substantially at the sweet spot of the bat barrel <b>14</b>. The one or more ribs <b>22</b> may alternatively be located anywhere in the hitting zone of the barrel <b>14</b>, which typically extends approximately from two inches to eight inches from the end of the ball bat <b>10</b>. In another embodiment, one or more ribs <b>22</b> may be located outside of the hitting zone, preferably toward the cap-end of the ball bat where shaving typically begins.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">The rib <b>22</b> preferably has a length of approximately 0.625 to 1.000 inches in the longitudinal direction of the bat barrel <b>14</b>. The rib <b>22</b> alternatively could be longer or shorter. In some embodiments, for example, the rib <b>22</b> could have a length of 6.000 inches or more. The rib <b>22</b> preferably is positioned along the full circumference of the radially inner surface of the barrel <b>14</b> but smaller, discontinuous ribbed sections could alternatively be used. Because the rib <b>22</b> protrudes inwardly, it has a smaller inner diameter than neighboring regions of the bat barrel <b>14</b>. In one embodiment, the rib's inner diameter is approximately 0.020 inches less than the inner diameter of neighboring barrel regions so that it resides in the path of any machinery used to shave the inner surface of the bat barrel <b>14</b>. The rib <b>22</b> may alternatively protrude inwardly from the inner surface of the barrel <b>14</b> to a greater or lesser degree.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">In a composite ball bat, the rib <b>22</b> may be formed from one or more layers of the composite material used to construct the bat barrel <b>14</b>. Alternatively, a higher stiffness material, such as a stiffer composite or metal material, may be used to form the rib <b>22</b>, particularly if the barrel material has a relatively low stiffness. Including a higher-stiffness rib <b>22</b> on the radially inner surface of the barrel <b>14</b> renders the barrel structure more dependent on the presence of the stiffer material. Accordingly, if the rib <b>22</b> is shaved or machined away, the barrel <b>14</b> immediately undergoes a significant drop in durability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">Additionally, the fiber types and fiber angles of the one or more composite materials used to form the rib <b>22</b> may be selected to cause a significant reduction in barrel durability when the barrel <b>14</b> is subjected to rolling or other severe deflection. Low-elongation fibers, such as high-modulus carbon fibers having less than 2% elongation, for example, may be used to construct the rib <b>22</b>. In one embodiment, the fibers are oriented at an angle greater than approximately 30 degrees relative to the longitudinal axis of the bat <b>10</b>, which increases the likelihood the barrel laminate will fail when the barrel is subjected to radial deflections greater than approximately 0.1 inches, such as those caused by rolling.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">The weakened region <b>24</b> may be a hollow chamber extending through the barrel wall or it may be made up of—or filled with—one or more weak materials. Some relatively weak materials that could be used in the weakened region <b>24</b> include foam (for example, polyurethane, polystyrene, or thermoplastic foam), rope, balsa, textile yarn, polypropylene, or other suitable materials. Elastomers, such as polyurethane or silicone, could also be used to form the weakened region <b>24</b>. Additionally or alternatively, weaker laminate fibers or a weaker resin matrix than those used to construct the remainder of the barrel <b>14</b>—or a material that is not bonded to the surrounding laminate layers—could be used to form the weakened region <b>24</b>. These relatively weak materials and arrangements provide sufficient durability when the reinforcing rib <b>22</b> is present but will break down if the rib <b>22</b> or other inwardly protruding feature is machined away.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in another embodiment, a weakened region <b>26</b> of a composite or metal bat barrel <b>14</b> is formed by fabricating the barrel <b>14</b> with a region having a lesser thickness than neighboring barrel regions. The weakened region <b>26</b> is covered by a structural patch <b>28</b> or other reinforcing element that is bonded or otherwise attached to the radially inner surface of the barrel <b>14</b> adjacent to the weakened region <b>26</b>. The patch <b>28</b> protrudes inwardly from the radially inner surface of the barrel wall, thus decreasing the inner diameter of the barrel <b>14</b> in that region and positioning the patch <b>28</b> in the path of machinery used to shave the inner surface of the barrel <b>14</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">The material used to construct the patch <b>28</b>—or to bond the patch to the inner surface of the barrel <b>14</b>—may be selected to fail when the barrel <b>14</b> is subjected to excessive radial deflections greater than approximately 0.1 inches, such as those resulting from rolling. High modulus, low-elongation carbon fibers, such as those described above, could be used to construct the patch <b>28</b> and achieve this result. Additionally or alternatively, low-elongation adhesives (for example, epoxy, acrylic, or cyanoacrylate) could be used to bond the patch <b>28</b> to the bat barrel <b>14</b>. Such an adhesive breaks down under extreme loading conditions, such as the radial deflections resulting from rolling or similar practices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">The reduction in barrel thickness in the weakened region <b>26</b> necessary to achieve the desired drop in barrel durability depends on the strength of the materials used to construct the bat and the level of play at which the bat will be used. For example, a typical adult baseball bat made of a high-strength aluminum alloy generally has a barrel-wall thickness of approximately 0.100 inches to 0.110 inches. Incorporating in such a bat a weakened region <b>26</b> having a length of approximately 0.5 inches in the longitudinal direction of the ball bat, and a thickness of approximately 0.075 inches, would result in barrel-denting under normal use in the absence of a reinforcing element, such as a patch <b>28</b>. A high-strength aluminum alloy ring having a thickness of approximately 0.040 inches, for example, would be a suitable patch <b>28</b> for supporting such a thinned, weakened region <b>26</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">In general, a reduction of approximately 25% or more of the wall thickness in a given ball bat should be sufficient to cause barrel failure after the inner surface of the barrel <b>14</b> is machined away or the patch <b>28</b> is broken or de-bonded. Lower reductions in barrel-wall thickness (for example, an approximately 10% reduction) could provide similar results but might allow the bat to perform at a relatively high level for several impacts after the barrel is shaved, rolled, or otherwise modified.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment, the radially outer surface of the patch <b>28</b> is bonded to the radially inner surface of the barrel <b>14</b> via a tough polyurethane or epoxy adhesive. Film adhesives typically work well and generally are easier to control and position than non-film adhesives. The bond strength between the patch <b>28</b> and the barrel <b>14</b> can be regulated by limiting the bonding area or by leaving the mating surfaces of the patch <b>28</b> and the barrel <b>14</b> unprepared (i.e., by using smooth surfaces that do not bond as strongly as prepared surfaces).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">In another embodiment, the barrel wall—or one or more of the radially inner layers of the barrel wall—may be made of one or more materials that are difficult to shave or otherwise machine away. Materials of this nature may alternatively be bonded or otherwise attached to the radially inner surface of a barrel wall made of a more readily machinable material. Some examples of suitable shaving-resistant materials include but are not limited to the following: soft, sticky materials (for example, composite materials with relatively high melting points); stringy, difficult-to-cut fibers, such as aramid fibers; and particles or wires made of materials that are at least as hard as typical machining cutters, such as tungsten carbide, which would damage or wear on the cutters.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">Any of the above-described embodiments may be used alone or in combination with one another. For example, a bat barrel may include a weakened region reinforced by a rib or a similar reinforcing element, and may include another weakened or thinned region reinforced with a structural patch. These regions may be positioned near the barrel's sweet spot or may be located in other regions inside or outside the hitting zone. The ball bat may also include features not described herein. While several embodiments have been shown and described, various changes and substitutions may of course be made, without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The invention, therefore, should not be limited, except by the following claims and their equivalents.</div>
