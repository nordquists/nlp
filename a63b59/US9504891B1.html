<heading id="h-0001">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a baseball instrument, particularly to a baseball bat whose barrel is not hardened after shape forming.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The wooden baseball bats are generally used because they are inexpensive. However, a wooden bat is fragile and heavier. A wooden bat is laborious to swing, easy to break, inferior in batting performance, and likely to vibrate violently during batting and cause sport injury.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">So far, a baseball bat whose barrel is mainly made of cured resin layers has been developed to overcome the abovementioned problems. As the barrel is fabricated via shape forming and resin curing, higher stress is likely to concentrate on the sweet spot of the barrel during batting, reducing the vibration absorption capability of the sweet spot and decreasing the stability of the batted ball. Therefore, this type of baseball bats lacks sufficient reliability.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">One objective of the present invention is to solve the problem that the barrel of the conventional baseball bat is likely to harden after shaping forming. Thus, the present invention provides a baseball bat having higher damping capability and increasing the stability of the batted ball.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">To achieve the abovementioned objective, the present invention proposes a baseball bat, which comprises a hollow handle region and a barrel region. The hollow handle region extends along an axis and includes a grip section and a connection section, which respectively extend oppositely from the joint thereof along the axis. The connection section has an outer diameter greater than that of the grip section. The barrel region is connected with the connection section and extends along the axis. The barrel region is mainly fabricated with thermoset resin layers with at least one flexible chain polymer layer thereinside and will not harden after shape forming.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Owing to the abovementioned unique design, the present invention is distinct from the conventional technology and has the following efficacies:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">The barrel region of the baseball bat of the present invention has thermoset resin layers with at least one flexible chain polymer layer thereinside. Therefore, the strength of the barrel region is enhanced, and the durability of the baseball bat is increased. Further, the barrel region can effectively absorb vibration during batting the baseball and increase the stability of the batted ball.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">Below, embodiments are described in detail in cooperation with the attached drawings to make easily understood the objectives, technical contents, characteristics and accomplishments of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">Refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> for a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The baseball bat <b>1</b> of the present invention comprises a hollow handle region <b>11</b> and a barrel region <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">The hollow handle region <b>11</b> extends along an axis X and includes a grip section (<b>111</b>) and a connection section (<b>112</b>), which respectively extend oppositely from the joint thereof along the axis X. The connection section (<b>112</b>) has an outer diameter greater than that of the grip section (<b>111</b>). The barrel region <b>12</b> extends along the axis X and is connected with the connection section (<b>112</b>). The barrel region <b>12</b> has at least one thermoset resin layer <b>121</b> and at least one flexible chain polymer layer <b>2</b>, which exists within the thermoset resin layer <b>121</b> and does not harden after the barrel region <b>12</b> has been formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the barrel region <b>12</b> has two flexible chain polymer layers <b>2</b>. The flexible chain polymer layer <b>2</b> is fabricated with a fabric composite, which is made of synthetic methyl acrylic acid polymer and carbon fiber (CF) or glass fiber (GF). The thermoset resin layer <b>121</b> of the barrel region <b>12</b> is fabricated with a fabric composite, which is made of epoxy resin and carbon fiber (CF) or glass fiber (GF) and hardened after shape forming. The weight ratio of the thermoset resin layer <b>121</b> and the flexible chain polymer layers <b>2</b> is adjusted to an appropriate value to make the barrel region <b>12</b> achieve a vibration absorption effect similar to a flax-containing composite material. The weight of the flexible chain polymer layer <b>2</b> of the barrel region <b>12</b> is 3%-50% of the weight of the baseball bat <b>1</b>. The impact absorptivity of a normal fiber reinforced plastic plate is 10% of the impact strength. The impact absorptivity of the flexible chain polymer layer <b>2</b> is 60% of the impact strength and thus 6 times the impact absorptivity of the thermoset resin layer <b>121</b>, almost equal to the impact absorptivity of rubber.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment, the flexible chain polymer layer <b>2</b> is extended from the top of the barrel region <b>12</b> to have a length of at least 22% of the total length L of the baseball bat <b>1</b>, wherein the flexible chain polymer layer <b>2</b> is fabricated with a fabric composite, which is made of synthetic methyl acrylic acid polymer and carbon fiber (CF) or glass fiber (GF).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment, the flexible chain polymer layer <b>2</b> adopts a synthetic methyl acrylic acid polymer, which is similar to epoxy resin in flexibility and toughness and unlikely to harden after shape forming. In one embodiment, the flexible chain polymer layer <b>2</b> is fabricated with a fabric composite, which is made of synthetic methyl acrylic acid polymer and carbon fiber (CF) or glass fiber (GF), wherein rubber powder, carbon nanotubes, or carbon nano fullerene is further added to the fabric composite to enhance the durability of the barrel region <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">In one embodiment, the hardness of the flexible chain polymer layer <b>2</b> is less than 60% of the hardness of the thermoset resin layer <b>121</b>. The difference of the hardnesses of the thermoset resin layer <b>121</b> and the resin of the flexible chain polymer layer <b>2</b> is over 25 Shore Hardness (HS). Thereby is increased the comfort of holding the baseball bat and decreased the vibration caused by batting.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">In one embodiment, the flexible chain polymer layer <b>2</b> has an optimized weight ratio of the reinforcing fiber and the synthetic methyl acrylic acid polymer 35-70: 65-30, wherein the reinforcing fiber of the flexible chain polymer layer <b>2</b> is carbon fiber (CF) or glass fiber (GF).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment, the barrel region <b>12</b> has only a single flexible chain polymer layer <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">Refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In one embodiment, the barrel region <b>12</b> has a plurality of thermoset resin layers <b>121</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">According to the above discussion, the advantages of the baseball bat of the present invention are summarized as follows:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">1. The strength and performance of the barrel region is enhanced via the cooperation of the thermoset resin layer and the flexible chain polymer layer, and the service life of the baseball bat is also prolonged.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">2. The flexible chain polymer layers inside the barrel region decrease the weight of the overall weight of the baseball bat without reducing structural strength and make the barrel region not hardened after shape forming. Further, the flexible chain polymer layers promote comfort of holding the baseball bat and reduce vibration caused by batting the baseball.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">The embodiments have been described above to enable the persons skilled in the art to understand, make, and use the present invention. However, these embodiments are only to exemplify the present invention but not to limit the scope of the present invention. Any equivalent modification or variation according to the shape, structure or characteristic of the present invention is to be also included within the scope of the present invention.</div>
