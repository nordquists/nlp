<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a national stage entry of PCT/AU2013/000083 filed on Jan. 31, 2013, which in turn claims the benefit of priority to AU Application No. 2012902330 filed Jun. 5, 2012 and AU Application No. 2012900349 filed Jan. 31, 2012, each of the foregoing patent applications is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety for any purpose whatsoever.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a thrower. More particularly, but not exclusively, this invention relates to a thrower for throwing, hurling or flinging objects for retrieval by a dog, for example.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">A popular pastime amongst dog owners is to throw or fling various objects for retrieval by a dog. At present, there are a number of devices that are used to assist with such throwing or flinging.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">An example of such a device includes an elongate arm with a handle at one end and a receptacle at an opposite end. The arm and the receptacle are configured and respectively oriented so that when a ball is received in the receptacle the ball can be projected or hurled from the receptacle by swinging the arm.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">According to the invention, there is provided a thrower that comprises
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0006">an elongate arm;</li> <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0007">a handle attached to one end of the arm; and</li> <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0008">a retaining device having a base attached to an opposite end of the arm and at least one gripping member extending from the base to define a retention volume together with the base, the, or each, gripping member being configured so that an object to be thrown can be retained in the retention volume, the object having a range of different sizes.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0009">The, or each, gripping member may be resiliently displaceable with respect to the base to permit the retaining device to be urged on to the object to be thrown such that the, or each, gripping member is displaced to permit the object to be received in the retention volume.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0010">Thus, a user can manipulate the thrower to pick up objects that are rigid and inflexible since the, or each, gripping member can be displaced to accommodate the object. With prior art devices, some reliance is placed on the resilient deformability of the object, such as ball, since the receptacle is relatively rigid. It follows that the thrower of the invention can be used to pick up a wide variety of objects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0011">The base may be generally part-ellipsoidal or part-spherical to accommodate an object that is generally spherical or ellipsoidal or similar. However, the base is also suitable for accommodating objects having other shapes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0012">The retaining device may include at least three gripping members spaced apart and extending from a peripheral edge of the base. More particularly, the retaining device may include four or more gripping members. The gripping members may be configured to define an entrance zone to the retention volume such that when ends of the gripping member are urged against a ball to be thrown, the gripping members move apart to enlarge the entrance zone to permit passage of the ball into the retention volume.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0013">Each gripping member may be elongate and of a flexible, resilient material so that when the gripping members move apart, they do so against a bias of the material. The gripping members may have an inward curved portion at least partially bounding the retention volume and outward curved portions defining the entrance zone. The outward curved portions may be configured so that when they are urged on to a ball the gripping members are forced apart, against their bias, to enlarge the entrance zone to accommodate passage of the ball at least partially into the retention volume. A return of the gripping members can serve to obstruct passage out of the volume or grip the object.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0014">A number of slots or holes may be defined in the peripheral edge of the base. Each gripping member may have a projection extending from a free end of the outward curved portion. Each projection may be received in a respective slot to secure the gripping members to the base. Each projection may be in the form of a lug or the like with a rectangular profile. Likewise, each hole may also have a rectangular profile.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0015">The gripping members may have a substantially rectangular transverse cross-section.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0016">A retention device may be arranged on each projection to enhance attachment of the gripping members to the base. The retention device may be in the form of a tab or the like which extends from the lug to engage an internal surface of the associated slot. Each projection may be of a resiliently flexible material with the tab forming part of the projection to be urged back towards a remainder of the projection when the projection is urged into the slot. Thus, the bias of the tab can serve to retain the projection in the slot. In one example, each projection is of sprung metal with the tab being pivotal, against a bias of the metal, towards an opening defined by the projection, when the projection is urged into the slot.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0017">Instead, each gripping member may define an opening or slot in the free end of the outward curved portion. A number of retaining devices may be arranged about the peripheral edge of the base. The retaining devices may be received in each slot of respective gripping members to retain the gripping members in position. For example, each retaining device may be in the form of a spring that is mounted in a reinforced portion of the base. The spring may be a coil spring and a portion of spring wire may extend from the peripheral edge of the base to be received in a respective slot of a gripping member.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0018">In this embodiment, the springs impart further resilient characteristics to the gripping members, alleviating strain on the gripping members. Thus, the gripping members can move apart, in use, at least partly due to the resilient deformation of the springs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0019">The retaining device may include four gripping members and associated slots equally spaced about the peripheral edge of the base, with one pair of gripping members aligned with the handle and thus with a direction in which the object is to be thrown.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0020">In some cases, a gripping member that is distal with respect to the handle and the material defining its associated slot may experience a significant amount of stress, particularly when the object is relatively heavy or is thrown vigorously. Thus, in one embodiment, the retaining device may include a gripping member in the form of a tab or lug that is shorter than one or more of the gripping members and extends from the periphery aligned with the handle and the direction in which the object is to be thrown. The tab or lug cooperates with the gripping members to retain the object in the retention volume and, since it is more rigid and shorter than the gripping members, is able to resist damage to itself and the base during use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0021">The inventor(s) envisage that the tab or lug can be used with one or two other gripping members, instead of four. For example, the retaining device can include the tab or lug and one oppositely positioned gripping member. Instead, the retaining device can include the tab or lug and two spaced gripping members positioned with respect to the tab or lug to retain the object to be thrown in the retention volume.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0022">The arm may be attached to the base so that the base opens generally orthogonally with respect to the arm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0023">The arm may be curved and of a resiliently flexible material to enhance a throwing effect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0024">The handle, arm and base may be of a one-piece moulding. In particular, the handle, arm and base may be moulded from a resiliently flexible plastics material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0025">Embodiments of the invention are now described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0045">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, reference numeral <b>10</b> generally indicates a first exemplary embodiment of a thrower, in accordance with the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0046">The thrower <b>10</b> is intended for throwing, hurling or flinging various objects. In this particular embodiment, the thrower <b>10</b> is suited for throwing balls of various sizes. However, it is envisaged that the thrower <b>10</b> can also be used for throwing other objects of various sizes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0047">The thrower <b>10</b> includes an arm <b>12</b>. A handle <b>14</b> is attached to one end of the arm <b>12</b>. A retaining device <b>16</b> is attached to an opposite end of the arm <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0048">The retaining device <b>16</b> includes a base in the form of a generally part-spherical cup <b>18</b>. The cup <b>18</b> has a wall that terminates at a circular periphery <b>22</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>) of the cup <b>18</b> that is generally aligned with a plane extending across an opening of the cup <b>18</b>. The inventor(s) envisages that the cup <b>18</b> could also be generally part-ellipsoidal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0049">A number of gripping members <b>20</b> are attached to the periphery <b>22</b> so that they extend generally orthogonally with respect to the plane of the cup-opening. In this example, four gripping members <b>20</b> are attached to the periphery <b>22</b>. However, it will be appreciated that any number of gripping members <b>20</b>, preferably three or more, can be attached to the periphery <b>22</b>. It is to be appreciated that a person of ordinary skill in the field would understand how to position, for example three gripping members <b>20</b>, for functionality.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0050">The gripping members <b>20</b> are configured to define an entrance zone <b>26</b> to a retention volume <b>28</b> defined by the members <b>20</b> and the cup <b>18</b>. In particular, the gripping members <b>20</b> are configured so that when the retaining device <b>16</b> is urged onto an object, the gripping members <b>20</b> are displaced to enlarge the entrance zone <b>26</b> and to permit the object to pass into the retention volume <b>28</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0051">Each gripping member <b>20</b> is elongate and is of a resiliently flexible material so that when the gripping members <b>20</b> move apart, they do so against a bias of the material. Each gripping member <b>20</b> has an inward curved portion <b>30</b> and an outward curved portion <b>32</b>. The portions <b>32</b> define the entrance zone <b>26</b>. The portions <b>32</b> are configured so that when they are urged onto a ball or object of a particular size, the gripping members <b>20</b> are forced apart to enlarge the entrance zone <b>26</b>, allowing the ball into the retention volume <b>28</b>. A bias of the gripping members <b>20</b> results in them subsequently obstructing the volume <b>28</b> or bearing against the object to retain the object in the volume <b>28</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0052">The periphery <b>22</b> defines a number of holes, recesses, slots or sockets <b>24</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>) that correspond with respective gripping members <b>20</b>. A projection or lug <b>34</b> extends from a free end of each portion <b>30</b> of the gripping member <b>20</b>. The lugs <b>34</b> and the sockets <b>24</b> are dimensioned so that the lugs <b>34</b> can be received in respective sockets <b>24</b> to retain the members <b>20</b> in attachment with the cup <b>18</b>. Each lug <b>34</b> and its associated socket <b>24</b> has a rectangular profile. However, other profiles can also be suitable depending on requirements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0053">As can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 6</figref>, a securing device is arranged on each lug <b>34</b> to secure the lug <b>34</b> in its associated socket <b>24</b>. The securing device is in the form of a tab <b>36</b> that extends from the lug <b>34</b> to interfere with an internal surface of the socket <b>24</b> when the lug <b>34</b> is inserted into the socket <b>24</b>. Each lug <b>34</b> is of a resiliently flexible material with the tab <b>36</b> forming part of the lug <b>34</b> to be urged back towards a remainder of the lug <b>34</b> when the lug <b>34</b> is inserted into the socket <b>24</b>. Thus, a bias of the tab <b>36</b> serves to retain the lug <b>34</b> in the socket <b>24</b>. In this example, each lug <b>34</b> is of sprung metal with the tab <b>36</b> being pivotal, against a bias of the metal, towards an opening <b>38</b> defined by the lug <b>34</b>, when the lug <b>34</b> is inserted into the socket <b>24</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0054">Each gripping member <b>20</b> has a generally flat, rectangular profile. Other profiles may also be suitable, if required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0055">The arm <b>12</b> is attached to the cup <b>18</b> so that the cup <b>18</b> opens generally orthogonally with respect to the arm <b>12</b>. The arm <b>12</b> is curved and of a resiliently flexible material to enhance a throwing or hurling effect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0056">The handle <b>14</b>, arm <b>12</b> and cup <b>18</b> are of a one piece moulding of a resiliently flexible plastics material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0057"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 10</figref> show operation of the gripping members with differently sized balls. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a ball <b>25</b>.<b>1</b> with a diameter of less than 50 mm is shown in the retention volume <b>28</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a ball <b>25</b>.<b>2</b> with a diameter of about 50 mm is shown in the retention volume <b>28</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a ball <b>25</b>.<b>3</b> with a diameter of about 65 mm is shown in the retention volume <b>28</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a ball <b>25</b>.<b>4</b> with a diameter of about 75 mm is shown in the retention volume <b>28</b>. It will be appreciated that a simple adjustment of the size of the gripping member can increase the diameter range of balls that can be launched with the thrower <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0058">The retaining device <b>16</b> can be dimensioned to suit different ranges of ball sizes. In one example the retaining device <b>16</b> has an overall width of between about 75 mm and 80 mm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0059">An overall length of the thrower <b>10</b> is between 650 mm and 700 mm. However, the length can vary depending on requirements. The handle <b>14</b> and arm <b>12</b> can be of any length, depending on requirements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0060">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, reference numeral <b>50</b> generally indicates a retaining device of a second exemplary embodiment of a thrower, in accordance with the invention. With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 10</figref>, like reference numerals refer to like parts unless otherwise specified.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0061">The retaining device <b>50</b> includes a base <b>52</b> that is significantly smaller than the cup <b>18</b> of the thrower <b>10</b>. The base <b>52</b> is dished to accommodate a ball or some other object to be thrown. The gripping members <b>20</b> of the thrower <b>50</b> are longer than those of the thrower <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0062">The gripping members <b>20</b>, the base <b>52</b>, the arm <b>12</b> and the handle <b>14</b> are in the form of a moulding. The moulding material can be a resiliently flexible plastics material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0063">The retaining device <b>50</b> can be dimensioned to suit different ranges of ball sizes. In one example, the retaining device <b>50</b> has an overall width of between about 65 mm and 70 mm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0064">It will be recognized that moulding the retaining device <b>50</b> in a single step may be complicated. The device <b>50</b> can thus be moulded initially to form two identical members. These are then joined to form the device <b>50</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0065">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, reference numeral <b>60</b> generally indicates a retaining device of a third exemplary embodiment of a thrower, in accordance with the invention.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0066">Instead of the gripping members <b>20</b>, the device <b>60</b> includes a spiral or coil <b>62</b> of a resiliently flexible material extending from, and tapering outwardly from a base <b>64</b>. The coil <b>62</b> is split at <b>66</b> so that the taper of the device <b>60</b> can increase to accommodate a ball.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0067">The device <b>60</b> can be fabricated in the same way as the device <b>50</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0068">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, reference numeral <b>70</b> generally indicates a retaining device of a fourth exemplary embodiment of a thrower, in accordance with the invention.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0069">The retaining device <b>70</b> includes a part-spherical base <b>72</b> with a number of gripping members in the form of inwardly curved, claw-like fingers <b>74</b> that each taper to a point at a free end. In this example, there are four fingers <b>74</b>. The fingers <b>74</b> curve inwardly partially to enclose the retention volume <b>28</b>. The fingers <b>74</b> are configured so that the device <b>70</b> can be pushed onto the ball or object with the fingers <b>74</b> initially bending inwardly and subsequently snapping back to retain the ball in the volume <b>28</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0070">In one example, the device <b>70</b> has an overall diameter of between about 90 mm and 100 mm. An overall diameter of the entrance zone <b>26</b> is between 45 mm and 50 mm. A gap between consecutive fingers does not exceed between 45 mm and 50 mm.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0076">With the thrower <b>10</b> there are four gripping members <b>20</b>. These are spaced equally about the periphery <b>22</b>, with one pair of the gripping members <b>20</b> being aligned with the handle <b>12</b> and thus the direction in which the object is to be thrown. In that configuration, the gripping member <b>20</b> of that pair that is distal with respect to the handle <b>12</b> and the material defining its associated slot can be subject to a significant amount of stress, particularly when the object is thrown vigorously or is heavier than a tennis ball, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0077">Thus, instead of that particular gripping member, the thrower <b>90</b> includes a tab or lug <b>92</b> that is shorter than the gripping members <b>20</b> and extends from the periphery <b>22</b> aligned with the handle and the direction in which the object is to be thrown. The tab or lug <b>92</b> cooperates with the gripping members <b>20</b> to retain the object in the retention volume <b>28</b> and, since it is more rigid and shorter than the gripping members <b>22</b>, is able to resist damage to itself and the base or cup <b>18</b> during use. The tab or lug <b>92</b> and the base or cup <b>18</b> can form part of a common moulding.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0078">The inventor(s) envisage that one or two gripping members <b>20</b> can be used with the tab or lug <b>92</b>, instead of three gripping members <b>20</b>. A person skilled in the art will understand that is would be relatively straightforward to provide a single gripping member <b>20</b> opposite the tab or lug <b>92</b>. The gripping member <b>20</b> could then be dimensionally adjusted to function correctly. Likewise, a person skilled in the art will understand that it would be relatively straightforward to provide two spaced gripping members <b>20</b> opposite the tab or lug <b>92</b>. The gripping members <b>20</b> could then be positioned to function correctly. Also, if necessary, the gripping members <b>20</b> could be dimensionally adjusted also to function correctly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0079">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>, reference numeral <b>100</b> generally indicates an example of a ball thrower, in accordance with the invention. With reference to the preceding drawings, particularly <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 to 17</figref>, like reference numerals refer to like parts, unless otherwise specified.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0080">This embodiment is similar to the thrower <b>90</b>. However, the thrower <b>100</b> has gripping members <b>102</b> and a cup <b>104</b> that differ from those of the ball thrower <b>90</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0081">The cup <b>104</b> has three reinforced or thickened portions <b>106</b> about its periphery <b>108</b>. Each portion <b>106</b> defines a rebate or recess <b>110</b>. A spring <b>112</b> is mounted in each recess <b>110</b>. Each spring <b>112</b> is a coil spring, with a length <b>114</b> of spring wire of the spring <b>112</b> extending past the periphery and bent back towards a coil of the spring <b>112</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0082">As with the gripping members <b>20</b>, the members <b>102</b> are elongate and have an inward curved portion <b>116</b> and outward curved portion <b>118</b>. The device <b>100</b> thus operates in the same manner as the device <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0083">Each gripping member <b>102</b> defines a slot or opening in a free end of the outward curved portion <b>118</b>. Each of the lengths <b>114</b> is received in a respective slot to fasten the gripping members <b>102</b> to the periphery <b>108</b>. Thus, as the gripping members <b>102</b> are urged outwardly, the springs <b>102</b> can bend to accommodate that outward movement. This serves to alleviate strain on the gripping members <b>102</b>. That helps to avoid failure due to repeated bending of the gripping members <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0084">As with the thrower <b>90</b>, the thrower <b>100</b> can also include a single gripping member <b>102</b> opposite the lug or tab <b>92</b> or two gripping members <b>102</b> are positioned with respect to the lug or tab <b>92</b> to function properly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0085">The various embodiments described above can be used to pick an object to be thrown up from a substrate. As a result, it is not necessary for a user to handle the object so avoiding mucus, saliva, spittle and dirt that may be on the object. Also the user can avoid the need to bend over repeatedly. Furthermore, the nature of the retaining device of the various embodiments allows differently sized objects to be picked up and thrown.</div>
