<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a training bat <b>20</b> according to the present invention. The training bat <b>20</b> includes a tubular body <b>22</b> having a first end <b>24</b> and a second end <b>26</b>. The first end <b>24</b> includes a handle <b>28</b> with a grip <b>29</b>. The first end <b>24</b> of the bat is sealed by a knob <b>30</b>, preferably welded to the first end of the tubular body <b>22</b>. A knob boot <b>31</b>, preferably constructed of rubber, extends from the knob <b>30</b> and extends around the first end <b>24</b> of the tubular body. The second end <b>26</b> of the bat includes an impact pad <b>32</b> surrounding and integral with the tubular body <b>22</b>. A core member or weight <b>34</b> is held within the tubular body <b>22</b> at the second end by a detachable pin <b>36</b>, a portion of which weight <b>34</b> extends from the second end <b>26</b> of the tubular body <b>22</b>. A flexible clip member or clip <b>38</b> is attached to the pin <b>36</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref> the pin <b>36</b> passes through a bore <b>40</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) that extends through opposing sides of the tubular body <b>22</b> and through the weight <b>34</b> and secures the weight within the tubular body <b>22</b> at the second end <b>26</b>. Pin <b>36</b> includes a head <b>42</b> and a distal end <b>44</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, an aperture <b>46</b> extends through pin head <b>42</b>. Flexible clip <b>38</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is substantially U-shaped and includes a base end <b>48</b> that extends through the aperture <b>46</b> in pin head <b>42</b> and renders the base end <b>48</b> free to rotate with respect to the pin head. Flexible clip <b>38</b> includes parallel arms <b>50</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) and is preferably constructed of metal. Flexible clip <b>38</b> further includes a detachable end <b>52</b>. The metal construction of the clip <b>38</b> combined with the narrow diameter of the arms <b>50</b> and the U-shape of the clip enables a user to pry the detachable end <b>52</b> of the clip off of the distal end <b>44</b> of the pin <b>36</b> as desired. Once detached, detachable end <b>52</b> of flexible clip <b>38</b> can be rotated with respect to the head <b>42</b> of the pin <b>36</b> and pin can be removed from the tubular body <b>22</b>. The flexible clip <b>38</b> is rotated in the direction of arrow <b>53</b> or over the second end <b>26</b> of the bat. The clip shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is in its relaxed or unbiased shape, which holds the weight <b>34</b> firmly within the bat. A clamp <b>54</b> secures the two arms <b>50</b> together at the base end <b>48</b> of the clip <b>38</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the arms <b>50</b> at detachable end <b>52</b> of clip <b>38</b> include flared end portions <b>56</b> that provide an opening <b>58</b> at the detachable end for accommodating the distal end <b>44</b> of pin <b>36</b> when the detachable end <b>52</b> is closed upon the pin <b>36</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the tubular body <b>22</b> of the training bat <b>20</b> includes a storage space or cavity <b>35</b> for a plurality of weights <b>34</b>A-<b>34</b>E therein. A spacer <b>60</b>, secured above the knob <b>30</b> and within the tubular body <b>22</b> at the first end <b>24</b> of the bat <b>20</b>, serves to limit the movement of the weights when all the weights are stored within the bat as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, each of the weights <b>34</b>A-<b>34</b>E are of substantially cylindrical shape, have a diameter that substantially spans the hollow inner diameter of the cavity <b>35</b>, and the weights include a first or upper end <b>62</b>, a second or lower end <b>64</b>, and a bore <b>66</b> therein. Preferably, each of the bores <b>66</b> in the weights is equidistant from the upper end <b>62</b> of the weight. The weights are constructed of steel and preferably are of different lengths. The weights thus vary in weight, with the smallest weight most preferably weighing 3.4 ounces, with each successively larger weight being incrementally higher in weight by 3 ounces. The weights, from lightest (<b>34</b>A) to heaviest (<b>34</b>E) weigh 3.4, 6.4, 9.4, 12.4, and 15.4 ounces respectively, from left to right <b>10</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the knob <b>30</b> of the bat preferably includes a flat base portion <b>68</b> that abuts the first end <b>24</b> of the tubular body <b>22</b> and a tubular nose portion <b>70</b> that extends a slight distance within tubular body <b>22</b>. The knob <b>30</b> and spacer <b>60</b> may be secured to tubular body <b>22</b> by welding or similar fastening means.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">The training bat <b>20</b> is used to increase the bat speed of a batter as will be described herein. When not in use, as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, tubular body <b>22</b> includes all of the weights <b>34</b>A-<b>34</b>E stored therein. The knob <b>30</b> seals the first end <b>24</b> of the tubular body <b>22</b> and pin <b>36</b> extends through the tubular body <b>22</b> and bore <b>66</b> in weight <b>34</b>A, thereby holding all of the weights within the tubular body. Spacer <b>60</b> maintains the weights substantially flush against each other and limits the movement of the weights axially within the tubular body <b>22</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">To operate the invention, a batter would slide the clip member <b>38</b> off of the distal end <b>44</b> of the pin <b>36</b> and remove the pin <b>36</b> from the bat assembly. To increase his or her bat speed, the batter would begin practice by removing the heavier weights <b>34</b>B-<b>34</b>E and securing the smallest weight <b>34</b>A at the second end <b>26</b> of the bat using the clip member <b>38</b> and pin <b>36</b>. The batter would then sequentially progress through the remaining weights, changing to the next heavier weight at each step of the practice. Most preferably, the bat is between 31 and 35 inches in length and can be varied in weight from 25.4 ounces to 37.4 ounces in 3.0 ounce increments by sequentially progressing through the weights.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, while operating the invention with the selected weight <b>34</b> secured at the second end <b>26</b> of tubular body <b>22</b>, the batter grips the grip <b>29</b> of handle <b>28</b>, addresses the pitcher or batting machine, and swings at the pitched ball. After taking the desired number of swings with the smallest weight <b>34</b> secured by clip member <b>38</b> and pin <b>36</b>, the batter would install the next higher weight and subsequently progress sequentially through each higher weight to increase his or her bat speed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">Impact pad <b>32</b> includes two wide end portions <b>72</b> and a narrower mid-portion. The surface <b>74</b> of impact pad <b>32</b> is preferably tapered, being narrower in the middle than near the end portions <b>72</b>. The impact pad <b>32</b> provides a resilient contact surface for striking the pitched ball. The tapered surface <b>74</b> of impact pad <b>32</b> marks the sweet spot, or ideal striking portion, of the bat. The tapered surface <b>74</b> thus gives the batter an indication of the closeness of striking the ball at the sweet spot, as an impact at the center of the tapered surface will provide both a feel of stronger impact to the batter and also will provide an audible indication of stronger impact as an impact at the narrower center of the impact pad <b>32</b> will provide a less muffled sound that an impact at the wide end portions <b>72</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">Preferably the tubular body <b>22</b> and knob <b>30</b> are constructed of metal, and most preferably the tubular body <b>22</b> and knob <b>30</b> are constructed of aluminum. The knob <b>70</b> is preferably welded to the first end <b>24</b> of the tubular body <b>22</b> to close and seal the first end. Most preferably, impact pad <b>32</b> is constructed of closed cell foam rubber material. The grip <b>29</b> is preferably constructed of a flexible material, such as leather or rubber tape, that is wrapped around and adhered to the handle portion of the tubular body <b>22</b>. The clip member <b>38</b> is preferably constructed of a flexible metal such as spring steel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref>, there is shown a second and preferred embodiment of a detachable pin <b>80</b> according to the present invention. The detachable pin <b>80</b> includes a strap <b>82</b> having an outer layer <b>84</b> and an inner layer <b>86</b>. Detachable pin <b>80</b> further includes a pin member <b>36</b> including a head <b>42</b>, and a distal end <b>44</b>, with the head <b>42</b> secured between the inner <b>86</b> and outer <b>84</b> layers of the strap <b>82</b>. The strap <b>82</b> preferably includes complementary hook and loop fastening material on its opposing broad surfaces. Most preferably inner layer <b>86</b> includes hook material <b>88</b> thereon and outer layer <b>84</b> includes loop material <b>90</b> thereon. Head <b>42</b> of pin is embedded between the inner <b>86</b> and outer <b>84</b> layers of the strap <b>82</b> and distal end <b>44</b> of pin <b>36</b> extends from the strap. Detachable pin <b>80</b> includes a first end <b>92</b> and second end <b>94</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-13</figref>, detachable pin <b>80</b> is shown secured to the second end <b>26</b> tubular body <b>22</b> thus securing a core member <b>34</b> within the tubular body <b>22</b>, with the core member secured at a predetermined depth determined by the depth of bore <b>66</b> from the second end <b>62</b> of the core member <b>34</b>.
