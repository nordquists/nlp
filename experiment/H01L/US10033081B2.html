<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">When constructing multi-chip package structures, it is important to implement interconnect structures that enable communication between package components such as integrated circuit (IC) chips. Conventional structures for transmitting signals between package components include, for example, planar transmission lines such as microstrip, stripline, and coplanar waveguides transmission lines. While these transmission lines are sufficient for transmitting lower frequency signals, signal attenuation and frequency dispersion occurs when using such planar transmission lines to transmit high frequency signals that are demanded by today's industry standards. Indeed, the ability to implement high-speed communication links in package structures that are capable of transmitting at data rates in the range of Gbps (Gigabits per second) to hundreds of Gbps will be essential for various types of systems designed to operate at millimeter-wave frequencies to Terahertz frequencies, such as radar, imaging, and computer server systems.</div>

Similarly, the second IC chip <b>120</b> comprises a bulk substrate layer <b>121</b>, an insulating layer <b>122</b>, an active layer <b>123</b>, and a BEOL structure <b>124</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">The BEOL structures <b>114</b> and <b>124</b> of the respective IC chips <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> comprise respective transmission lines <b>116</b> and <b>126</b>, and other interconnect structures <b>118</b> and <b>128</b> that comprise a series of interconnected metallic traces and conductive vias which are formed within various alternating conductive and insulating/dielectric layers of the BEOL structures <b>114</b> and <b>124</b>. The BEOL structures <b>114</b> and <b>124</b> of the respective first and second IC chips provide a network of interconnects to connection active circuitry and other components formed in the respective active layers <b>113</b> and <b>123</b>. Furthermore, the BEOL structures <b>114</b> and <b>124</b> each comprise a plurality of bonding/contact pads such as, for example, ground pads, DC power supply pads, input/output pads, control signal pads, associated wiring, etc., that are formed as part of a BEOL wiring structure of the respective IC chips <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the first and second IC chips <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> are electrically and mechanically connected to the waveguide substrate <b>130</b> by flip-chip mounting the active (front side) surface of the first and second IC chips <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> to a first surface <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> of the waveguide substrate <b>130</b> using, for example, an array of solder ball controlled collapse chip connections (hereinafter known as C4) <b>150</b>, or other similar techniques. The C4 connections <b>150</b> are formed between bonding/contact pads and wiring patterns formed on a bottom surface of the BEOL structures <b>114</b> and <b>124</b>, and corresponding bonding/contact pads and wiring patterns of a patterned metallization layer formed on the first surface <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> of the waveguide substrate <b>130</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">Moreover, the waveguide substrate <b>130</b> is electrically and mechanically connected to the application board <b>140</b> using, for example, an array of BGA connections <b>160</b> or other similar techniques.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">As further shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the waveguide substrate <b>130</b> comprises an integrated waveguide <b>132</b>. The integrated waveguide <b>132</b> comprises a first metallic plate <b>132</b>-<b>1</b>, a second metallic plate <b>132</b>-<b>2</b>, and sidewalls <b>132</b>-<b>3</b>. The first and second metallic plates <b>132</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>132</b>-<b>3</b> are patterned from metallization layers on opposing surfaces <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>130</b>-<b>2</b> of the waveguide substrate <b>130</b>, and the sidewalls <b>132</b>-<b>3</b> comprise an array of metallic posts (e.g., metallized via holes) connecting the first and second metallic plates <b>132</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>132</b>-<b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> schematically illustrates a sidewall structure of the integrated waveguide <b>132</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, according to an embodiment of the invention. In particular, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates a sidewall structure along a length L of the integrated waveguide <b>132</b> (the length L corresponds to a direction of wave propagation in the integrated waveguide), wherein the sidewall structure comprises a series of metallic posts <b>132</b>-<b>3</b> that are formed with a spacing S between the metallic posts <b>132</b>-<b>3</b>. In one embodiment of the invention, the metallic posts <b>132</b>-<b>2</b> are formed by drilling or etching an array of via holes through the waveguide substrate <b>130</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) and then plating or otherwise filling the via holes with metallic material such as copper.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the package structure <b>100</b> further comprises a first transmission line to waveguide transition <b>134</b> and a second transmission line to waveguide transition <b>136</b>. The first transmission line to waveguide transition <b>134</b> is connected to the transmission line <b>116</b> in the BEOL structure <b>114</b> of the first IC chip <b>110</b>, and the second transmission line to waveguide transition <b>136</b> is connected to the transmission line <b>126</b> in the BEOL structure <b>124</b> of the second IC chip <b>120</b>. The transmission line to waveguide transitions <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> are formed, in part, by transition structures that are formed/patterned in the first metallic plate <b>132</b>-<b>1</b> of the integrated waveguide <b>132</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">The transmission lines <b>116</b> and <b>126</b> are formed from a series of interconnected wiring traces and conductive vias formed in the BEOL layers <b>114</b> and <b>124</b>. The transmission lines <b>116</b> and <b>126</b> serve to transmit high frequency signals between the integrated waveguide <b>132</b> and active circuitry in the active layers <b>113</b> and <b>123</b> of the first and second IC chips <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>. For high frequency applications, lateral extending portions of the transmission lines <b>116</b> and <b>126</b> may be formed by grounded planar transmission lines such as striplines or coplanar waveguide transmission lines to reduce coupling effects between the transmission lines <b>116</b> and <b>126</b> and surrounding components such as power plane, low frequency control signal lines, and other transmission lines.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">For example, a stripline transmission line comprises a signal line formed on one metallization level, which is disposed between two ground elements formed by ground planes of adjacent metallization levels. Moreover, vertical portions of the transmission lines <b>116</b> and <b>126</b> can include vertical signal lines (e.g., formed by a series of connected vertical vias through multiple layers of the BEOL structures <b>114</b> and <b>124</b>), wherein the vertical signal lines are shielded by series of grounding vias that surround the vertical signal line. In this regard, vertical portions of the transmission lines <b>116</b> and <b>126</b> are similar in structure and function to a coaxial transmission line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">The first and second transmission line to waveguide transitions <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> can be implemented using one of various types of known transmission line to waveguide transition structures that are sufficient to provide a transition between the transmission lines <b>116</b> and <b>126</b> and the L/O ports of the integrated waveguide <b>132</b>. Such transmission line to waveguide transition structures include, for example, microstrip, stripline, coplanar waveguide, slotted feed, and probe-type transition structures, or other types of GSG (ground signal ground) transition structures, which are suitable for the intended application.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">The integrated waveguide <b>132</b> provides a communication channel that allows the first and second IC chips <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> to communicate at high-speed data rates (e.g., data rates in the range of Gbps to hundreds of Gbps). Although one integrated waveguide structure is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the waveguide substrate <b>130</b> can be fabricated with two or more integrated waveguide structures to enable high-speed multi-channel communication between the first and second IC chips <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>. Moreover, although two IC chips are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> connected to the waveguide substrate <b>130</b>, the package structure <b>100</b> can have three or more IC chips flip-chip bonded to the waveguide substrate <b>130</b> with multiple integrated waveguide structures implemented in the waveguide substrate <b>130</b> to enable communication between all IC chips in the package structure <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">As further shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the waveguide substrate <b>130</b> comprises a plurality of conductive through vias <b>138</b> which provide electrical connections between contact pads and wiring patterns on the first and second surfaces <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>130</b>-<b>2</b> of the waveguide substrate. The conductive through vias <b>138</b> form part of the electrical wiring and interconnects that are utilized for supplying/distributing DC power to the IC chips <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> from power supply lines on the application board <b>140</b>, and for routing low frequency base band and control signals, for example, between the application board <b>140</b> and the IC chips <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>. Moreover, wiring patterns can be formed on the surface <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> of the waveguide substrate <b>130</b> and bonded to contact pads on the bottom surfaces of the BEOL structures <b>114</b> and <b>124</b> to enable low frequency communication between the first and second IC chips <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">In this regard, it is to be appreciated that the waveguide substrate <b>130</b> serves multiple purposes. For example, the waveguide substrate <b>130</b> serves as a package substrate for mounting and supporting the IC chips <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>. In addition, the waveguide substrate <b>130</b> serves as a package interposer for routing low frequency signals between the application board <b>140</b> and the IC chips <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>, for routing low frequency signals between the IC chips <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>, and for supplying power to IC chips <b>110</b> and <b>120</b>. Moreover, the waveguide substrate <b>130</b> comprises one or more integrated waveguide structures that enables low-loss, high-speed data communications between the IC chips mounted on the waveguide substrate <b>130</b>, as well as wiring patterns on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">The operating characteristics of the integrated waveguide <b>132</b> depends on various factors. For example, for low-loss transmission of high-speed communication signals, the waveguide substrate <b>130</b> should be fabricated using low loss insulating/dielectric material. For example, the waveguide substrate <b>130</b> can be formed of material such as glass (e.g., quartz) or high resistivity silicon, or other low loss materials that are suitable for the given package application. Moreover, the types of transmission line to waveguide transition structures that are implemented will have some effect on the amount of insertion loss and the operating bandwidth of the integrated waveguide, as is understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">Moreover, various dimensional parameters such as the spacing S between the metallic posts <b>132</b>-<b>3</b> forming the waveguide sidewalls and the cross-sectional dimensions (height H as shown in. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 1C</figref>, and width W as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>) of the integrated waveguide will depend on the desired operating frequency and bandwidth of and an integrated waveguide structure. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the spacing S between the metallic posts <b>132</b>-<b>3</b> should be small enough so that the sidewalls of the integrated waveguide <b>132</b> effectively provide a “closed structure” in conjunction with the metallic plates <b>132</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>132</b>-<b>2</b>. For example, in one embodiment of the invention, the spacing S between the metallic posts <b>132</b>-<b>3</b> is less than about ¼ of the operating wavelength Λ(S ≤0.25 Λ) of the integrated waveguide <b>132</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the waveguide structure along line <b>1</b>C-<b>1</b>C in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> shows the cross-sectional dimensions of the integrated waveguide structure <b>132</b> including the height H between the first and second metallic plates <b>132</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>132</b>-<b>2</b> (i.e., the thickness of the waveguide substrate <b>130</b>), and the waveguide width W between the opposing waveguide sidewalls <b>132</b>-<b>3</b>. The operating modes of the integrated waveguide <b>132</b> are based on the dimensions H and W. In one embodiment, the width W is preferably much greater than 2×H for the integrated waveguide (which is to be contrasted with standard rectangular waveguides in which W=2×H). The width W is approximately one-half (½) the operating wavelength of the integrated waveguide <b>132</b>. In this regard, the width W is a critical dimension that has a significant influence on the operating frequency of the waveguide. While the waveguide height H has some influence on the operating frequency, the height H primarily affects the loss of the waveguide structure. If the waveguide height H is too small, the insertion loss of the integrated waveguide increases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">Although not specifically shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the first and second metallic plates <b>132</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>132</b>-<b>2</b> and sidewalls <b>132</b>-<b>3</b> are grounded through grounding connections between the components of the integrated waveguide <b>132</b> and the IC chips <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> and/or the application board <b>140</b>. For example, in one embodiment of the invention, the second metallic plate <b>132</b>-<b>2</b> may be a package ground plane. In this regard, the laminated waveguide <b>132</b> provides an electrically isolated structure in which the propagating signals within the integrated waveguide <b>132</b> (propagating along the waveguide length L) are electrically isolated from external electrical signals. The electrical isolation allows two integrated waveguide structures to be disposed in parallel to each other at close proximity (e.g., small pitch) without interference between the propagating signals in the adjacent integrated waveguides. In fact, as will be explained in further detail below, two adjacent integrated waveguides can be constructed with a common sidewall structure that is shared between the two adjacent integrated waveguides, while providing sufficient isolation between propagating signals in the adjacent waveguides.</div>
