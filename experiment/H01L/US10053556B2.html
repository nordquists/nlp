<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to and the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2014-0174445 filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Dec. 5, 2014, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Barrier coating compositions, composites prepared therefrom, and quantum dot-polymer composite articles including the same are disclosed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">A light emitting particle may be dispersed in a polymer host matrix and may be used in various display devices as a composite. For example, a semiconductor nanocrystal called a quantum dot (QD) is dispersed in a host matrix of a polymer or an inorganic material, and thus may be used as a light conversion layer in a light emitting diode (LED) and the like. Particle size of the quantum dots may be relatively readily adjusted during colloid synthesis, and in addition, the particle sizes may be uniformly controlled. When the quantum dot has a size of less than or equal to about 10 nanometers (nm), a quantum confinement effect becomes significant, and thus, as the particle size decreases, the bandgap increases, and thereby the energy density becomes larger. Accordingly, the quantum dot may emit light in a visible light region with excellent luminous efficiency and thus, active research efforts have been focused on application of the quantum dot to various lighting devices, a light emitting diode (LED) for a backlight unit, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">The quantum dot has theoretical quantum efficiency of about 100% and may emit light with a high color purity (e.g., of less than or equal to about 40 nm of a full width at half maximum (FWHM)). Thus, the quantum dot is expected to provide high luminous efficiency and improved color reproducibility compared to an inorganic phosphor used in a conventional art. However, since the quantum dot is a short-living nano-size particle, which is vulnerable, for example, to an external factor such as moisture or oxygen (unlike the inorganic phosphor, which is a micro-size particle), development of technology for overcoming this problem is needed. When the quantum dot is used in a quantum dot-polymer composite in a light emitting diode or a quantum dot sheet, it is important to well maintain a passivation layer on the surface of the quantum dot in order to secure its high efficiency and color purity. The quantum dot-polymer composite may have a barrier coating for protecting the quantum dot from moisture or oxygen, and as the barrier coating, a deposited metal oxide (e.g., formed by sputtering and the like) has been extensively used. However, a currently-used barrier coating shows an insufficient performance with regard to the economic or technological aspects of the device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, there remains a need in a new and efficient barrier coating that would be applicable to a quantum dot polymer composite.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139">This disclosure will be described more fully hereinafter in the following detailed description, in which some but not all embodiments of this disclosure are described. This disclosure may be embodied in many different forms and is not to be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will fully convey the scope of the instant disclosure to those skilled in the art. Thus, in some exemplary embodiments, well-known technologies are not specifically explained to avoid ambiguous understanding of the present inventive concept. Thus, in some exemplary embodiments, well known technologies are not specifically explained to avoid ambiguous understanding of the present inventive concept. Accordingly, the exemplary embodiments are merely described below, by referring to the figures, to explain aspects of the present inventive concept. Expressions such as “at least one of,” when preceding a list of elements, modify the entire list of elements and do not modify the individual elements of the list. Unless otherwise defined, all terms used in the specification (including technical and scientific terms) may be used with meanings commonly understood by a person having ordinary knowledge in the art to which this invention belongs. Further, unless explicitly defined to the contrary, the terms defined in a generally-used dictionary should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and the present disclosure, and are not ideally or excessively interpreted. In addition, unless explicitly described to the contrary, the word “comprise” and variations such as “comprises” or “comprising”, and the word “include” and variations such as “includes” or “including”, when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, regions, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, regions, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof. Therefore, the above words will be understood to imply the inclusion of stated elements but not the exclusion of any other elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0140">It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, third etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers, and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers, and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer, or section from another element, component, region, layer, or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer, or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer, or section without departing from the teachings of the present embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0141">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting. As used herein, the singular forms “a,” “an,” and “the” are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0143" num="0142">Spatially relative terms, such as “beneath,” “below,” “lower,” “above,” “upper” and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as “below” or “beneath” other elements or features would then be oriented “above” the other elements or features. Thus, the exemplary term “below” can encompass both an orientation of above and below. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0144" num="0143">“About” or “approximately” as used herein is inclusive of the stated value and means within an acceptable range of deviation for the particular value as determined by one of ordinary skill in the art, considering the measurement in question and the error associated with measurement of the particular quantity (i.e., the limitations of the measurement system).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0144">Exemplary embodiments are described herein with reference to cross section illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, embodiments described herein should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions as illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, a region illustrated or described as flat may, typically, have rough and/or nonlinear features. Moreover, sharp angles that are illustrated may be rounded. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the precise shape of a region and are not intended to limit the scope of the present claims.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0145">As stated above, unless specifically described to the contrary, a singular form includes a plural form.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0147" num="0146">In the drawings, the thickness of layers, films, panels, regions, etc., are exaggerated for clarity. Like reference numerals designate like elements throughout the specification.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0148" num="0147">It will be understood that when an element such as a layer, film, region, or substrate is referred to as being “on” another element, it can be directly on the other element or intervening elements may also be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being “directly on” another element, there are no intervening elements present.</div>

The clay particle may be included in an amount of less than or equal to about 20 parts by weight, for example, in an amount of less than or equal to about 19 parts by weight, less than or equal to about 18 parts by weight, less than or equal to about 17 parts by weight, less than or equal to about 16 parts by weight, less than or equal to about 15 parts by weight, less than or equal to about 14 parts by weight, less than or equal to about 13 parts by weight, less than or equal to about 12 parts by weight, or less than or equal to about 10 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the monomer combination. While not wishing to be bound by a theory, it is understood that when the clay particle is included within the above ranges, transmission rate of oxygen and moisture may be lowered and light transmittance of the prepared composition may be increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0178" num="0177">The clay particle may include smectite clay, mica clay, vermiculite clay, montmorillonite clay, iron-containing montmorillonite clay, beidellite clay, saponite clay, hectorite clay, stibensite clay, nontronite clay, anionic clay (e.g., layered double hydroxide or hydrotalcite), zirconium phosphate, kaolinite, atapulgite, illite, halloysite, diatomaceous earth, fuller's earth, calcined aluminum silicate, hydrated aluminum silicate, magnesium aluminum silicate, sodium silicate, and magnesium silicate, or a combination thereof. In an embodiment, the clay particle may be smectite clay. The clay particle may be a sheet-shaped particle having a nano-sized thickness. The clay particle may have an aspect ratio ranging from about 20 to about 10,000 in an exfoliated form. Herein, the aspect ratio indicates a ratio of a longest diameter of the clay particle (a single clay sheet) relative to a thickness thereof. In an embodiment, the clay particle may have the longest average diameter of about 50 nanometers (nm) to about 10 micrometers (um), for example, about 50 nm to about 1 um, and an average thickness of about 1 nm to about 10 nm. The clay particle may have a layered structure including at least one sheet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0179" num="0178">The clay particle includes the compound including a hydrocarbyl group linked to a heteroatom and thus may be a lipophilic (or hydrophobic) clay particle. This clay particle may be dispersed in a post-described monomer combination or a cross-linked polymer manufactured therefrom without remarkable phase-separation or aggregation. This clay particle may be dispersed in a post-described monomer combination or a cross-linked polymer manufactured therefrom without remarkable interlayer exfoliation. As a result, a barrier coating composition including the clay particle or a clay-polymer composite prepared therefrom may show high transmittance with regard to visible light. For example, the barrier coating composition including the clay particle (and the clay-polymer composite prepared therefrom) may have light transmittance of greater than or equal to about 85%, for example, greater than or equal to about 90% for visible light.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0242" num="0241">In the monomer combination, an amount of the first monomer and second monomer may be adjusted in order to obtain desirable properties of the resulting polymer. For example, in the monomer combination, the first monomer and the second monomer may be present in such amounts that a mole ratio of the thiol group of the first monomer to the carbon-carbon unsaturated bond of the second monomer may be about 1:0.1 to about 1:10, for example, about 1:about 0.2 to 1:5, about 1:about 0.75 to 1:3, about 1:about 1.1 to 2, or about 1:about 1.5 to 1.8. While not wishing to be bound by a theory, it is understood that when the monomer combination includes the first and second monomers within the above ranges, a polymer composite manufactured therefrom may have a high density network and thus excellent mechanical strength and properties.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0243" num="0242">The composition for the light emitting particle-polymer composite may further include a third monomer having one thiol group located at a terminal end of the third monomer or a fourth monomer having one unsaturated carbon-carbon bond located at a terminal end of the fourth monomer, or both of the third and fourth monomers.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0244" num="0243">Examples of the third monomer may be a C1 to C20 alkyl 3-mercaptopropionate(alkyl 3-mercaptopropionate), alkyl thioglycolate, a C1 to C20 thiol-substituted (meth)acrylate, a C1 to C20 thiol-substituted silane, for example (3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane, but are not limited thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0245" num="0244">Examples of the fourth monomer may be (meth)acrylates such as isobornyl(meth)acrylate, isooctyl(meth)acrylate, lauryl(meth)acrylate, benzoyl(meth)acrylate, norbornyl(meth)acrylate, cyclohexyl(meth)acrylate, n-hexyl(meth)acrylate, isooctyl(meth)acrylate, butyl(meth)acrylate, adamantyl acrylate, and cyclopentyl acrylate, vinyl ether, alkyl ether, propenyl ether, alkenes such as pentene, and hexene, unsaturated ester, maleimide, acrylonitrile, styrene, diene, N-vinyl amide, and the like, but are not limited thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0246" num="0245">The amounts of the third monomer and the fourth monomer are not particularly limited, and may be appropriately selected considering miscibility, viscosity, releasing properties, and optical properties. For example, the third monomer such as (3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane may be used in an amount of less than or equal to about 30 parts by weight, for example less than or equal to about 20 parts by weight, less than or equal to about 15 parts by weight, or less than or equal to about 10 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the monomer combination, and the fourth monomer such as the lauryl methacrylate monomer may be used in an amount of less than or equal to about 30 parts by weight, for example less than or equal to about 20 parts by weight, less than or equal to about 15 parts by weight, less than or equal to about 12 parts by weight, or less than or equal to about 10 parts by weight, without limitation. While not wishing to be bound by a theory, it is understood that within the above ranges, a composite manufacturing process may be smoothly carried out while ensuring mechanical properties of the composite.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0247" num="0246">The monomer combination may further include an initiator so as to promote a polymerization initiation reaction. The initiator may be a phosphine oxide compound, an α-amino ketone, phenylglyoxylate, a monoacyl phosphine, a benzylmethyl ketal, a hydroxyketone, azobisisobutyronitrile, benzoyl peroxide, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0248" num="0247">In an embodiment, the barrier coating composition may provide a clay-polymer composite including a cross-linked polymer formed by polymerization between the first monomer and the second monomer and the clay particle dispersed in the cross-linked polymerization product, or a barrier coating including the same. In the clay-polymer composite or the barrier coating including the same, details of the first monomer, the second monomer, and the clay particle are the same as described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0249" num="0248">The first monomer and the second monomer may form a highly cross-linked polymer through a polymerization mechanism as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a thiyl radical may be formed from a thiol group by an initiation reaction using light and an initiator as needed. The formed thiyl radical may react with a carbon-carbon unsaturated bond to form a vinyl radical, which then may participate in a propagation reaction by reacting with the thiol or carbon-carbon unsaturated bond. The polymerization may be terminated by a recombination between the formed thiyl radical and thiyl radical, between the vinyl radical and the vinyl radical, or between the thiyl radical and the vinyl radical. In the monomer combination, since the first monomer includes two or more thiol groups (e.g., 3 thiol groups or 4 thiol groups) and the second monomer includes two or more unsaturated bonds, the polymer prepared from the monomer combination may have a highly densified cross-linking structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0250" num="0249">In addition, such a densified cross-linked polymer includes organo-modified clay particles dispersed in the monomer combination of the first and second monomers before polymerization. The clay particle may be included in an amount of about 0.1 to about 20 wt %, for example, about 1 wt % to about 15 wt % based on the total weight of the clay-polymer composite. The clay-polymer composite according to an embodiment may have a structure where a plurality of organo-modified clay particles including the organic compound on the surface thereof is dispersed in a highly cross-linked thiol-ene polymer network. Such organo-modified clay particles may increase haze of the composite without having a negative effect on its light transmittance. For example, as described above, the clay-polymer composite or the barrier coating including the same may have transmittance of greater than or equal to about 85%, for example, greater than or equal to about 90%, for visible light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0251" num="0250">In the clay-polymer composite, the clay particles do not permeate gases due to its high-density crystal structure. Accordingly, a gas transfer path is remarkably prolonged in the clay-polymer composite according to an embodiment, and thus, the composite or a coating including this composite may show a remarkably low gas (e.g., oxygen) transmission rate. In addition, the clay particles have a long-chained hydrocarbyl group on their surface, and the above clay-polymer composite may have sufficiently high resistance against water transmission without an additional water-repellent treatment. Accordingly, a clay-polymer composite according to an embodiment or a barrier coating including the clay-polymer composite may show high resistance against oxygen and water transmissions. For example, the clay composite may have an oxygen transmittance rate (OTR) measured at 23° C. under relative humidity (RH) of 0% according to ASTM D 3985 or JIS K 7128-2 with Oxytran (Mocon Inc.) of less than or equal to about 5 grams per square meter per day (cc/m<sup>2</sup>/day/atm).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0252" num="0251">The clay composite may have a water vapor transmittance rate (WVTR) measured at 37° C. under relative humidity of 100% according to JIS K7129B with Aquatran (Mocon Inc.) and the like, of less than or equal to about 5 grams per square meter per day (g/m<sup>2</sup>/day).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0253" num="0252">The above clay-polymer composite or the barrier coating including the same shows a high light transmission rate and excellent gas/moisture blocking characteristics, and thus may be used as a barrier layer of a quantum dot-polymer matrix. Accordingly, in another embodiment, a quantum dot-polymer composite article includes:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0254" num="0253">a quantum dot-polymer composite that includes a polymer host matrix and a plurality of quantum dot dispersed in the polymer host; and</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0261" num="0260">The barrier coating may have one layer or two or more layers. When the barrier coating has two layers, each layer may include the same as or different composition and thickness. The thickness of the barrier coating is not particularly limited, and may be adjusted as desired. For example, the barrier coating may have a thickness of greater than or equal to about 1 um, for example greater than or equal to about 50 um, without limitation. For example, the barrier coating may have a thickness of less than or equal to about 300 um, for example, less than or equal to about 200 um, without limitation. The barrier coating may be formed from the barrier coating composition or the clay-polymer composite. On the barrier coating, a base film of a transparent polymer such as polyester, polycarbonate, polyimide, polyamide, and PET or a transparent inorganic material substrate may be provided. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic view showing the cross-section of a quantum dot-polymer composite article according to an embodiment. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the above clay-polymer composite is provided as a barrier coating on both sides of a quantum dot polymer composite, and a base film may be provided on the barrier coating. Alternatively, the above clay-polymer composite may be provided as a barrier coating on one side of the quantum dot polymer composite.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0262" num="0261">Since a quantum dot is a light emitting material having high color purity and improved color reproducibility, a quantum dot-polymer composite obtained by dispersing the quantum dot in a polymer host matrix is widely used as various lighting elements, or a light emitting diode used in a backlight unit for a display or a quantum dot sheet for improving display quality of the display. This quantum dot-polymer composite includes various barrier films for protecting a quantum dot included therein from oxygen and moisture. This barrier film mostly has a metal oxide thin layer such as SiO<sub>2</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub>, or Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>layer disposed on a polymer substrate. This metal oxide thin layer is formed by physical deposition (e.g., sputtering or thermal evaporation) requiring expensive vacuum equipment, plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), and atomic layer deposition. In addition, a conventional barrier film includes at least two metal oxide layers in order to decrease a pinhole defect, and thus, the devise including the barrier film has a high price.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0263" num="0262">Technologically, the conventional barrier film for a QD-polymer composite has an insufficient close contacting property on the interface between a polymer host matrix and a metal oxide, since the metal oxide layer is positioned on the side that contacts the QD-polymer composite. In order to solve this problem, the metal oxide layer is coated with an organic silane compound or an organic/inorganic composite overcoat including siloxane and polyacrylate disposed on the surface of the metal oxide layer, but this process further increases a cost for forming the barrier layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0264" num="0263">On the contrary, a barrier coating including the above clay-polymer composite may play a role of a barrier against oxygen and moisture with a remarkably decreased cost when applied to the surface of the quantum dot-polymer composite. In addition, the above clay-polymer composite, unlike the metal oxide layer, has an excellent interface close contacting property with the surface of the quantum dot polymer composite, and thus needs no particular surface treatment. Furthermore, the above clay-polymer composite shows high light transmittance, and thus has almost no negative influence on the light emitting characteristics of a quantum dot.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0265" num="0264">In an embodiment, the above quantum dot-polymer composite article may be manufactured by preparing a quantum dot polymer composite, coating the barrier coating composition on at least a part of the surface of the quantum dot polymer composite, and curing the barrier coating composition. According to another embodiment, the above quantum dot-polymer composite article may be manufactured by laminating a barrier coating including the above clay-polymer composite on at least a part of the surface of the quantum dot polymer composite (e.g., one surface or both surfaces). When the above clay-polymer composite is disposed on a base film, the quantum dot polymer composite article may be manufactured by disposing the surface of the quantum dot polymer composite to face the surface of the above clay-polymer composite.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0267" num="0266">The quantum dot-polymer composite may have any shape or size, but are generally spherical, ellipsoidal, polyhedral, or irregular in shape. For example, the quantum dot-polymer composite may have a sheet shape, a bar shape, a pipe shape, or a tube shape. For example, the quantum dot-polymer composite may be manufactured by using a mold or by casting to have various thicknesses and forms.</div>

The semiconductor nanocrystal may have a core/shell structure, wherein a semiconductor nanocrystal surrounds another (different) semiconductor nanocrystal. The core and shell may have an interface, and an element in of at least one of the core or the shell in the interface may have a concentration gradient wherein the concentration of the element(s) of the shell decreases toward the core. The semiconductor nanocrystal may have one core of a semiconductor nanocrystal and multi-shells surrounding the core. The core and multi-shell structure has at least two shells, wherein each shell may be a single composition, an alloy, or the one having a concentration gradient.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0284" num="0283">In addition, in the semiconductor nanocrystal, the materials of the shell may have a larger energy bandgap than that of the core, and thereby the semiconductor nanocrystal may exhibit a quantum confinement effect more effectively. In case of a multi-shell type of semiconductor nanocrystal particle, the bandgap of the material of an outer shell may be higher energy than that of the material of an inner shell (a shell that is closer to the core). In this case, the semiconductor nanocrystal may emit light of a wavelength ranging from UV to infrared light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0285" num="0284">The semiconductor nanocrystal may have quantum efficiency of greater than or equal to about 10%, for example, greater than or equal to about 30%, greater than or equal to about 50%, greater than or equal to about 60%, greater than or equal to about 70%, or greater than or equal to about 90%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0286" num="0285">The semiconductor nanocrystal may be designed to have a wider or narrower full width at half maximum (FWHM) in its photoluminescence spectrum depending on its application. By way of an example, for use in display devices, the semiconductor nanocrystal may have a narrower FWHM so as to realize enhanced color purity or color reproducibility. The semiconductor nanocrystal may have a FWHM of less than or equal to about 45 nanometers (nm), for example less than or equal to about 40 nm, or less than or equal to about 30 nm.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0290" num="0289">In a non-limiting example, the quantum dot having a several nanometer size may be prepared via a wet chemical method. In the wet chemical method, precursors react in an organic solvent to grow nanocrystal particles, and the organic solvent or a ligand compound may coordinate the surface of the quantum dot, thus providing the crystal growth. As the coordinated organic solvents on the surface of the quantum dot may adversely affect the stability of the device, extra organic materials not coordinating the surface of the quantum dot may be removed by adding the quantum dot in an excess amount of a non-solvent and centrifuging the resulting mixture. Examples of the non-solvent may include, but are not limited to, acetone, ethanol, methanol, and the like. After the removal of extra organic materials, the amount of the organic materials coordinated on the surface of the quantum dot may be less than or equal to about 35% by weight.</div>

For example, the ligand compound may be RCOOH, RNH<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>NH, R<sub>3</sub>N, RSH, R<sub>3</sub>P(═O), R<sub>3</sub>P, ROH, RC(═O)OR′, RP(═O)(OH)<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>P(═O)OH (wherein R and R′ are independently a C1 to C24 alkyl group or a C5 to C20 aryl group), or a combination thereof. The organic ligand compound may be coordinated to the surface of the quantum dots at the time the quantum dots are prepared to well-dispersing the quantum dots in a solution, and to modulate the light-emitting and electrical characteristics of the quantum dots.
