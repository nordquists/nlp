These applications are hereby incorporated by reference herein.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to light emitting modules adapted to produce output spectra having desirable spectral composition, and to the use of such light emitting modules.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Light sources or illumination devices consisting of light emitting diodes (LEDs) are increasingly used for replacing conventional light sources such as incandescent lamps and fluorescent light sources. LEDs offer many advantages compared to conventional light sources, especially when it comes to light conversion efficiency. However, one disadvantage is that LEDs generate light in a relatively narrow spectral band.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">In many applications, such as retail applications and environments, the standard with respect to for example color rendition is set by light sources such as the Philips CDM-Elite. The CDM-Elite lamp has high quality of light and an excellent white rendition. The term “white rendition” refers to a desired improved white appearance of a white object being illuminated by a light source. When LED-based light sources are used to replace traditional lighting systems, they are especially required to generate light that is perceived as white.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Color reproduction is typically measured using the color rendering index (CRI), which is calculated in Ra. The CRI is sometimes also referred to as color rendition index. The CRI is a quantitative measure of the ability of a light source to reproduce the colors of various objects faithfully in comparison with an ideal or natural light source. Daylight has a high CRI, where Ra is approximately 100. Incandescent bulbs are relatively close with an Ra greater than 95 and fluorescent lighting is less accurate with an Ra of typically 70-90.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Consequently, in order to achieve the desired “white” light in LED-based lighting applications, light sources with a high CRI are desirable. For LED lighting systems there are warm-white or neutral-white LED modules with a color rendering of about 80-90 readily available. Although the color rendition of these sources is good, white objects viewed under these light sources appear somewhat less white compared to the standard conventional alternatives. In some applications, this may be a disadvantage for these LED modules, especially for the mentioned retail applications where lamps having excellent white rendition, often referred to as “crisp white”, are preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">The term chromaticity is used to identify the color of a light source regardless of its brightness or luminance. In particular, the chromaticity of a light source can be represented by chromaticity coordinates, or color points in the 1931 CIE Chromaticity Diagram or the 1976 CIE Chromaticity Diagram (Commission International de l'Eclairage). The color temperature of a light source is defined in terms of an ideal, purely thermal light source also known as a blackbody radiator, whose light spectrum has the same chromaticity as that of the light source. The color temperature is measured in Kelvin (K). The so called black body locus (or line) is the path or line that the color of an incandescent black body would take in a particular chromaticity space as the blackbody temperature changes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Many attempts have been made relating to improvement of the white light illumination of LED sources. US 2007/0284563 discloses a light emitting device including at least three different LEDs to emit light in the blue, green or red wavelength range, optionally a fourth LED having a peak emission wavelength of 410-460, and also including a wavelength conversion means to convert primary light into secondary light. Using LEDs having narrow emission ranges and a phosphor emitting yellow-green or orange light having relatively wide emission wavelength ranges high color rendering ability is achieved. According to US 2007/0284563, a high CRI (&gt;90) can be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">However, although the light is generally perceived as white and has good color rendering, the white light is still not the “crisp white” desired for many applications. Hence, there is still a need for an efficient solution for providing the desired white light having improved white rendition in LED applications.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0022">wherein 0.6≤A′≤3.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0023">As used herein, “deep blue” or “short wavelength blue” denotes blue light of the wavelength range from 380 and up to 440 nm. The second light emitting element according to the invention has an emission peak wavelength in the range of from 390 to 440 nm, typically from 400 to 440 nm. Hence, light below the peak wavelength may also be within the “short wavelength blue” range.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0024">Furthermore, as used herein, “blue”, “regular blue”, “normal blue” or “standard blue” generally refers to light having a peak wavelength in the range of from 440 to 460 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0025">As used herein, “light emitting element” refers to a light emitting semiconductor structure, such as an LED chip or die. A light emitting diode may comprise one or more light emitting elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0026">As used herein, in particular with respect to the above-described second aspect of the invention, “emitter” refers to a source of light of a particular wavelength range. The term “emitter” is intended to include a light emitting element as well as a fluorescent or luminescent material, such as a wavelength converting material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0027">Hence, a light emitting module according to the second aspect of the invention may comprise a deep blue emitter, typically in the form of a deep blue light emitting element, a blue emitter in the form of a blue light emitting element or a blue wavelength converting material (capable of converting part of the deep blue light into normal blue), and another wavelength converting material for converting part of the normal blue light into light of the green to red wavelength range. Alternatively, a light source according to the second aspect of the invention may comprise a normal blue light emitting element (corresponding to the first light emitting element according to the first aspect of the invention), a deep blue light emitting element (corresponding to the second light emitting element according to the first aspect of the invention), and a wavelength converting material for converting part of the normal blue light into light of the green to red wavelength range.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0028">In a study, the present inventors found that by adding a certain amount of short wavelength blue light (also referred to as “deep blue”) to the spectrum, an excellent white rendition can be achieved also for LED modules. Thus, the present invention is based on the realization that by adding a certain amount of short wavelength blue light to the output spectrum, an excellent white rendition can be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0029">Hence, according to the present invention the light emitting module produces an output light spectrum having an intensity peak somewhere in the wavelength range of 400-440 nm, preferably in the range of 400-425 nm or 400-420 nm. In contrast to the device of US 2007/028563, which uses a blue LED having a peak emission wavelength in the range 410-460 nm in combination with a phosphor which undoubtedly is provided to convert the light into longer wavelengths, the contribution from the “deep blue” emitter or light emitting element of the invention is to a large extent preserved in the total output spectrum and thereby provides a “crisp white” effect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0030">To further improve the white appearance the color point of the light emitting module according to embodiments of the invention may be tuned to lie below the black body line (BBL), in particular for low correlated color temperatures, CCTs (typically 4000 K or less).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0031">It has been established an object appears whiter either if it appears brighter, or if it appears achromatic or slightly chromatic with a blue tint. Hence, a bluish color point is perceived as more white than a color point that lies on the black body line (BBL). It is therefore possible to obtain “crisp” white light by tuning the color point of a light source far below the BBL by addition of normal blue. This will however result in a color point outside the ANSI (American National Standards Institute) color space, which defines acceptable variations for an LED light source of a determined color temperature (e.g. 3000 K), also referred to as “ANSI bins”. However, the present inventors have found that by adding short wavelength blue light according to the invention rather than normal blue, the final color point may again be located within the ANSI space, and still give excellent white rendering, including “crisp white”. It may be noted that the addition of the short wavelength blue is not particularly meant to increase the CRI, but to provide a desired “crisp white” effect.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0034">In embodiments of the invention, the light generated by the light emitting module may have a color point in the CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram or the 1976 CIE chromaticity diagram which lies on the black body line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0035">In embodiments of the invention, the light generated by the light emitting module may have a color point in the CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram or the 1976 CIE chromaticity diagram which lies below or slightly below the black body line. When the color point of the light generated by the light emitting module is tuned at little bit below the black body line (this further improves the white appearance of an illuminated white object.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0037">The light emitting module according to embodiments of the invention may be adapted to produce white output light having an emission peak in the wavelength range from 400 to 435 nm, e.g. from 405 to 420 nm, such as from 405 to 415 nm or from 410 to 420 nm. The second wavelength range may thus be from 400 to 435 nm, e.g. from 405 to 420 nm, such as from 405 to 415 nm or from 410 to 420 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0038">Further, the light emitted by the wavelength converting material may be from 500 to 780 nm, typically from 500 to 600 nm, e.g. from 500 to 560 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0039">In embodiments of the invention, the light emitting module comprises at least two different wavelength converting materials. For example, one wavelength converting material may be capable of emitting light having an emission peak wavelength in the range of from 500 to 600 nm (representing green-yellow) and one wavelength converting material may be capable of emitting light having an emission peak wavelength in the range of from 600-780 nm (representing orange or red).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0040">In embodiments of the invention, a major portion of the light emitted by the second light emitting element (according to the first aspect of the invention) is not converted by the green/yellow/red wavelength converting material. Instead, this deep blue light may form part of the total output spectrum and thus may contribute to a crisp white effect. Accordingly in embodiments of the second aspect of the invention, a major portion of the light emitted by the deep blue emitter is not converted by the green/yellow/red wavelength converting material.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0047">In embodiments of the invention, the wavelength converting material is arranged remotely from said first light emitting element or said semiconductor-based light emitting element, respectively. Hence, the wavelength converting material may be a remote phosphor element. Optionally the wavelength converting material may also be arranged remotely from said second light emitting element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0048">In embodiments of the invention, at least a portion of the wavelength converting material may be provided on the first light emitting element or semiconductor-based light emitting element, respectively, and may thus form a phosphor-converted white light emitting diode. Optionally, another portion of said wavelength converting material may be arranged on the second light emitting element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0049">Alternatively, in embodiments of the invention, the second light emitting element may lack a wavelength converting material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0050">An additional benefit of the light emitting module according to some embodiments of the invention is that it may solve or alleviate problems relating to uneven spectral distribution of the emitted light at different viewing angles, also referred to as “color over angle” problems. In conventional phosphor converted LEDs the output light contains less blue light at large emission angles, since blue light emitted at large angles are converted to a higher extent due to its longer path through the phosphor. Conventional ways of solving this problem for white phosphor converted LEDs can be adding scattering to the phosphor layer (which however lead to reduced efficiency) or a dichroic filter on top of the phosphor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0051">However, advantageously, the addition of a second (although short wavelength) blue LED according to the invention results in a Lambertian emission for the major portion of blue light emitted by the module, so that the emitted light is more homogeneous with respect to color over various viewing angles.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0092">The present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which currently preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided for thoroughness and completeness, and fully convey the scope of the invention to the skilled person.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0093"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an embodiment of the present invention in the form of a light emitting arrangement <b>100</b> which may form part of a light emitting module equipped with driving electronics etc, as appreciated by a skilled person. The light emitting arrangement <b>100</b> comprises a first light emitting element <b>101</b> and a second light emitting element <b>102</b> arranged on a support <b>103</b>. The first light emitting element <b>101</b>, here a first light emitting diode (LED) chip, is adapted to emit light in the blue wavelength range, in particular from 440 to 460 nm. A wavelength converting material <b>104</b>, also referred to as a phosphor, is arranged on the first LED chip <b>101</b>, e.g. as a layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0094">The wavelength converting material <b>104</b> is adapted to convert part of the blue light emitted by the first LED <b>101</b> into light of longer wavelengths, typically of the green to red spectral range, so that the resulting combination of blue light (440-460 nm) and green to red light is perceived as white. Hence it may be a yellow, green or red phosphor. The LED chip <b>101</b> in combination with the wavelength converting material <b>104</b> may be referred to as a phosphor-converted white LED chip.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0095">Further, the second light emitting element <b>102</b>, here a second LED chip, is adapted to emit short wavelength blue light, typically in the wavelength range from 400 to 440 nm. In this embodiment, the second LED chip <b>102</b> lacks a wavelength converting material, and may be referred to as a direct emitting LED chip.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0096">During operation, light emitted from the first LED chip will be partially converted by the wavelength converting material <b>104</b> to yield white light having a conventional spectral distribution. However, the light emitted by the second LED chip will not be converted by any wavelength converting material, and thus will provide a spectral contribution to the total light output from the light emitting arrangement in the form of an emission peak in the wavelength range from 400 to 440 nm. Hence, the light emitting arrangement <b>100</b> yields white output light having an additional emission peak in the wavelength range from 400 to 440 nm, which result from the second LED chip <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0097">In some embodiments, the second LED chip <b>102</b> may be adapted to emit light in the wavelength range from 400 to 435 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0098">The support <b>103</b> may be or form part of any suitable physical and/or functional support structure, including a printed circuit board (PCB). The support <b>103</b> may carry means for electrical connection required for the light emitting elements <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>. Optionally, parts of the support <b>103</b> may be reflective.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0099">It is also contemplated the light emitting arrangement <b>100</b> may be surrounded by at least one reflective wall, optionally forming a light mixing chamber.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0100">The wavelength converting materials used in the present invention may be inorganic phosphors emitting in the green to red wavelength range.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0101">Examples of suitable wavelength converting materials include, but are not limited to, cerium (Ce) doped garnets, such as Ce doped YAG (Y<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>), also denoted YAG:Ce or Ce doped LuAG (Lu<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>), also denoted LuAG:Ce. YAG:Ce emits yellowish light, whereas LuAG:Ce emits yellow-greenish light. Alternatively, a YAG:Ce material in which some of the yttrium is replaced with gallium (Ga) (thus emitting yellow-greenish light) may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0102">The absorption maximum of YAG:Ce is typically at around 455 nm. The absorption maximum of LuAG:Ce is typically at around 445 nm. Using YAG:Ce in the present invention, a CRI of 80 may be achieved. However using LuAG:Ce, a higher CRI, up to 90, may be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0103">Examples of inorganic phosphor materials which emit red light may include, but are not limited to ECAS (ECAS, which is Ca<sub>1-x</sub>AlSiN<sub>3</sub>:Eu<sub>x </sub>wherein 0&lt;x≤1; preferably 0&lt;x≤0.2) and BSSN (BSSNE, which is Ba<sub>2-x-z</sub>M<sub>x</sub>Si<sub>5-y</sub>Al<sub>y</sub>N<sub>8-y</sub>O<sub>y</sub>:Eu<sub>z </sub>wherein M represents Sr or Ca, 0≤x≤1 and preferably 0≤x≤0.2, 0≤y≤4, and 0.0005≤z≤0.05).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0104">In embodiments of the invention at least two wavelength converting materials may be used. Typically, in such embodiments, one wavelength converting material emits light in the green to yellow spectral range and one wavelength converting material emits light in the red spectral range.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0105"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows another embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, a light emitting arrangement <b>200</b> comprises a first light emitting element, here a first LED chip <b>201</b>, and a second light emitting element, here a second LED chip <b>202</b>. The first LED chip <b>201</b> is adapted to emit blue light of the wavelength range from 440 to 460 nm. The second LED chip <b>202</b> is adapted to emit light of the wavelength range from 400 to 460 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0106">In contrast to the embodiment described above with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the first LED chip <b>201</b> is not a phosphor-converted LED chip, i.e. does not have a wavelength converting material arranged directly on top of the chip. Instead, in the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a wavelength converting member <b>204</b> comprising a wavelength converting material is arranged remotely from both the first LED chip <b>201</b> and the second LED chip <b>202</b>, to receive light emitted by both LED chips <b>201</b>, <b>202</b>. The wavelength converting member <b>204</b> may be referred to as a “remote phosphor” or as being in “remote configuration”. The wavelength converting member <b>204</b> may also be referred to as a remote phosphor layer. The wavelength converting member may be self-supporting and may be provided in the form of a film, a sheet, a plate, a disc, or the like. Although not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the wavelength converting member may be supported by one or more side walls surrounding the light sources <b>201</b>, <b>202</b>, such that the wavelength converting member forms a lid or a window.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0107">Typically, the wavelength converting material contained in the wavelength converting member <b>204</b> may be adapted to convert blue light into light of longer wavelengths, typically of the green to red spectral range, so that the resulting combination of blue light (440-460 nm) and green to red light is perceived as white. Thus, light emitted by the first LED <b>201</b> is received by the wavelength converting member <b>204</b> and is partially converted, whereas light emitted by the second LED <b>202</b> which is received by the wavelength converting member <b>204</b> is not substantially converted, but rather transmitted. The light emitting arrangement <b>200</b> hence yields white output light having an additional emission peak in the wavelength range from 400 to 440 nm, which results from the second LED chip <b>202</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0108">In some embodiments, the wavelength converting member <b>204</b> may comprise a wavelength converting material having an absorption maximum above 450 nm, for example at about 455 nm. One example of such a material is YAG:Ce. In such embodiments, the second LED chip <b>202</b> may have an emission peak at or near 440 nm, which due to the higher absorption wavelength of the wavelength converting material may still avoid too much conversion of light emitted by the second LED chip <b>202</b>, in particular light having wavelengths below 435 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0109">In other embodiments, the wavelength converting member <b>204</b> may comprise a wavelength converting material having an absorption maximum below 450 nm, e.g. at or around 445 nm. One example of such a material is LuAG:Ce.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0110">Another embodiment of the invention is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3<i>a</i> </figref>. This figure shows a light emitting arrangement <b>300</b> which may form part of a light emitting module, comprising a first light emitting element <b>301</b> in the form of a first LED chip, and a second light emitting element <b>302</b> in the form of a second LED chip, arranged on a support <b>303</b>. In this embodiment, both the first LED chip <b>301</b> and the second LED chip <b>302</b> are so-called phosphor-converted LED chips. The first LED chip <b>301</b> is provided with a first wavelength converting material <b>304</b>, and the second LED chip <b>302</b> is provided with a second wavelength converting material <b>305</b>. The first and second wavelength converting materials <b>304</b>, <b>305</b> may be of the same material or different materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0111">Typically, the first LED chip <b>301</b> is adapted to emit light in the wavelength range from 440 to 460 nm. The first wavelength converting material <b>304</b> converts part of this light into light of longer wavelengths, so that the total emission from the phosphor-converted first light emitting element <b>301</b> including the wavelength converting material <b>304</b> is perceived as white. Furthermore, the second LED chip <b>302</b> typically emits light in the wavelength range from 400 to 440 nm and the wavelength converting material <b>305</b> receives and converts part of this light into light of longer wavelengths, so that also the total emission from the light emitting element <b>302</b> including the wavelength converting material <b>305</b> is perceived as white. However, a sufficient amount of the light emitted by the second LED chip <b>302</b> is not absorbed and converted by the wavelength converting material <b>305</b>, thus providing an emission peak in the wavelength range from 400 to 440 nm to the total output spectrum of the light emitting arrangement <b>300</b>.</div>

The wavelength converting material(s) may be homogeneously distributed throughout the layer <b>305</b>. The layer <b>306</b> may be produced by providing the wavelength converting material(s) in fluid form, e.g. dispersed in a carrier liquid, and dispensing the fluid to cover the light emitting elements <b>301</b>, <b>302</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0130">A method for generating light with a white light spectrum having a desired white rendition relating to an improved white appearance of a white object illuminated by a light emitting module, may comprise the steps of arranging, in said light emitting module, at least one primary light emitting diode element to emit white light; arranging, in said light emitting module, at least one secondary light emitting diode element to emit short wavelength blue light. The method generates light with a white light spectrum having a desired white rendition relating to an improved white appearance of a white object illuminated by a light emitting module. The method comprises a step where at least one primary light emitting diode element is arranged in the light emitting module. In a subsequent step at least one secondary light emitting diode element is arranged in the light emitting module.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0131">A light emitting module according to embodiments of the invention may advantageously be used for illuminating objects and articles comprising a fluorescent whitening agent (FWA).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0132">The name “fluorescent whitening agents” generally denotes chemical substances that upon excitation by UV light produce blue fluorescence usually with a peak at 445 nm. Fluorescent whitening agents are added to many products, for example paper, fabrics and plastics, in order to improve the white appearance. However, the present inventors have found that fluorescent whitening agents are also susceptible of excitation by short wavelength blue light, which leads to emission of regular blue light, thus contributing to improving the white impression of the illuminated material. In particular, light having a wavelength of 440 nm or lower, especially 420 nm or lower, can excite fluorescent whitening agents. In embodiments of the invention, a second light emitting diode having an emission peak wavelength in the range of from 400 to 440 nm may produce a sufficient intensity of light of ≤420 nm to effectively excite a fluorescent whitening agent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0133">A desirable “crisp white” effect may be represented by the difference (v′ shift, Δv′ as seen in the 1976 CIE diagram) in color point of the light emitted/reflected by an object containing FWA compared to the light emitted by the light source used for illuminating said object. When the color point of the emitted/reflected light (P2) is shifted further below the black body line compared to the color point of the light (P1) emitted by the light source, this may provide a crisp white effect (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). This phenomenon is explained in more detail with reference to Example 2 below. In order to provide a desired improvement in white rendition and a “crisp white” effect, a Δv′ of at least −0.002 (−Δv′≥0.002) may be sufficient, in particular where the color point of the light source is already below the BBL. However, depending on the color point of the light source, a larger v′ shift, e.g. a Δv′ of at least −0.005, may be desirable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0134">The inventors have found that the “crisp white” effect (e.g., a Δv′ of −0.005) obtained when illuminating an object containing a fluorescent whitening agent, using a light emitting module according to embodiments of the invention, is dependent on the intensity ratio of the “deep” blue light (e.g. 380-430 nm) to the total spectrum emitted by the module.</div>

In particular, it was found that at deep blue peak wavelengths in the lower part of the deep blue wavelength range (e.g., 405 nm), the intensity required for achieving a “crisp white” effect (a certain v′ shift) was lower than for deep blue emission peak wavelengths in the upper part of the deep blue wavelength range (e.g. 420 nm).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0146">In the same way, a 445 nm blue emitting LED was used in combination with different selected yellow/green/red phosphors.
