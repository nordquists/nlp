<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a U.S. national stage application of International Patent Application No. PCT/JP2016/001907 filed on Apr. 5, 2016 and is based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2015-110269 filed on May 29, 2015, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a semiconductor device having a deep layer and a guard ring layer and a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device, and more particularly, to a silicon carbide (hereinafter, abbreviated to SiC) semiconductor device.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Attention has been paid to SiC as a material of a power device capable of obtaining high breakdown field strength. However, in a SiC trench gate MOSFET, breakdown field strength of SiC is so high that an electric field applied to a gate insulating film at a bottom of the trench is too high to realize a required life. Accordingly, an electric field at the bottom of the trench needs to be relaxed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">A structure having a p-type deep layer deeper than the bottom of the trench is proposed as a structure capable of relaxing an electric field at the bottom of the trench as above. By adopting such a structure, field concentration at the bottom of the trench can be relaxed by restricting an electric field from entering the bottom of the trench when the MOSFET is OFF. Consequently, breaking of the gate insulating film can be prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">However, an impurity hardly diffuses in SiC and it is difficult to provide a p-type deep layer over 1 μm deep by ion implantation and thermal diffusion of an impurity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Non Patent Literature 1 discloses a method of providing a p-type deep layer of a great depth developed as an embedded epitaxial technique, by which a p-type layer is epitaxially grown to fill a trench. When the embedded epitaxial technique as above is used, a p-type deep layer over, for example, 1 μm deep can be formed by using neither ion implantation nor thermal diffusion of an impurity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In a SiC semiconductor device, a p-type deep layer is provided in a cell region, and a p-type guard ring layer is provided in an outer peripheral region in which an outer peripheral breakdown voltage structure is formed to enclose an outer periphery of the cell region. Both of the p-type deep layer and the p-type guard ring layer can be provided by the embedded epitaxial technique.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">However, a shape abnormality and surface irregularities are conformed with a p-type deep layer of a great depth and a p-type guard ring layer provided by the embedded epitaxial technique. For example, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, a region where the layers are embedded expands due to a difference in width among trenches J<b>1</b>, or as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, a shape abnormality and surface irregularities occur at an intersection of two linear trenches J<b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">When a trench gate formation process is performed later in presence of such irregularities, a desired gate shape cannot be obtained. Accordingly, leakage through the gate insulating film may occur and a required life cannot be realized due to a failure in sufficiently relaxing an electric field at the bottom of the trench. Because the p-type deep layer and the p-type guard ring layer are designed individually, a shape abnormality and irregularities on the surface readily occur particularly when the both layers are provided at a time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Meanwhile, the surface may be planarized by grinding or polishing to remove surface irregularities. However, SiC is too hard to be processed with good control performance. It thus becomes necessary to planarize a surface of a p-type deep layer by improving patterns of trenches in which embedded epitaxy takes place.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">The above has described a case where SiC is used as a semiconductor material. However, similar problems arise even when a p-type deep layer is provided by the embedded epitaxial technique using a semiconductor material other than SiC, for example, Si (silicon) or GaN (silicon nitride).</div>
<heading id="h-0004">NON PATENT LITERATURE</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">Non Patent Literature 1: Materials Science Forum Vols. 600-603 (2009) pp 171-174, Growth Mechanism and 2D Aluminum Dopant Distribution of Embedded Trench 4H—SiC Region, N. Sugiyama et. al.</div>
<heading id="h-0005">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">It is an object of the present disclosure to provide a semiconductor device capable of planarizing surfaces of a deep layer and a guard ring layer and reducing leakage through a gate insulating film, and a method for manufacturing such a semiconductor device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">According to a first aspect of the present disclosure, a semiconductor device includes: a substrate with a first conductive type or a second conductive type having a cell region and an outer peripheral region; and a drift layer with the first conductive type arranged on the substrate and having an impurity concentration lower than the substrate. The cell region has a semiconductor element. The semiconductor element includes a base region with the second condition type arranged on the drift layer, a source region with the first conductive type arranged on the base region and having an impurity concentration higher than the drift layer, a trench gate structure having a gate trench arranged from a surface of the source region to be deeper than the base region, a gate insulating film arranged on an inner wall of the gate trench, and a gate electrode arranged on the gate insulating film, a deep layer having a first layer embedded in each of a plurality of deep trenches that are arranged from a surface of the drift layer to be deeper than the gate trench and have a line shape, a source electrode electrically connected to the source region and the base region, and a drain electrode arranged on a back side of the substrate. The semiconductor element provides a channel region in a surface portion of the base region located on a side of the gate trench by controlling a voltage applied to the gate electrode, and flows a current between the source electrode and the drain electrode via the source region and the drift layer. The outer peripheral region surrounding an outer periphery of the cell region has a recess portion in which the source region and the base region are removed and the drift layer are exposed, and a guard ring layer. The guard ring layer includes a plurality of guard ring trenches having a line frame shape, surrounding the cell region and arranged on a surface of the drift layer exposed in the recess portion, and a first guard ring with the second conductive type disposed in the guard ring trenches and having an impurity concentration equal to the first layer. Each of the linear deep trenches has a width equal to a width of each of the linear guard ring trenches.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">In the manner as above, the deep trenches and the guard ring trenches in which to provide the deep layer and the guard ring layer, respectively, are formed in a same width. Hence, a shape abnormality and irregularities on a surface of the layer of the second conduction type occurring when embedded into the respective trenches by embedded epitaxy can be restricted. Because the surface of the layer of the second conduction type can be of a planar shape without irregularities, processing is applied to the planar surface in subsequent processes. Hence, a desired gate shape can be obtained when various processes to form the trench gate structure are performed. Consequently, leakage through the gate insulating film can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">According to a second aspect of the present disclosure, a method for manufacturing the semiconductor device according to the first aspect includes: forming the drift layer on a main surface of the substrate; arranging a mask on the drift layer having an opening for a deep-trench-to-be-formed region and a guard-ring-trench-to-be-formed region, and forming the deep trenches and the guard ring trenches at a same time by etching the drift layer using the mask; epitaxially growing an impurity layer with the second conductive type on the drift layer to fill the deep trenches and the guard ring trenches; and forming the first layer in each of the deep trenches and the first guard ring in each of the guard ring trenches by removing the impurity layer with the second conductive type formed on the drift layer and planarizing a surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">According to the method for manufacturing the semiconductor device configured as above, a shape abnormality and irregularities on the surface of the layer of the second conduction type occurring when embedded into the respective trenches by embedded epitaxy can be restricted. Because the surface of the layer of the second conduction type can be of a planar shape without irregularities, processing is applied to the planar surface in subsequent processes. Hence, a desired gate shape can be obtained when various processes to form the trench gate structure are performed. Consequently, leakage through the gate insulating film can be reduced.</div>

<heading id="h-0007">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present disclosure will be described according to the drawings while labeling same or equivalent portions in respective embodiments below with same reference numerals.</div>
<heading id="h-0008">First Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">A first embodiment of the present disclosure will be described. The following will describe a SiC semiconductor device provided with an inverting MOSFET as a trench gate MOSFET by way of example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">The SiC semiconductor device shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> has a cell region in which a trench gate MOSFET is provided as a semiconductor element, and an outer peripheral region (termination structure region) in which an outer peripheral breakdown voltage structure enclosing the cell region is provided. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is not a cross section but hatched in part for ease of view.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">As is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the SiC semiconductor device is formed by using an n<sup>+</sup>-type substrate <b>1</b> made of SiC. An n-type drift layer <b>2</b>, a p-type base region <b>3</b>, and an n<sup>+</sup>-type source region <b>4</b> all made of SiC are epitaxially grown in sequence on a main surface of the n<sup>+</sup>-type substrate <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">The n<sup>+</sup>-type substrate <b>1</b> has an n-type impurity concentration of, for example, 6.0×10<sup>18 </sup>ions/cm<sup>3 </sup>and a thickness of about 300 μm. In the n-type drift layer <b>2</b>, an n-type impurity concentration is changed between a lower layer portion <b>2</b> <i>a </i>and an upper layer portion <b>2</b> <i>b</i>. The lower layer portion <b>2</b> <i>a </i>has an impurity concentration of, for example, 1.0×10<sup>16 </sup>ions/cm<sup>3 </sup>and a thickness of 9 μm. The upper layer portion <b>2</b> <i>b </i>is more heavily doped than the lower layer portion to function as a dispersion layer which disperses a current in a wide range, and has an impurity concentration of, for example, 2.0 to 3.0×10<sup>16 </sup>ions/cm<sup>3 </sup>and a thickness of 1.9 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">The p-type base region <b>3</b> forms a channel epitaxial layer in which a channel region is induced, and has a p-type impurity concentration of, for example, 2.0×10<sup>17 </sup>ions/cm<sup>3 </sup>and a thickness of about 0.5 μm. The n<sup>+</sup>-type source region <b>4</b> is more heavily doped than the n-type drift layer <b>2</b>, and has an n-type impurity concentration in a top-layer portion of, for example, 8.0×10<sup>18 </sup>ions/cm<sup>3 </sup>and a thickness of about 0.4 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">In the cell region, the p-type base region <b>3</b> and the n<sup>+</sup>-type source region <b>4</b> are left on a surface side of a semiconductor substrate. In the outer peripheral region, a recess portion <b>20</b> is provided to reach the n-type drift layer <b>2</b> by penetrating through the n<sup>+</sup>-type source region <b>4</b> and the p-type base region <b>3</b> and therefore a mesa structure is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">In the cell region, a p-type deep layer <b>5</b> extending from a bottom surface of the p-type base region <b>3</b> is provided to reach the lower layer portion <b>2</b> <i>a </i>of the n-type drift layer <b>2</b> by penetrating through the upper layer portion <b>2</b> <i>b</i>. The p-type deep layer <b>5</b> is more heavily doped with a p-type impurity than the p-type base region <b>3</b>. More specifically, the p-type deep layer <b>5</b> has an upper deep layer (first layer) <b>5</b> <i>a </i>embedded in a linear trench (deep trench) <b>5</b> <i>c </i>provided to the n-type drift layer <b>2</b>, and a lower deep layer (second layer) <b>5</b> <i>b </i>provided by implanting ions of a p-type impurity into a bottom surface of the trench <b>5</b> <i>c</i>. An extending direction of the p-type deep layer <b>5</b> may be determined arbitrarily. However, by extending the p-type deep layer <b>5</b> in a &lt;11-20&gt; direction and setting both two opposing wall surfaces forming long sides of the trench <b>5</b> <i>c </i>in a same (1-100) plane, layers grow equally on both the two wall surfaces by embedded epitaxy. Hence, not only can a homogenous film quality be obtained, but also a poor embedding restricting effect can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">As is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, multiple p-type deep layers <b>5</b> are disposed in stripes at regular intervals. The upper deep layer <b>5</b> <i>a </i>of each p-type deep layer <b>5</b> has a constant width W<b>1</b>. As is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a top surface shape of the p-type deep layer <b>5</b> is rounded at both ends in a longitudinal direction of the deep layer <b>5</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">The upper deep layer <b>5</b> <i>a </i>has a p-type impurity concentration of, for example, 6.0×10<sup>17 </sup>ions/cm<sup>3</sup>, a width of 0.7 μm, and a thickness (width) of about 1.6 μm. The lower deep layer <b>5</b> <i>b </i>is more lightly doped with a p-type impurity than the upper deep layer <b>5</b> <i>a</i>, and has a p-type impurity concentration of, for example, 1.0 to 3.0×10<sup>17 </sup>ions/cm<sup>3 </sup>and a thickness (depth) of about 0.9 μm. The lower deep p layer <b>5</b> <i>b </i>having a lower impurity concentration than the upper deep p layer is capable of relaxing field concentration at corners of the deep p layer <b>5</b> and therefore has a higher breakdown voltage. As is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the p-type deep layer <b>5</b> including the upper deep layer <b>5</b> <i>a </i>and the lower deep layer <b>5</b> <i>b </i>is provided across the cell region from one end to the other. The p-type deep layer <b>5</b> extends in the longitudinal direction which is a same direction as a trench gate structure described below, and extends beyond both ends of the trench gate structure to an outside of the cell region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the lower deep layer <b>5</b> <i>b </i>is shown slightly wider than the upper deep layer <b>5</b> <i>a</i>, because the p-type impurity slightly spreads due to ion implantation and thermal diffusion. However, such spreading is small in comparison with spreading in Si or the like and widths of the lower deep layer <b>5</b> <i>b </i>and the upper deep layer <b>5</b> <i>a </i>have little difference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">A gate trench <b>6</b> having, for example, a width of 0.8 μm and a depth of 1.0 μm is provided to reach the n-type drift layer <b>2</b> by penetrating through the p-type base region <b>3</b> and the n<sup>+</sup>-type source region <b>4</b>. The p-type base region <b>3</b> and the n<sup>+</sup>-type source region <b>4</b> are disposed to be in contact with a side surface of the gate trench <b>6</b>. The gate trench <b>6</b> is formed in a linear shape having a width direction, a longitudinal direction, and a depth direction which coincide, respectively, with a right-left direction of a sheet surface of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a direction perpendicular to the sheet surface, and a top-bottom direction of the sheet surface. As is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, multiple gate trenches <b>6</b> are arranged in stripes aligned parallel to one another at regular intervals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">One trench <b>7</b> extending in a same direction as the gate trench <b>6</b> is provided between every two adjacent gate trenches <b>6</b> and on either side having all the gate trenches <b>6</b> in between, that is, at a position corresponding to where each p-type deep layer <b>5</b> is provided in the cell region. Multiple trenches <b>7</b> disposed among and on both sides of the gate trenches <b>6</b> are arranged in stripes. The trench <b>7</b> is provided to reach the p-type base region <b>3</b> by penetrating through the n<sup>+</sup>-type source region <b>4</b>. A p<sup>+</sup>-type contact region <b>3</b> <i>a </i>is provided at a bottom of the trench <b>7</b> by implanting a p-type impurity into the p-type base region <b>3</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">An inner wall surface of the gate trench <b>6</b> is covered with a gate insulating film <b>8</b>. The gate insulating film <b>8</b> is formed of a thermally oxidized film formed by, for example, thermally oxidizing the inner wall surface of the gate trench <b>6</b>. A thickness of the gate insulating film <b>8</b> is, for example, about 75 nm on both a side surface side and a bottom side of the gate trench <b>6</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the gate insulating film <b>8</b> has angular corners at the bottom of the gate trench <b>6</b> and at both ends in the longitudinal direction. However, the corners can be round by applying a rounding treatment to the gate trench <b>6</b> in advance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">A gate electrode <b>9</b> is provided to fill the gate trench <b>6</b> on a surface of the gate insulating film <b>8</b>. The gate electrode <b>9</b> is made of, for example, Poly-Si doped with an impurity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">A source electrode <b>11</b> and a gate wiring (not shown) are provided to surfaces of the n<sup>+</sup>-type source region <b>4</b> and the p<sup>+</sup>-contact region <b>3</b> <i>a </i>and a surface of the gate electrode <b>9</b> via an interlayer insulating film <b>10</b>. The source electrode <b>11</b> and the gate wiring are made of more than one type of metal (for example, Ni and Al), and at least a portion coming into contact with n-type SiC (to be more specific, the n<sup>+</sup>-type source region <b>4</b>) is made of metal capable of making ohmic contact with n-type SiC, and at least a portion coming into contact with p-type SiC (to be more specific, the p<sup>+</sup>-type contact region <b>3</b> <i>a</i>) is made of metal capable of making ohmic contact with p-type SiC. The source electrode <b>11</b> and the gate wiring are provided on the interlayer insulating film <b>10</b> and are therefore electrically isolated. Through a contact hole provided to the interlayer insulating film <b>10</b>, the source electrode <b>11</b> is brought into electrical contact with the p-type base region <b>3</b> via the n<sup>+</sup>-type source region <b>4</b> and the p<sup>+</sup>-type contact region <b>3</b> <i>a</i>, while the gate wiring is brought into electrical contact with the gate electrode <b>9</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">A drain electrode <b>12</b> is provided to a back surface side of the n<sup>+</sup>-type substrate <b>1</b> and electrically connected to the n<sup>+</sup>-type substrate <b>1</b>. A passivation film <b>13</b> is provided to a substrate front surface side. The source electrode <b>11</b> and the gate wiring are exposed in part from an opening provided to the passivation film <b>13</b>. The exposed portion is used as a pad to establish external electrical connection. Owing to the structure as above, an n-channel, inverting, trench gate MOSFET is formed. The cell region is formed by disposing such MOSFETs in multiple cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">Meanwhile, as has been described, the outer peripheral region has a mesa structure by providing the recess portion <b>20</b> to reach the n-type drift layer <b>2</b> by penetrating through the n<sup>+</sup>-type source region <b>4</b> and the p-type base region <b>3</b>. Hence, the p-type base region <b>3</b> is removed and the n-type drift layer <b>2</b> is exposed at a location remote from the cell region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">Multiple (four in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) p-type guard ring layers <b>21</b> are provided to the top-layer portion of the n-type drift layer <b>2</b> located below the recess portion <b>20</b> and nested while enclosing the cell region. The p-type guard ring layer <b>21</b> includes an upper guard ring <b>21</b> <i>a </i>embedded in a trench (guard ring trench) <b>21</b> <i>c</i>, and a lower guard ring <b>21</b> <i>b </i>provided at a bottom of the upper guard ring <b>21</b> <i>a</i>. Respective parts forming the p-type guard ring layer <b>21</b> are formed in a same manner as the p-type deep layer <b>5</b> described above except for one point. That is, in contrast to the trench <b>5</b> <i>c </i>formed in a linear shape, a top surface of the trench <b>21</b> <i>c </i>is of a linear frame shape enclosing the cell region. In other words, the upper guard ring <b>21</b> <i>a </i>is same as the upper deep layer <b>5</b> <i>a </i>in width and thickness (depth) and the lower guard ring <b>21</b> <i>b </i>is same as the lower deep layer <b>5</b> <i>b </i>in width and thickness (depth). Intervals among the p-type guard ring layers <b>21</b> may be equal. However, intervals among the p-type guard ring layers <b>21</b> are made narrower on the cell region side and wider on the outer peripheral side for an equipotential line to head toward the outer periphery by relaxing field concentration more on an inner peripheral side, that is, on the cell region side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">A p<sup>+</sup>-type coupling layer <b>30</b> having an impurity concentration of, for example, 1.0×10<sup>18 </sup>ions/cm<sup>3 </sup>and a thickness (depth) of about 0.9 μm is provided to the top-layer portion of the n-type drift layer <b>2</b> from the cell region at a vicinity of the outer peripheral region to the outer peripheral region. The p<sup>+</sup>-type coupling layer <b>30</b> couples the p-type deep layer <b>5</b> located in the cell region on the outer peripheral region side, to be more specific, the p-type deep layer <b>5</b> located more on the outer peripheral region side than all the gate trenches <b>6</b>, to one p-type guard ring layer <b>21</b> located nearest to the cell region side. Accordingly, a boundary position of the recess portion <b>20</b> (a boundary position of the mesa structure) overlaps the p<sup>+</sup>-type coupling layer <b>30</b>, and a bottom surface of the recess portion <b>20</b> at the boundary position is not formed of a surface of the n-type drift layer <b>2</b> but formed of the p<sup>+</sup>-type coupling layer <b>30</b> while a portion of the p-type guard ring layer <b>21</b> on the cell region side is fixed at source potential.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">Although it is not shown in the drawings, by providing an EQR structure on a more outer peripheral side than the p-type guard ring layers <b>21</b> when necessary, an outer peripheral region provided with an outer peripheral breakdown voltage structure enclosing the cell region is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">Owing to the structure as above, the SiC semiconductor device of the present embodiment is formed. The SiC semiconductor device formed as above induces a channel region in a surface portion of the p-type base region <b>3</b> located on the side surface of the gate trench <b>6</b> by controlling an applied voltage to the gate electrode <b>9</b> to switch ON the MOSFET. A current thus flows between the source electrode <b>11</b> and the drain electrode <b>12</b> via the n<sup>+</sup>-type source region <b>4</b> and the n-type drift layer <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">While the MOSFET is OFF, even when a high voltage is applied, an electric field is restricted from entering the bottom of the gate trench by the p-type deep layer <b>5</b> provided deeper than the trench gate structure. Hence, field concentration at the bottom of the gate trench is relaxed, which can in turn prevent breaking of the gate insulating film <b>8</b>. In the outer peripheral region, equipotential lines terminate while intervals are widened toward the outer periphery by the p-type guard ring layers <b>21</b>. Hence, a desired breakdown voltage can be obtained in the outer peripheral region, too. The SiC semiconductor device is thus capable of obtaining a desired breakdown voltage.</div>

<heading id="h-0009">Second Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">A second embodiment of the present disclosure will be described. The present embodiment is same as the first embodiment above except that a configuration of a p-type guard ring layer <b>21</b> is changed from the configuration of the first embodiment above, and only a difference from the first embodiment above will be described in the following.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">In the first embodiment above, intervals among the p-type guard ring layers <b>21</b> are narrower on the cell region side and wider on the outer peripheral side and intervals among the upper deep layer <b>5</b> <i>a </i>and the lower deep layers <b>5</b> <i>b </i>are set in the same manner. By contrast, a same structure is formed in the present embodiment by setting intervals among upper deep layers <b>5</b> <i>a </i>and lower deep layers <b>5</b> <i>b </i>constant and providing a p<sup>+</sup>-type impurity layer <b>21</b> <i>d </i>as a part of a p-type guard ring layer <b>21</b> as are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. That is, p<sup>+</sup>-type impurity layers <b>21</b> <i>d </i>are provided to a top-layer portion of an n-type drift layer <b>2</b> to overlap the respective upper deep layers <b>5</b> <i>a </i>and intervals among the p<sup>+</sup>-type impurity layers <b>21</b> <i>d </i>are made narrower on a cell region side and wider on an outer peripheral side. The p<sup>+</sup>-type impurity layers <b>21</b> <i>d </i>are provided by implanting ions of a p-type impurity and all are same in depth and impurity concentration. For example, the p<sup>+</sup>-type impurity layers <b>21</b> <i>d </i>and a p<sup>+</sup>-type coupling layer <b>30</b> may be provided at a same time. By providing the p<sup>+</sup>-type impurity layers <b>21</b> <i>d </i>and the p<sup>+</sup>-type coupling layer <b>30</b> at a same time, the p<sup>+</sup>-type impurity layers <b>21</b> <i>d </i>can be provided without having to add a process required only to provide the p<sup>+</sup>-type impurity layers <b>21</b> <i>d. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">In the manner as above, intervals among the p-type guard ring layers <b>21</b> can be adjusted by neither upper guard rings <b>21</b> <i>a </i>provided in trenches <b>21</b> <i>c </i>nor lower guard rings <b>21</b> <i>c </i>provided at bottoms of the trenches <b>21</b> <i>c</i>, but by the p<sup>+</sup>-type impurity layers <b>21</b> <i>d </i>which can be provided individually by ion implantation. Owing to the configuration as above, intervals among the trenches <b>21</b> <i>c </i>are made constant and equal to intervals among trenches <b>5</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">For example, in a case where intervals among the trenches <b>21</b> <i>c </i>are varied as in the first embodiment above, rough and dense trench forming areas are present between the cell region in which the trenches <b>5</b> <i>c </i>are provided and the outer peripheral region in which the trenches <b>21</b> <i>c </i>are provided. Hence, a recess may possibly occur in the p-type layer <b>41</b> when embedded. In the present embodiment, however, intervals among the trenches <b>21</b> <i>c </i>can be constant and equal to intervals among the trenches <b>5</b> <i>c</i>. Hence, generation of rough and dense trench forming areas between the cell region and the outer peripheral region can be restricted. Consequently, a recess in the p-type layer <b>41</b> occurring when embedded into the trenches <b>5</b> <i>c </i>and <b>21</b> <i>c </i>can be restricted further.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">A third embodiment of the present disclosure will be described. The present embodiment is same as the first and second embodiments above except that the p-type deep layer <b>5</b> and the p-type guard ring layer <b>21</b> of the first and second embodiments above are connected, and only a difference from the first and second embodiments above will be described in the following. The following will describe a case where a configuration of the present embodiment is applied to the layout of the first embodiment above as an example. However, an outcome is same when the configuration of the present embodiment is applied to the layout of the second embodiment above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">In the present embodiment, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a p-type deep layer <b>5</b> is connected to a p-type guard ring layer <b>21</b> at both ends in a longitudinal direction. It is, however, necessary to prevent an embedded region from spreading at connection portions of the p-type deep layer <b>5</b> and the p-type guard ring layer <b>21</b>. To satisfy such a need, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the p-type deep layer <b>5</b> is made narrower at the both ends in the longitudinal direction than on a cell region side in the present embodiment. Likewise, the p-type guard ring layer <b>21</b> is made narrower in the connection portions to the p-type deep layer <b>5</b> than in a portion other than the connection portions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">Owing to the configuration as above, an effect same as the effect of the first embodiment above can be obtained by the structure in which the p-type deep layer <b>5</b> and the p-type guard ring layer <b>21</b> are connected.</div>
<heading id="h-0011">Other Embodiments</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">(1) The embodiments above have described a case where the p-type deep layer <b>5</b> includes the upper deep layer <b>5</b> <i>a </i>and the lower deep layer <b>5</b> <i>b</i>. However, a p-type deep layer <b>5</b> may include an upper deep layer <b>5</b> <i>a </i>alone. In such a case, it is preferable to provide the p-type deep layer <b>5</b> deeper than an upper layer portion <b>2</b> <i>b </i>more heavily doped than a lower layer potion <b>2</b> <i>a </i>in restricting entrance of an electric field. Hence, a trench <b>5</b> <i>c </i>may be provided preferably to penetrate through the upper layer portion <b>2</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">(2) In the embodiments above, the p-type base region <b>3</b> and the source electrode <b>11</b> are connected by a structure in which the source electrode <b>11</b> is brought into direct contact with the p-type base region <b>5</b> by providing the trench <b>7</b>. However, the above configuration is a mere example, and a p<sup>+</sup>-type contact region <b>3</b> <i>a </i>may be provided by implanting ions of, for example, a p-type impurity, to reach a p-type base region <b>3</b> by penetrating through an n<sup>+</sup>-type source region <b>4</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">(3) In the embodiments above, the n<sup>+</sup>-type source region <b>4</b> is epitaxially grown on the p-type base region <b>3</b> in succession. However, an n<sup>+</sup>-type source region <b>4</b> may be provided by implanting ions of an n-type impurity into the p-type base region <b>3</b> at a desired location.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">(4) The first and second embodiments above have described a case where the p-type deep layer <b>5</b> is of a round shape at the both ends in the longitudinal direction. However, the tip ends may be of a pointed triangular shape or a flat surfaced square shape. In a case where the tip ends are of a triangular shape, when the p-type deep layer <b>5</b> extends in a &lt;11-20&gt; direction, a plane orientation of a wall surface forming two sides of the triangular tip at either end tends to be an equivalent (1-100) plane in a hexagonal crystal like SiC. Hence, layers grow equally on the respective equivalent planes by embedded epitaxy. Consequently, not only can a homogenous film quality be obtained, but also a poor embedding restricting effect can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">(5) The embodiments above have described an n-channel MOSFET in which a first conductive type is an n-type and a second condition type is a p-type as an example. However, the present disclosure is also applicable to a p-channel MOSFET in which conductive types of all components are reversed. The above has described a MOSFET as an example of a trench gate semiconductor element. However, the present disclosure is also applicable to a similar trench gate IGBT. In an IGBT, only a conductive type of the substrate <b>1</b> of the embodiments above is changed from the n type to the p type, and a structure and a manufacturing method are same as the structures and the manufacturing methods of the embodiments above.</div>
