<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional App. No. 62/371,971 filed Aug. 8, 2016, which is hereby incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure generally relates to semiconductor devices and, more particularly, to semiconductor diode structures and related circuits and methods.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Structures and techniques have been proposed to enhance the performance of semiconductor devices, such as by enhancing the mobility of the charge carriers. For example, U.S. Patent Application No. 2003/0057416 to Currie et al. discloses strained material layers of silicon, silicon-germanium, and relaxed silicon and also including impurity-free zones that would otherwise cause performance degradation. The resulting biaxial strain in the upper silicon layer alters the carrier mobilities enabling higher speed and/or lower power devices. Published U.S. Patent Application No. 2003/0034529 to Fitzgerald et al. discloses a CMOS inverter also based upon similar strained silicon technology.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">U.S. Pat. No. 6,472,685 B2 to Takagi discloses a semiconductor device including a silicon and carbon layer sandwiched between silicon layers so that the conduction band and valence band of the second silicon layer receive a tensile strain. Electrons having a smaller effective mass, and which have been induced by an electric field applied to the gate electrode, are confined in the second silicon layer, thus, an n-channel MOSFET is asserted to have a higher mobility.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 4,937,204 to Ishibashi et al. discloses a superlattice in which a plurality of layers, less than eight monolayers, and containing a fractional or binary or a binary compound semiconductor layer, are alternately and epitaxially grown. The direction of main current flow is perpendicular to the layers of the superlattice.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 5,357,119 to Wang et al. discloses a Si—Ge short period superlattice with higher mobility achieved by reducing alloy scattering in the superlattice. Along these lines, U.S. Pat. No. 5,683,934 to Candelaria discloses an enhanced mobility MOSFET including a channel layer comprising an alloy of silicon and a second material substitutionally present in the silicon lattice at a percentage that places the channel layer under tensile stress.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 5,216,262 to Tsu discloses a quantum well structure comprising two barrier regions and a thin epitaxially grown semiconductor layer sandwiched between the barriers. Each barrier region consists of alternate layers of SiO2/Si with a thickness generally in a range of two to six monolayers. A much thicker section of silicon is sandwiched between the barriers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">An article entitled “Phenomena in silicon nanostructure devices” also to Tsu and published online Sep. 6, 2000 by Applied Physics and Materials Science &amp; Processing, pp. 391-402 discloses a semiconductor-atomic superlattice (SAS) of silicon and oxygen. The Si/O superlattice is disclosed as useful in a silicon quantum and light-emitting devices. In particular, a green electroluminescence diode structure was constructed and tested. Current flow in the diode structure is vertical, that is, perpendicular to the layers of the SAS. The disclosed SAS may include semiconductor layers separated by adsorbed species such as oxygen atoms, and CO molecules. The silicon growth beyond the adsorbed monolayer of oxygen is described as epitaxial with a fairly low defect density. One SAS structure included a 1.1 nm thick silicon portion that is about eight atomic layers of silicon, and another structure had twice this thickness of silicon. An article to Luo et al. entitled “Chemical Design of Direct-Gap Light-Emitting Silicon” published in Physical Review Letters, Vol. 89, No. 7 (Aug. 12, 2002) further discusses the light emitting SAS structures of Tsu.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Published International Application WO 02/103,767 A1 to Wang, Tsu and Lofgren, discloses a barrier building block of thin silicon and oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous, antimony, arsenic or hydrogen to thereby reduce current flowing vertically through the lattice more than four orders of magnitude. The insulating layer/barrier layer allows for low defect epitaxial silicon to be deposited next to the insulating layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Published Great Britain Patent Application 2,347,520 to Mears et al. discloses that principles of Aperiodic Photonic Band-Gap (APBG) structures may be adapted for electronic bandgap engineering. In particular, the application discloses that material parameters, for example, the location of band minima, effective mass, etc., can be tailored to yield new aperiodic materials with desirable band-structure characteristics. Other parameters, such as electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity and dielectric permittivity or magnetic permeability are disclosed as also possible to be designed into the material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">Furthermore, U.S. Pat. No. 6,376,337 to Wang et al. discloses a method for producing an insulating or barrier layer for semiconductor devices which includes depositing a layer of silicon and at least one additional element on the silicon substrate whereby the deposited layer is substantially free of defects such that epitaxial silicon substantially free of defects can be deposited on the deposited layer. Alternatively, a monolayer of one or more elements, preferably comprising oxygen, is absorbed on a silicon substrate. A plurality of insulating layers sandwiched between epitaxial silicon forms a barrier composite.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">Despite the existence of such approaches, further enhancements may be desirable for using advanced semiconductor materials and processing techniques to achieve improved performance in semiconductor devices.</div>

In other words, to characterize semiconductor material structures, the conductivity effective mass for electrons/holes as described above and calculated in the direction of intended carrier transport is used to distinguish improved materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">Applicant has identified improved materials or structures for use in semiconductor devices. More specifically, Applicant has identified materials or structures having energy band structures for which the appropriate conductivity effective masses for electrons and/or holes are substantially less than the corresponding values for silicon. In addition to the enhanced mobility characteristics of these structures, they may also be formed or used in such a manner that they provide piezoelectric, pyroelectric, and/or ferroelectric properties that are advantageous for use in a variety of different types of devices, as will be discussed further below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the materials or structures are in the form of a superlattice <b>25</b> whose structure is controlled at the atomic or molecular level and may be formed using known techniques of atomic or molecular layer deposition. The superlattice <b>25</b> includes a plurality of layer groups <b>45</b> <i>a</i>-<b>45</b> <i>n </i>arranged in stacked relation, as perhaps best understood with specific reference to the schematic cross-sectional view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">Each group of layers <b>45</b> <i>a</i>-<b>45</b> <i>n </i>of the superlattice <b>25</b> illustratively includes a plurality of stacked base semiconductor monolayers <b>46</b> defining a respective base semiconductor portion <b>46</b> <i>a</i>-<b>46</b> <i>n </i>and an energy band-modifying layer <b>50</b> thereon. The energy band-modifying layers <b>50</b> are indicated by stippling in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> for clarity of illustration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">The energy band-modifying layer <b>50</b> illustratively includes one non-semiconductor monolayer constrained within a crystal lattice of adjacent base semiconductor portions. By “constrained within a crystal lattice of adjacent base semiconductor portions” it is meant that at least some semiconductor atoms from opposing base semiconductor portions <b>46</b> <i>a</i>-<b>46</b> <i>n </i>are chemically bound together through the non-semiconductor monolayer <b>50</b> therebetween, as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Generally speaking, this configuration is made possible by controlling the amount of non-semiconductor material that is deposited on semiconductor portions <b>46</b> <i>a</i>-<b>46</b> <i>n </i>through atomic layer deposition techniques so that not all (i.e., less than full or 100% coverage) of the available semiconductor bonding sites are populated with bonds to non-semiconductor atoms, as will be discussed further below. Thus, as further monolayers <b>46</b> of semiconductor material are deposited on or over a non-semiconductor monolayer <b>50</b>, the newly deposited semiconductor atoms will populate the remaining vacant bonding sites of the semiconductor atoms below the non-semiconductor monolayer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">In other embodiments, more than one such non-semiconductor monolayer may be possible. It should be noted that reference herein to a non-semiconductor or semiconductor monolayer means that the material used for the monolayer would be a non-semiconductor or semiconductor if formed in bulk. That is, a single monolayer of a material, such as silicon, may not necessarily exhibit the same properties that it would if formed in bulk or in a relatively thick layer, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">Applicant theorizes without wishing to be bound thereto that energy band-modifying layers <b>50</b> and adjacent base semiconductor portions <b>46</b> <i>a</i>-<b>46</b> <i>n </i>cause the superlattice <b>25</b> to have a lower appropriate conductivity effective mass for the charge carriers in the parallel layer direction than would otherwise be present. Considered another way, this parallel direction is orthogonal to the stacking direction. The band modifying layers <b>50</b> may also cause the superlattice <b>25</b> to have a common energy band structure, while also advantageously functioning as an insulator between layers or regions vertically above and below the superlattice.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">Moreover, this superlattice structure may also advantageously act as a barrier to dopant and/or material diffusion between layers vertically above and below the superlattice <b>25</b>. These properties may thus advantageously allow the superlattice <b>25</b> to provide an interface for high-K dielectrics which not only reduces diffusion of the high-K material into the channel region, but which may also advantageously reduce unwanted scattering effects and improve device mobility, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">It is also theorized that semiconductor devices including the superlattice <b>25</b> may enjoy a higher charge carrier mobility based upon the lower conductivity effective mass than would otherwise be present. In some embodiments, and as a result of the band engineering achieved by the present invention, the superlattice <b>25</b> may further have a substantially direct energy bandgap that may be particularly advantageous for opto-electronic devices, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">The superlattice <b>25</b> also illustratively includes a cap layer <b>52</b> on an upper layer group <b>45</b> <i>n</i>. The cap layer <b>52</b> may comprise a plurality of base semiconductor monolayers <b>46</b>. The cap layer <b>52</b> may have between 2 to 100 monolayers of the base semiconductor, and, more preferably between 10 to 50 monolayers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">Each base semiconductor portion <b>46</b> <i>a</i>-<b>46</b> <i>n </i>may comprise a base semiconductor selected from the group consisting of Group IV semiconductors, Group III-V semiconductors, and Group II-VI semiconductors. Of course, the term Group IV semiconductors also includes Group IV-IV semiconductors, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. More particularly, the base semiconductor may comprise at least one of silicon and germanium, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">Each energy band-modifying layer <b>50</b> may comprise a non-semiconductor selected from the group consisting of oxygen, nitrogen, fluorine, carbon and carbon-oxygen, for example. The non-semiconductor is also desirably thermally stable through deposition of a next layer to thereby facilitate manufacturing. In other embodiments, the non-semiconductor may be another inorganic or organic element or compound that is compatible with the given semiconductor processing as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. More particularly, the base semiconductor may comprise at least one of silicon and germanium, for example</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">It should be noted that the term monolayer is meant to include a single atomic layer and also a single molecular layer. It is also noted that the energy band-modifying layer <b>50</b> provided by a single monolayer is also meant to include a monolayer wherein not all of the possible sites are occupied (i.e., there is less than full or 100% coverage). For example, with particular reference to the atomic diagram of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a 4/1 repeating structure is illustrated for silicon as the base semiconductor material, and oxygen as the energy band-modifying material. Only half of the possible sites for oxygen are occupied in the illustrated example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">In other embodiments and/or with different materials this one-half occupation would not necessarily be the case as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. Indeed it can be seen even in this schematic diagram, that individual atoms of oxygen in a given monolayer are not precisely aligned along a flat plane as will also be appreciated by those of skill in the art of atomic deposition. By way of example, a preferred occupation range is from about one-eighth to one-half of the possible oxygen sites being full, although other numbers may be used in certain embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">Silicon and oxygen are currently widely used in conventional semiconductor processing, and, hence, manufacturers will be readily able to use these materials as described herein. Atomic or monolayer deposition is also now widely used. Accordingly, semiconductor devices incorporating the superlattice <b>25</b> in accordance with the invention may be readily adopted and implemented, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">It is theorized without Applicant wishing to be bound thereto that for a superlattice, such as the Si/O superlattice, for example, that the number of silicon monolayers should desirably be seven or less so that the energy band of the superlattice is common or relatively uniform throughout to achieve the desired advantages. The 4/1 repeating structure shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, for Si/O has been modeled to indicate an enhanced mobility for electrons and holes in the X direction. For example, the calculated conductivity effective mass for electrons (isotropic for bulk silicon) is 0.26 and for the 4/1 SiO superlattice in the X direction it is 0.12 resulting in a ratio of 0.46. Similarly, the calculation for holes yields values of 0.36 for bulk silicon and 0.16 for the 4/1 Si/O superlattice resulting in a ratio of 0.44.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">While such a directionally preferential feature may be desired in certain semiconductor devices, other devices may benefit from a more uniform increase in mobility in any direction parallel to the groups of layers. It may also be beneficial to have an increased mobility for both electrons and holes, or just one of these types of charge carriers as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">The lower conductivity effective mass for the 4/1 Si/O embodiment of the superlattice <b>25</b> may be less than two-thirds the conductivity effective mass than would otherwise occur, and this applies for both electrons and holes. Of course, the superlattice <b>25</b> may further comprise at least one type of conductivity dopant therein, as will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">Indeed, referring now additionally to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, another embodiment of a superlattice <b>25</b>′ in accordance with the invention having different properties is now described. In this embodiment, a repeating pattern of 3/1/5/1 is illustrated. More particularly, the lowest base semiconductor portion <b>46</b> <i>a</i>′ has three monolayers, and the second lowest base semiconductor portion <b>46</b> <i>b</i>′ has five monolayers. This pattern repeats throughout the superlattice <b>25</b>′. The energy band-modifying layers <b>50</b>′ may each include a single monolayer. For such a superlattice <b>25</b>′ including Si/O, the enhancement of charge carrier mobility is independent of orientation in the plane of the layers. Those other elements of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> not specifically mentioned are similar to those discussed above with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and need no further discussion herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">In some device embodiments, all of the base semiconductor portions of a superlattice may be a same number of monolayers thick. In other embodiments, at least some of the base semiconductor portions may be a different number of monolayers thick. In still other embodiments, all of the base semiconductor portions may be a different number of monolayers thick.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4C</figref>, band structures calculated using Density Functional Theory (DFT) are presented. It is well known in the art that DFT underestimates the absolute value of the bandgap. Hence all bands above the gap may be shifted by an appropriate “scissors correction.” However the shape of the band is known to be much more reliable. The vertical energy axes should be interpreted in this light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> shows the calculated band structure from the gamma point (G) for both bulk silicon (represented by continuous lines) and for the 4/1 Si/O superlattice <b>25</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (represented by dotted lines). The directions refer to the unit cell of the 4/1 Si/O structure and not to the conventional unit cell of Si, although the (001) direction in the figure does correspond to the (001) direction of the conventional unit cell of Si, and, hence, shows the expected location of the Si conduction band minimum. The (100) and (010) directions in the figure correspond to the (110) and (−110) directions of the conventional Si unit cell. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the bands of Si on the figure are folded to represent them on the appropriate reciprocal lattice directions for the 4/1 Si/O structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">It can be seen that the conduction band minimum for the 4/1 Si/O structure is located at the gamma point in contrast to bulk silicon (Si), whereas the valence band minimum occurs at the edge of the Brillouin zone in the (001) direction which we refer to as the Z point. One may also note the greater curvature of the conduction band minimum for the 4/1 Si/O structure compared to the curvature of the conduction band minimum for Si owing to the band splitting due to the perturbation introduced by the additional oxygen layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> shows the calculated band structure from the Z point for both bulk silicon (continuous lines) and for the 4/1 Si/O superlattice <b>25</b> (dotted lines). This figure illustrates the enhanced curvature of the valence band in the (100) direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> shows the calculated band structure from both the gamma and Z point for both bulk silicon (continuous lines) and for the 5/1/3/1 Si/O structure of the superlattice <b>25</b>′ of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (dotted lines). Due to the symmetry of the 5/1/3/1 Si/O structure, the calculated band structures in the (100) and (010) directions are equivalent. Thus the conductivity effective mass and mobility are expected to be isotropic in the plane parallel to the layers, i.e. perpendicular to the (001) stacking direction. Note that in the 5/1/3/1 Si/O example the conduction band minimum and the valence band maximum are both at or close to the Z point.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">Although increased curvature is an indication of reduced effective mass, the appropriate comparison and discrimination may be made via the conductivity reciprocal effective mass tensor calculation. This leads Applicant to further theorize that the 5/1/3/1 superlattice <b>25</b>′ should be substantially direct bandgap. As will be understood by those skilled in the art, the appropriate matrix element for optical transition is another indicator of the distinction between direct and indirect bandgap behavior.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">Turning to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-6B</figref>, tunneling diode structures and associated devices including the above-described superlattice technology (also referred to as “MST” herein) are now described. By way of background, resonant tunneling diodes operate in a similar fashion to p-n junction diodes, in that the diode will conduct an “on” current with forward bias. Yet, in p-n junction diodes the bias current monotonically increases the forward current, whereas a resonant tunneling diode (RTD) exhibits negative differential resistance (NDR), in which the current level drops with increased bias. NDR characteristics increase operation points on load lines, and it is thus attractive for various circuit applications.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">Generally speaking, most RTD devices utilize III-V materials, which makes integration into Si-based CMOS platforms very difficult. Moreover, a high doping level is typically desired at the contact regions for ohmic contacts. For example, doping levels may be at least 10×<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, and levels of greater than 1×10<sup>20</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>may be desired for lower contact resistance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">On the other hand, RTDs also typically use a relatively low doping level in the three regions immediately adjacent to and between the double barriers to prevent impurity scattering. The requisite doping level is generally determined based upon the electron mean free path vs. the dimensions of the double barrier and tunneling layer thicknesses. Typically, the doping level may be set at approximately 1×10<sup>16</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">N-type and P-type MST double barrier (DB) RTD structures <b>110</b>, <b>110</b> and their associated band diagrams <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A, 6B and 5B, 6B</figref>, respectively. The N-type DBRTD structure <b>100</b> illustratively includes a stack of layers including (starting from the bottom) a bottom n+ Si contact layer <b>102</b>, a first superlattice barrier layer <b>103</b> (such as the superlattice layers <b>25</b>, <b>25</b>′ described above—labeled MST in the drawings), an undoped (intrinsic) Si layer <b>104</b>, a second superlattice barrier layer <b>105</b>, and an upper n+ Si contact layer <b>106</b>. Similarly, the P-type DBRTD <b>110</b> illustratively includes a stack of layers including (starting from the bottom) a bottom p+Si contact layer <b>112</b>, a first superlattice barrier layer <b>113</b>, an undoped (intrinsic) Si layer <b>114</b>, a second superlattice barrier layer <b>115</b>, and an upper p+ Si contact layer <b>116</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">The superlattice barrier layers <b>103</b>, <b>105</b> and <b>113</b>, <b>115</b> advantageously allow for the formation of potential barriers in the Si conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) while maintaining Si epitaxy when forming the upper contact layers <b>106</b>, <b>116</b>. That is, the above-described superlattice structure advantageously allows semiconductor (e.g., silicon) bonds to propagate through the intervening oxygen atoms so that the epitaxy is not disrupted, allowing single crystalline semiconductor contact layers to be formed on top of the second superlattice barrier layers <b>105</b>, <b>115</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">The barrier height may advantageously be tuned for the given RTD application using the different structures and fabrication techniques described above. Simulations of a 4/1 repeating structure with a <b>15</b>A spacing between non-semiconductor (e.g., oxygen) monolayers projects approximately 0.6 eV for both the CB and VB. Furthermore, the potential barrier strength resulting from the MST barrier layers may be tuned based upon the oxygen concentration per monolayer, spacing between oxygen monolayers, and the number of oxygen monolayers used, for example, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">However, another important characteristic of the superlattice film is that it may advantageously be used to block dopant diffusion from the highly doped contact layers <b>102</b>, <b>106</b> and <b>112</b>, <b>116</b> into the undoped/intrinsic layers <b>104</b>, <b>114</b>, as discussed further above. That is, the superlattice material advantageously allows the desired doping profiles to be created for an RTD structure, with a high concentration of doping near the contacts and little or no doping in RTD regions, with relatively precise process control. Moreover, the superlattice material also provides for strain buffer capability for hetero epitaxial film growth, as well as a strain buffer effect for lattice mismatch of hetero epitaxial films.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">Referring additionally to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-8B</figref>, other examples of N-type and P-type DBRTD structures <b>120</b>, <b>130</b> are shown along with their respective band diagrams <b>121</b>, <b>131</b>. In contrast to the DBRTD structures <b>100</b>, <b>110</b> described above, the DBRTD structures <b>120</b>, <b>130</b> illustratively include upper SiO<sub>2 </sub>barrier layers <b>125</b>, <b>135</b> instead of upper superlattice barrier layers.

The SiO<sub>2 </sub>layers <b>125</b>, <b>135</b> may be formed in a similar fashion to the way in which oxygen monolayers are formed during the MST monolayer deposition, but with a longer exposure time and/or higher dosage so that more Si bonding sites are populated with O atoms to form SiO<sub>2</sub>. In these examples, the upper n+ and p+ Si contact layers <b>126</b>, <b>136</b> are polysilicon because they are formed on SiO<sub>2</sub>, as opposed to the single crystal Si layers <b>106</b>, <b>116</b> which may be epitaxially grown on the superlattice layers <b>105</b>, <b>115</b>, as described above.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">Turning now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, one example application for replacing at least a portion of a tungsten (W) plug <b>271</b> in a CMOS FINFET device <b>270</b> with one or more of RTD structures <b>272</b> such as those described above is shown. It should be noted that RTD structure(s) <b>272</b> may be used in planar semiconductor devices as well.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, in another example embodiment a MOBILE device illustratively includes a DBRTD <b>281</b> as described above and a second diode <b>282</b> (which may also be a DBRTD as described above in some embodiments) coupled in series between a clock signal Clock and ground. Furthermore, a transistor <b>283</b> has its source and drain coupled to the first and second contacts of the diode <b>282</b>, and its gate coupled to an input signal IN. An output signal OUT is provided at the point where the diodes <b>281</b>, <b>282</b> are coupled together.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">An example CMOS process flow in which a superlattice RTD module may be included to form the above-described superlattice RTD structures within CMOS devices is shown in the flow diagram <b>290</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. The process begins with a shallow trench isolation (STI) module <b>291</b>, followed by a well module <b>292</b>, a gate module <b>293</b>, a lightly doped drain (LDD) module <b>294</b>, a spacer and source/drain module <b>295</b>, a silicide module <b>296</b>, a contact/M1 module <b>297</b>, and a back end of line (BEOL) module <b>298</b>. More particularly, in the illustrated example, the DBRTD formation occurs within the silicide module <b>296</b>, in that after an oxide chemical vapor deposition (CVD), the MST RTD module is inserted, which includes another (optional) oxide CVD, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), RTD contact patterning, and superlattice RTD epitaxy to create the desired RTD device (which may be done in either a blanket form across an entire wafer (MST1) or selectively at different locations on the water (MST2) with an optional CMP). The silicide module <b>296</b> further illustratively includes silicide block mask patterning which includes lithography, etching, and photoresist (PR) removal, then silicide metal physical vapor deposition (PVD) including a pre-clean and sputter, followed by silicide rapid thermal anneal(s) (RTA), and metal removal via wet etch, for example. It should be noted that certain steps and modules may be performed in different orders in different embodiments, depending upon the type of semiconductor device being created.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">Various devices may be created using the above-described structures and processes. One such device is a tunneling-based SRAM (TSRAM) cell. Using the above-described techniques, a smaller than conventional 6T-SRAM cell (˜150F<sup>2</sup>) may be produced having less power consumption than conventional DRAM cells (4˜8F<sup>2</sup>). Applicability to multi-bit cells may be provided by increasing the number of RTDs, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">Other logic circuit elements in which the above-described DBRTDs may be implemented include FETs and BJTs. One potential benefit of such configurations may include high-speed operation, as tunneling time scale is within pico seconds. Another potential benefit is relatively low power operation, because transition currents during state change may be limited by valley current. For example, greater than 50% reduction of circuit elements may be realized in some instances for implementing a given function, and the I-V curve of NDR devices intersects with other device's load line (at least) twice.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">As noted above, another advantageous application for the DBRTDs described herein is a MOBILE logic element. The RTD not only compacts the memory and logic circuitry, but it may also add new functionality. Moreover, integration of the DBRTD structures into standard Si CMOS may help change future circuit design from a system level. For example, this may enable “neuron network” logic replacing conventional Boolean logic. Moreover, this may allow for an immediate impact by hybrid integration with conventional logic (pipelined ripple carry adder, as an example).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">Many modifications and other embodiments of the invention will come to the mind of one skilled in the art having the benefit of the teachings presented in the foregoing descriptions and the associated drawings. Therefore, it is understood that the invention is not to be limited to the specific embodiments disclosed, and that modifications and embodiments are intended to be included within the scope of the appended claims.</div>
