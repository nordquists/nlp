<heading id="h-0002">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure relates to optoelectronic modules have shielding to reduce light leakage or stray light, and fabrication methods for such modules.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Smartphones and other devices sometimes include miniaturized optoelectronic modules such as light modules, sensors or cameras. Light modules can include a light emitting element such as a light emitting diode (LED), an infra-red (IR) LED, an organic LED (OLED), an infra-red (IR) laser or a vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) that emits light through a lens to outside the device. Other modules can include a light detecting element. For example, CMOS and CCD image sensors can be used in primary or front facing cameras. Likewise, proximity sensors and ambient light sensors can include a light sensing element such as a photodiode. The light emitting and light detecting modules as well as cameras can be used in various combinations. Thus, for example, a light module such as a flash module can be used in combination with a camera that has an imaging sensor. Light emitting modules in combination with light detecting modules also can be used for other applications such as gesture recognition or IR illumination.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, one challenge when integrating an optoelectronic module <b>10</b> into a device such as a smartphone is how to reduce light leakage <b>14</b> from the light source <b>16</b> in the light module, or how to prevent incoming stray light from impinging, for example, in the case of sensors or cameras. Preferably, light emitted from light source <b>16</b> (or light to be detected by a sensor in the module) should pass through lens <b>12</b> and exit (or enter) directly through the transparent cover <b>18</b> of the module <b>10</b>. However, in some cases, some of the light <b>14</b> exits (or enters) the sides of transparent cover <b>18</b>, which can be undesirable.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure describes various optoelectronic modules that include an optoelectronic device (e.g., a light emitting or light detecting element) and a transparent cover. A non-transparent material is present on the sidewalls of the transparent cover, which, in some implementations, can help reduce light leakage from the sides of the transparent cover.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, various techniques are described for fabricating the modules. In some implementations, the modules are fabricated in a wafer-scale process in which two or more wafers are attached to one another to form a wafer stack. Such processes allow many modules to be manufactured at the same time. In some implementations, various elements (e.g., an optical element such as a lens, an optical filter, or a focal length correction layer; or a spacer) can be formed directly on one side or both sides of the transparent wafer using one or more vacuum injection and/or replication tools. In some cases, an optical filter (e.g., a dielectric band-pass filter) and/or a focal length correction layer is present on a surface of the transparent wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">The transparent covers for the modules also can be fabricated as part of the wafer-level processes. For example, a structured transparent wafer (i.e., a wafer that has a non-flat or non-planar surface) can be provided by forming openings such as trenches in the transparent wafer. The trenches then can be filled with a non-transparent material using, for example, a vacuum injection tool. When the vertical-stack subsequently is separated into individual modules, the result is that each module can include a transparent cover having sidewalls that are covered by the non-transparent material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">For example, in one aspect, an optoelectronic module includes an optoelectronic device mounted on a substrate, and a transparent cover separated from the substrate by a spacer. The spacer is composed of a material that is non-transparent to light emitted by or detectable by the optoelectronic device. Sidewalls of the transparent cover are covered by a material that is non-transparent to light emitted by or detectable by the optoelectronic device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Some implementations include one or more of the following features. For example, the module also can include an optical element such as a lens, an optical filter and/or a focal length correction layer on a surface of the transparent cover. The non-transparent material covering the sidewalls of the transparent cover can be, for example, the same material of which the spacer is composed. In some cases, the non-transparent material covering the sidewalls of the transparent cover is a polymer material (e.g., epoxy, acrylate, polyurethane, or silicone) containing a non-transparent filler (e.g., carbon black, pigment, or dye). The optical element can be located in an interior area (i.e., on the sensor-side) of the module or disposed on an exterior surface (i.e., the object-side) of the transparent cover. Some implementations may include multiple optical elements (e.g., an optical element in an interior area of the module and an optical element disposed on an exterior surface of the transparent cover). The module also can include a baffle extending beyond a surface of the transparent cover. The baffle can be composed, in some implementations, of the same non-transparent material that covers the sidewalls of the transparent cover.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Another aspect describes methods of fabricating optoelectronic modules each of which includes at least one optoelectronic device and at least one optical element such as lens, an optical filter or a focal length correction layer. The methods can include providing a transparent wafer having first and second surfaces on opposite sides of the transparent wafer, wherein there are a plurality of non-transparent spacer elements on one of the surfaces of the transparent wafer. Openings (e.g., trenches) are formed in the transparent wafer. Each opening is disposed over a respective one of the spacer elements and extends through the transparent wafer. The openings in the transparent wafer substantially filled with a material that is non-transparent to light emitted by or detectable by the optoelectronic devices. The methods allow modules to be fabricated such that sidewalls of the transparent cover are covered by a non-transparent material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">In yet a further aspect, some modules (e.g., camera modules) can include a vertical stack of two or more transparent substrates, each of which includes optical elements (e.g., lenses) on one or both sides. Such modules can include an image sensor and a vertically stacked transparent substrates separated from one another by a spacer. Each of the transparent substrates has an optical element on at least one of its surfaces. The stacked transparent substrates are attached to the image sensor, which is composed of a material that is non-transparent to light detectable by the image sensor. Sidewalls of the transparent substrates also are covered by a material that is non-transparent to light detectable by the image sensor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">In a further aspect, an optoelectronic module includes an image sensor on a substrate. The image sensor defines a plurality of photosensitive regions each of which corresponds to a respective optical channel. The module also includes a transparent cover, in each optical channel, separated from the substrate by a spacer. The spacer is composed of a material that is non-transparent to light detectable by the image sensor. A focal length correction layer is on a surface of the transparent cover of at least one of the optical channels. Sidewalls of the transparent cover are covered by a material that is non-transparent to light emitted by or detectable by the optoelectronic device. In some implementations, the module also may include an optical filter on a surface of the transparent cover of each optical channel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">In some instances, a module may include an optics assembly on the object-side of the transparent cover. The optics assembly can include, for example, one or more lenses (e.g., a vertical stack of injection molded lenses).</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">The present disclosure describes various techniques for fabricating optoelectronic modules that include non-transparent material (e.g., a polymer such as epoxy with carbon black) on the exterior sidewalls of the transparent cover. An example of such a module is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, which shows a module <b>20</b> including an optoelectronic device <b>22</b> mounted on a printed circuit board (PCB) or other substrate <b>24</b>. Examples of the optoelectronic device <b>22</b> include a light emitting element (e.g a LED, an IR LED, an OLED, an IR laser or a VCSEL) or a light detecting element (e.g., a photodiode or other light sensor).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">A transparent cover <b>26</b> composed, for example, of glass, sapphire or a polymer material, is separated from substrate <b>24</b> by a spacer <b>28</b>. Spacer <b>28</b> surrounds optoelectronic device <b>22</b> and serves as sidewalls for the module. Transparent cover <b>26</b> generally is transparent to wavelengths of light emitted or detectable by optoelectronic device <b>22</b>. Spacer <b>28</b> preferably is composed of a non-transparent material, such as epoxy with carbon black. Attached to one side of transparent cover <b>26</b> is an optical element such as a lens or diffuser <b>30</b>. In the illustrated example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the optical element <b>30</b> is formed by a replication technique and, together with optoelectronic device <b>22</b>, is present in an interior area <b>32</b> of module <b>20</b>. Exterior sidewalls <b>34</b> of transparent cover <b>26</b> also are covered by a non-transparent material <b>36</b>, which may be composed of the same or a different material as is used for spacer <b>28</b>. The exterior side of substrate <b>24</b> includes one or more solder balls or other conductive contacts <b>38</b>, which can be coupled electrically to optoelectronic device <b>22</b> by way of conductive vias extending through substrate <b>24</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">In some cases, non-transparent material <b>39</b> extends beyond the top of transparent cover <b>26</b> near its edges. The non-transparent material <b>39</b> that extends above transparent cover <b>26</b> can serve as a baffle for the module. Depending on the implementation, the non-transparent material <b>36</b> that covers the sidewalls <b>34</b> of the transparent cover <b>26</b> can be the same as, or different from, the material of the spacer <b>28</b>. Likewise, the baffle may be composed of the same material as, or a different material from, the non-transparent material <b>36</b> that covers the sidewalls <b>34</b> of the transparent cover <b>26</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">In some implementations, an optical element is disposed on the exterior surface of transparent cover <b>26</b>. For example, module <b>40</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is similar to module <b>20</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, except that in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> there are a pair of optical elements <b>30</b>A, <b>30</b>B. The second optical element <b>30</b>B is disposed on the exterior surface of transparent cover <b>26</b>, whereas the first optical element <b>30</b>A is disposed on the interior surface of transparent cover <b>26</b>. Some implementations may include an optical element only on the exterior surface of transparent cover <b>26</b>. Other features of module <b>40</b> can be similar to the features discussed above with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">The following paragraphs describe various fabrication techniques for manufacturing the foregoing optoelectronic modules and other similar modules that include a light emitting element or light detecting element and an optical element such as a lens or diffuser integrated as part of the module. Some modules can include multiple optoelectronic devices (e.g., a light emitting element and a light detecting element). In this way, proximity-type sensor modules, for example, having a light emitter and a light detector can be fabricated. In some implementations, the light emitter and light detector are separated by a spacer made of non-transparent material. In some implementations, the modules are fabricated in a wafer-scale process so that multiple modules (e.g., hundreds or even thousands) can be manufactured at that same time. The methods can include using a vacuum injection technique to form various elements on a structured substrate (i.e., a substrate that has a non-flat or non-planar surface). Forming the structured substrate can include, for example, forming openings such as trenches in a transparent wafer. The trenches then can be filled with a non-transparent material using, for example, a vacuum injection tool. Various elements (e.g., the optical elements or spacers) can be formed directly on one side or both sides of the transparent wafer using one or more vacuum injection and/or replication tools.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">For example, in some implementations, a wafer-scale spacer/optics structure <b>84</b> is provided and includes replicated optical elements <b>44</b> and spacers <b>46</b> on a transparent wafer <b>72</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Wafer <b>72</b> can be composed, for example, of a transparent material such as glass or a transparent plastic or polymer material. The spacer/optics structure <b>84</b> can be fabricated in any one of several ways. For example, in a first technique, a single tool can be used to form replicated lenses or other optical elements <b>44</b> on a surface of the transparent wafer <b>72</b> and to form the spacers <b>46</b> using vacuum injection. As used in this disclosure, replication refers to a technique in which a structured surface is embossed into a liquid, viscous or plastically deformable material, and then the material is hardened, e.g., by curing using ultraviolet radiation or heating. In this way, a replica of the structured surface is obtained. Suitable materials for replication are, for example, hardenable (e.g., curable) polymer materials or other replication materials, i.e. materials which are transformable in a hardening or solidification step (e.g., a curing step) from a liquid, viscous or plastically deformable state into a solid state. Although the replication material used to form lenses <b>44</b> is transparent (at least to wavelengths of light that are to be emitted from or detected by the module), the vacuum injection material for the spacers preferably is non-transparent and can be composed, for example, of epoxy with carbon black. Further details that may be applicable to the foregoing process in some implementations are described in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/746,347, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. In a second technique, instead of forming the spacers <b>46</b> using a vacuum injection technique, a spacer/optics structure <b>84</b> can be formed using a wafer stacking process (i.e., attaching a spacer wafer to an optics wafer that includes the previously formed optical elements on its surface).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">The spacer/optics structure <b>84</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> can be used, for example, to form modules such as those illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>. For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4E</figref> illustrates further steps for fabricating the module <b>20</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the spacer/optics structure <b>84</b> is attached to a printed circuit board (PCB) or other substrate <b>90</b> on which are mounted multiple optoelectronic devices <b>92</b>. Alternatively, the spacer/optics structure <b>84</b> may be attached to a transient substrate(s) instead of substrate <b>90</b> to impart, for example, mechanical support to spacer/optics structure <b>84</b>. Examples of transient substrates include UV dicing tape, a PDMS substrate, a glass substrate, a polymer wafer, and/or the tool(s) used to form the replicated optical elements <b>44</b> and/or spacers <b>46</b>, or a combination of any of the foregoing examples. Use of a transient substrate allows the PCB substrate <b>90</b> to be attached to the spacer optics structure <b>84</b> later in the process (e.g., after performance of the step(s) in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>). In some implementations, image sensors can be attached or electrically connected to the PCB substrate <b>90</b>, and then can be attached to the spacer optics structure <b>84</b> later in the process (e.g., after performance of the step(s) in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref>). The PCB substrate <b>90</b> is attached, for example, using a thermally stable adhesive, to spacer elements <b>46</b> on the spacer/optics structure <b>84</b>. The result is a wafer stack that includes an array of optoelectronic devices <b>92</b> each of which is aligned with a respective one of the optical elements (e.g., lenses) <b>44</b>. The exterior surface of the substrate can include one or more solder balls or other conductive contacts, which can be coupled electrically to the optoelectronic devices by way of conductive vias extending through the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, openings (e.g., trenches) <b>98</b> are formed in the transparent wafer <b>72</b> in regions above spacers <b>46</b>. Trenches <b>98</b> should extend entirely through the thickness of wafer <b>72</b> and, preferably, should extend partially into spacers <b>46</b>. Trenches <b>98</b> can be formed, for example, by dicing, micromachining or laser cutting techniques. The result is a non-planar surface that includes trenches <b>98</b> formed between adjacent portions of transparent wafer <b>72</b>. As explained below, trenches <b>98</b> subsequently are filled with a non-transparent material (e.g., epoxy with carbon black) so as to provide a non-transparent layer on the sidewalls of the various portions of the transparent wafer <b>72</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, a vacuum injection PDMS tool <b>100</b> is placed over transparent wafer <b>72</b> to facilitate filling trenches <b>98</b> with a non-transparent material (e.g., epoxy with carbon black). A vacuum chuck <b>101</b> is provided below and around the spacer/optics structure <b>84</b> so as to apply a vacuum between the vacuum injection tool <b>100</b> and the PCB substrate <b>90</b>. The non-transparent material can be injected into an inlet <b>101</b>A in the vacuum chuck <b>101</b>. A vacuum pump <b>101</b>B near an outlet of the vacuum chuck <b>101</b> facilitates flow of the injected non-transparent material. After filling trenches <b>98</b> with the epoxy material under vacuum, the epoxy material is hardened (e.g., by UV or thermal curing), and the tool <b>100</b> is removed from the spacer/optics structure <b>84</b>. The result, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, is that non-transparent regions <b>104</b> (e.g., epoxy with carbon black) are formed between adjacent portions of the transparent wafer <b>72</b>. Each non-transparent region <b>104</b> is in contact with, and bonds to, a non-transparent spacer <b>46</b>. Non-transparent regions <b>104</b> are flush with the exterior surface of the various portions of the transparent wafer <b>72</b> and can be composed of the same non-transparent material or a different non-transparent material as spacers <b>46</b>. In some implementations, a baffle wafer <b>99</b> composed of a non-transparent material is attached over the spacer/optics structure. In other implementations, the baffle wafer <b>99</b> can be omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">After forming the epoxy with carbon black regions <b>104</b> and removing the vacuum injection tool <b>100</b>, the wafer stack is separated along dicing lines to form individual optoelectronic modules <b>20</b> each of which includes an optoelectronic device aligned with a lens element attached to a transparent cover, whose exterior sidewalls are covered with, or embedded within, non-transparent material (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4E and 2A</figref>). Thus, the foregoing technique can be used to fabricate multiple modules <b>20</b> on a wafer-level scale.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">In the illustrated example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4E</figref>, the PCB substrate <b>90</b> (with the optoelectronic devices mounted on its surface) is attached to the spacer/optics structure <b>84</b> before performance of the steps in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B-4E</figref>. In other implementations, the spacer/optics structure <b>84</b> may be attached to a transient substrate instead of substrate <b>90</b> to impart, for example, mechanical support to spacer/optics structure <b>84</b>. Examples of transient substrates include UV dicing tape, a PDMS substrate, a glass substrate, a polymer wafer, and/or the tool(s) used to form the replicated optical elements <b>44</b> and/or the spacers <b>46</b>, or a combination of any of the foregoing examples. Use of a transient substrate allows the PCB substrate <b>90</b> to be attached to the spacer/optics structure <b>84</b> later in the process (e.g., after performance of the step(s) in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>). In other implementations, image sensors may be attached or electrically connected to the PCB substrate <b>90</b>, and then attached to a singulated spacer optics structure <b>84</b> later in the process (e.g., after performance of the step(s) in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref>). Furthermore, in some implementations, instead of attaching a PCB substrate (with the optoelectronic devices mounted on its surface) to the spacer/optics structure <b>84</b>, individual singulated optoelectronic devices can be attached to the spacer elements <b>46</b>.</div>

If a transparent FFL substrate is provided for FFL correction of the optical channel(s), the trenches can extend into the FFL substrate as well. Trenches <b>98</b> can be formed, for example, by dicing, micromachining or laser cutting techniques. The result is a non-planar surface that includes trenches <b>98</b> formed between adjacent portions of the transparent wafers. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>, a vacuum injection PDMS tool <b>114</b>B is placed over the first transparent wafer <b>72</b>A to facilitate filling trenches <b>98</b> with a non-transparent material (e.g., epoxy with carbon black), and a vacuum chuck <b>101</b> is provided below and around the spacer/optics structure <b>84</b>B so as to apply a vacuum between the vacuum injection tool <b>114</b>B and the PCB substrate <b>90</b>. The non-transparent material can be injected into an inlet in the vacuum chuck <b>101</b>. As described above in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, a vacuum pump near an outlet of the vacuum chuck <b>101</b> facilitates flow of the injected non-transparent material. After filling trenches <b>98</b> with the non-transparent material (e.g., epoxy with carbon black) under vacuum, the epoxy material is hardened (e.g., by UV or thermal curing), and the tool <b>114</b>B is removed from the spacer/optics structure <b>84</b>B. The material with which the trenches <b>98</b> are filled can be the same as or different from the material of the spacers <b>46</b>. In some implementations, a baffle wafer composed of a non-transparent material can be attached over the spacer/optics structure. Alternatively, in some implementations, baffle features are provided in the vacuum injection tool <b>114</b>B, and the baffle structure is formed by vacuum injection as described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">The wafer stack then can be separated, for example, along dicing lines to form individual optoelectronic modules each of which includes an image sensor aligned with vertical stacks of optical elements attached to transparent substrates, whose exterior sidewalls are covered with, or embedded within, non-transparent material <b>93</b> (see, e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10D</figref>). The illustrated example module of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10D</figref> shows an array of camera (e.g., a 2×2 or any other M×N array) including a transparent substrate <b>95</b> for FFL channel correction, and an additional spacer <b>97</b> that separates the FFL correction substrate <b>95</b> from the substrate <b>90</b> on which the image sensor <b>94</b> is mounted. The additional spacer <b>97</b> can provide additional FFL correction for the module.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">In the foregoing examples, after forming the trenches <b>98</b> in the transparent wafer <b>72</b>, which results in a non-planar structure, sidewalls of the various sections of the transparent wafer <b>72</b> (or <b>72</b>A, <b>72</b>B) are covered with a non-transparent material by a vacuum injection technique. In some implementations, a different technique can be used to cover the sidewalls of the various sections of the transparent wafer <b>72</b> with a non-transparent material. For example, after forming trenches <b>98</b>, the sidewalls of the various sections of the transparent wafer <b>72</b> can be coated with one or more layers <b>108</b> of non-transparent material(s) (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). In a particular implementation, one or more coatings are applied to the side and top surfaces of the various sections of the transparent wafer <b>72</b>. The layers <b>108</b> can be composed, for example, of a polymer resist-type material, a metallic material (e.g., aluminum) or a black chromium material. The layers can be applied, for example, using PVD, CVD, dip coating, spray coating, sputtering or evaporation techniques. The thickness of the layers <b>108</b> depends on the implementation, but preferably each coating layer has a thickness in the range of about 5-40 microns (μm) and, in some implementations, each coating layer has a thickness in the range of about 10-20 μm. After depositing the layers <b>108</b>, baking (i.e., heating at an elevated temperature) may be performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">After depositing and baking the layers <b>108</b>, the layers over the top surfaces of the various portions of the non-transparent wafer <b>72</b> are removed using, for example, photolithographic, chemical or mechanical techniques. If a photolithographic technique is used, a photolithographically structurable coating (e.g., a photoresist coating) can be used. If a chemical technique is used, an appropriate solvent can be provided to etch away the coating layers from the top surface of the various portions of the non-transparent wafer <b>72</b>. In some implementations, the layers are removed from the top surfaces of the various portions of the non-transparent wafer <b>72</b> mechanically by applying a tape having an adhesive surface. After removal of the coating layers from the top surfaces of the various portions of the non-transparent wafer <b>72</b>, the sidewalls of the various portions of the non-transparent wafer <b>72</b> remain covered with coating layers <b>108</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The wafer stack then can be separated (e.g., by dicing) to form individual modules each of which includes a light emitting element <b>92</b> aligned with an optical element (e.g., lens <b>44</b>). As in the previous examples, the sidewalls of the module's transparent cover are covered with non-transparent material so as to reduce light leakage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">Furthermore, although the foregoing examples include a single optoelectronic device (e.g., light emitting or light detecting element) in each module, techniques similar to the foregoing techniques can be used to fabricate modules that include two or more light emitting elements, each of which is aligned with one or more respective optical elements. Such modules, which can include non-transparent sidewalls surrounding two or more light emitting elements without a spacer separating the light emitting elements from one another, can serve, for example, as dual LED flash modules. In some implementations, the modules also may include other optoelectronic or optical components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">The modules described above include a replicated lens one or both sides of the transparent cover <b>26</b>. In some cases, however, an optical filter layer may be provided on the transparent cover. Likewise, in some implementations, a focal flange length (FFL), correction layer may be applied on the transparent cover. The FFL sometimes is referred to as a flange focal distance. Including a FFL correction layer can be particularly advantageous, for example, for image sensor applications. Thus, in some instances, the transparent cover <b>26</b> may include a replicated lens on one side only or, in some cases, may not include a replicated lens on either side. An example is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref>, which show multi-channel modules <b>200</b>A and <b>200</b>B, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">Modules <b>200</b>A and <b>200</b>B of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref> include an image sensor <b>222</b> supported on a PCB or other substrate <b>224</b>. Image sensor <b>222</b> has optically sensitive regions <b>223</b> that are surrounded laterally by a spacer <b>228</b>, which also serves as sidewalls for the sensor-side of the module. Side edges of the transparent covers <b>226</b> are embedded within the spacers, which can be composed, for example, of a non-transparent material (e.g., epoxy with carbon black). Transparent covers <b>226</b> can be composed, for example, of glass, sapphire or a polymer material, and are separated from image sensor <b>222</b> by spacer <b>228</b>. In the illustrated examples of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref>, the object-side of each transparent cover <b>226</b> includes an optical filter <b>230</b>, which can be implemented, for example, as a thin coating. Likewise, the sensor-side of each transparent cover may include a FFL correction layer <b>232</b> to correct for the channel focal length. The thickness of the FFL correction layer <b>232</b> in each channel may vary from the thickness of the FFL layer <b>232</b> in another channel. In some cases, only some of the channels have a FFL correction layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">Non-transparent material <b>239</b> may extend beyond the top of transparent covers <b>226</b> near their edges. Depending on the implementation, non-transparent material <b>236</b> that covers the sidewalls of the transparent covers <b>226</b> can be the same as, or different from, the material of the spacer <b>228</b> and/or the non-transparent material <b>239</b> that extends beyond the top of the transparent covers <b>226</b>. The exterior side of PCB substrate <b>224</b> can includes conductive contacts, which can be coupled electrically to image sensor <b>222</b> by way of conductive vias extending through substrate <b>224</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">The modules <b>200</b>A, <b>200</b>B can include one or more optics assemblies <b>250</b>. The optics assemblies can be attached to an assembly <b>240</b> that is composed of the transparent covers <b>226</b> (including the FFL correction layer <b>232</b> and the filter layer <b>230</b>, if present) and non-transparent walls/spacers <b>228</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>239</b>. Each optics assembly <b>250</b> can include, for example, a stack of one or more injection molded optical elements (e.g., lenses) <b>252</b> placed in a lens barrel <b>254</b>. In some cases, an array of injection molded lens stacks can be provided collectively for all the optical channels (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>), whereas in other implementations, a separate lens stack is provided for each respective channel (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">Multiple assemblies <b>240</b> including transparent covers <b>226</b> (together with the FFL correction layer <b>232</b> and/or the filter layer <b>230</b>) and non-transparent walls/spacers <b>228</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>239</b> can be fabricated as part of a waver-level process. For example, to fabricate assemblies <b>240</b>, a process similar to the one described in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5E</figref> can be used, except that instead of lenses being formed on the transparent wafer, a FFL correction layer is provided on the transparent wafer. The FFL correction layer may be composed, for example, of a glass or polymer material, and can be applied, for example, by spin coating, spraying or sputtering. An optical filter layer may be applied to the other side of the transparent wafer. The spacers and walls for the modules can be formed using the techniques described in detail above (e.g., replication or vacuum injection, trench formation and filling of the trenches with non-transparent material). Transient substrates (e.g., UV dicing tape, a PDMS substrate, a glass substrate, a polymer wafer) can be used to support the structure during the foregoing steps. In some cases, a lens may be replicated on the surface of the optical filter layer. Further, if an optical filter layer is not provided on the transparent wafer, then in some cases, a lens may be replicated directly on the surface of the transparent wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">Next, optics assemblies (i.e., lens stacks) can be attached to the object-side of the spacer/optics/embedded transparent cover assemblies. This can be accomplished either on a wafer-level scale or by attaching individual lens stacks to the spacer/optics/embedded transparent cover assemblies. Next, the focal length (e.g., FFL) of each optical channel can be measured and compared to a specified value. If the measured FFL for particular channel deviates from a desired value, the FFL correction layer can be removed selectively in that channel to correct for the FFL value. Photolithographic techniques can be used, for example, to partially or entirely remove the FFL correction layer, as needed. Since the channels may have different FFL values, different amounts of the channel FFL correction layer may be needed to achieve corrected FFL values for the various channels. For some channels, no FFL correction may be needed. In other cases, a portion of the channel FFL correction layer may be removed. In yet other cases, no portion of the channel FFL correction layer may be removed. Thus, depending on the implementation, the channel FFL correction layer may be present for all of the channels or for only some of the channels. Furthermore, the thickness of the final channel FFL correction layer may vary from one channel to the next, depending on the amount of FFL correction needed in each channel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">The wafer-level structure (including the spacers, embedded transparent covers, and optics assemblies) then can be separated into individual assemblies, each of which includes, for example, an array of optical channels. Each of the separated assemblies then can be attached to an individual image sensor assembly (i.e., a PCB substrate on which is mounted an imager sensor).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">In some implementations, it may be desirable to provide an optical filter <b>230</b>A directly on the active photosensitive regions <b>223</b> of the image sensor <b>222</b>. Such filters can be provided, for example, instead of the filters <b>230</b> on the transparent cover <b>226</b>. This arrangement may be useful, for example, where a lens is replicated on the surface of each transparent cover <b>226</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">Each of the modules of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref> includes multiple optical channels. Single modules that include similar features can be provided as well. An example of such a module <b>200</b>C is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref>. The sidewalls of the transparent cover <b>226</b> as well as the sidewalls of the optical filter <b>230</b> are encapsulated by the non-transparent material of the spacer <b>228</b>. The module <b>200</b>C also includes an optics assembly implemented as a stack of one or more injection molded optical elements (e.g., lenses) <b>252</b> placed in a lens barrel <b>254</b>. In the illustrated example, the module <b>200</b>C does not include an FFL correction layer <b>232</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">As illustrated in the examples of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref>, the bottom of the spacer <b>228</b> extends to, and is in contact with, the upper surface of the image sensor <b>222</b>. In some instances, however, as shown in the module <b>200</b>D of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12D</figref>, the bottom of the interior part <b>228</b>A of the spacer <b>228</b> between the two adjacent optical channels does not extend to the upper surface of the image sensor <b>222</b> (or to the upper surface of the optical filter <b>230</b>A, if present). The bottom of the interior part <b>228</b>A of the spacer <b>228</b> between the two channels may, thus, not be in contact with any surface. Further, in some implementations, the optical filter <b>230</b>A, if present, can be formed as a contiguous coating that spans both channels. In other cases, each channel may have an optical filter <b>230</b>A that has different optical properties from the filter in the other channel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">The optical filters discussed above can be implemented in various ways. For example, in some implementations, a dielectric band-pass filter can be applied to the photo sensitive surface of the light sensing element (e.g., an image sensor) or to a surface of the transparent cover that is disposed over the light sensing element. In some cases, such a band-pass filter is deposited onto the transparent cover (or onto a transparent wafer in the case of a wafer-level process) by vapor deposition or sputtering. Preferably the dielectric filter is deposited onto a transparent cover composed, for example, of glass, sapphire or another transparent material that has mechanical/thermal-expansion properties similar those of glass or sapphire. The band-pass filter can be advantageous because it permits a very narrow range of wavelengths to impinge on the light sensing element (e.g., a photodiode or image sensor). An example of a module <b>300</b> that incorporates a dielectric band-pass filter <b>230</b>B on the surface of the transparent cover <b>226</b>A in the optical detection channel is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">The module <b>300</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> includes two optical channels: an optical emission channel and an optical detection channel. The emission channel includes a light emitting device (e.g., a LED or laser diode) <b>222</b>B, and the detection channel includes a light sensing device (e.g., a photodiode or image sensor) <b>222</b>A. The devices <b>222</b>A, <b>222</b>B are mounted on a common PCB or other substrate <b>224</b>. Each channel includes a respective transparent cover <b>226</b>A, <b>226</b>B that intersects the optical axis of the channel. The side edges of the transparent covers <b>226</b>A, <b>226</b>B can be covered by or embedded within non-transparent material, in accordance with the techniques described above. The transparent cover <b>226</b>B in the emission channel may include one or more optical elements (e.g., a lens) <b>244</b> on its surface. Likewise, the transparent cover <b>226</b>A in the detection channel includes a dielectric band-pass filter <b>230</b>B on its surface. The range of transmission of the band-pass filter <b>230</b>B may be selected to match substantially the range of emission from the light emitting device <b>222</b>B. For example, in some instances, the light emitting device <b>222</b>B is operable to emit infra-red light (e.g., about 937 nm+10 nm), and the band-pass filter is operable to allow only light in the same range to pass to the light sensing device <b>222</b>A. Such an arrangement allows light <b>350</b> from the light emitting device <b>222</b>B to be reflected by an object or scene. Some of the reflected light <b>352</b> can be sensed by the light sensing device <b>222</b>A, whereas light <b>354</b> (e.g., ambient light) at wavelengths outside the range of the filter <b>230</b>B are blocked.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">In the fabrication examples described above, a spacer/optics structure (e.g., <b>84</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>) is attached directly by adhesive to a PCB or other substrate wafer on which are mounted multiple optoelectronic devices (e.g., light emitting elements or light detecting elements). In particular, the free ends of the spacer elements of the spacer/optics structure is attached directly by adhesive to the PCB or other substrate wafer. In the resulting modules, the spacer <b>46</b> that separates the PCB or other substrate <b>90</b> from the transparent wafer <b>72</b> is composed of a non-transparent material, such as a vacuum injected polymer material (e.g., epoxy, acrylate, polyurethane, or silicone) containing a non-transparent filler (e.g., carbon black, pigment, or dye). In some implementations, however, instead of attaching the spacer/optics structure directly to the PCB or other substrate wafer <b>90</b>, the spacer/optics structure <b>84</b> is attached to a structural element on the surface of the substrate wafer. An example is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, which is discussed below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>, a spacer/optics structure <b>302</b> includes a transparent cover <b>304</b> and a spacer <b>308</b>. A substrate wafer <b>310</b> comprises a metal frame <b>310</b> and molded cavity <b>314</b> (a lead frame). The metal frame, which may be composed for example of a metal such as copper, aluminum or nickel, has optoelectronic devices <b>312</b> mounted on its surface and spaced laterally form one another. Further, the molded cavity <b>314</b> should have dimensions that match those of the spacer <b>312</b> such that the free ends of the spacer <b>308</b> and molded cavity <b>314</b> can be attached directly to one another by adhesive, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>. This can be particularly advantageous, for example, as the substrate wafer can be relatively inexpensive. The stack formed by the spacer/optics structure <b>302</b> and the substrate wafer <b>318</b> then can be processed in accordance with any of the various techniques described above to fabricate modules in which the non-transparent spacer material covers the sidewalls of the transparent cover (see, e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref>). In some cases the transparent cover may include an optical element on one or both of its surfaces. The optical element can be, for example, a lens, an optical filter or a FFL correction layer. In some cases, an optics assembly <b>250</b> including a stack of lenses can be attached over the transparent cover.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">In modules fabricated using a stack as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref>, one end of the spacer <b>308</b> is attached (e.g., by adhesive) to an end of the molded cavity <b>314</b>. Thus, the molded cavity <b>314</b> is attached to the spacer <b>308</b>, which may be composed, for example, of a vacuum injected polymer material such as epoxy, acrylate, polyurethane, or silicone containing a non-transparent filler such as carbon black, a pigment, or a dye. The sidewalls of the transparent cover <b>304</b> in each module can be encapsulated laterally by the same or similar material as the spacer <b>308</b>; likewise, the sidewalls of the metal substrate <b>310</b> in each module can be encapsulated laterally by the molded cavity <b>314</b>.</div>
