Device layers are typically fabricated separately on Silicon on insulator (SOI) substrates or bulk Silicon (Si) substrates. Additionally, each device layer may include at least one interconnect and one or more of active Si, Gallium nitride (GaN) and III-V field-effect transistors (FETs).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">Example device layers may include complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuits having a pair of transistors, one using electrons and the other electron holes. Silicon (Si) and/or Germanium (Ge) semiconductor materials may be used to fabricate device layers having silicon transistors in high performance applications, for example. Alternative semiconductor materials such as Gallium Nitride (GaN) and Silicon Carbide (SiC) may also be used as they tend to cope much better at higher temperatures (e.g., Si for electronics and compound semiconductors for photonics). Silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) and hafnium dioxide (HfO<sub>2</sub>) may be used as insulator materials or structures within transistors in device layers. Additionally, III-V compound semiconductors, particularly those containing Indium such as Indium Arsenide and Indium Antimonide combined with germanium-rich transistors (e.g., nfinFETs with fins that are 5 nm wide or less), may be used in device layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">Example device layers may also include quantum-well devices which are fabricated with high-mobility materials such as fully depleted silicon-on-insulator (FD-SOI) materials (e.g., in quantum-well devices having a thickness between about twenty two nanometers (nm) and about twenty eight nm). Such quantum-well devices may be suitable for low-power applications including, for example, the Internet of Things (IoT). Example device layers may further include Nanowire FETs in some embodiments. In the backend, low-k treatments of nanowire FETs may be critical. Self-alignment of nanowire FETs may also be very important.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">It is possible to operate some of the circuit elements or devices (e.g., transistors) in device layers at low temperatures (e.g., a temperature which is greater than room temperature up to about 4 K) to provide for reduced operating voltages, higher speed operation and low power dissipation. Additionally, it is possible to utilize transistor technology with “low” and/or “ultra-low” power requirements and increased switching speeds in comparison to room temperature transistor devices in device layers. It is also possible to consider room temperature and/or high temperature devices as low temperature devices if these devices are able to operate at low temperature ranges. 2D materials (e.g., Graphene) and/or 2D material based devices (e.g., Vanadium dioxide based hybrid field effect transistors) can be used as a functional section or device layer, or be provided as part of a functional section or device layer. Various bandgap materials including silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), indium antimonide (InSb), indium arsenide (InAs), indium arsenide (InP), gallium phosphide (GaP), gallium arsenide (GaAs), gallium sulfide (GaS), cadmium sulfide (CdS), cadmium selenide (CdSe), cadmium telluride (CdTe), and zinc oxide (ZnO) may further be used to fabricate device layers.</div>

The module may include a plurality of conductive leads adapted for coupling the module to electrical circuitry and/or electrical components located externally of the module. One known example of such a module is a Multi-Chip Module (MCM), such modules coming in a variety of shapes and forms.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">As used herein, the term “self-bondable oxide” is used to describe multilayer oxide (e.g., single or multi component, doped or undoped, high density-low density, etc.), the multilayer oxide having at least one chemically activated, ultra-smooth bonding surface (e.g., within a predetermined number of angstroms (Å)) capable of bonding with another self-bondable oxide without any external force. The process for bonding a first self-bondable oxide with a second self-bondable oxide, etc. requires minimum force to activate bonding at a symmetry point on a bonding surface of the first and second self-bondable oxides (e.g. wafers), and little to no additional force to self-propagate bonding to entire surfaces of the first and second self-bondable oxides. Self-bondable oxides preferably use an oxidizing-reducing agent to chemically activate a bonding surface. RCA and/or high frequency (HF) and/or mega sonic cleaning and/or Plasma (e.g. oxygen) and/or Ammonium Hydroxide may be used for pre-bond surface treatments for the self-bondable oxide. Additionally, annealing the self-bondable oxide at a temperature between about one-hundred fifty degrees Celsius (C) and about five-hundred degrees C. in presence of Hydrogen (H) or Nitrogen (N) may increase bond strength of the self-bondable oxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">As used herein, the term “substrate” is used to describe any structure upon which an integrated circuit or semiconductor device can be disposed or upon which semiconductor materials can be deposited and/or into which semiconductor materials can be implanted and diffused to form a semiconductor structure or device, for example.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">As used herein, the term “three-dimensional (3-D) integrated circuit (IC)” is used to describe a semiconductor structure including at least two device layers (e.g., which are vertically stacked) and interconnects (e.g., vertical interconnects) to make one or more electrical connections between the device layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">As used herein, the term “equivalent three-dimensional (3-D) integrated circuit (IC)” is used to describe when multiple three-dimensional (3-D) integrated circuits including a substantially same number of device layers (e.g., which are vertically stacked) and a substantially same number of interconnects (e.g., vertical interconnects) are used to make one or more electrical connections between the device layers but at least one interconnect and or vertical interconnect and/or layer of interconnects have substantially different dimensions and/or substantially different resistances and/or substantially different compositions from each other. Each of the device layers (or semiconductor structures) is substantially the same in each of the ICs (e.g., multi-layer semiconductor structures) and each of the interconnects is arranged substantially the same in each of the ICs. In one example, an interconnect may include at least one of a micro-bump, solder bump, solder coated micro-pillar, micro pillar, via first, via last, and a through silicon via (TSV) or a combination thereof. In another example, an interconnect may include one or more of the following materials: tin-lead, bismuth-tin, bismuth-tin-iron, tin, indium, tin-indium, indium-gold, tin-indium-gold, tin-silver, tin-gold, indium, tin-silver-zinc, tin-silver-zinc-copper, tin-bismuth-silver, tin-copper, tin-copper-silver, tin-indium-silver, tin-antimony, tin-zinc, tin-zinc-indium, copper-based solders, and alloys thereof. Such materials may melt during a bonding or a reflow process, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">As used herein, the term “through oxide via (TOV)” is used to describe a via (e.g., micro via) in a semiconductor structure used to connect adjacent device layers. The TOV passes through one or more oxide, dielectric, and/or metal layers and terminates at a predetermined Silicon (Si) layer or surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">As used herein, the term “via first” may be used to describe a micro via and/or a submicro via used to make at least one electrical connection between a first device layer and second device layer in a semiconductor structure including at least two device layers. Additionally, as described here, the term “via” first may also be used to describe a micro via and/or a submicro via passing through a dielectric material or layer (in some embodiments, only the dielectric material or layer) to make at least one electrical connection between a first device layer and a second device layer in a semiconductor structure including at least two device layers. For a via first process, the first device layer and the second device layer are completed separately. As one example, a partial via material is added on first and/or second opposing surfaces (i.e., top and/or bottom surfaces) of the first second device layers and subsequent bonding and/or post bonding process create a via first between the first and second device layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">The via first may be filled with at least one metal or alloy having a high Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) to produce a rigid, robust, and conductive via first joint between the at least two device layers during the composite bonding process. High temperatures and/or high pressures may be applied and used to bond the two device layers and provide a three-dimensional (3D) interconnection (i.e., interconnect) among the device layers. The high CTE metal or alloy are expanded at relatively high temperatures and interdiffuse with each other to produce the 3D interconnect. Alternatively, the via first may be filled with a low temperature fusible metal which melts and interdiffuse during bonding or post bonding processes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">As used herein, the term “via last” is used to describe a micro via and/or a submicro via used to make at least one electrical connection between a first device layer and a second device layer in a semiconductor structure including at least two device layers. Fabrication of the first device layer is completed first, and the second device layer is deposited over the first device layer. The second device layer is completed with via last process. A pad layer which includes one or more interconnect pads may be added after via last process. In one embodiment, via last is filled. Additionally, in one embodiment, the via last can be unfilled or partially filled. Via last may pass through the device layers (e.g., second device layers) and, in some embodiments, one or more isolation layers or materials. A titanium (Ti) material having a thickness of about ten nanometers (nm) and, a metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) Titanium Nitride (TiN) liner having a thickness of about five nm, and tungsten plugs may be used for via lasts. A MOCVD or chemical vapor deposition (CVD) TiN<sub>X</sub>, with X less than or equal to 1, is preferred for better conformal coating.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">As used herein, the term “through silicon via” (TSV) is used to describe a vertical interconnect which passes substantially through one or more of a silicon wafer, a silicon die, a silicon interposer, silicon active circuits, silicon passive circuits, or other silicon circuits, components or layers. TSVs can be fabricated by different methods and approaches. In Silicon (Si) via-first approaches, for example, TSVs are fabricated prior to fabrication of active devices (i.e. bipolar or MOSFET devices) to which the TSVs may be coupled. The approach includes patterning the TSVs, lining the TSVs with a high temperature dielectric (thermal oxide or chemical vapor deposition), filling the TSVs with doped polysilicon and using chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) techniques to remove excess polysilicon from one or more surfaces of the TSVs. Si via-first approaches allow for the use of high temperature processes to insulate and fill the TSVs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">In Si via-middle approaches, TSVs are fabricated after forming the active devices to which the TSVs may be coupled, but before back end of line (BEOL) stack fabrication. The approach includes patterning the TSVs after a contact process, lining the TSVs with a low temperature dielectric deposition, and then filling the TSVs with single/multiple barrier metals. Typically the TSVs are filled with Copper (Cu) and/or W. For TSVs filled with Cu, a Cu seed layer is disposed on top of a barrier layer and a subsequent Cu electroplating fills the TSVs. The TSVs are then planarized using CMP techniques. For W, chemical vapor depositing (CVD) processes are used to fill the TSVs, and CMP techniques are used to remove excess polysilicon from one or more surfaces of the TSV. W is preferred for filling high aspect ratio TSVs (e.g., TSVs with aspect ratio of height-to-width &gt;10:1). In general, Cu is used to fill low aspect ratio TSVs (e.g., TSVs with aspect ratio &lt;10:1). Si via-middle process are useful for fabricating TSVs with a small via pitch, TSVs having minimal blockage of wiring channels, and TSVs having a low via resistance, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">In front side Si via-last approaches, TSVs are fabricated at the end of the BEOL processing of the wafer. Si via-last approaches are similar to Si via middle approaches, but Si via-last approaches use low temperature dielectric depositions (&lt;400 C) compared to higher temperature dielectric compositions (&lt;600 C) in Si via middle approaches. Front side Si via-last approaches may be suitable for their coarse TSV feature size, which simplifies the process of integrating TSVs into semiconductor structures. The front side Si via-last approaches may also useful for wafer-to-wafer bonding. In such approaches, TSVs can be formed at the end of the wafer-to-wafer bonding process, connecting multiple layers in the multi-layer (e.g., three-dimensional (3D)) stack of wafers or semiconductor structures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">Front side Si via-last approaches may use TSV etch as well as the entire BEOL dielectric stack. Backside Si via-last approaches also use wafer to wafer (or semiconductor structure to semiconductor structure) stacking. The wafers can be bonded together using oxide bonding or polymer adhesive bonding, either front-to-front or front-to-back. The wafers can be thinned by etching and or polishing. Additionally, a TSV may be formed in the wafers by etching a via down to bond pads on a top wafer and a bottom wafer. The process includes patterning the TSVs after the contact process, lining the TSVs with a low temperature dielectric deposition, and then filling the TSVs with a single/multiple barrier metal (e.g., Cu and/or W). The TSVs are then planarized through a subsequent CMP process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">A number of inorganic and organic dielectric materials having a thickness in a range of about one hundred nanometers (nm) to about one thousand nm can be used to insulate the TSVs. TSV dielectrics may be required to have good step coverage (at least 50% through the depth of the trench), good thickness uniformity (&lt;3% variation across the wafer), high deposition rate (&gt;100 nm/min), low stress (&lt;200 MPa), low leakage current (&lt;1 nA/cm2), and high breakdown voltage (&gt;5 MV/cm). Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) of SiO2 or SiN, or sub-atmospheric chemical vapor depositions (SACVD) of SiO2, are some examples of insulator deposition. The most commonly used conductors to fill TSVs are doped polysilicon (180 lohm-cm), tungsten (5.6 lohm-cm), or copper (1.7 lohm-cm). W deposited by CVD has a good fill of the TSV and can be integrated with the contacts to which the TSVs are to be coupled. A TiN liner is required to ensure that the WF6 precursor does not attack the Si substrate in the TSV. A disadvantage of W compared to Cu is that it has a high intrinsic stress (1400 MPa for W, 20 MPa for Cu).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">Reactive-ion-etching (RIE) may be used to create high aspect ratio TSVs and deep trench structures in the Si (i.e., for capacitors or for isolation) in which the TSVs are provided. In one embodiment, a TSV RIE Bosch process may be used to fabricate the TSVs, with process alternating between deposition and etching steps to fabricate deep vias. SF6 isotropic etching of Si may not be suitable for forming TSVs (which require a highly anisotropic etch). Fluorocarbon chemistry (e.g., C4F8) may be used for anisotropic etching achieved through the deposition of a chemically inert passivation on the sidewall of the TSVs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) may be used for planarization of metal filled vias (e.g., micro vias), for example. Additionally, a metal contact (i.e. pad) in an upper device layer (e.g., the second device layer) may be an annulus with an about a one point five micrometer (μm) opening that also functions as a self-aligned mask (e.g., hard mask) during the plasma etch of the oxide beneath it to reach a corresponding metal contact in a lower device layer (e.g., the first device layer). In order to fully dispose and electrically the via, the size of the metal contacts, and thus the pitch of the vertical interconnect, is made proportional to about twice the wafer-wafer misalignment of the wafers including the first and second device layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">As used herein, the term “bulk Complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)) fabrication techniques” is used to describe semiconductor fabrication techniques in which CMOS circuit elements or devices are fabricated in a Silicon (Si) substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">As used herein, the term “Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) CMOS fabrication techniques” is used to describe semiconductor fabrication techniques in which CMOS circuit elements or devices are isolated from a Si substrate by one or more dielectric materials. SOI CMOS fabrication techniques may be used to significantly reduce junction capacitances and allow the CMOS circuit elements or devices to operate at a “higher” speed or at a substantially “lower” power level at a same speed as those which are fabricated through bulk CMOS fabrication techniques, for example. SOI CMOS fabrication techniques also reduces or eliminates latch up effects that may be found in bulk CMOS, and improves the short channel effect and soft error immunity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">As used herein, the term “single-sided bondable semiconductor structure” is used to describe a semiconductor structure which includes at least one functional section and at least self-bondable oxide before bonding, and is capable of bonding with other semiconductor structures one side at a time (e.g., using via first or via last approaches). For Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) technology, a single side bondable wafer can undergo a post bonding process which includes removal of handle (e.g., a Si handle), deposition of at least self-bondable oxide and subsequent processing before second bonding. Thus, if necessary (or desired), a SOI based single-sided bondable wafer can be used as double-sided bondable wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">As used herein, the term “double-sided bondable semiconductor structure” is used to describe a semiconductor structure which includes at least one functional section and at least self-bondable oxide before bonding, and. is capable of bonding with other semiconductor structures one side at a time (e.g., using via first and/or via last approaches). After a first bonding process/cycle, the semiconductor structure may undergo post bonding process which may include removal of a handle (e.g., a Si handle), deposition of at least one self-bondable oxide, and subsequent processing before second bonding.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">As used herein, the term “single step double-sided bondable semiconductor structure” is used to describe a semiconductor structure which includes at least one functional section, at least one TSV to connect both sides of the semiconductor structure and at least self-bondable oxide on each side of the semiconductor structure.
