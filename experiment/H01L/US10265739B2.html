<heading id="h-0002">DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present Invention relates to a method and an apparatus for treating substrates, wherein a liquid is supplied to at least a partial area of the substrate and radiation is introduced into the liquid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">In the field of semiconductors it is known that for example photo masks have to be exposed to different treatment steps, In particular cleaning steps, both during their manufacture and during their use in the field. It is in particular known to expose the masks to a wet cleaning process. For such a wet cleaning process it is advantageous if the surface to be cleaned has hydrophilic surface characteristics, in order to enable better wetting of the surface to be cleaned by the process media applied thereto. Due to different phenomena, the surface of photo masks, however, is often hydrophobic prior to its cleaning, which may on one hand be caused by the orientation of absorbed water molecules and on the other hand by thin organic layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Thus it is known in the field to irradiate the masks prior to a wet cleaning thereof with UV radiation, while the mask is in a gas atmosphere such as nitrogen or an oxygen atmosphere. In this process often UV radiation having a wavelength of about 172 nm is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Such a UV radiation in a gas atmosphere may initiate several different processes such as an oxidation of hydrocarbons at the surface by atomic oxygen, an oxidation of metals at the surface of the substrate by atomic oxygen, the removal of hydrophilic molecular wet layers by photons, and the activation of adsorbed Ions by UV energy. In particular, a hydrophobic surface area may be changed into a hydrophilic surface area. The photons of the UV radiation, however, often impact unimpeded with high energy on the surface of the substrate. This may feed to stress forces and/or relaxation processes in the substrate, in particular in fine structures on the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">This may thus lead to the displacement of structures, which may negatively influence the usability of the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">It is further known to provide a wet treatment after such a preparation of the surface, in which a liquid film is at least locally formed on the substrate and UV radiation is introduced into the liquid film. In this process, the liquid and the UV radiation are matched such that a majority of the UV radiation is absorbed in the liquid film in order to generate radicals therein. In particular, it is known to generate hydroxyl radicals in for example diluted hydrogen peroxide water or ozone water O<sub>3</sub>—H<sub>2</sub>O. Such hydroxyl radicals cause selective dissolution of organic materials from the substrate surface without harming metallic on the substrate surface if they are present.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Such a method is for example disclosed in US 2006/0207629 A1. In particular, a thin liquid film made of for example ozone water, hydrogen peroxide water, ammonia water, a hydrogen peroxide solution, sulfuric acid, organic acids and mixtures thereof is applied. Then, UV radiation is introduced into the liquid film via a window which is transparent to UV radiation and which is in contact with the liquid film, in order to generate radicals. Again the UV radiation source and the liquid film are matched such that many radicals are generated, such that a high absorption rate, if possible a complete absorption, of the UV radiation occurs in the liquid film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">After the removal of the contaminations mentioned above, in particular of organic contaminations, it may be useful to also remove residual ions from the substrate surface. Known methods for this purpose usually use heated liquids, in particular deionized water (DI water) to rinse the surface. Here, the problem may arise that for a complete removal of residual ions either a longer application time of the liquid or a high temperature of the liquid is required. High temperatures may be problematic in that the heating process for the liquid may lead to contaminations therein. This is in particular true when the temperature is raised close to the boiling point of the respective liquid. In the treatment of temperature sensitive substrates or substrate layers it is furthermore possible that the solubility of the Ions is below the desired value. Prolonging application times for compensating for reduced temperatures is not desirable in view of efficiency considerations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Starting from the known treatment methods it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved apparatus and an improved method for the treatment of substrates. In accordance with one aspect of the invention the generation of a hydrophilic substrate surface should be improved. In accordance with a further aspect the cleaning of the substrate surface should be improved. In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention, the removal of ions from the substrate surface should be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with the present invention one or more of these aspects may solved by a method according to claim <b>1</b>, a method according to claim <b>14</b>, a method according to claims <b>27</b>, a method according to claim <b>32</b>, a method according to claim <b>37</b> or a device according to claim <b>42</b>. Further embodiments of the invention are claimed in the respective dependent claims.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">In particular, a method for cleaning of a substrate is provided, in which a liquid is applied to at least a partial area of said substrate, wherein prior to applying the liquid to the substrate, radicals are generated therein by means of UV radiation, and wherein the generation of said radicals occurs directly before applying the liquid to the substrate, such that at least a portion of the radicals reaches the substrate. At the same time, by pre-treating the liquid prior to applying the same to the substrate, it may be ensured that unwanted reactive components such as ozone are destroyed or substantially reduced before the liquid reaches the substrate surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">By generating the radicals directly before applying the liquid to the substrate it can be ensured by a targeted direction of flow of the medium having activated radicals therein, that at least a portion of these radicals reach the substrate and thus an improved cleaning of the substrate surface may be achieved. Preferably, UV radiation may also be introduced into a liquid film on the substrate formed by the activated liquid applied to the substrate and containing the radicals or precursors for radicals, in order to maintain the activation of the radicals and/or to generate further radicals. In so doing, the effective duration of the radicals in the liquid may b(c) prolonged, leading to an improved cleaning of the substrate surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">The UV radiation, which is introduced into the liquid prior to applying the same to the substrate and which is introduced into the liquid film on said substrate may at least partially be emitted by the same radiation source, thus simplifying the method. For a localized cleaning of surface areas of the substrate it is possible to limit the liquid containing the radicals to selected surface areas of the substrate to be cleaned.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">For generating the radicals UV radiation having for example a wavelength in the range of 140 nm to 280 nm, depending on the liquid in the range of 140 nm to 200 nm may be used, which has a high absorption rate in most of the liquids. Preferably, the UV radiation in the cited range of wavelength should be matched to the liquid such that at least 50% of this UV radiation, and in particular 80% thereof is absorbed in the liquid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">In one embodiment UV radiation is introduced into the liquid prior to applying the same to the substrate while the liquid flows along a UV radiation source, wherein on the one hand, the UV radiation is chosen such that it causes a destruction of the molecular structure of the liquid, in order to facilitate the directly subsequent generation of radicals possibly by UV radiation. The liquid is thus prepared for an efficient generation of radicals and undesired reactive components in the liquid are reduced or destroyed prior to the application of the liquid. Thus these components do not contact the substrate surface or do so only in a weaker form. This occurs for example by generating suited precursors and intermediate products while the liquid is in motion, because this dynamics facilitates and homogenizes the respective destruction or decomposition. The direction of flow of the liquid is chosen such that it flows towards the substrate and such that the generation of radicals occurs directly before applying the liquid to the substrate. By choosing a suited UV radiation, a pretreatrnent of the liquid on one hand and the generation of radicals on the other hand may be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">As the liquid is at least one of the following may be used: ozone water, hydrogen water, DI water, H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>—H<sub>2</sub>O, DI water having O2 gas dissolved therein, NH<sub>4</sub>OH, acetic acid, citric add, TMAH, HNO<sub>3</sub>, HCl, H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>or mixtures thereof. Furthermore, to as is known in the art, hydrogen peroxide solutions, sulfuric add or other organic acids may be used, wherein the decomposition of the media directly before the generation of the radicals may make superfluous the use of chemicals which require special disposal. The substrate may for example be one of the following: a photo mask for the manufacture of semiconductors, a semiconductor, in particular a Si-wafer, a Ge-wafer, a GaAs-wafer or an InP-wafer, a flat panel substrate and a multi layer ceramic substrate, or any other substrate to be cleaned which may for example be used in the manufacture of semiconductors. Such substrates may have different shapes and sizes. During the cleaning at least one of the following is at least partially removed from the substrate by the help of the radicals: carbon, hydrocarbons, organic contaminations as well as organic functional layers, such as positive resist, negative resist and ion implanted resist, embossing and imprint material, stress buffer and underfill materials, lacquers, dyes, bio materials and also bacteria.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">In accordance with a further aspect of the invention, a method for removing ions from the surface of a substrate and near surface layers of said substrate is provided, wherein a liquid which is heated above ambient temperature is applied onto said substrate, in order to form a liquid film on at least a partial area of said substrate, and wherein electromagnetic radiation is introduced into said liquid film such that at least a portion of said radiation reaches the surface of said substrate. The electromagnetic radiation thereby causes increased ion mobility when it hits residual ions on the substrate surface. Furthermore, the electromagnetic radiation may increase the temperature of the liquid and/or may generate radicals therein, when it is absorbed, both of which may facilitate the removal of ions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">In one embodiment, the liquid is heated at least partially by means of electromagnetic radiation immediately prior to and/or during the application thereof onto the substrate, thereby little energy losses occur, before the thus heated liquid reaches the substrate. Alternatively or additionally, the liquid may be delivered pre-heated to the point of use before applying electromagnetic radiation. The liquid may for example be to heated to a temperature in the range between ambient temperature and the boiling point of the liquid. It is also possible to conduct the method under increased pressure and thus heat the liquid to a higher temperature before it reaches the boiling point.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">As the liquid one of the following may for example be used: ozone water, hydrogen water, DI water, H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>—H<sub>2</sub>O, DI water having O<sub>2 </sub>gas dissolved therein or mixtures thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">In one embodiment UV radiation, in particular UV radiation having a wavelength above 190 nm is introduced into the liquid, at least 50% of which, in particular at least 80% of which reaches the interface between a surface of the substrate and the liquid film. Alternatively or additionally IR radiation may be introduced into the liquid film, which may for example be used for an in-situ heating of the liquid film. In this case at least 50% of the IR radiation should roach the interface between the surface of the substrate and the liquid film. The UV radiation and the IR radiation may be introduced via the same radiation source. At least a portion of the radiation may generate radicals in the liquid film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">According to a further aspect, a method for changing the surface characteristics of a substrate having an at least partially hydrophobic substrate surface is provided, in which at least a portion of said hydrophobic substrate surface gets an hydrophilic surface characteristic. To achieve this, a liquid is applied to at least the partial area of the substrate surface, whose surface characteristic is to be changed and UV radiation of a predetermined range of wavelength is guided through said liquid onto at least the partial area of the surface of said substrate, whose surface characteristic is to be changed. Due to absorption of in particular high energy short wave radiation in the liquid, problems with respect to stress forces in the area of the substrate surface may be substantially reduced or completely overcome. The liquid also facilitates the removal of the hydrophobic surface layer at low radiation energies compared to the dry condition, thus also enabling a further reduction of stress at the substrate surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">In order to achieve a good transmission through the liquid, the predetermined range wavelengths of the UV radiation is above 190 nm, wherein at least 80% of the UV radiation within said predetermined wavelength range should reach the surface of the substrate. As the liquid at least one of the following may be used: ozone water, hydrogen water, DI water, CO<sub>2</sub>-water or mixtures thereof. Other liquids may also be used. In particular, DI water may also be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">The different methods described above, may advantageously combined to a complete method, wherein individual ones of these methods are conducted sequentially and/or in parallel in the same or also changing liquids. In particular, it is possible to conduct these methods in a single apparatus without the need to handle the substrate between the individual methods.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">In accordance with another aspect, an apparatus for treating substrates is provided, comprising a substrate holder for receiving the substrate, a housing defining a flow chamber having an inlet and an outlet, a first radiation source, and a unit for generating a relative movement between said substrate holder and said housing. The first radiation source is arranged to emit radiation into said flow chamber and is further capable of emitting UV radiation. The unit for generating the relative movement is capable to arrange said housing with respect to said substrate holder such that the outlet is directed towards the substrate holder such that a liquid exiting the outlet directly flows onto a substrate on the substrate holder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">Such an apparatus enables the introduction of radiation, in particular UV radiation, into a liquid applied to a substrate via the first radiation source. This may for example be used, as described in the above methods, for generating precursors and intermediate products for the generation of radicals or directly for generating radicals in the liquid. It is, however, also possible to heat the liquid during the application thereof onto the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">It is possible that the first radiation source is arranged such that it also emits radiation through said outlet out of the housing. This enables introduction of radiation into the liquid not only prior to the application thereof onto the substrate but also, thereafter, to maintain an activation of radicals or to generate further radicals. Also, further heating of the liquid or maintaining the liquid at a temperature may be achieved. Furthermore, the same radiation source, which is used to introduce radiation into the liquid prior to the application thereof onto a substrate, may also be used in a simple manner to achieve changing a hydrophobic surface to a hydrophilic surface, or for the removal of ions from the substrate surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">In one embodiment, the first radiation source is at least partially arranged in said flow chamber. The housing may for example have an outlet opening in which the first radiation source may be at least partially arranged in the outlet opening, in particular, substantially in the middle thereof. The outlet opening and the first radiation source may have an extension in length which is greater or at least equal to an extension in width of the substrate to be cleaned, in order to enable a complete cleaning of the substrate during a single scanning movement of the housing relative to the substrate. In one embodiment, the first radiation source comprises a first lamp, which emits radiation in the UV range, wherein the first lamp may additionally emit radiation in the IR range. The first radiation source may additionally comprise at least a second lamp emitting radiation in a primarily different wavelength range than the first lamp. As an example, the second lamp may emit IR radiation, in case the first lamp does not emit IR radiation, or it may for example emit UV radiation in a different range of wavelengths. The radiation source may thus be matched to the requirements of a process by respectively controlling the first and second lamps. It is also possible that the first radiation source has further lamps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">According to one embodiment, a cover is provided between the first and/or second lamp and the flow chamber in the housing, wherein the at least one cover is substantially transparent to at least UV radiation. Such a cover enables replacement of individual lamps without the danger of introducing contaminations into the flow chamber. In this respect, the cover completely surrounds the first and/or second lamp at least in one plane. The material of the cover may for example be quartz.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">The first and/or second lamp may be a longitudinal or rod lamp, which may extend through the flow chamber and which may provide homogenous radiation throughout the same. The first lamp may inter alia emit UV radiation in the wavelength range between 140 nm and 280 nm, depending in on the liquid between 140 nm to 200 nm, and in one embodiment primarily, i.e. more than 50% of UV radiation in this wavelength range. The second lamp may for example emit radiation in the wavelength range over 180 nm and/or IR radiation. Hereby different process results may be achieved. The radiation above 180 nm may for example primarily cause a decomposition of certain liquids in the flow chamber, in order to subsequently facilitate a generation of radicals in the flow chamber by the radiation in the range between 140 and 280 nm, depending in on the liquid between 140 nm to 200 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">Additionally, at least one second radiation source may be provided outside the flow chamber of the housing such that it emits radiation into an area adjacent to the outlet of the housing. Such a radiation source would not primarily emit radiation into the flow chamber, but, if applicable, into a liquid film formed on a substrate by liquid exiting the flow chamber. The second radiation source may primarily emit radiation in a different wavelength range than the first radiation source, even though it is also contemplated that it emits substantially the same radiation. In particular, the second radiation source may emit UV radiation in the wavelength rang(c) above 180 nm and/or IR radiation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">A control unit may be provided, which is capable of individually and independently controlling the first and second radiation source and possibly of individual lamps thereof. This enables matching the introduction of radiation into the liquid applied to a substrate in accordance with the respective process requirements.</div>

In this manner, the main part <b>8</b> may be moved across a substrate <b>2</b>, which is received on said substrate holder <b>4</b>, in order to enable treatment of partial areas or the complete surface of said substrate.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">The rod lamps described above are each connected to a control unit, which is capable of controlling or driving the rod lamps individually and independently of the others. Rather than using rod lamps it is also possible to use other lamps/radiators which should, however, be capable of providing a substantially homogeneous radiation profile across the length of the flow chamber.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">In the following, operation of the apparatus <b>1</b> will be described in more detail with respect to the Figures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">For the treatment of a surface of the substrate <b>2</b>, the main part <b>8</b> of the application unit <b>6</b> will be moved over a substrate <b>2</b> on the substrate holder <b>4</b>. If the complete surface of the substrate should be treated the main part <b>8</b> may be moved during the treatment described here in below across the substrate, unless the embodiment according to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is used, which may completely cover the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">Then, a fluid, in particular a liquid is applied to at least the surfaces of the substrate to be treated via the fluid ports <b>16</b>, the conduits <b>24</b> and the flow chamber <b>22</b>. Radiation is introduced into said fluid via the first radiation sources <b>18</b> and/or the radiation sources <b>40</b>. The radiation is chosen such that it directly acts on the substrate, in order to treat the same and/or to act on the fluid for changing the characteristics thereof, in order to conduct the desired treatment. In so doing, different treatment possibilities for the surface of the substrate are given, which may be locally limited or may be conducted on the complete surface of the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">In the following, some of these treatment possibilities are explained in more detail without being limited to these examples. The treatment of a photo mask will be given as an example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">First changing of a surface characteristic of a substrate <b>2</b> having an at least partially hydrophobic substrate surface to a hydrophilic substrate surface is described. To achieve the same, a liquid such as DI water will be applied as a fluid via the flow chamber <b>22</b> onto the substrate surfaces to be treated, in order to form a liquid film on the substrate <b>2</b>. UV radiation will be introduced into this liquid film via the radiation sources <b>18</b> or <b>40</b>, wherein the liquid and the wave length range of the UV radiation are matched to each other, such that a substantial portion of the UV radiation reaches the interface between the liquid and the substrate surface. The UV radiation now acts to change the previously hydrophobic substrate surface to a hydrophilic surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">In order to obtain good transmission of the UV radiation through the liquid film, the wave length range of the UV radiation used here is for example above 190 nm. In order to provide such a wave length range, a corresponding rod lamp, which emits in this wave length range, may be controlled or driven, while possibly other lamps are not controlled or driven. When using the cited wave length range one of the following may be used as the liquid: ozone-water, hydrogen-water, DI water or mixtures thereof. Other liquids may also be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">Next, cleaning of substrate surface will be described which surface was for example treated to have a hydrophilic surface as described above, and which has contaminations, which may be better removed by interaction with radicals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">Here, again, a liquid is applied to the surfaces of the substrate <b>2</b> to be cleaned via the flow chamber <b>22</b>. While the liquid flows around the radiation source <b>18</b>, UV radiation is emitted into the liquid by the radiation source <b>18</b>. This radiation causes inter alia the generation of radicals in the liquid. This generation occurs directly before the liquid is applied to the substrate, such that at least a portion of the thus generated radicals, which have a very short decay time contact the substrate <b>2</b>. Since a radiation of the radiation source <b>18</b> is not limited to the flow chamber <b>22</b>, it is also introduced into a liquid film which is formed by the liquid on the substrate <b>2</b> and thus generates further radicals and/or partially maintains the activation of the already generated radicals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">By means of a corresponding movement of the application unit <b>6</b>, it is possible to selectively clean partial areas or the complete surface of the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">The liquid and the radiation introduced therein are again matched to each other in order to achieve the desired effect. For the generation of radicals, in particular UV radiation in the wave length range of 140 to 280 nm, depending in on the liquid between 140 nm to 200 nm is suited. The UV radiation in the cited wave length range may in particular be matched to the used liquid such that at least 50% of the UV radiation and in particular 80% thereof are absorbed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">Depending on the used liquid, the generation of radicals may also be facilitated by a UV induced decomposition of the liquid, which may occur while the liquid flows around the radiation source <b>18</b>. For this purpose, the UV radiation should be chosen on the one hand such that a destruction of the molecular structure of the liquid is caused, in order to facilitate a directly following generation of radicals also by means by UV radiation. UV radiation having a wave length above 180 nm is particularly suited for such decomposition. In the embodiment of the radiation source <b>18</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> it could thus be advantageous, if the upper rod lamp is one, which promotes the decomposition, i.e. emits UV light having a wave length above 180 nm, while the lower rod lamp is one, which promotes the generation of radicals, i.e. emits UV light having a wave length between 140 and 280 nm, depending in on the liquid between 140 nm to 200 nm. Taking DI-water as an example, the wavelength range between 140 nm to 200 nm may be suited for the generation of radicals, while for other liquids, a higher range of wavelength between 140 nm to 280 nm may be suited.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">These wave length ranges are obviously not binding and may vary depending on the liquid, but are applicable for many of the usually used liquids for cleaning photo masks such as: ozone-water, hydrogen-water, DI water, H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>—H<sub>2</sub>O, DI water having O<sub>2</sub>-gas dissolved therein, NH<sub>4</sub>OH, organic acids, TMAH, HNO<sub>3</sub>, HCl, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>or mixtures thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">Finally, a treatment is described in which ions are to be removed from the surface or near surface layers of the substrate <b>2</b>, which was for example treated as described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">For this treatment a liquid, which is heated above ambient temperature is applied via the flow chamber <b>22</b> onto the substrate, in order to form a liquid film on at least a partial area of the substrate <b>2</b>. Radiation is introduced into this liquid film via at least one of the radiation sources <b>18</b>, <b>40</b>, wherein the radiation and the liquid are matched to each other, such that at least a portion of the radiation reaches the substrate surface. The electromagnetic radiation causes increased ion mobility, when it hits residual ions on the substrate surface. Furthermore, the radiation, as long as it is absorbed in the liquid may also cause a temperature increase and/or the generation of radicals, which may both promote the removal of ions. In particular, the liquid may be heated directly during the application thereof, for example by means of radiation source having a high IR portion. Inasmuch as an increased temperature of the liquid also increases the solubility of the ions in the liquid, the liquid may be heated up to the boiling point thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">As a liquid for example one of the following liquids may be used: ozone-water, hydrogen-water, DI water, H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>—H<sub>2</sub>O, DI water having O<sub>2</sub>-gas dissolved therein, or mixtures thereof. DI water is particularly suited for higher temperatures. As the radiation, in particular UV radiation in the wave length range above 190 nm is suited, which is not so strongly absorbed and which promotes the desired effect of mobilizing and removing ions. IR radiation is also well suited, inasmuch it may provide an in-situ heating of the liquid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">The above treatments may be combined as desired and may be conducted sequentially as described or in part or completely simultaneously.</div>
