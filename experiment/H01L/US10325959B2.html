<div class="abstract">A pixel structure and an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display panel incorporating the pixel structure are disclosed. Each pixel unit (110) in the pixel structure includes a first sub-pixel (111), a second sub-pixel (112), a third sub-pixel (113) and two fourth sub-pixels (114). The second sub-pixel (112), the third sub-pixel (113) and the fourth sub-pixels (114) are arranged to define a quadrilateral encompassing the first sub-pixel (111) and be common to four adjacent pixel units (110). The first sub-pixel (111) serves as a primary display element, while each of the second sub-pixel (112), the third sub-pixel (113) and the fourth sub-pixels (114) acts as a secondary display element. As a result, a higher aperture ratio of the primary display element can be obtained at the same PPI and design margin, or an increased design margin and reduced process difficulty can be obtained at the same PPI and aperture ratio.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to the field of display technology and, in particular, to a pixel structure and an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display panel incorporating the pixel structure.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display panels are considered to have the most potential to be the next generation of new flat panel display technology thanks to their wide variety of outstanding advantages including active illumination, thinness, a large viewing angle, fast response, good energy-saving performance, a wide temperature tolerance range and capabilities of flexible and transparent display.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Currently, there are two well developed full-color techniques for OLED display panels: color filters (CF) and RGB (the three primary colors: red, green and blue) pixels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Like those used in liquid crystal display (LCD) panels, color filters can also be used in OLED display panels for the full-color effect. In these cases, white-light OLEDs serve as backlight playing the same role as both backlight and liquid crystal molecules in LCD panels, and color filters are placed thereon to form red, green and blue sub-pixels. In this way, the resolution and large panel requirements can be satisfied. However, as light loses significant energy when passing through the color filters, such display panels suffer from significant power consumption.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to address the high power consumption issue, full-color OLED display panels using RGB pixels have been utilized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically illustrates an existing OLED display panel utilizing RGB pixels. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the OLED display panel is formed in a paralleled RGB manner and has multiple pixel units Pixel each including, horizontally aligned, one red sub-pixel unit R, one green sub-pixel unit G and one blue sub-pixel unit B. The sub-pixel units in the OLED display panel are arranged in a matrix and each of them has a display section <b>1</b> and a non-display section <b>2</b>. Specifically, the display section <b>1</b> of each sub-pixel unit is provided with a cathode, an anode and an electroluminescent layer (organic emission layers) disposed between the cathode and the anode to generate light of the prescribed color so as to enable the display of an image. The electroluminescent layer is usually fabricated by vapor deposition. During the fabrication of the conventional display panel, three vapor deposition processes are carried out to form electroluminescent layers for the corresponding colors (red, green and blue) in the display sections <b>1</b> of the pixel units.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> schematically illustrates another existing OLED display panel utilizing RGB pixels. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the OLED display panel formed in an RGB matrix manner has multiple pixel units Pixel each including one red sub-pixel unit R, one green sub-pixel unit G and one blue sub-pixel unit B. Two out of these three sub-pixel units, for example, the red sub-pixel unit R and the green sub-pixel unit G, are arranged in a column, and the third sub-pixel unit, for example, the blue sub-pixel unit B, is disposed in another column. As such, the sub-pixel units in the OLED display panel are arranged in a matrix.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">As technology evolves, users are increasingly demanding for OLED display panels with higher resolution, and the conventional RGB pixel arrangements have fallen short in meeting the increasingly higher PPI (pixels per inch) requirements.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">As described in the Background section, the conventional RGB pixel arrangements have fallen short in meeting the increasingly higher PPI requirements. In view of this, it is proposed in the present invention a pixel structure for an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display panel, comprising a plurality of pixel units arranged in an array, each including a first sub-pixel, a second sub-pixel, a third sub-pixel and two fourth sub-pixels. The second, third and fourth sub-pixels define a quadrilateral encompassing the first sub-pixel (i.e., the first sub-pixel is within the quadrilateral) and are common to four adjacent pixel units. The first sub-pixel is a primary display element, while the second, third and fourth sub-pixels are secondary display elements. This arrangement allows a higher aperture ratio of the sub-pixels acting as the primary display elements and a longer life span of them at the same PPI and design margin, or an increased design margin, reduced process difficulty and an improved yield at the same PPI and aperture ratio.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">Presented above is the basis concept of the present application. The subject matter of specific embodiments of the present invention will be fully described with reference to the drawings accompanying the embodiments so that it will be more apparent. Obviously, the disclosed embodiments are only some rather than all embodiments of the invention. All other embodiments made by those of ordinary skill in the art based on the embodiments disclosed herein without inventive efforts fall within the scope of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">Although numerous specific details are set forth below to facilitate a thorough understanding of the present invention, the invention can also be implemented in other ways than those described herein and those skilled in the art can make similar forms thereof without departing from the spirit of the present invention. Therefore, the present invention is not limited to the specific embodiments disclosed below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">The present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. In order to facilitate the following detailed description, the sectional views of the device structure may not be drawn to scale with parts showing some elements being enlarged. These schematics are provided merely for example and shall not be deemed as limiting the scope of the invention. Further, in practical fabrication, three-dimensional dimensions of the components, i.e., their lengths, widths and depths shall also be taken into account.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">The pixel structure and the OLED display panel incorporating the pixel structure will be described in details with reference to the embodiments described below. For the sake of clarity and brevity, the positions of the sub-pixels are described with respect to their centers. However, the present invention is not limited to this, and it is to be understood by those skilled in the art that the positions of the sub-pixels may also be described with respect to their apexes or other references.</div>
<heading id="h-0006">Embodiment 1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic illustrating part of a pixel structure in an OLED display panel according to a first embodiment of the present invention. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic illustration of four pixel units in the pixel structure of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic illustration of one pixel unit in the pixel structure of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 5</figref>, the pixel structure of the OLED display panel includes a plurality of pixel units <b>110</b> arranged in an array, each comprising five sub-pixels including a first sub-pixel <b>111</b>, a second sub-pixel <b>112</b>, a third sub-pixel <b>113</b> and two fourth sub-pixels <b>114</b>. The first sub-pixel <b>111</b> is dedicated to the specific pixel unit <b>110</b>, while the second sub-pixel <b>112</b>, the third sub-pixel <b>113</b> and the fourth sub-pixels <b>114</b> are common to the four adjacent pixel units. The first sub-pixel <b>111</b> is a primary display element and its PPI represents the PPI of the display device. The rest four sub-pixels all serve as secondary display elements configured only for coloring without contribution to lighting and can therefore be made smaller than their traditional counterparts, saving more space for the primary display element. This arrangement enables, on the one hand, an increased aperture ratio of the sub-pixels and hence a longer life span of them at the same PPI and design margin, and on the other hand, an increased design margin and reduced process difficulty at the same PPI and aperture ratio because the size-reduced sub-pixels acting as the secondary display elements allow greater pixel-to-pixel spacings favorable to the reliability of organic emission layer deposition processes utilizing fine metal masks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">The second sub-pixel <b>112</b>, the third sub-pixel <b>113</b> and the two fourth sub-pixels <b>114</b> define a quadrilateral, for example, a square as indicated by the square dashed box in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The second sub-pixel <b>112</b> and the third sub-pixel <b>113</b> are located at two opposing corners P<b>1</b>, P<b>3</b> of the quadrilateral (i.e., two apexes on a diagonal of the quadrilateral), while the two fourth sub-pixels <b>114</b> are situated at the other two opposing corners P<b>2</b>, P<b>4</b> of the quadrilateral (i.e., the two apexes on the other diagonal thereof). The second sub-pixel <b>112</b>, the third sub-pixel <b>113</b> and the fourth sub-pixels <b>114</b> surround the first sub-pixel <b>111</b>. That is, the first sub-pixel <b>111</b> is within the quadrilateral.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">With emphasized reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in this embodiment, the first sub-pixel <b>111</b> is located on the midpoint of a line segment connecting the nearest second sub-pixel <b>112</b> and third sub-pixel <b>113</b> and also on the midpoint of a line segment connecting the nearest two fourth sub-pixels <b>114</b>. In other words, the first sub-pixel <b>111</b> resides right at the center of the square dashed box. It is a matter of course that the first sub-pixel <b>111</b> is not limited to this location, and for example, it may be not located on the line segment connecting the nearest second sub-pixel <b>112</b> and the third sub-pixel <b>113</b> or not located on the line segment connecting the nearest fourth sub-pixels <b>114</b>. In fact, the first sub-pixel <b>111</b> may be located any other position in the quadrilateral than the center thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">In this embodiment, the first, second, third and fourth sub-pixel <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>114</b> in the pixel structure each assume a quadrilateral shape. In particular, the first sub-pixel <b>111</b> is a rectangle, while each of the second, third and fourth sub-pixel <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>114</b> is a square. Further, the long sides of the first sub-pixel <b>111</b> are oriented parallel to the line segment connecting centers of the nearest second and third sub-pixel <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, and its short sides extend parallel to the line segment connecting the two adjacent fourth sub-pixels <b>114</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">Furthermore, every two adjacent imaginary square boxes have a common side, for example, the imaginary sides L<b>1</b>, L<b>2</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The first sub-pixels <b>111</b> of every two adjacent pixel units are in mirror symmetry with respect to the common side of the two corresponding imaginary square boxes, on which centers of the second sub-pixel <b>112</b> and the fourth sub-pixel <b>114</b> both nearest to both of the first sub-pixels <b>111</b> are located. Herein, the phase “mirror symmetry” means that the two first sub-pixels <b>111</b> are of the same shape but oriented toward different directions. Every two adjacent second sub-pixels <b>112</b> are in exact symmetry with respect to a line segment connecting centers of the two third sub-pixels <b>113</b> both nearest to both of the specific second sub-pixels <b>112</b>, every two adjacent third sub-pixel <b>113</b> are in exact symmetry with respect to a line segment connecting centers of the two second sub-pixel <b>112</b> both nearest to both of the specific third sub-pixel <b>113</b>, and every two adjacent fourth sub-pixels <b>114</b> are in exact symmetry with respect to a line segment connecting centers of the second sub-pixel <b>112</b> and third sub-pixel <b>113</b> both nearest to both of the specific fourth sub-pixels <b>114</b>. Here, the phrase “exact symmetry” means that the two sub-pixels are identical to each other in terms of shape and orientation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">While the first, second, third and fourth sub-pixels <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>114</b> have been described above as each having a quadrilateral shape as an example, it is to be noted that in other embodiments of the present invention, the first, second, third and fourth sub-pixels <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>114</b> may also have one or more of many other polygonal shapes such as triangular, pentagonal, hexagonal, heptagonal and octagonal, and the long sides of the first sub-pixel <b>111</b> may also not be parallel to the line segment connecting the centers of the second and third sub-pixels <b>112</b>, <b>113</b> and, for example, form a certain angle therewith.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">With continued reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, in this embodiment, the second and third sub-pixels <b>112</b>, <b>113</b> have the same area, the fourth sub-pixels <b>114</b> each have an area smaller than the area of the second and third sub-pixels <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, and the first sub-pixel <b>111</b> has an area smaller than the area of the fourth sub-pixels <b>114</b>. In this embodiment, the first sub-pixel <b>111</b> has the smallest area among the other sub-pixels due to the consideration that each of the other sub-pixels is common to the four adjacent pixel units. However, it is noted that the present invention is not limited to any specific area of any of the sub-pixels, and the first, second, third and fourth sub-pixels <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>114</b> may have the same area or not, and their areas may be adjusted according to the specific coloring requirements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the first sub-pixel <b>111</b> is spaced apart from each adjacent first sub-pixel <b>111</b> by a distance D<b>1</b>, from the second sub-pixel <b>112</b> by a distance D<b>2</b>, from the third sub-pixel <b>113</b> by a distance D<b>3</b>, and from each of the fourth sub-pixels <b>114</b> by a distance D<b>4</b>. The first sub-pixel <b>111</b> serves as a primary display element, and the second, third and fourth sub-pixels <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>114</b> all function as secondary display elements that are configured only for coloring without contribution to lighting and can therefore be made smaller than their traditional counterparts, saving more space for the primary display element. At the same PPI and aperture ratio as the traditional arrangements, shrinkage of the sub-pixels serving as the secondary display elements enables increases in the distances between the sub-pixels, for example, D<b>2</b>, D<b>3</b> and D<b>4</b>, the reliability of organic emission layer deposition processes utilizing fine metal masks can be improved. That is, the design margin of the panel device can be enhanced with reduced the process difficulty.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">In this embodiment, in each odd-numbered row, the second and third sub-pixels <b>112</b>, <b>113</b> are alternately arranged, for example, along the first imaginary line X<b>1</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, with the first sub-pixels <b>111</b> interposed therebetween, and in each even-numbered row, the first and fourth sub-pixels <b>114</b> are alternately arranged, for example, along the second imaginary line X<b>2</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.

In other embodiments of the present invention, the second and third sub-pixels <b>112</b>, <b>113</b> may be transposed. In other words, in each odd-numbered row, the first and fourth sub-pixels <b>111</b>, <b>114</b> are alternately arranged, and in each even-numbered row, the second and third sub-pixels <b>112</b>, <b>113</b> are alternately arranged with the first sub-pixels <b>111</b> interposed therebetween.

It is to be appreciated that <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows only part of the pixel structure in the OLED display panel for the sake of brevity, and the pixel structure may actually include more columns and/or more rows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">In one embodiment, the first sub-pixel <b>111</b> is adapted to emit yellow or white light and, to this end, includes an organic emission layer for emitting yellow or white light; the second sub-pixel <b>112</b> is adapted to emit red light and, to this end, includes an organic emission layer for emitting red light; the third sub-pixel <b>113</b> is adapted to emit blue light and, to this end, includes an organic emission layer for emitting blue light; and the fourth sub-pixels <b>114</b> are adapted to emit green light and, to this end, includes respective organic emission layers for emitting green light. It is to be appreciated that these light-emitting functions can be interchanged among the sub-pixels, provided that the first, second, third and fourth sub-pixels <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>114</b> include at least sub-pixels for emitting red, green and blue light. In other words, the first, second, third and fourth sub-pixels <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>114</b> may emit light of distinct colors, for example, yellow, red, green and blue, or white red, green and blue, as described above.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">An OLED display panel according to this embodiment incorporates the pixel structure according to Embodiment 1, 2 or 3.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">In one embodiment, the first, second, third and fourth sub-pixels <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>114</b> are provided with power lines for driving individual pixels, for example, gate lines, data lines, driving power lines, etc. In addition, they are also provided with insulating layers for limiting the individual sub-pixels, for example, pixel limiting layers. Further, in one embodiment, OLEDs for the individual first, second, third and fourth sub-pixels <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>114</b> are included, each including an anode, an organic emission layer and a cathode. The shapes of the individual pixels are defined by the corresponding power lines, pixel limiting layers and anodes. This is well-known to those skilled in this art and will not be described in greater detail for the sake of brevity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">The organic emission layers in the pixels of the OLED display panel may be fabricated by deposition processes in which masks (e.g., fine metal masks (FMMs)) are used. Reducing the spacings between the pixels can lead to an increase in the aperture ratio of the pixels but a reduction in the reliability of the deposition processes. On the other hand, while greater pixel-to-pixel spacings can enhance the reliability of the deposition processes, they can lead to a lower aperture ratio of the pixels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">Different from the traditional RGB pixel arrangements, in the present invention, the second, third and fourth sub-pixels each acting as a secondary display element define a quadrilateral encompassing the first sub-pixel which serves as a primary display element. The secondary display elements are configured only for coloring while not contributing to lighting and can thus be reduced in size compared to their traditional counterparts to save more space for the primary display element. This arrangement can enable, on the one hand, a higher aperture ratio of the sub-pixels serving as the primary display elements and hence a longer service life of the OLED display panel at the same PPI and design margin, and on the other hand, an increased design margin and reduced process difficulty at the same PPI and aperture ratio because the size-reduced sub-pixels acting as the secondary display elements allow greater pixel-to-pixel spacings favorable to the reliability of organic emission layer deposition processes utilizing fine metal masks.</div>
