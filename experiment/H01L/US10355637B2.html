<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">The following description and drawings are illustrative and are not to be construed as limiting. Numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding. However, in certain instances, well known or conventional details are not described in order to avoid obscuring the description. References to one or an embodiment in the present disclosure are not necessarily references to the same embodiment; and, such references mean at least one.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">In one embodiment, each solar panel (or photovoltaic panel) is connected to other panels via a local management unit. Each local management unit manages one solar panel and thus represents the solar panel. The connectivity topology of the local management units thus represents the connectivity topology of the solar panels in the system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment, the local management units are used in the automated detection of the connectivity topology of the local management units and thus the connectivity topology of the solar panels. Thus, for example, if errors were made in the installation, the automated detection of the connectivity topology can be used to detect the errors. Further, the connectivity topology of the local management units provides information about the strings on which the local management units are located and/or the sequences in which the local management units are connected, both electrically and physically. Such information can be used in various applications.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">One embodiment provides a system and method for determining a connectivity topology of one or more local management units (LMU) in a solar photovoltaic power generation (SPVPG) system using, for example, indirect indications of connections of an LMU and the SPVPG and indications of the physical location of the LMU with respect to other elements of the SPVPG.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">As used herein, the term “connectivity topology” refers to information about how components are connected within an SPVPG system, without specific regard to a particular level of detail of the mapping. For example, a connectivity topology may be created with a first level of detail and then revised to a second level of detail. Furthermore, a connectivity topology may be created with a level of detail at a particular level that is less than a complete description of all connections (and/or their order) within an SPVPG system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">In an SPVPG system, LMUs may be connected in configurations, such as, for example, serial, parallel and a combination thereof, as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/691,692. As another example, the SPVPG system may control LMUs within the SPVPG as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/840,228. The contents of the above-discussed patent applications and publications are incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an exemplary SPVPG system with a number of inverters, according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The SPVPG system <b>100</b> includes a connection to an alternating current (AC) grid <b>101</b> and multiple inverters <b>110</b> <i>a</i>-<i>n </i>adapted to invert direct current (DC) from combiner boxes <b>111</b> <i>a</i>-<b>111</b> <i>n </i>into AC for delivery to the AC grid. Each of the inverters <b>110</b> <i>a</i>-<i>n </i>may have its own communication interface <b>114</b> <i>a</i>-<i>n </i>adapted for communicating information relating to the operations of the inverter to, for example, the master management unit (MMU) <b>120</b>, other portions of the SPVPG system and/or the Internet <b>122</b>. The SPVPG system generates power via solar (e.g., photovoltaic or PV) panels <b>112</b> <i>aa</i> <b>1</b>-<b>112</b> <i>nnn</i>. Optionally each panel may include an LMU <b>113</b> <i>aa</i> <b>1</b>-<b>113</b> <i>nnn</i>. The SPVPG system may include an MMU <b>120</b>, which may contain an MMU software instance <b>121</b>, either or both of which may also be coupled or connected to the Internet <b>122</b>. In this description, the Internet <b>122</b> is used as an exemplary communications network and another network may also be used alone or in combination such as, for example, a wired network, power-line network, radio network, wireless network, 802.11 network, infrared network, ultrasound network, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">While communication interfaces <b>114</b> <i>a</i>-<i>n </i>are shown for each inverter, it should be understood that other configurations are possible, including using multiple connections and communications protocols to allow the components of the SPVPG system <b>100</b> to communicate with one another. Exemplary communications between components of the SPVPG system <b>100</b> include transmitting and receiving operational data, as well as transmitting, receiving, and confirming instructions and/or commands. As described further herein, exemplary communications may be used to determine or ascertain the topology or configurations of components of the SPVPG system <b>100</b>. Any suitable network technology or combination of network technologies may be used including, but not limited to, wired, over power lines, wireless radio, radio, wireless, 802.11, infrared, ultrasound, etc., including the multiple variations of protocols of each technology.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment, the MMU <b>120</b> is in communication with the SPVPG system <b>100</b> and receives data from components of the SPVPG system, whether in response to a specific request or as part of a polling/reporting protocol. In one embodiment, more than one MMU <b>120</b> may be present (e.g., in very large systems), and each of the MMUs <b>120</b> may be networked directly to one another, or via the Internet <b>122</b> or other network connections, if present, or both. The MMU <b>120</b> may issue instructions or commands to control each of the LMUs <b>113</b> <i>aaa</i>-<b>113</b> <i>nnn </i>through the communications channels with the SPVPG system components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">LMUs <b>113</b> may connect the PV panels <b>112</b> in an SPVPG system <b>100</b> in many different ways. In one embodiment, particularly in system configurations utilizing serial connections, each panel <b>112</b> has an LMU <b>113</b> which connects the corresponding panel <b>112</b> to a series power bus (e.g., a string of LMUs). The LMU <b>113</b> may be used to monitor and control the power output from the corresponding panel <b>112</b>. For example, the LMU <b>113</b> may contain circuitry to measure various operating parameters (such as power output, temperature, voltage, current) of the respective solar panel unit(s) and may connect, disconnect and/or pulse-width modulate the power from the corresponding panel <b>112</b>. In one embodiment, an LMU <b>113</b> may contain a communicator or communications device to transmit the operating parameters and to receive instructions, for example, from an MMU <b>120</b> or other controller. In another embodiment, described further herein, an LMU may contain a communicator or communications device that may be used, at least in part, to provide an indication of the location of the LMU relative to other parts of the SPVPG system <b>100</b>. In one embodiment, particularly in system configurations utilizing parallel connections, an LMU <b>113</b> may contain a DC to DC step-up converting device for connecting the solar panel unit(s) monitored and controlled by the LMU to a parallel bus. In one embodiment, the LMU <b>113</b> may contain a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) device and/or may perform maximum power point (MPP) tracking functions. In another embodiment, the LMU <b>113</b> may communicate with another controller, such as the MMU <b>120</b>, to allow the other controller to monitor and instruct the LMU to adjust the operation point of the corresponding PV panel <b>112</b> (e.g., to track the MPP). For example, the LMU <b>113</b> may communicate operational parameters to an MMU <b>120</b> that may select or compute an operation point for the LMU <b>113</b> and/or perform the MPP tracking functions (e.g., via instructing the LMU to adjust how the solar panel unit(s) are operated to track the MPP of the solar panel unit(s)). Various configurations and functions of the LMUs are described in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 12/392,042, 12/612,641, 12/411,317 (now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 7,602,080), and Ser. No. 12/840,228, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">An SPVPG system <b>100</b> may be arranged differently in many possible embodiments of varied complexity and size. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> indicates this exemplary range of possible complexities and sizes of the SPVPG system <b>100</b> via vertical interruption lines, horizontal interruption lines and through ellipsis. The exemplary SPVPG system <b>100</b> is arranged using strings of panels <b>112</b>. An exemplary string of panels is the string on the left of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, namely panels <b>112</b> <i>aa</i> <b>1</b>-<b>112</b> <i>aab. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">In one embodiment, a string local management unit (SLMU) is used to control the output of an individual string, and some SPVPG systems may include an SLMU for each string. In one embodiment, the SLMU(s) may be contained within the combiner box <b>111</b>. In one embodiment, the SLMU may be contained separately from the combiner box <b>111</b>. In one embodiment, the SLMU includes a DC to DC converting device to convert the DC voltage of a string to a parallel bus DC voltage before it is combined by the combiner box <b>111</b>. The DC to DC conversion may be performed by the DC to DC converting device contained in an SLMU based on communication with the MMU <b>120</b>. Alternatively, the SLMU may include a stand-alone DC to DC converting device. Configurations of SLMUs, combiner boxes, panels and strings of panels are described in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 12/691,692, 12/628,977, and 12/612,641, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">After conversion of the DC voltage of each string to a DC voltage compatible with the parallel bus, there may be several strings of panels <b>112</b> connected to a combiner box <b>111</b> that may connect each string in parallel to a single DC bus that is connected to an inverter <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, SLMUs are not used. The inverter <b>110</b> connects to the DC bus from the combiner box <b>111</b> and to the AC grid <b>101</b>, inverting the power received from the DC bus into alternating current for placement onto the AC grid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">The operations of MPP tracking may be performed by several types of components in an SPVPG system, and these components may be broadly referred to as MPPT devices to describe their function of performing MPP tracking, regardless of any other functions the components may perform in the SPVPG system. In some instances, an MPPT device may be simply referred to as an inverter due to the presence of MPPT devices and/or functionality present in inverters. However, this description should not limit the understanding from this disclosure that inverters are one of several types of components that may include MPPT devices and/or functionality. For example, LMU devices may contain MPPT devices and/or functionality.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">Different variations of elements of the SPVPG systems and components in some embodiments are discussed in other applications, including, for example, U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/335,566, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/411,317 (now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 7,602,080), Ser. Nos. 12/612,641 and 12/628,977, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. For example, in one embodiment, each photovoltaic panel <b>112</b> <i>aa</i> <b>1</b>-<b>112</b> <i>nnn </i>may have its own LMU <b>113</b>. In another embodiment, each string of panels (e.g., <b>112</b> <i>aa</i> <b>1</b>-<b>112</b> <i>aab</i>) may have a single LMU associated with the string, namely a string local management unit (SLMU), at its end controlling the string of panels. In another embodiment, an LMU may be configured to control the operation of a different grouping of multiple panels <b>112</b>. In addition, any SPVPG system <b>100</b> may include different and varied distributions of LMUs <b>113</b> throughout the system. In one embodiment, each of the strings connected to the combiner box (e.g., <b>111</b> <i>a</i>) has only one panel. In one embodiment, each of the strings connected to the combiner box (e.g., <b>111</b> <i>a</i>) has a plurality of panels connected in series. In one embodiment, a single string of panels (e.g., <b>112</b> <i>aa</i> <b>1</b>-<i>n</i>) is connected directly to the inverter <b>110</b> <i>a </i>without the combiner box (e.g., <b>111</b> <i>a</i>) (and the other strings).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows an exemplary portion of an SPVPG system <b>200</b> with an exemplary embodiment of a configuration of LMUs and connections between the LMUs and other portions of the SPVPG. As described further herein, systems and processes may be unaware of a particular configuration or connectivity topology of portions of an SPVPG system. For example, the LMUs of the portion of the SPVPG may be connected to a string in an unknown order or configuration (e.g., serial, parallel, a combination thereof) and/or may be connected to different strings and/or different parts of the system. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the SPVPG system <b>200</b> is built from a few components, including photovoltaic modules (<b>201</b> <i>a</i>, <b>201</b> <i>b</i>, . . . , <b>201</b> <i>n</i>), LMUs (<b>202</b> <i>a</i>, <b>202</b> <i>b</i>, . . . , <b>202</b> <i>n</i>), an inverter (<b>203</b>), and an MMU (<b>204</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">In one embodiment, the master management unit (<b>204</b>) is part of the inverter (<b>203</b>), the combiner box (<b>206</b>), an LMU, or a stand-alone unit. The solar modules (<b>201</b> <i>a</i>, <b>201</b> <i>b</i>, . . . , <b>201</b> <i>n</i>) are connected in parallel to the LMUs (<b>202</b> <i>a</i>, <b>202</b> <i>b</i>, . . . , <b>202</b> <i>n</i>) respectively, which are connected in series to form a string bus (<b>205</b>), which eventually is connected to the inverter (<b>203</b>) and the management unit (<b>204</b>). The solar module (<b>201</b> <i>a</i>), for example, is connected to the LMU (<b>202</b> <i>a</i>) by the terminals of the LMU (<b>382</b>, <b>384</b>, <b>386</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, in one embodiment, the terminal that connects to the panel voltage and the string voltage is connected to the depicted left connection between the solar module (<b>201</b> <i>a</i>) and the LMU (<b>202</b> <i>a</i>) and connected to the depicted left connection between the LMU (<b>202</b> <i>a</i>) and the string bus (<b>205</b>). The terminal that is connected to the panel voltage is connected to the depicted right connection between the between the solar module (<b>201</b> <i>a</i>) and the LMU (<b>202</b> <i>a</i>). The terminal that is connected to the string voltage is connected to the depicted right connection between the LMU (<b>202</b> <i>a</i>) and the string bus (<b>205</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the string bus (<b>205</b>) can be connected to the inverter (<b>203</b>) directly or as part of a mesh network or combiner boxes or fuse boxes (not shown). An isolated LMU can be used as a combiner box (<b>206</b>) to adjust all voltages before connecting to the inverter (<b>203</b>); or, a single or multi-string inverter can be used. To limit the changes in the voltage of the string bus (<b>205</b>), the master management unit (<b>204</b>) can assign a different phase for each of the LMUs (<b>202</b> <i>a</i>, <b>202</b> <i>b</i>, . . . , <b>202</b> <i>n</i>). In one embodiment, at any given time, a maximum of a predetermined number of solar modules (e.g., one single solar module) are disconnected from the string bus (<b>205</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">In one embodiment, beyond the module connection, the LMUs can have signal inputs, including but not limited to duty cycle, phase and synchronization pulse (e.g., to keep the LMUs synchronized). In one embodiment, the phase and the synchronization pulse are used to further improve performance, but the LMUs can work without them.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">In one embodiment, the LMU (<b>202</b>) can provide output signals. For example, the LMU (<b>202</b>) can measure current and voltage at the module side and optionally measure current and voltage in the string side. The LMU (<b>202</b>) can provide other suitable signals, including but not limited to measurements of light, temperature (both ambient and module), etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">In one embodiment, the output signals from the LMU (<b>202</b>) are transmitted over the power line (e.g., via power line communication (PLC)), or transmitted wirelessly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">In one embodiment, the MMU (<b>204</b>) receives sensor inputs from light sensor(s), temperature sensor(s), one or more each for ambient, solar module or both, to control the SPVGP system (<b>200</b>). In one embodiment, the signals can also include synchronization signals. For example, an LMU can send synchronization signals periodically to set the timing values, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">Using the described methods, the LMU can be a very non-expensive and reliable device that can easily increase the throughput of a photovoltaic solar system by a few (e.g., signal or low double digits) percentage points. These varied controls also allow installers using this kind of system to control the VOC (open circuit voltage) by, for example, shutting off some or all modules. For example, by using the LMUs of the system, a few modules can be disconnected from a string if a string is getting to the regulatory voltage limit, and thus more modules can be installed in a string.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, LMUs can also be used within the solar panel to control the connection of solar cells attached to strings of cells within the solar panel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a solar array along with an inverter and a string combiner. In the illustrated embodiment, the solar array (<b>200</b>) includes three string buses (<b>205</b> <i>a</i>, <b>205</b> <i>b</i>, <b>205</b> <i>c</i>), although one or more string buses (<b>205</b> <i>a</i>, <b>205</b> <i>b</i>, <b>205</b> <i>c</i>) can also be used. The string buses enable a series connection of solar modules (<b>201</b> <i>a</i>, <b>201</b> <i>b</i>, . . . , <b>201</b> <i>n</i>). Coupled between each solar module (<b>201</b> <i>a</i>, <b>201</b> <i>b</i>, . . . <b>201</b> <i>n</i>) and its corresponding string bus (<b>205</b> <i>a</i>, <b>205</b> <i>b</i>, <b>205</b> <i>c</i>), is an LMU (<b>202</b> <i>a</i>, <b>202</b> <i>b</i>, . . . , <b>202</b> <i>n</i>). The LMUs (<b>202</b> <i>a</i>, <b>202</b> <i>b</i>, . . . , <b>202</b> <i>n</i>) are controlled by a controller (<b>204</b>). The controller (<b>204</b>) can communicate wirelessly with the LMUs (<b>202</b> <i>a</i>, <b>202</b> <i>b</i>, . . . , <b>202</b> <i>n</i>) or via wireless repeaters. In an embodiment (not illustrated), wired connections between the controller (<b>204</b>) and the LMUs (<b>202</b> <i>a</i>, <b>202</b> <i>b</i>, . . . , <b>202</b> <i>n</i>) can be implemented. String bus (<b>205</b> <i>a</i>, <b>205</b> <i>b</i>, <b>205</b> <i>c</i>) outputs are connected at an inverter (<b>203</b>) or in an optional string combiner (<b>206</b>). The controller (<b>204</b>) can be configured to balance current outputs from the solar modules on a string bus (<b>205</b> <i>a</i>, <b>205</b> <i>b</i>, <b>205</b> <i>c</i>). This can be done for each string bus (<b>205</b> <i>a</i>, <b>205</b> <i>b</i>, <b>205</b> <i>c</i>). Once the current outputs from solar modules (<b>201</b> <i>a</i>, <b>201</b> <i>b</i>, . . . , <b>201</b> <i>n</i>) on a string bus (<b>205</b> <i>a</i>, <b>205</b> <i>b</i>, <b>205</b> <i>c</i>) are balanced (weak solar module currents are raised to the level of strong solar module currents within a string), the controller (<b>204</b>) can balance the current outputs from the string buses (<b>205</b> <i>a</i>, <b>205</b> <i>b</i>, <b>205</b> <i>c</i>) (strong string bus voltages are lowered to the level of weak string bus voltages, which in turn raise strong string bus currents and hence the solar array current). This process can be repeated, or an inverter (<b>203</b>) can then attempt to determine the MPPT for the solar array (<b>200</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">A “solar array” typically comprises two or more solar modules series-connected via a string bus where the output voltage is a sum of the voltages of the series-connected solar modules. In larger solar arrays, string buses can be connected in parallel such that their currents add. A combiner and inverter are not part of the solar array.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">Balancing current outputs of solar modules (<b>201</b> <i>a</i>, <b>201</b> <i>b</i>, . . . , <b>201</b> <i>n</i>) on a string bus (<b>205</b> <i>a</i>, <b>205</b> <i>b</i>, <b>205</b> <i>c</i>) will now be discussed in more depth. The controller (<b>204</b>) can be configured to balance the currents produced by the solar modules (<b>201</b> <i>a</i>, <b>201</b> <i>b</i>, . . . , <b>201</b> <i>n</i>) on a given string bus (<b>205</b> <i>a</i>, <b>205</b> <i>b</i>, <b>205</b> <i>c</i>), and perform this balancing for each string bus (<b>205</b> <i>a</i>, <b>205</b> <i>b</i>, <b>205</b> <i>c</i>). As a result, the currents from the solar modules (<b>201</b> <i>a</i>, <b>201</b> <i>b</i>, . . . , <b>201</b> <i>n</i>) on a string bus (<b>205</b> <i>a</i>, <b>205</b> <i>b</i>, <b>205</b> <i>c</i>) can be balanced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">In order to balance solar modules (<b>201</b> <i>a</i>, <b>201</b> <i>b</i>, . . . , <b>201</b> <i>n</i>) on a string bus (<b>205</b> <i>a</i>, <b>205</b> <i>b</i>, <b>205</b> <i>c</i>), it can be useful to identify strong solar modules (<b>201</b> <i>a</i>, <b>201</b> <i>b</i>, . . . , <b>201</b> <i>n</i>) and weak solar modules (<b>201</b> <i>a</i>, <b>201</b> <i>b</i>, . . . , <b>201</b> <i>n</i>). This is done by varying the current on a string bus (<b>205</b> <i>a</i>, <b>205</b> <i>b</i>, <b>205</b> <i>c</i>), monitoring the resulting change in voltage in each solar module (<b>201</b> <i>a</i>, <b>201</b> <i>b</i>, . . . , <b>201</b> <i>n</i>), and comparing the changes in voltage on each solar module (<b>201</b> <i>a</i>, <b>201</b> <i>b</i>, . . . , <b>201</b> <i>n</i>) to identify strong solar modules (<b>201</b> <i>a</i>, <b>201</b> <i>b</i>, . . . , <b>201</b> <i>n</i>) and weak solar modules (<b>201</b> <i>a</i>, <b>201</b> <i>b</i>, . . . , <b>201</b> <i>n</i>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">Varying the current on the string bus (<b>205</b> <i>a</i>, <b>205</b> <i>b</i>, <b>205</b> <i>c</i>) can involve the inverter (<b>203</b>) pulling a different current from the string bus (<b>205</b> <i>a</i>, <b>205</b> <i>b</i>, <b>205</b> <i>c</i>). It can involve varying an impedance seen by the string bus (<b>205</b> <i>a</i>, <b>205</b> <i>b</i>, <b>205</b> <i>c</i>). For instance, the inverter (<b>203</b>) can vary the impedance that the string bus (<b>205</b> <i>a</i>, <b>205</b> <i>b</i>, <b>205</b> <i>c</i>) sees, and in doing so will vary the current and voltage produced by the solar modules (<b>201</b> <i>a</i>, <b>201</b> <i>b</i>, . . . , <b>201</b> <i>n</i>) on the string bus (<b>205</b> <i>a</i>, <b>205</b> <i>b</i>, <b>205</b> <i>c</i>). In other words, pulling a different current or changing the impedance changes the location on the I-V curve at which each solar module (<b>201</b> <i>a</i>, <b>201</b> <i>b</i>, . . . , <b>201</b> <i>n</i>) operates. Since current for devices connected in series is the same, a change in current on the string bus (<b>205</b> <i>a</i>, <b>205</b> <i>b</i>, <b>205</b> <i>c</i>) causes the same change in current for each solar module (<b>201</b> <i>a</i>, <b>201</b> <i>b</i>, . . . , <b>201</b> <i>n</i>) on the string bus (<b>205</b> <i>a</i>, <b>205</b> <i>b</i>, <b>205</b> <i>c</i>). However, the changes in voltage may not be the same, since the solar modules (<b>201</b> <i>a</i>, <b>201</b> <i>b</i>, . . . , <b>201</b> <i>n</i>) can operate at different operating points on the I-V curve.</div>

An LMU <b>310</b> may be configured to control the manner in which the solar module <b>380</b> connects to the rest of the system. As described and referenced further herein, the LMU <b>310</b> may control the current and/or voltage of the solar module <b>380</b> as it connects to other portions of the system. The negative connection terminal <b>382</b> and positive connection terminal <b>386</b> are shown representing connections to a string bus or other power line of the SPVPG system. In the embodiment shown, the LMU <b>310</b> controls the connection between the solar module <b>380</b> and one of the terminals of the solar module through connecting to the solar module and providing a circuit through which the current from the solar module may flow to the positive connection terminal <b>386</b>. The LMU <b>310</b> may also connect to the negative terminal <b>382</b>, for example, to monitor the state of the power line bus (e.g., string bus).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">The polarity of the connections of the negative connection terminal <b>382</b> and positive connection terminal <b>386</b> to the power line may be reversed with respect to the solar module <b>380</b>. For example, in one embodiment, the negative connection terminal <b>382</b> and the positive connection terminal <b>386</b> have reversed polarities, and in particular, the negative connection from the solar module connects through the LMU <b>310</b> (i.e., the negative connection of the solar module connects to intermediate connection <b>384</b>) and the positive connection from the solar module connects directly to the power line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">The exemplary connections shown with the LMU <b>310</b> include a control interface including signals <b>304</b> <i>a</i>-<b>304</b> <i>n</i>.

For example, the LMU <b>310</b> may connect to an MMU through this interface for receiving control instructions, reporting status information (e.g., power production status of solar module <b>380</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">As further described and referenced herein, the LMU <b>310</b> may control the power production of the solar module <b>380</b> and the interaction with the power line (e.g., string bus) through the positive connection terminal <b>386</b> and the negative connection terminal <b>382</b>. For example, the LMU <b>310</b> may adjust the voltage and/or current produced by the solar module <b>380</b>. As another example, the LMU <b>310</b> may stop power production by the solar module <b>380</b>. As used herein, the term power production by a solar module refers to providing power to or receiving power from the power lines (e.g., string bus) of the SPVPG system. In one embodiment, the LMU <b>310</b> may stop power production from the solar module <b>380</b> by stopping the flow of current (e.g., creating an open circuit) between intermediate terminal <b>384</b> and positive terminal <b>386</b>, thereby effectively disconnecting one side of the solar module from the power lines. In another embodiment, the LMU <b>310</b> is instructed to stop power production from the solar module <b>380</b> by allowing current to flow on the power lines without any addition of power from the solar module <b>380</b>. For example, the LMU <b>310</b>, when connected in a series connection with the power line, may create a short circuit between negative connection terminal <b>382</b> and positive connection terminal <b>386</b>, thereby passing the current between the two terminals with no addition of power from the solar module <b>380</b>. In another embodiment, the LMU <b>310</b> is instructed to create an open circuit between all three terminals <b>382</b>, <b>384</b>, and <b>386</b>, thereby interrupting the power production of an entire series-connected bus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">In another embodiment, the LMU <b>310</b> may modulate the power production of the solar module <b>380</b> somewhere between the maximum power output of the solar module <b>380</b> and a zero power output state, as described and referenced further herein. For example, the LMU <b>310</b> may create an open circuit between the negative connection terminal <b>382</b> and both the intermediate connection terminal <b>384</b> and the positive connection terminal <b>386</b>, while at the same time creating a short circuit between the intermediate connection terminal and the positive connection terminal, thereby removing the control function of the LMU <b>310</b> from the SPVPG system. As described further herein, each of these modulations in functioning of the LMU <b>310</b> may be used, for example, through various observations of functioning of other system elements, to determine and identify the connectivity topology of the LMU <b>310</b> within the system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">As described further herein, modifying the operation of the LMU <b>310</b> to manipulate the output of the solar panel can cause changes in the power production operation of the entire SPVPG system or portions thereof (e.g., a SLMU, an inverter) that may be observed and stored by other parts of the system, such as, for example, other LMUs and/or one or more MMU(s). These changes to the system operation may be interpreted as indicating connections between the LMU <b>310</b> and other parts of the SPVPG system. For example, an indication of a connection may be determined from an operational parameter of the system or a change therein. As described further herein, an MMU may instruct an LMU <b>310</b> to modify the power production of a solar module <b>380</b> and may thereafter receive power output information (e.g., from another LMU or an inverter) and interpret the information as including an indication of how the instructed LMU <b>310</b> is connected within the system (e.g., a connectivity topology).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">In one embodiment, an LMU <b>310</b> is instructed to create a short circuit between positive connection terminal <b>386</b> and negative connection terminal <b>382</b> and, in response, due to the configuration of the LMU and other LMUs on the same string, the voltages provided by other LMUs on the string will rise. Another LMU on the string, an SLMU, or other component of the SPVPG system (e.g., an inverter handling the string) may detect the change and report the details of the change to the MMU. For example, a component of the SPVPG system may update or report operational parameters to an MMU, such as, for example, on a schedule and/or when operational parameters change (e.g., by more than a threshold amount). The MMU, having instructed the LMU <b>310</b> to create the short circuit will interpret the information (e.g., operational parameters) received from the components in the SPVPG system in combination with the instruction sent to determine information about where the instructed LMU <b>310</b> is located in the system. As described further herein, the same or similar actions may be ordered and/or repeated with multiple LMUs while determinations are made with respect to a connectivity topology sought to be known in the SPVPG system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">In one embodiment, a connection with an LMU may be detected through receiving an indication of a changed operational parameter of an SPVPG component, such as an increased voltage in one or more other LMUs, a shift in power production by an inverter, or an elimination of current on a string bus. For example, an LMU that is connected in series on a string bus and that is instructed to create a short circuit between its series connections to the bus will cause one or more other LMUs on the string bus to increase its voltage. In this example, each of the LMUs showing increased voltage may be associated together as being connected to the same string bus. In another embodiment, a connection with an LMU may be detected through receiving an indication of a decreased or eliminated current. For example, an LMU that is connected in series on a string bus and that is instructed to create an open circuit between its series connections to the bus will cause the other LMUs on the string bus to cease having current flow through the LMUs because the open circuit of the instructed LMU in series connection will interrupt the current for the entire string. In this example, each of the LMUs showing eliminated current may be associated together as being connected to the same string bus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">Parallel connections between LMUs and buses may be investigated via similar instructions sent to one or more LMUs and along with similar received operational parameters. In one embodiment, an LMU may be instructed to create an open circuit between its bus connections, and other LMUs connected to the same bus in parallel may respond with a shift in either current or voltage output production and/or the power output of the entire bus may shift. In another embodiment, an LMU may be instructed to create a closed circuit between its bus connections, and other LMUs connected to the same bus in parallel (and/or the entire bus) may respond with a decrease or elimination of voltage and/or current for the bus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">In one embodiment, an SLMU is included in the SPVPG system, as further described and referenced herein. Exemplary embodiments of instructions to an LMU, as described further herein, may be similarly directed to an SLMU and operational parameters may be similarly received and interpreted to indicate connections of SLMUs and/or LMUs connected to the SPVPG system.</div>

As described further herein, communications systems <b>400</b> may be included within an MMU or may be external to an MMU. Exemplary communications systems <b>400</b> may connect to an MMU through a bus <b>415</b> that allows the communications systems <b>400</b> to transfer information to the portions of the MMU, such as a single chip microcontroller (SCMC) or other processor within the MMU. In one embodiment, as described further herein, signals transmitted to an MMU through communications systems <b>400</b> may be used to determine connection information of LMUs within the SPVPG system, location information of the LMUs, and/or any combination thereof. For example, as described further herein, a signal strength measurement may be used to determine a location of an SPVPG system component and/or a distance between two SPVPG system components. As another example, as described further herein, a signal transmitted along a power line of the SPVPG system, such as power lines <b>407</b> and <b>408</b>, may be used to determine a connection with that power line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">In one embodiment, communications systems <b>400</b> may each be associated with either an MMU, an LMU, a combiner box or another system component. In one embodiment, a communications device is integrated with an SPVPG system component. In another embodiment, a communications device is separated from the system component. In some embodiments, the physical positioning of the communications device is at a predetermined physical relationship with the SPVPG component, such as a predetermined distance from an MMU or a combiner box.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">As further described and referenced herein, an MMU may contain a SCMC that may communicate with other system components through modulating communications onto power lines of the SPVPG system. For example, as described further herein, an MMU may modulate communications signals onto power line <b>407</b> and/or power line <b>408</b>, and may receive information that the signal was received at an LMU site, thereby identifying one or both of these power lines as connected to the LMU. For example, an MMU may transmit a signal (e.g., communications with information) over a power line <b>408</b> through string bus connection <b>409</b> and an LMU may receive the signal, thus indicating a connection of the LMU to power line <b>408</b>. In one embodiment, as described further herein, a signal transmitted may contain information to be communicated, for example, between the MMU and the LMU.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">In one embodiment, communications signals and signals for determining connections may be modulated on power lines and/or multiplexed on power lines for communicating and/or determining connectivity of LMUs. For example, signals may be transmitted between an MMU and an LMU, or alternatively, between two LMUs. In one embodiment, a LMU and/or its connection to power lines of the SPVPG system may include a blocking filter to limit or exclude signals from travelling beyond the blocking filter, such as, for example, to a neighboring LMU. For example, an LMU may block a signal from transmitting along a power line beyond that LMU with a blocking filter (e.g., dampening device). In one embodiment, the blocking filter attenuates only a portion of the signal on the power lines, such as a connection-determining portion of the signal, but not a communications portion of the signal. In another embodiment, the blocking filter reduces a portion of the signal on the power lines by a predetermined amplitude. In one embodiment, the blocking filter is adjustable by the LMU. For example, the blocking filter may be activated or deactivated by the LMU, such as, for example, to allow a connection-determining signal to pass to a neighboring LMU at some time periods and not at other time periods. In one embodiment, the blocking filter is adjustable based on a command from the MMU. In another embodiment, the blocking filter may be tunable in its effect on a modulated signal or in its effect on a frequency of a signal. For example, a blocking filter may be tuned to eliminate a certain frequency band from the signal that is associated with the LMU such that the connection-determining signal will include an indication that the signal has travelled on the power line past the blocking filter and, hence, has travelled past a connection with the LMU.</div>

Portable device <b>510</b> may be used to identify a system component via identification tag (e.g., tag <b>502</b>). For example, portable device <b>510</b> may include a barcode reader capable of reading an identification tag <b>502</b> containing a barcode on an LMU <b>501</b>. In one embodiment, the portable device <b>510</b> includes a location discovery system, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS), and uses the location discovery system to associate the identification of a system component with a particular physical location. For example, portable device <b>510</b> may receive an identification of an LMU <b>501</b> and associate that LMU with the physical position of the portable device <b>510</b> determined via GPS antenna <b>511</b> and satellite system <b>520</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">In one embodiment, system <b>500</b> provides for identification of other system components, such as wires, lines, and connections. For example, the identification tags <b>504</b> <i>a </i>and <b>505</b> <i>b </i>may be associated with the power lines <b>505</b> <i>a </i>and <b>505</b> <i>b</i>, respectively. As another example, the identification tags <b>504</b> <i>a </i>and <b>504</b> <i>b </i>may be associated with the connections <b>503</b> <i>a </i>and <b>503</b> <i>b</i>, respectively, between the power lines <b>505</b> <i>a </i>and <b>505</b> <i>b </i>and the LMU <b>501</b>. In one embodiment, identification information included with identification tags, such as identification tag <b>504</b> <i>a</i>, includes information about a connection, such as connection <b>503</b> <i>a </i>between system components power line <b>505</b> <i>a </i>and LMU <b>501</b>. In another embodiment, identification information may be added through the portable device <b>510</b>, such as through manual entry on a keypad <b>514</b> or through wireless communications <b>512</b>. For example, an identification tag <b>502</b> may include certain information identifying the LMU <b>501</b>, and further information may be associated with the LMU (e.g., model type, connections observed in the SPVPG system installation) through manual entry and/or other entry means, such as wireless or visual information from a camera on the portable device <b>510</b>. A screen <b>513</b> on the portable device <b>510</b> may be used to interface with a user, for example, to confirm reading of an identification tag, successful determination of location or physical position, and/or entry of manual information to be associated with the information retrieved through other means.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">In one embodiment, a GPS system is used for determining physical location. In another embodiment, another system is used, such as a local grid of coordinates or radio beacons in the SPVPG, radio telemetry, and/or triangulation to visible objects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">In one embodiment, an identification tag (e.g., <b>502</b>) is read automatically using a barcode on the tag and barcode reader on the portable device <b>510</b>. In another embodiment, an identification tag (e.g., <b>502</b>) is read by an operator and manually entered into a portable device <b>510</b>. In another embodiment, radio frequency identification (RFID) technology is used by the portable device <b>510</b> to receive identification information from the identification tag (e.g., <b>502</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">Information about location may be used by systems and methods described herein in conjunction with information about connectivity between system components to create or enhance connectivity topology determinations. For example, connectivity information that an LMU <b>501</b> is connected to power lines <b>505</b> <i>a </i>and <b>505</b> <i>b </i>may be used to determine that the LMU <b>501</b> is connected to a string bus closer to a combiner box than another LMU connected to the power line <b>505</b> <i>a </i>and another power line (not shown) that is known to be in a physical location that is further from the combiner box.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an exemplary flowchart of an embodiment of a process <b>600</b> for determining the connectivity topology of an SPVPG system. The process <b>600</b> begins in step <b>601</b> with receiving a list of LMUs in the SPVPG system. The list of LMUs may be received in step <b>601</b> from any of a number of locations, including a storage in an MMU, a portable device that has stored/logged information regarding LMUs in the SPVPG system, or a data repository. In one embodiment, the list of LMUs contains information about the location of one or more of the LMUs, for example a physical location of the LMU. In another embodiment, the list of LMUs contains limited or no information about the location or connections of the LMUs within the SPVPG system. In another embodiment, the list of LMUs contains location information and/or connection information about one subset of LMUs and contains no location or connection information about a second subset of LMUs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">The process <b>600</b> includes selecting an LMU in step <b>602</b>. The selection of an LMU may be performed in a step-wise fashion along the list of LMUs or may be as a result of some other determination. In one embodiment, location information or connectivity information is used to select an LMU. For example, an LMU may be selected based on connectivity information that is lacking for the LMU or based on connectivity information indicating that the LMU is connected to power lines (e.g., a string bus) that are connected to other LMUs that are either unidentified or about which there is missing information. In another embodiment, information about power production may be used to select an LMU in step <b>602</b>. For example, an LMU may be selected for having a particularly high or low power production. As another example, an LMU may be selected for having a power production that is significantly influenced by changes in power production of other LMUs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">The process includes instructing the LMU to stop power production in step <b>603</b>. Instructions to an LMU to stop power production and/or manipulations of power point tracking devices in the SPVPG may be used as further described herein to determine connectivity. Stopping power production may include, as described further herein, creating an open circuit or a short circuit in particular connections between a solar module and power lines of the SPVPG system. In one embodiment, stopping power production in step <b>603</b> includes a full stop of power production through the creation of static connections within the LMU. In another embodiment, stopping power production in step <b>603</b> includes a modification of power production to temporarily stop or store the power created from a solar module and disconnect such power from the power lines of an SPVPG system. In another embodiment, step <b>603</b> is substituted with a modification of power production by the LMU, including power production control and modulation as described and referenced further herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">After stopping power production in step <b>603</b>, or otherwise modifying power production in a different embodiment, the process receives operational information from the SPVPG system in step <b>604</b>. The operational information received in step <b>604</b> may include modifications in power production of a portion of the SPVPG system. For example, an LMU connected to the same string bus as the LMU that stopped power production will respond with a change in one or more operational parameters such as voltage, current, etc. The changed operational information received in step <b>604</b> may be used to determine a connectivity topology of at least a portion of the SPVPG system through interpreting the changes in operational parameter(s) along with information about the instruction sent to the LMU and/or previously known connectivity information and/or location information. Thus, a connectivity topology of the SPVPG may be determined and constructed using the existing knowledge of the SPVPG system and changes to operational parameter(s) responsive to instructions to stop or vary power production transmitted to an LMU.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">The process <b>600</b> includes determinations in steps <b>605</b>, <b>608</b> and <b>611</b> of whether to repeat portions of the process based on whether the acquired information is sufficient to build or determine the desired connectivity topology. For example, after the operational information is received from the SPVPG system in step <b>604</b>, a determination may be made in step <b>605</b> that the resulting connectivity topology based on the information is insufficient and/or that further changes in operational information may be desired, and that steps <b>602</b>-<b>604</b> will be repeated. The determination made in step <b>605</b> may include information about the desired detail of the connectivity topology, the ability to determine more of the connectivity topology based on repetitions of steps <b>602</b>-<b>604</b>, and the other means available for determining more about the connectivity topology. For example, a connection order between LMUs may not be an important detail to be added into a connectivity topology, but the identification of an LMU as belonging to one subset or another may be significant and may inform the next step to be performed (e.g., step <b>602</b> or step <b>606</b>) in the process <b>600</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">The process <b>600</b> includes instructing the transmission of an ultrasonic signal in step <b>606</b>. In one embodiment, the process <b>600</b> includes another step of determining which portion of the system, such as an LMU, should be instructed to transmit ultrasonic signals in step <b>606</b>. In one embodiment, instructions are sent to one or more LMUs to transmit ultrasonic signals on power lines of the SPVPG system. In another embodiment, all ultrasonic transducers in the SPVPG system are instructed to transmit ultrasonic signals on power lines. In one embodiment, instructions for multiple transducers to transmit may include instructions causing the ultrasonic signals to be multiplexed, such as multiplexed by time, frequency, code, or other type of multiplexing, as described further herein. In another embodiment, instructions for multiple transducers to transmit may be created so that multiple transducers will transmit in a non-multiplexed manner, such as with overlapping times and/or frequencies.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">In step <b>607</b> information (e.g., a report) is received from one or more system components regarding ultrasonic signals received by ultrasonic transducers connected to power lines. In one embodiment, as described further herein, an LMU receives information from a transducer indicating a received ultrasonic signal and communicates with an MMU the nature and/or content of the ultrasonic signal received. In another embodiment, an MMU receives a report of an ultrasonic signal received from another part of the SPVPG system. As described further herein, the received ultrasonic signal may include an indication of connection and/or location of the receiving and/or transmitting component of the SPVPG and that indication may be used to further determine a connectivity topology.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">In step <b>608</b>, the process <b>600</b> determines, as described further herein, whether process steps <b>606</b> and <b>607</b> should be repeated based on the information received or otherwise known relating to the connectivity topology.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">The process <b>600</b> includes instructing the transmission of an electromagnetic (EM) signal in step <b>609</b>, such as an infrared (IR), radio frequency (RF) or microwave signal. In one embodiment, the process <b>600</b> includes another step of determining which portion of the system, such as an LMU, should be instructed to transmit the EM signal in step <b>609</b>. For example, a particular network interface card (NIC) associated with an LMU may be used to broadcast an EM signal on a wireless network communications band. As another example, a particular IR source that is centered on a particular direction may be instructed to transmit an IR signal. In another embodiment, an instruction is sent in step <b>609</b> to transmit an EM signal from multiple or all EM transmitters of the SPVPG system. As described further herein, multiple signal transmissions may be multiplexed or encoded to distinguish between received transmissions from multiple sources.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">The process <b>600</b> includes receiving EM signal strength information in step <b>610</b>. As described further herein, signal strength information may be determined from a signal in multiple ways, including measuring an analog value and/or setting a threshold above which signals will be registered as received. In one embodiment, information about a signal strength is determined by an LMU and transmitted through a communications means to an MMU for further processing. In another embodiment, information about a signal strength is processed into another format by an LMU, such as formatting information to include an indication of distance between the receiver and the transmitter of the EM signal. Various technologies for implementing EM transmitters and receivers in an SPVPG system are described further herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">In step <b>611</b>, the process <b>600</b> determines, as described further herein, whether process steps <b>609</b> and <b>610</b> should be repeated based on the information received or otherwise known relating to the connectivity topology.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">In step <b>612</b>, the process <b>600</b> may further use other technologies or system information to determine the connectivity topology to a desired level of detail, as described further herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows an exemplary flowchart of another embodiment of a process <b>700</b> for determining the connectivity topology of an SPVPG system. The process starts in step <b>702</b> and determines a technology to use in eliciting information for determining a connectivity topology of the SPVPG system. For example, any of the technologies described further herein for determining connection information and/or location information may be selected in step <b>702</b>. As described further herein, the technology selected in step <b>702</b> may be selected based on the information already known about components in the SPVPG system, a known connectivity topology (e.g., an incomplete connectivity topology), and/or a desired portion of a connectivity topology (e.g., the connections of a specified LMU). Based on the selection performed in step <b>702</b>, the process <b>700</b> proceeds to investigate the SPVPG system using the selected technology to determine further aspects about the SPVPG system, as described further herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">In one embodiment, the process <b>700</b> selects multiple different technologies in step <b>702</b> and performs multiple investigations using those technologies simultaneously. For example, process <b>700</b> may at the same time instruct an LMU to stop power production in step <b>706</b> and instruct a transmission of an ultrasonic signal in step <b>710</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">In one embodiment, the process <b>700</b> instructs an LMU to stop power production in step <b>706</b>, as described further herein. After such an instruction in step <b>706</b>, the process <b>700</b> receives operational information from a system component in step <b>708</b>, as described further herein. Steps <b>706</b> and <b>708</b> may be performed in parallel and/or simultaneously with other steps in the process <b>700</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">Process <b>700</b> includes determining whether sufficient data has been received or is otherwise known to create a desired connectivity topology in step <b>722</b>. As described further herein, a connectivity topology may contain any level of detail and may be improved upon to meet a certain level of detail. Also as described further herein, different types of information may be included and used in determining a connectivity topology. For example, the process <b>700</b> may determine that there is not sufficient data in step <b>722</b> and may repeat step <b>704</b> of determining a technology to use to receive further information about the connectivity topology. The process <b>700</b> may inquire with multiple different LMUs using multiple technologies described further herein and receive only partial information from each iteration. The process <b>700</b> may then prepare a composite sketch of connectivity topology based on analysis of the information received. Information used in analysis could include connectivity indications and location information, as described further herein. When the process <b>700</b> determines in step <b>722</b> that there is sufficient data for determining the connectivity topology at a desired level of detail, the process <b>700</b> may end in step <b>724</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">Process <b>700</b> may determine in step <b>704</b> to use one or more of several different technologies, as described further herein. For example, process <b>700</b> may instruct the transmission of ultrasonic signals along lines or wires in the SPVPG system in step <b>710</b> and may receive a report from system component(s) in step <b>712</b>. As another example, process <b>700</b> may instruct the transmission of radio frequency (RF) signals in step <b>714</b> and may receive information about an RF signal strength of the received RF signal in step <b>716</b>. As another example, process <b>700</b> may instruct the transmission of a directional electromagnetic transmission (e.g., infrared) in step <b>718</b> and receive directional information in step <b>720</b> related to receiving the electromagnetic transmission. Process <b>700</b> may use each of these technologies, as described further herein, to determine a connectivity topology for the SPVPG system.</div>
