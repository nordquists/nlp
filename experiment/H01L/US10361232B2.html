<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0002">The interaction of light with semiconductor materials has been a significant innovation. Silicon imaging devices are used in various technologies, such as digital cameras, optical mice, video cameras, cell phones, and the like. Charge-coupled devices (CCDs) were widely used in digital imaging, and were later improved upon by complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) imagers having improved performance. Many traditional CMOS imagers utilize front side illumination (FSI). In such cases, electromagnetic radiation is incident upon the semiconductor surface containing the CMOS devices and circuits. Backside illumination CMOS imagers have also been used, and in many designs electromagnetic radiation is incident on the semiconductor surface opposite the CMOS devices and circuits. CMOS sensors are typically manufactured from silicon and can covert visible incident light into a photocurrent and ultimately into a digital image. Silicon-based technologies for detecting infrared incident electromagnetic radiation have been problematic, however, because silicon is an indirect bandgap semiconductor having a bandgap of about 1.1 eV. Thus the absorption of electromagnetic radiation having wavelengths of greater than about 1100 nm is, therefore, very low in silicon.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0023">Before the present disclosure is described herein, it is to be understood that this disclosure is not limited to the particular structures, process steps, or materials disclosed herein, but is extended to equivalents thereof as would be recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the relevant arts. It should also be understood that terminology employed herein is used for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting.</div>
<heading id="h-0006">Definitions</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0024">The following terminology will be used in accordance with the definitions set forth below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0025">It should be noted that, as used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms “a,” and, “the” include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to “a dopant” includes one or more of such dopants and reference to “the layer” includes reference to one or more of such layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0026">As used herein, the terms “disordered surface” and “textured surface” can be used interchangeably, and refer to a surface having a topology with nano- to micron-sized surface variations formed by the irradiation of laser pulses or other texturing methods such as chemical etching as described herein. While the characteristics of such a surface can be variable depending on the materials and techniques employed, in one aspect such a surface can be several hundred nanometers thick and made up of nanocrystallites (e.g. from about 10 to about 50 nanometers) and nanopores. In another aspect, such a surface can include micron-sized structures (e.g. about 2 μm to about 60 μm). In yet another aspect, the surface can include nano-sized and/or micron-sized structures from about 5 nm and about 500 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0027">As used herein, the term “fluence” refers to the amount of energy from a single pulse of laser radiation that passes through a unit area. In other words, “fluence” can be described as the energy density of one laser pulse.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0028">As used herein, the terms “surface modifying” and “surface modification” refer to the altering of a surface of a semiconductor material using a variety of surface modification techniques. Non-limiting examples of such techniques include plasma etching, reactive ion etching, porous silicon etching, lasing, chemical etching (e.g. anisotropic etching, isotropic etching), nanoimprinting, material deposition, selective epitaxial growth, and the like, including combinations thereof. In one specific aspect, surface modification can include processes using primarily laser radiation or laser radiation in combination with a dopant, whereby the laser radiation facilitates the incorporation of the dopant into a surface of the semiconductor material. Accordingly, in one aspect surface modification includes doping of a substrate such as a semiconductor material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0029">As used herein, the term “target region” refers to an area of a substrate that is intended to be doped or surface modified. The target region of the substrate can vary as the surface modifying process progresses. For example, after a first target region is doped or surface modified, a second target region may be selected on the same substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0030">As used herein, the term “detection” refers to the sensing, absorption, and/or collection of electromagnetic radiation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0031">As used herein, the term “backside illumination” refers to a device architecture design whereby electromagnetic radiation is incident on a surface of a semiconductor material that is opposite a surface containing the device circuitry. In other words, electromagnetic radiation is incident upon and passes through a semiconductor material prior to contacting the device circuitry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0032">As used herein, the term “substantially” refers to the complete or nearly complete extent or degree of an action, characteristic, property, state, structure, item, or result. For example, an object that is “substantially” enclosed would mean that the object is either completely enclosed or nearly completely enclosed. The exact allowable degree of deviation from absolute completeness may in some cases depend on the specific context. However, generally speaking the nearness of completion will be so as to have the same overall result as if absolute and total completion were obtained. The use of “substantially” is equally applicable when used in a negative connotation to refer to the complete or near complete lack of an action, characteristic, property, state, structure, item, or result. For example, a composition that is “substantially free of” particles would either completely lack particles, or so nearly completely lack particles that the effect would be the same as if it completely lacked particles. In other words, a composition that is “substantially free of” an ingredient or element may still actually contain such item as long as there is no measurable effect thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0033">As used herein, the term “about” is used to provide flexibility to a numerical range endpoint by providing that a given value may be “a little above” or “a little below” the endpoint.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0034">As used herein, a plurality of items, structural elements, compositional elements, and/or materials may be presented in a common list for convenience. However, these lists should be construed as though each member of the list is individually identified as a separate and unique member. Thus, no individual member of such list should be construed as a de facto equivalent of any other member of the same list solely based on their presentation in a common group without indications to the contrary.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0035">Concentrations, amounts, and other numerical data may be expressed or presented herein in a range format. It is to be understood that such a range format is used merely for convenience and brevity and thus should be interpreted flexibly to include not only the numerical values explicitly recited as the limits of the range, but also to include all the individual numerical values or sub-ranges encompassed within that range as if each numerical value and sub-range is explicitly recited. As an illustration, a numerical range of “about 1 to about 5” should be interpreted to include not only the explicitly recited values of about 1 to about 5, but also include individual values and sub-ranges within the indicated range. Thus, included in this numerical range are individual values such as 2, 3, and 4 and sub-ranges such as from 1-3, from 2-4, and from 3-5, etc., as well as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, individually.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0036">This same principle applies to ranges reciting only one numerical value as a minimum or a maximum. Furthermore, such an interpretation should apply regardless of the breadth of the range or the characteristics being described.</div>
<heading id="h-0007">The Disclosure</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0037">Electromagnetic radiation can be present across a broad wavelength range, including visible range wavelengths (approximately 350 nm to 800 nm) and non-visible wavelengths (longer than about 800 nm or shorter than 350 nm). The infrared spectrum is often described as including a near infrared portion of the spectrum including wavelengths of approximately 800 to 1300 nm, a short wave infrared portion of the spectrum including wavelengths of approximately 1300 nm to 3 micrometers, and a mid to long wave infrared (or thermal infrared) portion of the spectrum including wavelengths greater than about 3 micrometers up to about 30 micrometers. These are generally and collectively referred to herein as “infrared” portions of the electromagnetic spectrum unless otherwise noted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0038">Traditional silicon photodetecting imagers have limited light absorption/detection properties. For example, such silicon based detectors are mostly transparent to infrared light. While other mostly opaque materials (e.g. InGaAs) can be used to detect infrared electromagnetic radiation having wavelengths greater than about 1000 nm, silicon is still commonly used because it is relatively cheap to manufacture and can be used to detect wavelengths in the visible spectrum (i.e. visible light, 350 nm-800 nm). Traditional silicon materials require substantial path lengths and absorption depths to detect photons having wavelengths longer than approximately 700 nm. While visible light can be absorbed at relatively shallow depths in silicon, absorption of longer wavelengths (e.g. 900 nm) in silicon of a standard wafer depth (e.g. approximately 750 μm) is poor if at all.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0039">The devices of the present disclosure increase the absorption of semiconductor materials by increasing the absorption path length for longer wavelengths as compared to traditional materials. The absorption depth in conventional silicon detectors is the depth into silicon at which the radiation intensity is reduced to about 36% of the value at the surface of the semiconductor. The increased absorption path length results in an apparent reduction in the absorption depth, or a reduced apparent or effective absorption depth. For example, the effective absorption depth of silicon can be reduced such that these longer wavelengths can be absorbed at depths of less than or equal to about 850 μm. In other words, by increasing the absorption path length, these devices are able to absorb longer wavelengths (e.g. &gt;1000 nm for silicon) within a thin semiconductor material. In addition to decreasing the effective absorption depth, the response rate or response speed can also be increased using thinner semiconductor materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0040">Accordingly, backside-illuminated (BSI) photosensitive imager devices and associated methods are provided. Such devices provide, among other things, enhanced response in the near infrared light portion of the optical spectrum and improved response and quantum efficiency in converting electromagnetic radiation to electrical signals. As such, quantum efficiency (QE) of over 60% can be obtained in the visible region. Quantum efficiency can be defined as the percentage of photons that are converted into electrons. There are two types of QE, internal and external. Internal QE (IQE) describes the percentage of absorbed photons that are converted into electrons within the device. External QE (EQE) is the measurement of this conversion and the electrons that are collected outside of the device. The EQE is always lower than the IQE since there will inevitably be recombination effects and optical losses (e.g. transmission and reflection losses). One reason for improved performance with BSI is a higher fill factor or, in other words, the amount of light that can be collected in a single pixel. The various metal layers on top of a front side-illuminated sensor (FSI) limit the amount of light that can be collected in a pixel. As pixel sizes get smaller, the fill factor gets worse. BSI provides a more direct path for light to travel into the pixel, thus avoiding light blockage by the metal interconnect and dielectric layers on the top-side of the semiconductor substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0041">The present disclosure additionally provides BSI broadband photosensitive diodes, pixels, and imagers capable of detecting visible as well as infrared electromagnetic radiation, including associated methods of making such devices. A photosensitive diode can include a semiconductor substrate having multiple doped regions forming at least one junction, a textured region coupled to the semiconductor substrate and positioned to interact with electromagnetic radiation, and a passivation region positioned between the textured region and the at least one junction. The passivation region is positioned to isolate the at least one junction from the textured region, and the semiconductor substrate and the textured region are positioned such that incoming electromagnetic radiation passes through the semiconductor substrate before contacting the textured region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0042">In one aspect the multiple doped regions can include at least one cathode region and at least one anode region. In some aspects, doped regions can include an n-type dopant and/or a p-type dopant as is discussed below, thereby creating a p-n junction. In other aspects, a photosensitive device can include an i-type region to form a p-i-n junction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0043">A photosensitive pixel can include a semiconductor substrate having multiple doped regions forming at least one junction, a textured region coupled to the semiconductor substrate and positioned to interact with electromagnetic radiation, and a passivation region positioned between the textured region and the at least one junction. The passivation region is positioned to isolate the at least one junction from the textured region, and the semiconductor substrate and the textured region are positioned such that incoming electromagnetic radiation passes through the semiconductor substrate before contacting the textured region. Additionally, the photosensitive pixel also includes an electrical transfer element coupled to the semiconductor substrate and operable to transfer an electrical signal from the at least one junction. A photosensitive imager can include multiple photosensitive pixels. Additionally, an electrical transfer element can include a variety of devices, including without limitation, transistors, sensing nodes, transfer gates, transfer electrodes, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0044">Photosensitive or photo detecting imagers include photodiodes or pixels that are capable of absorbing electromagnetic radiation within a given wavelength range. Such imagers can be passive pixel sensors (PPS), active pixel sensors (APS), digital pixel sensor imagers (DPS), or the like, with one difference being the image sensor read out architecture. For example, a semiconducting photosensitive imager can be a three or four transistor active pixel sensor (3T APS or 4T APS). Various additional components are also contemplated, and would necessarily vary depending on the particular configuration and intended results. As an example, a 4T configuration as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can additionally include, among other things, a transfer gate <b>2</b>, a reset transistor <b>1</b>, a source follower <b>3</b>, a row select transistor <b>4</b>, and a photodiode sensor <b>5</b>. Additionally, devices having greater than 4 transistors are also within the present scope. Photosensor diode <b>5</b> can be a conventional pinned photodiode as used in current state of the art CMOS imagers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0045">As has been described, photosensitive imagers can be front side illumination (FSI) or back side illumination (BSI) devices. In a typical FSI imager, incident light enters the semiconductor device by first passing by transistors and metal circuitry. The light, however, can scatter off of the transistors and circuitry prior to entering the light sensing portion of the imager, thus causing optical loss and noise. A lens can be disposed on the topside of a FSI pixel to direct and focus the incident light to the light sensing active region of the device, thus partially avoiding the circuitry. In one aspect the lens can be a micro-lens. BSI imagers, one the other hand, are configured to have the depletion region of the junction extending to the opposite side of the device. In one aspect, for example, incident light enters the device via the light sensing portion and is mostly absorbed prior to reaching the circuitry. BSI designs allow for smaller pixel architecture and a high fill factor for the imager. It should also be understood that devices according to aspects of the present disclosure can be incorporated into complimentary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) imager architectures or charge-coupled device (CCD) imager architectures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0046">In one aspect, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a BSI photosensitive diode <b>20</b> can include a semiconductor substrate <b>22</b> having multiple doped regions <b>23</b>, <b>24</b> forming at least one junction, and a textured region <b>28</b> coupled to the semiconductor substrate and positioned to interact with electromagnetic radiation. The multiple doped regions can have the same doping profile or different doping profiles, depending on the device. While the device shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> contains three doped regions, it should be noted that other aspects containing one or more doped regions are considered to be within the present scope. Additionally, the semiconductor substrate can be doped, and thus can be considered to be a doped region in some aspects. A passivation region <b>26</b> is positioned between the textured region and the at least one junction. In one embodiment the passivation region can have a thickness in the range of about 10 nm to about 2 μm. In another embodiment the passivation region can have a thickness in the range of about 10 nm to about 100 nm. In yet another embodiment the passivation region can have a thickness of less than 50 nm. The passivation region is positioned to isolate the at least one junction from the textured region, and the semiconductor substrate and the textured region are positioned such that incoming electromagnetic radiation passes through the semiconductor substrate before contacting the textured region. The photosensitive diode is backside illuminated by electromagnetic radiation <b>29</b> that is incident on the side of the semiconductor substrate opposite the multiple doped regions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0047">In another aspect, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a BSI photosensitive imager device <b>30</b> is provided. The BSI photosensitive imager device includes a semiconductor substrate <b>32</b> having multiple doped regions <b>33</b>, <b>34</b> forming a least one junction, and a textured region <b>38</b> coupled to the semiconductor substrate and positioned to interact with electromagnetic radiation. A passivation region <b>36</b> is positioned between the textured region and the at least one junction to isolate the at least one junction from the textured region. The semiconductor substrate and the textured region are positioned such that incoming electromagnetic radiation <b>39</b> passes through the semiconductor substrate before contacting the textured region. An electrical transfer element <b>37</b> is coupled to the semiconductor substrate to transfer an electrical signal from the at least one junction. Side wall insulators <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> can also be formed about the transfer element <b>37</b> and passivation/textured regions, respectively, to insure proper spacing away from the transfer element. Additionally, a drain junction region <b>53</b> is electrically is electrically coupled to the transfer element to receive charge transferred thereto by the transfer element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0048">The various devices according to aspects of the present disclosure can exhibit increased quantum efficiency over traditional photosensitive devices. Any increase in the quantum efficiency makes a large difference in the signal to noise ratio. More complex structures can provide not only increased quantum efficiency but also good uniformity from pixel to pixel. In addition, devices of the present disclosure exhibit increased responsivity as compared to traditional photosensitive devices. For example, in one aspect the responsivity can be greater than or equal to 0.8 A/W for wavelengths greater than 1000 nm for semiconductor substrate that is less than 100 μm thick. In other embodiment the responsivity can be greater than 0.5 A/W for wavelengths greater than 1100 nm for semiconductor substrate that is less than 50 μm thick.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0049">A variety of semiconductor materials are contemplated for use with the devices and methods according to aspects of the present disclosure.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0052">The semiconductor substrate can be of any thickness that allows electromagnetic radiation detection and conversion functionality, and thus any such thickness of semiconductor material is considered to be within the present scope. In some aspects the textured region increases the efficiency of the device such that the semiconductor substrate can be thinner than has previously been possible. Decreasing the thickness of the semiconductor substrate reduces the amount of semiconductor material required to make such a device. In one aspect, for example, the semiconductor substrate has a thickness of from about 500 nm to about 50 μm. In another aspect, the semiconductor substrate has a thickness of less than or equal to about 100 μm. In yet another aspect, the semiconductor substrate has a thickness of from about 1 μm to about 10 μm. In a further aspect, the semiconductor substrate can have a thickness of from about 5 μm to about 50 μm. In yet a further aspect, the semiconductor substrate can have a thickness of from about 5 μm to about 10 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0053">Additionally, various types of semiconductor materials are contemplated, and any such material that can be incorporated into an electromagnetic radiation detection device is considered to be within the present scope. In one aspect, for example, the semiconductor material is monocrystalline. In another aspect, the semiconductor material is multicrystalline. In yet another aspect, the semiconductor material is microcrystalline. It is also contemplated that the semiconductor material can be amorphous. Specific nonlimiting examples include amorphous silicon or amorphous selenium.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0054">The semiconductor materials of the present disclosure can also be made using a variety of manufacturing processes. In some cases the manufacturing procedures can affect the efficiency of the device, and may be taken into account in achieving a desired result. Exemplary manufacturing processes can include Czochralski (Cz) processes, magnetic Czochralski (mCz) processes, Float Zone (FZ) processes, epitaxial growth or deposition processes, and the like. It is contemplated that the semiconductor materials used in the present invention can be a combination of monocrystalline material with epitaxially grown layers formed thereon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0055">The textured region can function to diffuse electromagnetic radiation, to redirect electromagnetic radiation, and to absorb electromagnetic radiation, thus increasing the quantum efficiency of the device. In the present BSI devices, electromagnetic radiation passing through the semiconductor substrate can contact the textured region. The textured region can include surface features to thus increase the effective absorption length of the photosensitive pixel. Such surface features can be micron-sized and/or nano-sized, and can be any shape or configurations. Non-limiting examples of such shapes and configurations include cones, pillars, pyramids, micolenses, quantum dots, inverted features, gratings, protrusions, and the like, including combinations thereof. Additionally, factors such as manipulating the feature sizes, dimensions, material type, dopant profiles, texture location, etc. can allow the diffusing region to be tunable for a specific wavelength. In one aspect, tuning the device can allow specific wavelengths or ranges of wavelengths to be absorbed. In another aspect, tuning the device can allow specific wavelengths or ranges of wavelengths to be reduced or eliminated via filtering.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0056">Tuning can also be accomplished through the relative location of the texture region within the device, modifying the dopant profile(s) of regions within the device, dopant selection, and the like. Additionally, material composition near the textured region can create a wavelength specific photosensing pixel device. It should be noted that a wavelength specific photosensing pixel can differ from one pixel to the next, and can be incorporated into an imaging array. For example a 4×4 array can include a blue pixel, a green pixel, a red pixel, and infrared light absorbing pixel, or a blue pixel, two green pixels, and a red pixel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0057">Textured regions according to aspects of the present disclosure can allow a photosensitive device to experience multiple passes of incident electromagnetic radiation within the device, particularly at longer wavelengths (i.e. infrared). Such internal reflection increases the effective absorption length to be greater than the thickness of the semiconductor substrate. This increase in absorption length increases the quantum efficiency of the device, leading to an improved signal to noise ratio.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0058">The materials used for making the textured region can vary depending on the design and the desired characteristics of the device. As such, any material that can be utilized in the construction of a textured region is considered to be within the present scope. Non-limiting examples of such materials include semiconductor materials, dielectric materials, silicon, polysilicon, amorphous silicon, transparent conductive oxides, and the like, including composites and combinations thereof. In one specific aspect, the textured layer is a textured polysilicon layer. Thus a polysilicon layer can be deposited onto the passivation region, and then textured to form the textured region. In another aspect, the textured layer is a textured dielectric layer. In this case the textured region is a portion of the dielectric layer making up the passivation region. In yet another aspect the textured layer is a transparent conductive oxide or another semiconductor material. In the case of dielectric layers, the textured region can be a textured portion of the passivation region or the textured region can be formed from other dielectric material deposited over the passivation region. In the case of semiconductor materials, forming the textured region can include depositing a semiconductor material on the passivation region and texturing the semiconductor material to form the textured region. The texturing process can texture the entire semiconductor material or only a portion of the semiconductor material. In one specific aspect, a polysilicon layer can be deposited over the passivation layer and textured and patterned by an appropriate technique (e.g. a porous silicon etch) to form the texture region. In yet another aspect, a polysilicon layer can be deposited over the passivation layer and textured and patterned by using a mask and photolithography and an etch to define a specific structure or pattern.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0059">In addition to surface features, the textured region can have a surface morphology that is designed to focus or otherwise direct electromagnetic radiation. For example, in one aspect the textured region has a surface morphology operable to direct electromagnetic radiation into the semiconductor substrate. Non-limiting examples of various surface morphologies include sloping, pyramidal, inverted pyramidal, spherical, square, rectangular, parabolic, asymmetric, symmetric, and the like, including combinations thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0060">One example of such a surface morphology is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Without intending to be limited to any operational theory, the following description provides one possible explanation for the effects of surface morphology on the direction of electromagnetic radiation. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a textured device having a surface morphology that affects the near infrared wavelength response. A semiconductor substrate <b>40</b> is shown having an illuminated surface <b>42</b> to receive incident electromagnetic radiation. The semiconductor substrate further has a textured region <b>44</b> (e.g. dielectric) coupled thereto at a surface that is opposite to the illuminated surface. The textured region has a surface morphology configured in an undulating pattern <b>46</b> with grooves, ridges, or similar patterns to produce an internal reflection that is not specular. In the near infrared the index of refraction of silicon is about η=3.42 and the reflectance is about R=30% from a single surface, and transmittance through a single surface is T=70% for normal incident waves. The absorption coefficient of silicon is very low in the near infrared. Electromagnetic radiation under normal incidence, represented by arrow <b>48</b>, is reflected from the illuminated surface <b>42</b>, and this is shown as arrow <b>41</b>. There are successive reflections from both the illuminated surface and the opposing side, represented by arrows <b>43</b> and <b>45</b>, and internal reflections from the illuminated surface, represented by arrow <b>47</b>, resulting in a total internal reflection, if there is neither a reflective metal layer <b>49</b> nor textured region, the total transmittance, T<sub>tot</sub>, is as shown in Equation (I) as:
<br/>
<i>T</i> <sub>tot</sub>=(<i>TT</i>)(1+<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> <i>+R</i> <sup>4</sup>+ . . . )=(<i>TT</i>)/(1−<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup>)  (I)
<br/>
This result has been obtained using the sum of a geometric series. If both surfaces are just polished silicon-air then this results in a total transmittance of 54% and a reflectance of 46%.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0061">If the increase in the individual path lengths caused by the diffuse scattering is neglected and if the absorption coefficient is very low then the total effective path length is determined by just the number of reflections, and the total absorption can be as shown in Equation (II):
<br/>
<i>A=αd</i>(1+<i>R</i> <sub>2</sub>)(1+<i>R</i> <sub>1</sub> <i>R</i> <sub>2</sub> <i>+R</i> <sub>1</sub> <sup>2</sup> <i>R</i> <sub>2</sub> <sup>2</sup>+ . . . )=<i>αd</i>(1+<i>R</i> <sub>2</sub>)/(1−<i>R</i> <sub>1</sub> <i>R</i> <sub>2</sub>)  (II)
<br/>
Here, α, is the absorption coefficient in reciprocal cm and, d, is the thickness of the sample in cm, and the effective increase in path length is Enh=(1+R<sub>2</sub>)/(1−R<sub>1</sub>R<sub>2</sub>). The internal quantum efficiency, IQE, in the infrared where the absorption in silicon is low is then, IQE=αd(Enh). The external quantum efficiency, EQE, is EQE=T<sub>1</sub>IQE and EQE=T<sub>1</sub>αd(Enh).
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0062">If both sides of an infrared photo detector are polished then T<sub>1</sub>=T<sub>2</sub>=0.70 and R<sub>1</sub>=R<sub>2</sub>=0.3, which gives Enh=1.4, IQE=1.4 ad and EQE=αd. If one side is polished and the other side has an oxide and then a metal reflector then R<b>1</b>=0.3 and R<b>2</b>=1.0, this yields an enhancement in infrared absorption or Enh=3. T<sub>1</sub>, is the transmittance of radiation incident on the first surface. T<sub>2</sub>, is the transmittance of radiation striking the second surface from the semiconductor side. R<sub>1 </sub>is the amount of radiation reflected back into the semiconductor for radiation striking the first surface from the semiconductor side. R<sub>2 </sub>is the amount of radiation reflected back into the semiconductor for radiation striking the second surface from the semiconductor side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0063">In one aspect that can improve the infrared response, the illuminated side <b>42</b> is polished but the opposing side <b>46</b> is a textured dielectric material <b>44</b>, with a reflecting region <b>49</b>. The texturing can be realized in a fashion to produce a true diffuse scattering (i.e. a Lambertian scattering), at the infrared wavelengths. This diffuse scattering layer/reflecting layer combination, in essence, yields an R<sub>2</sub>=100%, a diffuse reflector. The reflectance of the polished front side to the scattered light radiation is determined by solid angle considerations. Any incident light with an angle of incidence greater than the critical angle, θ <b>50</b>, will be totally internal reflected, <b>47</b>. If the backside scattering is totally diffuse or Lambertian, the transmittance is then determined by the area of the surface, π<sup>2</sup>, within the critical angle θ (labeled <b>50</b>), in this case 17° for silicon and air. The radius of the circle is r=d sin(17), where, d, is the thickness of the sample. This area is divided by the area of the half sphere, 2πd<sup>2</sup>. If the backside scattering is totally diffuse the transmittance of the front planar surface is then roughly T<sub>1</sub>=3% and the reflectance R<sub>1</sub>=97%. The path length enhancement factor can be very large, as is shown in Equation (III):
<br/>
Enh=(1+<i>R</i> <sub>2</sub>)/(1−<i>R</i> <sub>1</sub>R<sub>2</sub>)=66  (III)
<br/>
This would result in an IQE=66αd and an EQE=46. If the backside includes a textured region and a truly diffusive scattering surface and a mirror-like surface is used behind the back side, a very large enhancement of absorption in the near infrared can be achieved. If the absorption in the semiconductor substrate is not assumed to be small but rather is taken into account it can be shown that the enhancement factor for the IQE due to multiple reflections is modified from Equation (I) and as is shown in Equation (IV):
<br/>
Enh=(1−exp(−<i>αd</i>))(1+<i>R</i> <sub>2</sub>exp(−<i>αd</i>))/(1−<i>R</i> <sub>1</sub> <i>R</i> <sub>2</sub>exp(−2<i>αd</i>))  (IV)
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0064">This allows a calculation of the responsivity, in terms of the electrical current in Amperes per incident light power in Watts, of photo detectors of different thickness, d, for different wavelengths, λ, since the absorption coefficient, α(λ), is a function of wavelength, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. If it is assumed that the textured side is an ideal reflector, R<sub>2</sub>=1.0, and the amount of diffusive scattering of the textured surface varies from that of a planar surface, then the fraction of light reflected back from the opposing illuminated surface will vary. If the textured surface is planar, then there is only specular reflection, and R<sub>1</sub>=0.3; if the textured surface is an ideal Lambertian diffusive surface then the fraction of light reflected back from the front surface will be very large, R<sub>1</sub>=0.97. Several values of R<sub>1 </sub>as illustrated by curves, <b>601</b>, <b>602</b>, and <b>603</b> are discussed herein, and illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, for a diffuse reflector, and these represent the fraction of light internally reflected back at the front surface. For purposes of the present disclosure, values of R<sub>1</sub>≥0.9, curve <b>601</b>, are deemed useful. The enhancement in absorption described by Equation (IV) then varies with the fraction of light radiation reflected back from the illuminated surface and thickness of the sample, as is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. It should be noted that, while the techniques described herein have been used to enhance the absorption of infrared and red light radiation, they are also applicable to visible light as the thickness of the silicon layer becomes thinner. Scattering and multiple internal reflections can also be used to increase the absorption of yellow, green and even blue light that will not be totally absorbed in single passes within thin silicon layers. These techniques can be applied then to visible imagers with thin silicon absorption layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0065">The textured region, including surface features as well as surface morphologies, can be formed by various techniques, including plasma etching, reactive ion etching, porous silicon etching, lasing, chemical etching (e.g. anisotropic etching, isotropic etching), nanoimprinting, material deposition, selective epitaxial growth, and the like. In one aspect, the texturing process can be performed during the manufacture of the photosensitive device. In another aspect, the texturing process can be performed on a photosensitive device that has previously been made. For example, a CMOS, CCD, or other photosensitive element can be textured following manufacture. In this case, material layers may be removed from the photosensitive element to expose the semiconductor substrate or the passivation region upon which a textured region can be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0066">One effective method of producing a textured region is through laser processing. Such laser processing allows discrete locations of the passivation region or other substrate to be textured. A variety of techniques of laser processing to form a textured region are contemplated, and any technique capable of forming such a region should be considered to be within the present scope. Laser treatment or processing can allow, among other things, enhanced absorption properties and thus increased electromagnetic radiation focusing and detection. The laser treated region can be associated with the surface nearest the impinging electromagnetic radiation or, in the case of BSI devices, the laser treated surface can be associated with a surface opposite in relation to impinging electromagnetic radiation, thereby allowing the radiation to pass through the semiconductor substrate before it hits the laser treated region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0067">In one aspect, for example, a target region of the semiconductor material can be irradiated with laser radiation to form a textured region. Examples of such processing have been described in further detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,057,256, 7,354,792 and 7,442,629, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Briefly, a surface of a substrate material is irradiated with laser radiation to form a textured or surface modified region. Such laser processing can occur with or without a dopant material. In those aspects whereby a dopant is used, the laser can be directed through a dopant carrier and onto the substrate surface. In this way, dopant from the dopant carrier is introduced into the target region of the substrate material. Such a region incorporated into a substrate material can have various benefits in accordance with aspects of the present disclosure. For example, the target region typically has a textured surface that increases the surface area of the laser treated region and increases the probability of radiation absorption via the mechanisms described herein. In one aspect, such a target region is a substantially textured surface including micron-sized and/or nano-sized surface features that have been generated by the laser texturing. In another aspect, irradiating the surface of the substrate material includes exposing the laser radiation to a dopant such that irradiation incorporates the dopant into the substrate. Various dopant materials are known in the art, and are discussed in more detail herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0068">Thus the surface of the substrate or passivation region is chemically and/or structurally altered by the laser treatment, which may, in some aspects, result in the formation of surface features appearing as microstructures or patterned areas on the surface and, if a dopant is used, the incorporation of such dopants into the substrate material. In some aspects, the features or microstructures can be on the order of 50 nm to 20 μm in size and can assist in the absorption of electromagnetic radiation. In other words, the textured surface can increase the probability of incident radiation being absorbed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0069">The type of laser radiation used to surface modify a material can vary depending on the material and the intended modification. Any laser radiation known in the art can be used with the devices and methods of the present disclosure. There are a number of laser characteristics, however, that can affect the surface modification process and/or the resulting product including, but not limited to the wavelength of the laser radiation, pulse width, pulse fluence, pulse frequency, polarization, laser propagation direction relative to the semiconductor material, etc. In one aspect, a laser can be configured to provide pulsatile lasing of a material. A short-pulsed laser is one capable of producing femtosecond, picosecond and/or nanosecond pulse durations. Laser pulses can have a central wavelength in a range of about from about 10 nm to about 8 μm, and more specifically from about 200 nm to about 1200 nm. The pulse width of the laser radiation can be in a range of from about tens of femtoseconds to about hundreds of nanoseconds. In one aspect, laser pulse widths can be in the range of from about 50 femtoseconds to about 50 picoseconds. In another aspect, laser pulse widths can be in the range of from about 50 picoseconds to 100 nanoseconds. In another aspect, laser pulse widths are in the range of from about 50 to 500 femtoseconds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0070">The number of laser pulses irradiating a target region can be in a range of from about 1 to about 2000. In one aspect, the number of laser pulses irradiating a target region can be from about 2 to about 1000. Further, the repetition rate or frequency of the pulses can be selected to be in a range of from about 10 Hz to about 10 μHz, or in a range of from about 1 kHz to about 1 MHz, or in a range from about 10 Hz to about 1 kHz. Moreover, the fluence of each laser pulse can be in a range of from about 1 kJ/m<sup>2 </sup>to about 20 kJ/m<sup>2</sup>, or in a range of from about 3 kJ/m<sup>2 </sup>to about 8 kJ/m<sup>2</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0071">A variety of dopant materials are contemplated for both the formation of the multiple doped regions and incorporation by a texturing technique, and any such dopant that can be used in such processes to surface modify a material is considered to be within the present scope. It should be noted that the particular dopant utilized can vary depending on the material being doped, as well as the intended use of the resulting material. For example, the selection of potential dopants may differ depending on whether or not tuning of the photosensitive device is desired.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0072">A dopant can be either charge donating or accepting dopant species. More specifically, an electron donating or a hole donating species can cause a region to become more positive or negative in polarity as compared to the semiconductor substrate. In one aspect, for example, the doped region can be p-doped. In another aspect the doped region can be n-doped. A highly doped region can also be formed on or near the doped region to create a pinned diode. In one non-limiting example, the semiconductor substrate can be negative in polarity, and a doped region and a highly doped region can be doped with p+ and n dopants respectively. In some aspects, variations of n(−−), n(−), n(+), n(++), p(−−), p(−), p(+), or p(++) type doping of the regions can be used. It should be noted that in one aspect the highly doped region can be a textured region. In other words, textured surface features can be formed on or in a highly doped region. In another aspect, at least a portion of the textured region, or the material from which the textured region is generated, can be doped with a dopant to generate a back surface field. A back surface field can function to impede the movement of photo-generated carriers from the junction toward the textured region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0073">In one aspect, non-limiting examples of dopant materials can include S, F, B, P, N, As, Se, Te, Ge, Ar, Ga, In, Sb, and combinations thereof. It should be noted that the scope of dopant materials should include, not only the dopant materials themselves, but also materials in forms that deliver such dopants (i.e. dopant carriers). For example, S dopant materials includes not only S, but also any material capable being used to dope S into the target region, such as, for example, H<sub>2</sub>S, SF<sub>6</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and the like, including combinations thereof. In one specific aspect, the dopant can be S. Sulfur can be present at an ion dosage level of between about 5×10<sup>14 </sup>and about 1×10<sup>16 </sup>ions/cm<sup>2</sup>. Non-limiting examples of fluorine-containing compounds can include ClF<sub>3</sub>, PF<sub>5</sub>, F<sub>2 </sub>SF<sub>6</sub>, BF<sub>3</sub>, GeF<sub>4</sub>, WF<sub>6</sub>, SiF<sub>4</sub>, HF, CF<sub>4</sub>, CHF<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>3</sub>F, C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>HF<sub>5</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>8</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>, NF<sub>3</sub>, and the like, including combinations thereof. Non-limiting examples of boron-containing compounds can include B(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, BF<sub>3</sub>, BCl<sub>3</sub>, BN, C<sub>2</sub>B<sub>10</sub>H<sub>12</sub>, borosilica, B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, and the like, including combinations thereof. Non-limiting examples of phosphorous-containing compounds can include PF<sub>5</sub>, PH<sub>3</sub>, and the like, including combinations thereof. Non-limiting examples of chlorine-containing compounds can include Cl<sub>2</sub>, SiH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, HCl, SiCl<sub>4</sub>, and the like, including combinations thereof. Dopants can also include arsenic-containing compounds such as AsH<sub>3 </sub>and the like, as well as antimony-containing compounds. Additionally, dopant materials can include mixtures or combinations across dopant groups, i.e. a sulfur-containing compound mixed with a chlorine-containing compound. In one aspect, the dopant material can have a density that is greater than air. In one specific aspect, the dopant material can include Se, H<sub>2</sub>S, SF<sub>6</sub>, or mixtures thereof. In yet another specific aspect, the dopant can be SF<sub>6 </sub>and can have a predetermined concentration range of about 5.0×10<sup>−8 </sup>mol/cm<sup>3 </sup>to about 5.0×10<sup>4 </sup>mol/cm<sup>3</sup>. As one non-limiting example, SF<sub>6 </sub>gas is a good carrier for the incorporation of sulfur into the semiconductor material via a laser process without significant adverse effects on the material. Additionally, it is noted that dopants can also be liquid solutions of n-type or p-type dopant materials dissolved in a solution such as water, alcohol, or an acid or basic solution. Dopants can also be solid materials applied as a powder or as a suspension dried onto the wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0074">As a further processing note, the semiconductor substrate can be annealed for a variety of reasons, including dopant activation, semiconductor damage repair, and the like. The semiconductor substrate can be annealed prior to texturing, following texturing, during texturing, or any combination thereof. Annealing can enhance the semiconductive properties of the device, including increasing the photoresponse properties of the semiconductor materials by reducing any imperfections in the material. Additionally, annealing can reduce damage that may occur during the texturing process. Although any known anneal can be beneficial and would be considered to be within the present scope, annealing at lower temperatures can be particularly useful. Such a “low temperature” anneal can greatly enhance the external quantum efficiency of devices utilizing such materials. In one aspect, for example, the semiconductor substrate can be annealed to a temperature of from about 300° C. to about 1100 C°. In another aspect, the semiconductor substrate can be annealed to a temperature of from about 500° C. to about 900° C. In yet another aspect, the semiconductor substrate can be annealed to a temperature of from about 700° C. to about 800° C. In a further aspect, the semiconductor substrate can be annealed to a temperature that is less than or equal to about 850° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0075">The duration of the annealing procedure can vary according to the specific type of anneal being performed, as well as according to the materials being used. For example, rapid annealing processes can be used, and as such, the duration of the anneal may be shorter as compared to other techniques. Various rapid thermal anneal techniques are known, all of which should be considered to be within the present scope. In one aspect, the semiconductor substrate can be annealed by a rapid annealing process for a duration of greater than or equal to about 1 μs. In another aspect, the duration of the rapid annealing process can be from about 1 μs to about 1 ms. As another example, a baking or furnace anneal process can be used having durations that may be longer compared to a rapid anneal. In one aspect, for example, the semiconductor substrate can be annealed by a baking anneal process for a duration of greater than or equal to about 1 ms to several hours.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0076">Various types of passivation region configurations are contemplated, and any configuration that can be incorporated into a photosensitive device is considered to be within the present scope. One benefit to such a passivation region pertains to the isolation provided between the textured region and the doped regions that form the junction. In one aspect, for example, the passivation region can be positioned to physically isolate the textured region from the junction. In this way, the creation of the textured region can be isolated from the doped regions, thus precluding undesirable effects of the texturing process from affecting the junction. In another aspect, the passivation region can be a dielectric material, and thus the passivation region could be used to electrically isolate the textured region from the junction. In some cases, the passivation region is coupled directly to at least one of the doped regions forming the junction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0077">The passivation region can be made from a variety of materials, and such materials can vary depending on the device design and desired characteristics. Non-limiting examples of such materials can include oxides, nitrides, oxynitrides, and the like, including combinations thereof. In one specific aspect, the passivation region includes an oxide. Additionally, the passivation region can be of various thicknesses. In one aspect, for example, the passivation region has a thickness of from about 100 nm to about 1 micron. In another aspect, the passivation region has a thickness of from about 5 nm to about 100 nm. In yet another aspect, the passivation region has a thickness of from about 20 nm to about 50 nm. It should be noted that, in cases where the textured region is a portion of the passivation region (e.g. a dielectric layer) that has been textured, the thickness of the passivation material would be increased to account for the texturing. Thus the thickness ranges for the passivation region provided here would be measured as the thickness of the passivation region not including the textured portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0078">The devices according to aspects of the present disclosure can additionally include one or more reflecting regions. In one aspect, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a BSI photosensitive imager device <b>60</b> can include a reflecting region <b>62</b> coupled to the textured region <b>38</b>. It should be noted that all reference numbers in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> that have been reused from previous figures and will be reused in subsequent figures denote the same or similar materials and/or structures whether or not further description is provided. The reflecting region can be deposited over the entire textured region or only over a portion of the textured region. In some aspects, the reflecting region can be deposited over a larger area of the device than the textured region. The reflecting region can be positioned to reflect electromagnetic radiation passing through the texture region back through the textured region. In other words, as electromagnetic radiation passes into the semiconductor substrate <b>32</b>, a portion that is not absorbed contacts the textured region. Of that portion that contacts the textured region, a smaller portion may pass though the textured region to strike the reflecting region and be reflected back through the textured region toward the semiconductor substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0079">A variety of reflective materials can be utilized in constructing the reflecting region, and any such material capable of incorporation into a photosensitive device is considered to be within the present scope. Non-limiting examples of such materials include a Bragg reflector, a metal reflector, a metal reflector over a dielectric material, a transparent conductive oxide such as zinc oxide, indium oxide, or tin oxide, and the like, including combinations thereof. Non-limiting examples of metal reflector materials can include silver, aluminum, gold, platinum, reflective metal nitrides, reflective metal oxides, and the like, including combinations thereof. In one aspect, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a BSI photosensitive imager device <b>70</b> can include a dielectric layer <b>72</b> positioned between the reflecting region <b>62</b> and the textured region <b>38</b>. It should be noted that all reference numbers in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> that have been reused from previous figures and will be reused in subsequent figures denote the same or similar materials and/or structures whether or not further description is provided. In one specific aspect, the dielectric layer can include an oxide layer and the reflecting region can include a metal layer. The surface of the metal layer on an oxide acts as a mirror-like reflector for the incident electromagnetic radiation from the backside. It should be noted that the reflective region is not biased with a voltage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0080">In another aspect, the textured region <b>38</b> can include a hemispherical grained polysilicon or coarse grained polysilicon material and the reflective region <b>62</b> can include a metal layer. The hemispherical grained or coarse grained silicon can act as a diffusive scattering site for the incident optical radiation and the dielectric layer <b>72</b> and the reflective region together can act as a reflector.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0081">In still another aspect, the photosensitive imager can include selective epitaxial silicon growth for generating the textured region on top of the junction formed by the doped regions (e.g. a photodiode) without the passivation region being present (not shown). An oxide and metal reflector, for example, can be coupled to the textured region. The epitaxial growth places the textured region away from the top of the junction, and the rapid etch characteristics of grain boundaries can be used to create texturing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0082">Additionally, the textured surface of a metal on a roughened oxide can act as a diffusive scattering site for the incident electromagnetic radiation and also as a mirror-like reflector. Other aspects can utilize porous materials for the texturing. Porous polysilicon, for example, can be oxidized or oxide deposited and a reflective region such as a metal reflector can be associated therewith to provide a scattering and reflecting surface. In another aspect, aluminum can be subjected to anodic oxidation to provide porous aluminum oxide, a high dielectric constant insulator. This insulator can be coated with aluminum or other metals to provide a scattering and reflecting surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0083">In one specific aspect, a reflective region can include a transparent conductive oxide, an oxide, and a metal layer. The transparent oxide can be textured and a metal reflector deposited thereupon. The textured surface of the metal on a roughened transparent conductive oxide can act as a diffusive scattering site for the incident electromagnetic radiation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0084">In another specific aspect, a Bragg reflector can be utilized as a reflective region. A Bragg reflector is a structure formed from multiple layers of alternating materials with varying refractive indexes, or by a periodic variation of some characteristic (e.g. height) of a dielectric waveguide, resulting in periodic variation in the effective refractive index in the guide. Each layer boundary causes a partial reflection of an optical wave. For waves whose wavelength is close to four times the optical thickness of the layers, the many reflections combine with constructive interference, and the layers act as a high-quality reflector. Thus the coherent super-positioning of reflected and transmitted light from multiple interfaces in the structure interfere so as to provide the desired reflective, transmissive, and absorptive behavior. In one aspect, the Bragg reflector layers can be alternating layers of silicon dioxide and silicon. Because of the high refractive index difference between silicon and silicon dioxide, and the thickness of these layers, this structure can be fairly low loss even in regions where bulk silicon absorbs appreciably. Additionally, because of the large refractive index difference, the optical thickness of the entire layer set can be thinner, resulting in a broader-band behavior and fewer fabrications steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0085">Additional scattering can be provided by positioning a textured forward scattering layer on the side of the pixel opposing the doped photodiode regions or on the illuminated side. These forward scattering layers can be, without limitation, textured oxides or polysilicon without a reflector. These layers can be spaced away from the back side surface of the pixel and would provide scattering of the light in addition to that provided by layers on the front side of the pixel adjacent to the photodiode and transistor doped regions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0086">In one aspect, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a BSI photosensitive imager device <b>80</b> can include a lens <b>82</b> coupled to the semiconductor substrate <b>32</b> on a side facing incident electromagnetic radiation. It should be noted that all reference numbers in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> that have been reused from previous figures denote the same or similar materials and/or structures whether or not further description is provided. Thus the lens can focus the electromagnetic radiation more effectively into the semiconductor substrate. In the case of a BSI photosensitive device, the lens is disposed on the backside of the device. Additionally, an anti-reflective coating <b>84</b> can be associated with the device between the semiconductor substrate and the lens. It should be noted that the present scope also includes aspects having a lens without an anti-reflecting coating, and aspects having an anti-reflecting coating associated with the semiconductor substrate without a lens. Additionally, a color filter (not shown) can be optically coupled to the lens to allow specific wavelengths filtering of the electromagnetic radiation. Incident electromagnetic radiation passing through the color filter prior to contacting the semiconductor substrate can be filtered according to the characteristics of the filter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0087">In another aspect, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a BSI photosensitive imager device <b>90</b> can also include at least one isolation feature <b>92</b> associated with the semiconductor substrate <b>32</b>. It should be noted that all reference numbers in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> that have been reused from previous figures denote the same or similar materials and/or structures whether or not further description is provided. Isolation features can maintain pixel to pixel uniformity when multiple pixels are used in association by reducing optical and electrical crosstalk there between. The isolation feature can be shallow or deep, depending on the desired design. The isolation features can be generated using various materials including, without limitation, dielectric materials, reflective materials, conductive materials, light diffusing features, and the like. Additionally, in some aspects the isolation feature can be a void in the semiconductor substrate. In one aspect, isolation features can also be configured to reflect incident electromagnetic radiation until it is absorbed, thereby increase the effective absorption length of the device. Furthermore, the devices according to aspects of the present disclosure can also independently include one or more vias, passivation layers, and the like (not shown).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0088"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a photosensitive imager <b>100</b> comprising two photosensitive pixels <b>102</b>. Each photosensitive pixel includes a boundary region <b>104</b> that can include circuitry and a textured region <b>106</b>. Each photosensitive pixel can include at least one transistor <b>108</b> or other electrical transfer element. Additional read out and circuitry elements <b>109</b> can be utilized and shared by both photosensitive pixels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0089">In other aspects of the present disclosure, various methods of making photosensitive diodes, pixels, and imagers, are contemplated. In one aspect, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a method of making a backside-illuminated photosensitive imager device can include forming at least one junction at a surface of a semiconductor substrate <b>112</b>, forming a passivation region over the at least one junction <b>114</b>, and forming a textured region over the passivation region <b>116</b>. The passivation region isolates the at least one junction from the textured region, and the semiconductor substrate and the textured region are positioned such that incoming electromagnetic radiation passes through the semiconductor substrate before contacting the textured region. The method also includes coupling an electrical transfer element to the semiconductor substrate <b>118</b> such that the electrical transfer element is operable to transfer an electrical signal from the at least one junction. In one aspect, multiple pixels can be associated together to form an imager. A passivation layer can also be disposed on the backside of the photosensitive imager device to protect and/or reduce the dark current of the device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0090">In another aspect of the present disclosure, a method for making a photosensitive diode is provided. Such a method can include forming at least one cathode and at least one anode on a surface of a semiconductor substrate, depositing a passivation region on the semiconductor substrate over the cathode and the anode, and forming a textured region over the passivation layer. An electrical transfer element can be deposited on the semiconductor substrate and can be electrically coupled to at least one of the anode and cathode to form a photosensitive pixel. In some cases, the electrical transfer element can be electrically isolated from the semiconductor substrate. In another aspect, the semiconductor substrate can be thinned to improve the response rate and/or speed of the device.</div>
