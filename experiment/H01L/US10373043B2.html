<heading id="h-0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to radio IC devices, and particularly to a radio IC device including a radio IC used for an RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">A RFID system has been developed for commodity management in recent years. In the RFID system, information is transmitted by non-contact communication between a reader/writer that generates an induction field and an IC chip (may be referred to as IC tag or radio IC chip) which stores commodity information and other information attached on the package or other item of the commodity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2002-232221 discloses a transmitter/receiver unit including an IC chip-including radio IC device together with other chip components. In the transmitter/receiver unit, a circuit board on which the IC chip is mounted is enclosed in a shielding case, and an antenna element is further disposed on the circuit board.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">However, since the antenna element is disposed as an independent component different from the radio IC chip within the shielding case, the radio IC device is relatively large and, consequently, the size of the transmitter/receiver unit is increased. In order to avoid the increase in size, the antenna element is miniaturized. However, this reduces the radiation characteristics of the antenna element, which causes problems, such as a decrease in communication distance.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">To overcome the problems described above, preferred embodiments of the present invention provide a radio IC device that is miniaturized without reducing the radiation characteristics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">A radio IC device according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a high frequency device defined by an electromagnetic coupling module or a radio IC chip, and a radiation plate arranged so as to be coupled to the high frequency device. The electromagnetic coupling module includes a radio IC arranged to process transmitted and received signals and a feed circuit board including a feed circuit having an inductance element connected to or electromagnetically coupled to the radio IC and coupled to an external circuit. The radiation electrode is preferably defined by a case of an apparatus and/or a metal component disposed in the apparatus, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">More specifically, the radio IC device includes a high frequency device and a radiation plate, and the high frequency device includes an electromagnetic coupling module or a radio IC chip. The electromagnetic coupling module may preferably include a feed circuit board including the radio IC, or a feed circuit board on which the radio IC is disposed. If the high frequency device is a radio IC chip, the radio IC chip and the radiation plate are coupled to each other with a coupling electrode, such as a loop electrode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">The metal component defining the radiation plate can be any metal portion, such as a wiring electrode disposed in an apparatus, a shielding case, a ground electrode, and a metal portion of a connector, or a metal case of a switching module used in the apparatus, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">The feed circuit board may preferably include a resonance circuit and/or a matching circuit. The radio IC is operated by a signal received by the radiation plate through the resonance circuit and/or the matching circuit, and the answer signal from the radio IC is radiated from the radiation plate to the outside through the resonance circuit and/or the matching circuit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">Since the case of the apparatus and/or any metal component in the apparatus can be used as the radiation plate, another component is not required to be provided as an antenna element. Consequently, the size of the apparatus is not increased. In addition, the metal components, such as the case, the wiring electrode, and the ground electrode are relatively large, and accordingly, desired radiation characteristics can be obtained. The apparatus used herein preferably refers to an electronic apparatus in which the radio IC device is to be mounted, such as cellular phone, for example. If the case of the apparatus is a shielding case made of a metal, the case can function as the radiation plate by itself. If the case is made of a non-conductive material, an electroconductive electrode film can be formed on the case so that the electrode film functions as the radiation plate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">In the radio IC device, a miniature radio IC chip can easily be mounted on a small feed circuit board by providing an electromagnetic coupling module including a radio IC chip disposed on a feed circuit board. If the radio IC is modified according to the working frequency of the RFID system, all that is required is to modify the design of the feed circuit of the feed circuit board. It is not necessary to change the shape, size or arrangement of the radiation plate or the coupling state between the radiation plate and the feed circuit board.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">The radio IC device according to preferred embodiments of the present invention does not require that an antenna element be disposed as an additional independent component. Thus, the radio IC device and apparatuses including the radio IC device can be miniaturized without degrading the radiation characteristics. The feed circuit board can have a relatively small size. Accordingly, even a very small radio IC chip can be easily mounted on the small feed circuit board with a conventionally used IC mounter. Consequently, the packaging cost is reduced. All that is required to change the working frequency is to modify the design of the feed circuit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">Other features, elements, steps, characteristics and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of preferred embodiments of the present invention with reference to the attached drawings.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0216" num="0215">The electromagnetic coupling module may be used in a variety of apparatuses including household electrical appliances, such as TV set and refrigerator, without being limited to radio communication apparatuses, such as cellular phone.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0217" num="0216">As described above, the present invention is useful in radio IC devices used in RFID systems, and is particularly advantageous in miniaturization without reducing the radiation characteristics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0218" num="0217">While preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described above, it is to be understood that variations and modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing the scope and spirit of the present invention. The scope of the present invention, therefore, is to be determined solely by the following claims.</div>
