<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/374,588, filed Dec. 9, 2016, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/337,751, filed May 17, 2016, which are incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to non-volatile memory arrays.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Split gate non-volatile memory cells, and arrays of such cells, are well known. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,029,130 (“the '130 patent”) discloses an array of split gate non-volatile memory cells, and is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. The memory cell is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Each memory cell <b>10</b> includes source and drain regions <b>14</b>/<b>16</b> formed in a semiconductor substrate <b>12</b>, with a channel region <b>18</b> there between. A floating gate <b>20</b> is formed over and insulated from (and controls the conductivity of) a first portion of the channel region <b>18</b>, and over a portion of the drain region <b>16</b>. A control gate <b>22</b> has a first portion <b>22</b> <i>a </i>that is disposed over and insulated from (and controls the conductivity of) a second portion of the channel region <b>18</b>, and a second portion <b>22</b> <i>b </i>that extends up and over the floating gate <b>20</b>. The floating gate <b>20</b> and control gate <b>22</b> are insulated from the substrate <b>12</b> by a gate oxide <b>26</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">The memory cell is erased (where electrons are removed from the floating gate) by placing a high positive voltage on the control gate <b>22</b>, which causes electrons on the floating gate <b>20</b> to tunnel through the intermediate insulation <b>24</b> from the floating gate <b>20</b> to the control gate <b>22</b> via Fowler-Nordheim tunneling.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">The memory cell is programmed (where electrons are placed on the floating gate) by placing a positive voltage on the control gate <b>22</b>, and a positive voltage on the drain <b>16</b>. Electron current will flow from the source <b>14</b> towards the drain <b>16</b>. The electrons will accelerate and become heated when they reach the gap between the control gate <b>22</b> and the floating gate <b>20</b>. Some of the heated electrons will be injected through the gate oxide <b>26</b> onto the floating gate <b>20</b> due to the attractive electrostatic force from the floating gate <b>20</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">The memory cell is read by placing positive read voltages on the drain <b>16</b> and control gate <b>22</b> (which turns on the channel region under the control gate). If the floating gate <b>20</b> is positively charged (i.e. erased of electrons and positively coupled to the drain <b>16</b>), then the portion of the channel region under the floating gate <b>20</b> is turned on as well, and current will flow across the channel region <b>18</b>, which is sensed as the erased or “1” state. If the floating gate <b>20</b> is negatively charged (i.e. programmed with electrons), then the portion of the channel region under the floating gate <b>20</b> is mostly or entirely turned off, and current will not flow (or there will be little flow) across the channel region <b>18</b>, which is sensed as the programmed or “0” state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">The architecture of the memory array is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The memory cells <b>10</b> are arranged in rows and columns. In each column, the memory cells are arranged end to end in mirror fashion, so that they are formed as pairs of memory cells each sharing a common source region <b>14</b> (S), and each adjacent set of memory cell pairs sharing a common drain region <b>16</b> (D). All the source regions <b>14</b> for any given row of memory cells are electrically connected together by a source line <b>14</b> <i>a</i>. All the drain regions <b>16</b> for any given column of memory cells are electrically connected together by a bit line <b>16</b> <i>a</i>. All the control gates <b>22</b> for any given row of memory cells are electrically connected together by a control gate line <b>22</b> <i>a</i>. Therefore, while the memory cells can be individually programmed and read, memory cell erasure is performed row by row (each row of memory cells is erased together, by the application of a high voltage on the control gate line <b>22</b> <i>a</i>). If a particular memory cell is to be erased, all the memory cells in the same row must also be erased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Those skilled in the art understand that the source and drain can be interchangeable, where the floating gate can extend partially over the source instead of the drain, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> best illustrates the corresponding memory cell architecture, including the memory cells <b>10</b>, the source lines <b>14</b> <i>a</i>, the bit lines <b>16</b> <i>a</i>, and the control gate lines <b>22</b> <i>a</i>. As is evident from the figures, memory cells <b>10</b> of the same row share the same source line <b>14</b> <i>a </i>and the same control gate line <b>22</b> <i>a</i>, while the drains of all cells of the same column are electrically connected to the same bit line <b>16</b> <i>a</i>. The array design is optimized for digital applications, and permits individual programming of the selected cells, e.g., by applying 1.6 V and 7.6 V to the selected control gate line <b>22</b> <i>a </i>and source line <b>14</b> <i>a</i>, respectively, and grounding the selected bit line <b>16</b> <i>a</i>. Disturbing the non-selected memory cell in the same pair is avoided by applying a voltage greater than 2 volts on the unselected bit lines <b>16</b> <i>a </i>and grounding the remaining lines. The memory cells <b>10</b> cannot be erased individually because the process responsible for erasure (the Fowler-Nordheim tunneling of electrons from the floating gate <b>20</b> to the control gate <b>22</b>) is only weakly affected by the drain voltage (i.e., the only voltage which may be different for two adjacent cells in the row direction sharing the same source line <b>14</b> <i>a</i>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Split gate memory cells having more than two gates are also known. For example, memory cells have source region <b>14</b>, drain region <b>16</b>, floating gate <b>20</b> over a first portion of channel region <b>18</b>, a select gate <b>28</b> over a second portion of the channel region <b>18</b>, a control gate <b>22</b> over the floating gate <b>20</b>, and an erase gate <b>30</b> over the source region <b>14</b> are known, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Programming is shown by heated electrons from the channel region <b>18</b> injecting themselves onto the floating gate <b>20</b>. Erasing is shown by electrons tunneling from the floating gate <b>20</b> to the erase gate <b>30</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">The architecture for a four-gate memory cell array can be configured as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In this embodiment, each horizontal select gate line <b>28</b> <i>a </i>electrically connects together all the select gates <b>28</b> for that row of memory cells. Each horizontal control gate line <b>22</b> <i>a </i>electrically connects together all the control gates <b>22</b> for that row of memory cells. Each horizontal source line <b>14</b> <i>a </i>electrically connects together all the source regions <b>14</b> for two rows of memory cells that share the source regions <b>14</b>. Each bit line <b>16</b> <i>a </i>electrically connects together all the drain regions <b>16</b> for that column of memory cells. Each erase gate line <b>30</b> <i>a </i>electrically connects together all the erase gates <b>30</b> for two rows of memory cells that share the erase gate <b>30</b>. As with the previous architecture, individual memory cells can be independently programmed and read. However, there is no way to erase cells individually. Erasing is performed by placing a high positive voltage on the erase gate line <b>30</b> <i>a</i>, which results in the simultaneous erasing of both rows of the memory cells that share the same erase gate line <b>30</b> <i>a</i>. Exemplary operating voltages can include those in Table 1 below (in this embodiment, select gate lines <b>28</b> <i>a </i>can be referred to as word lines WL):</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">Recently, new applications for split gate non-volatile memory cells have been developed that requires true single bit operation (i.e. each memory cell can be individually programmed, read, and erased, without any interference from or disturbing the programming state of adjacent memory cells).

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">The present invention involves new architecture configurations for arrays of split-gate non-volatile memory cells that provide unique (random order) programming, reading and erasing of single memory cells (i.e., true single bit operation).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">For the two-gate cell of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, the memory cell array architecture that provides true single bit operation is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The main difference between the 2-gate single bit operation architecture of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, and the conventional 2-gate architecture discussed above with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>, is that the horizontal control gate lines <b>22</b> <i>a </i>(one for each row of memory cells) have been replaced with vertical control gate lines <b>22</b> <i>b </i>and <b>22</b> <i>c </i>(i.e., two control gate lines for each column of memory cells). Specifically, each column of memory cells includes two control gate lines: a first control gate line <b>22</b> <i>b </i>electrically connecting together all the control gates <b>22</b> of the odd row memory cells (i.e., those memory cells in odd rows 1, 3, 5, etc.), and a second control gate line <b>22</b> <i>c </i>electrically connecting together all the control gates <b>22</b> of the even row memory cells (i.e., those memory cells in even rows 2, 4, 6, etc.). By reorienting the control gate lines in this manner, any memory cell in the array can be individually programmed, erased and read without adversely affecting the memory state of adjacent memory cells. Exemplary (non-limiting) operational voltages to erase, program or read any given target memory cell are shown in Table 2 below:</div>

The main difference between the 2-gate single bit operation architecture of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, and the conventional 2-gate architecture discussed above with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>, is that the horizontal source lines <b>14</b> <i>a </i>(one for each row) have been replaced with vertical source lines <b>14</b> <i>b </i>(one for each column). Specifically, each column of memory cells includes a source line <b>14</b> <i>b </i>electrically connecting together all the source regions <b>14</b> for all the memory cells <b>10</b> in that column. By reorienting the source lines in this manner, any memory cell in the array can be individually programmed, erased and read without adversely affecting the memory state of adjacent memory cells. The Table 2 operational values equally apply to this embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a 4-gate single bit operation architecture for the memory cell of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The main difference between the 4-gate single bit operation architecture of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, and the conventional 4-gate architecture discussed above with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, is that the horizontal erase gate lines <b>30</b> <i>a </i>(one for each pair of memory cell pairs) have been replaced with vertical erase gate lines <b>30</b> <i>b</i>. Specifically, each column of memory cells includes an erase gate line <b>30</b> <i>b </i>that electrically connects together all the erase gates <b>30</b> for the column of memory cells. By reorienting the erase gate lines in this manner, any memory cell in the array can be individually programmed, erased and read. Exemplary operational voltages to erase, program or read any given target memory cell are shown in Table 4 below:</div>
