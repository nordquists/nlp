<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0003">Field of the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to pattern forming apparatuses, mark detecting apparatuses, exposure apparatuses, pattern forming methods, exposure methods and device manufacturing methods, and more particularly to a pattern forming apparatus and an exposure apparatus that are used when manufacturing electron devices such as semiconductor devices and liquid crystal display devices, or the like, a mark detecting apparatus that can suitably be used in the pattern forming apparatus or the exposure apparatus, a pattern forming method and an exposure method that can suitably be used when manufacturing the electron devices, and a device manufacturing method in which the pattern forming method or the exposure method is used.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">Description of the Background Art</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, in a lithography process for manufacturing electron devices (microdevices) such as semiconductor devices (such as integrated circuits) and liquid crystal display devices, exposure apparatuses such as a projection exposure apparatus by a step-and-repeat method (a so-called stepper) and a projection exposure apparatus by a step-and-scan method (a so-called scanning stepper (which is also called a scanner) are mainly used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Meanwhile, in a lithography process for manufacturing semiconductor devices or the like, multilayer circuit patterns are overlaid and formed on a wafer, and when the overlay accuracy between the layers is poor, the semiconductor devices or the like do not achieve predetermined circuit characteristics, which results in defectives in some cases. Therefore, normally, a mark (alignment mark) is arranged in advance in each of a plurality of shot areas on a wafer and the position (coordinate value) of the mark on a stage coordinate system of an exposure apparatus is detected. After that, based on position information of the mark and known position information of a pattern (e.g. a reticle pattern) that is newly formed, wafer alignment is performed in which the position of one shot area on the wafer is aligned with the pattern.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">As a method of the wafer alignment, global alignment in which the position of each shot area is aligned by detecting alignment marks of only several shot areas (which are also called sample shot areas or alignment shot areas) on a wafer to obtain regularity of the array of the shot areas has been mainly used, in consideration of throughput. In particular, recently, the Enhanced Global Alignment (EGA) in which the array of shot areas on a wafer is precisely computed by a statistical method has been a mainstream (e.g. refer to Kokai (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication) No. 61-044429).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the requirement for overlay accuracy is gradually getting stricter to cope with finer integrated circuits, and also in the EGA, in order to increase the computation accuracy, it is becoming essential to increase the number of sample shot areas, that is, to increase the number of marks to be detected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Further, the wafer surface is not always flat due to, for example, ununiformity of resist film thickness, undulation of a wafer, or the like. Therefore, in a scanning exposure apparatus such as a scanner in particular, when transferring a reticle pattern on a shot area on a wafer by a scanning exposure method, a so-called focus-leveling control is performed, in which position information (focus information) in an optical axis direction of a projection optical system of the wafer surface at a plurality of detection points set within an exposure area, on which an image of the reticle pattern is projected via a projection optical system, is detected using a multipoint focal position detecting system or the like, and based on the detection results, the position in the optical axis direction and the tilt of a table or a stage that holds the wafer is controlled so that the wafer surface is conformed to an image plane of the projection optical system within the exposure area (or, so that the wafer surface is within a range of a depth of focus of the projection optical system) (e.g. refer to Kokai (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication) No. 06-283403).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">However, since the increase in the number of sample shot areas in the EGA described above causes the decrease in throughput of the exposure apparatus, it is practically difficult to employ the measures of merely increasing the number of sample shots.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, in conventional exposure apparatuses, a wafer alignment (mark detection) operation and a detection operation of focus information are independently performed without taking the relation between both operations into consideration, because the purposes of both operations are different.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">However, it is certain that integration of semiconductor devices becomes much higher and accordingly circuit patterns to be formed on a wafer become finer in the future, and therefore further improvement of apparatus performance to realize formation of the finer patterns and further improvement in the throughput are required for the exposure apparatus that is a mass-production apparatus of semiconductor devices.</div>
<heading id="h-0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention has been made in consideration of the situation described above, and according to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a first pattern forming apparatus that forms a pattern on an object, the apparatus comprising: a movable body that moves within a predetermined plane that includes a first axis and a second axis intersecting the first axis, holding the object on which marks are each formed at a plurality of positions different from one another; a plurality of mark detecting systems whose detection areas are placed apart in a direction parallel to the second axis, and that each detect the different marks on the object; and a surface position detecting unit that detects surface position information of the object at a plurality of detection points whose positions are different in a direction parallel to the second axis, by irradiating a detection beam to the object and receiving a reflected light of the detection beam.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">With this apparatus, surface position information of the object at a plurality of detection points whose positions are different in a direction parallel to the second axis is detected by the surface position detecting unit, and also the marks at positions different from one another on the object are each detected by a plurality of mark detecting systems whose detection areas are placed apart in a direction parallel to the second axis. Thus, a detection operation of the marks and a detection operation of surface position information (focus information) can be performed in a short period of time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a second pattern forming apparatus that forms a pattern on an object, the apparatus comprising: a movable body that moves within a predetermined plane that includes a first axis and a second axis intersecting the first axis, holding the object, and also has a surface on which a first grating having a grating whose periodic direction is a direction parallel to the first axis is arranged in pairs; a plurality of mark detecting systems that have detection areas whose positions are different in a direction parallel to the second axis; and a first axis encoder that has a plurality of first heads including a pair of first heads each one of which is placed on both outer sides of the plurality of detection areas in a direction parallel to the second axis, and measures position information of the movable body in a direction parallel to the first axis by the first head that faces at least one of the pair of first gratings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">With this apparatus, position information of the movable body in a direction parallel to the first axis is measured by the first head of the first axis encoder that faces at least one of a pair of the first gratings. Further, in this case, since a pair of the first heads are each placed on both outer sides of the plurality of mark detecting systems, the marks on the object can be simultaneously measured by the plurality of mark detecting systems when movement of the movable body in a direction parallel to the first axis is performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a third pattern forming apparatus that forms a pattern on an object, the apparatus comprising: a movable body that moves within a predetermined plane that includes a first axis and a second axis intersecting the first axis, holding the object, and also has a surface on which a first grating having a grating whose periodic direction is a direction parallel to the first axis and a second grating having a grating whose periodic direction is a direction parallel to the second axis are arranged; at least one mark detecting system that detects marks on the object; a measuring unit that has a first axis encoder that has a plurality of first heads whose positions are different in a direction parallel to the second axis and measures position information of the movable body in a direction parallel to the first axis by the first head that faces the first grating, and a second axis encoder that has a plurality of second heads whose positions are different in a direction parallel to the first axis and measures position information of the movable body in a direction parallel to the second axis by the second head that faces the second grating; and a controller that detects the marks on the object using the mark detecting system while controlling a position of the movable body based on measurement values by the measuring unit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">With this apparatus, while controlling the position of the movable body by the controller based on the measurement values of the measuring unit, the marks on the object mounted on the movable body are detected using the mark detecting system. That is, the marks on the object can be detected using the mark detecting system, while controlling the position of the movable body with high accuracy based on the measurement values of the first head of the first axis encoder that faces the first grating and the second head of the second axis encoder that faces the second grating.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">According to a fourth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a fourth pattern forming apparatus that forms a pattern on an object, the apparatus comprising: a movable body that moves within a predetermined plane that includes a first axis and a second axis intersecting the first axis, holding the object on which marks are each formed at a plurality of positions different from one another; and a plurality of mark detecting systems whose detection areas are placed at different positions in a direction parallel to the second axis, and that simultaneously detect the marks at positions different from one another on the object, wherein the number of marks on the object that are simultaneously detected by the plurality of mark detecting systems differs depending on a position of the movable body within the plane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">With this apparatus, the number of marks on the object that are simultaneously detected by the plurality of mark detecting systems differs depending on the position within the predetermined plane of the movable body that mounts the object, and therefore, when moving the movable body in a direction intersecting the second axis, for example, a direction parallel to the first axis (or a direction orthogonal to the second axis), the marks at positions different from one another on the object can be simultaneously detected using the required number of mark detecting systems in accordance with the position of the movable body in a direction intersecting the second axis, in other words, in accordance with the placement of divided areas on the object.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">According to a fifth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a fifth pattern forming apparatus that forms a pattern on an object using an optical system, the apparatus comprising: a movable body that moves within a predetermined plane that includes a first axis and a second axis intersecting the first axis, holding the object; a mark detecting system that detects a plurality of marks formed on the object; an adjusting unit that adjusts optical properties of the optical system; and a controller that controls the adjusting unit so that the adjusting unit adjusts the optical properties based on detection results of a plurality of marks on the object that have been detected by the mark detecting system, at the stage where marks on the object to be detected by the mark detecting system remain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">With this apparatus, at the stage where the marks on the object to be detected by the mark detecting system remain, the adjusting unit is controlled by the controller to adjust optical properties of the optical system based on detection results of a plurality of marks on the object that have been detected with the mark detecting system. Accordingly, for example, in the cases such as when detection of an image of a mark (or pattern) by the optical system is performed after the adjustment of optical properties of the optical system, even if the image of the mark is shifted due to the adjustment, the image of the mark after the shift is measured, and consequently the shift of the image of the mark due to the adjustment of optical properties of the optical system does not become a measurement error factor. Further, since the adjustment is started based on the detection results of the marks that have been detected before detection of all the marks to be detected is finished, a period of time required for the adjustment can be overlapped with a period of time for detecting the remaining marks, which makes it possible to improve the throughput, compared with the conventional art in which the adjustment is started after detection of all the marks is finished.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">According to a sixth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a sixth pattern forming apparatus that projects a pattern on an object using an optical system, the apparatus comprising: a movable body that moves within a predetermined plane that includes a first axis and a second axis intersecting the first axis, holding the object; a mark detecting system that detects marks on the object mounted on the movable body; and a controller that performs a detection operation of the marks on the object during a period from when an operation of measuring a positional relation between a projection position of the pattern by the optical system and a detection center of the mark detecting system is started until when the operation is completed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">With this apparatus, during a period from when an operation of measuring a positional relation between a projection position of a pattern by the optical system and a detection center of the mark detecting system is stared until when the operation is completed, the controller performs a detection operation of the marks on the object mounted on the movable body by the mark detecting system. Accordingly, at the point in time when the measurement operation of the positional relation is completed, at least a part of the detection operation by the mark detecting system of a plurality of marks to be detected formed on the object can be finished. Thus, the throughput can be improved, compared with the case where the detection operation of the plurality of marks by the mark detecting system is performed before or after the measurement operation of the positional relation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">According to a seventh aspect of the present invention, there is provided a seventh pattern forming apparatus that projects a pattern on an object using an optical system, the apparatus comprising: a movable body that moves within a predetermined plane that includes a first axis and a second axis intersecting the first axis, holding the object; a mark detecting system that detects marks on the object mounted on the movable body; and a controller that performs a measurement operation of a positional relation between a projection position of the pattern by the optical system and a detection center of the mark detecting system during a period from when a detection operation of a plurality of marks to be detected formed on the object is started until before the operation is completed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">With this apparatus, during a period from when a detection operation by the mark detecting system of a plurality of marks to be detected formed on the object mounted on the movable body is started until before the operation is completed, the controller performs a measurement operation of a positional relation between a projection position of an image of the pattern by the optical system and a detection center of the mark detecting system. Accordingly, during a period when the detection operation by the mark detecting system of a plurality of marks to be detected formed on the object is performed, the measurement operation of the positional relation can be finished. Thus, the throughput can be improved, compared with the case where the measurement operation of the positional relation is performed before or after the detection operation by the mark detecting system of a plurality of marks to be detected formed on the object.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">According to an eighth aspect of the present invention, there is provided an eighth pattern forming apparatus that forms a pattern on an object, the apparatus comprising: a first movable body that moves within a predetermined plane that includes a first axis and a second axis intersecting the first axis, holding the object; a second movable body that moves independently from the first movable body within the plane; a mark detecting system that detects a plurality of marks to be detected formed on the object mounted on the first movable body; and a controller that controls the first movable body and the second movable body so that state switching is performed between a proximity state of making both the movable bodies come closer together at a predetermined distance or less and a separation state of separating both the movable bodies, wherein the controller performs an operation of the state switching during a period from when a detection operation of the plurality of marks to be detected formed on the object is started until before the detection operation is completed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">Herein, a proximity state of making the first movable body and the second movable body come closer together at a predetermined distance or less is a concept that also includes a state of making both the movable bodies come closer together at a distance of zero, that is, a state of making both the movable bodies come into contact with each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">With this apparatus, during a period from when a detection operation of a plurality of marks to be detected formed on the object mounted on the first movable body is started until before the detection operation is completed, the controller performs a state switching operation between a proximity state of making the first movable body and the second movable body come closer together at a predetermined distance or less and a separation state of separating both the movable bodies. Accordingly, during a period when the detection operation of a plurality of marks to be detected formed on the object is performed, the state switching operation can be finished. Thus, the throughput can be improved, compared with the case where the state switching operation is performed before or after the detection operation of a plurality of marks to be detected formed on the object.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">According to a ninth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a ninth pattern forming apparatus that forms a pattern on an object, the apparatus comprising: a movable body that moves within a predetermined plane that includes a first axis and a second axis intersecting the first axis, holding the object on which marks are each formed at a plurality of positions different from one another; a plurality of mark detecting systems that each detect the marks at positions different from one another on the object; a focus position changing unit that changes a relative positional relation between the plurality of mark detecting systems and the object mounted on the movable body in optical axis directions of the plurality of mark detecting systems that are perpendicular to the plane, simultaneously among the plurality of mark detecting systems; and a controller that simultaneously detects (measures) each of the marks formed at positions different from one another on the object using the plurality of mark detecting systems corresponding to each of the marks, while changing the relative positional relation in the optical axis directions by the focus position changing unit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">With this apparatus, the controller simultaneously detects each of the marks formed at positions different from one another on the object using the plurality of mark detecting systems corresponding to each of the marks, while changing a relative positional relation between the plurality of mark detecting systems and the object mounted on the movable body in a focus direction being a direction perpendicular to the predetermined plane by the focus position changing unit. Thus, by preferentially using each detection result of the mark, for example, in the most favorable focused state of each mark detecting system or the like, the marks formed at positions different from one another on the object can be detected with good precision without being affected by unevenness of the object surface or the best focus difference among the mark detecting systems.</div>

That is, the marks on the object can be detected using the mark detecting system, while controlling the position of the movable body with high precision based on the measurement values of the first head of the first axis encoder that faces the first grating and of the second head of the second axis encoder that faces the second grating.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">With this apparatus, the number of marks on the object that are simultaneously detected by a plurality of mark detecting systems differs depending on the position within the predetermined plane of the movable body that mounts the object, and therefore, when moving the movable body in a direction intersecting the second axis, for example, a direction parallel to the first axis (or a direction orthogonal to the second axis), the marks at positions different from one another on the object can be simultaneously detected using the required number of mark detecting systems in accordance with the position of the movable body in a direction intersecting the second axis.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">With this apparatus, the controller simultaneously detects each of the marks formed at positions different from one another on the object using a plurality of mark detecting systems corresponding to each of the marks, while changing a relative positional relation between a plurality of mark detecting systems and the object mounted on the movable body in a focus direction being a direction perpendicular to the predetermined plane by the focus position changing unit. Thus, by preferentially using each detection result of the mark, for example, in the most favorable focused state regarding each of the mark detecting systems or the like, the marks formed at positions different from one another on the object can be detected with good precision without being affected by unevenness of the object surface or the best focus difference among the mark detecting systems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">According to a twenty-second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a first pattern forming method of forming a pattern on an object, the method comprising: a detection process of detecting marks on the object mounted on a movable body using a mark detecting system, the movable body moving within a predetermined plane that includes a first axis and a second axis intersecting the first axis, and also having a surface on which a first grating having a grating whose periodic direction is a direction parallel to the first axis and a second grating having a grating whose periodic direction is a direction parallel to the second axis are arranged, wherein in the detection process, on detection of the marks, a position of the movable body is controlled based on measurement values by a measuring unit that has a first axis encoder that has a plurality of first heads whose positions are different in a direction parallel to the second axis and measures position information of the movable body in a direction parallel to the first axis by the first head that faces the first grating, and a second axis encoder that has a plurality of second heads whose positions are different in a direction parallel to the first axis and measures position information of the movable body in a direction parallel to the second axis by the second head that faces the second grating.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">With this method, at the stage where the marks on the object to be detected by the mark detecting system remain, optical properties of the optical system are adjusted based on the detection results of a plurality of marks on the object that have been detected by the mark detecting system. Accordingly, for example, in the cases such as when detection of an image of a mark (or a pattern) by the optical system is performed after the adjustment of optical properties of the optical system, even if the image of the mark is shifted due to the adjustment, the image of the mark after the shift is measured, and consequently the shift of the image of the mark due to the adjustment of optical properties of the optical system does not become a measurement error factor. Further, since the adjustment is started based on the detection results of the marks that have been detected, before detection of all the marks to be detected is finished, a period of time required for the adjustment can be overlapped with a period of time for detecting the remaining marks, which makes it possible to improve the throughput, compared with the conventional art in which the adjustment is started after detection of all the marks is finished.</div>

Accordingly, at the point in time when the measurement operation of the positional relation is completed, at least a part of the detection operation by the mark detecting system of a plurality of marks to be detected formed on the object can be finished. Thus, the throughput can be improved, compared with the case where the detection operation by the mark detecting system of the plurality of marks is performed before or after the measurement operation of the positional relation.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">Herein, a proximity state of making the first movable body and the second movable body come closer together at a predetermined distance or less is a concept that also includes a state of making both the movable bodies come closer together at a distance of zero, that is, a state of making both the movable bodies come into contact with each other.</div>

<heading id="h-0007">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">An embodiment of the present invention will be described below, with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 36</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically shows the configuration of an exposure apparatus <b>100</b> related to an embodiment. Exposure apparatus <b>100</b> is a scanning exposure apparatus by a step-and-scan method, that is, a so-called scanner. As will be described later, in the embodiment, a projection optical system PL is arranged, and the following description will be made assuming that a direction parallel to an optical axis AX of projection optical system PL is a Z-axis direction, a direction in which a reticle and a wafer are relatively scanned within a plane orthogonal to the Z-axis direction is a Y-axis direction and a direction that is orthogonal to a Z-axis and a Y-axis is an X-axis direction, and rotation (tilt) directions around the X-axis, the Y-axis and the Z-axis are θx, θy and θz directions respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">Exposure apparatus <b>100</b> is equipped with an illumination system <b>10</b>, a reticle stage RST that holds a reticle R that is illuminated by an illumination light for exposure (hereinafter, referred to as “illumination light” or “exposure light”) IL from illumination system <b>10</b>, a projection unit PU that includes projection optical system PL that projects illumination light IL emitted from reticle R on a wafer W, a stage unit <b>50</b> that has a wafer stage WST and a measurement stage MST, their control system, and the like. On wafer stage WST, wafer W is mounted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">Illumination system <b>10</b> includes a light source and an illumination optical system that has an illuminance uniformity optical system containing an optical integrator and the like, and a reticle blind and the like (none of which is shown), as is disclosed in, for example, Kokai (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication) No. 2001-313250 (the corresponding U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0025890) and the like. In illumination system <b>10</b>, a slit-shaped illumination area IAR on reticle R that is defined by the reticle blind (masking system) is illuminated by illumination light (exposure light) IL with substantially uniform illuminance. In this case, as illumination light IL, an ArF excimer laser light (wavelength: 193 nm) is used as an example. Further, as the optical integrator, for example, a fly-eye lens, a rod integrator (internal reflection type integrator), a diffraction optical element or the like can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">On reticle stage RST, reticle R having a pattern surface (the lower surface in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) on which a circuit pattern and the like are formed is fixed by, for example, vacuum suction. Reticle stage RST is finely drivable within an XY plane and also drivable at designated scanning velocity in a scanning direction (which is the Y-axis direction being a horizontal direction of the page surface of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), by a reticle stage drive system <b>11</b> (not shown <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) including, for example, a linear motor or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">Position information of reticle stage RST within the moving plane (including rotation information in the θz direction) is constantly detected at a resolution of, for example, around 0.5 to 1 nm with a reticle laser interferometer (hereinafter, referred to as a “reticle interferometer”) <b>116</b> via a movable mirror <b>15</b> (in actual, a Y movable mirror (or a retroreflector) having a reflection surface orthogonal to the Y-axis direction and an X movable mirror having a reflection surface orthogonal to the X-axis direction are arranged). The measurement values of reticle interferometer <b>116</b> are sent to a main controller <b>20</b> (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). Main controller <b>20</b> controls the position (and the velocity) of reticle stage RST by computing the position of reticle stage RST in the X-axis direction, the Y-axis direction and the θz direction based on the measurement values of reticle interferometer <b>116</b>, and controlling reticle stage drive system <b>11</b> based on the computation results. Incidentally, instead of movable mirror <b>15</b>, the end surface of reticle stage RST may be polished in order to form a reflection surface (corresponding to the reflection surface of movable mirror <b>15</b>). Further, reticle interferometer <b>116</b> may be capable of measuring also position information of reticle stage RST in at least one of the Z-axis, θx and θy directions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">Projection unit PU is placed below reticle stage RST in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Projection unit PU includes a barrel <b>40</b> and projection optical system PL having a plurality of optical elements that are held in a predetermined positional relation within barrel <b>40</b>. As projection optical system PL, for example, a dioptric system that is composed of a plurality of lenses (lens elements) that are arrayed along an optical axis AX direction parallel to the Z-axis direction is used. Projection optical system PL is, for example, both-side telecentric and has a predetermined projection magnification (such as one-quarter, one-fifth or one-eighth times). Therefore, when illumination area IAR is illuminated by illumination light IL from illumination system <b>10</b>, illumination light IL having passed through reticle R whose pattern surface is placed substantially coincidently with a first surface (object surface) of projection optical system PL forms a reduced image of a circuit pattern (a reduced image of part of a circuit pattern) of reticle R within illumination area IAR on an area (hereinafter, also referred to as an “exposure area”) IA that is conjugate with illumination area IAR on wafer W, which is placed on a second surface (image plane) side of projection optical system PL and whose surface is coated with resist (photosensitive agent), via projection optical system PL (projection unit PU). Although not shown in the drawing, projection unit PU is mounted on a barrel platform that is supported by three support columns via a vibration isolation mechanism. As is disclosed in, for example, the pamphlet of International Publication No. 2006/038952, however, projection unit PU may also be supported in a suspended state with respect to a main frame member (not shown) that is placed above projection unit PU, or a base member on which reticle stage RST is placed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">Note that in exposure apparatus <b>100</b> of the embodiment, since exposure applying the liquid immersion method is performed, the aperture on a reticle side becomes larger when the numerical aperture NA of projection optical system PL substantially increases. Therefore, in a dioptric system made up of only lenses, it becomes difficult to satisfy the Petzval condition, which tends to lead to an increase in size of the projection optical system. In order to avoid such an increase in size of the projection optical system, a catadioptric system including mirrors and lenses may also be used. Further, on wafer W, not only photosensitive layers but also, for example, a protective film (topcoat film) or the like that protects the wafer or the photosensitive layers may be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">Further, in exposure apparatus <b>100</b> of the embodiment, in order to perform exposure applying the liquid immersion method, a nozzle unit <b>32</b> that constitutes part of a local liquid immersion unit <b>8</b> is arranged so as to enclose the periphery of the lower end portion of barrel <b>40</b> that holds an optical element that is closest to an image plane side (wafer W side) that constitutes projection optical system PL, which is a lens (hereinafter, also referred to a “tip lens”) <b>191</b> in this case. In the embodiment, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the lower end surface of nozzle unit <b>32</b> is set to be substantially flush with the lower end surface of tip lens <b>191</b>. Further, nozzle unit <b>32</b> is equipped with a supply opening and a recovery opening of liquid Lq, a lower surface to which wafer W is placed facing and at which the recovery opening is arranged, and a supply flow channel and a recovery flow channel that are connected to a liquid supply pipe <b>31</b>A and a liquid recovery pipe <b>31</b>B respectively. As is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, liquid supply pipe <b>31</b>A and liquid recovery pipe <b>31</b>B are inclined at an angle of 45 degrees with respect to the X-axis direction and the Y-axis direction in a planer view (when viewed from above) and are symmetrically placed with respect to a straight line LV in the Y-axis direction that passes through optical axis AX of projection optical system PL.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">One end of a supply pipe (not shown) is connected to liquid supply pipe <b>31</b>A while the other end of the supply pipe is connected to a liquid supply unit <b>5</b> (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), and one end of a recovery pipe (not shown) is connected to liquid recovery pipe <b>31</b>B while the other end of the recovery pipe is connected to a liquid recovery unit <b>6</b> (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">Liquid supply unit <b>5</b> includes a liquid tank, a compression pump, a temperature controller, a valve for controlling supply/stop of the liquid to liquid supply pipe <b>31</b>A, and the like. As the valve, for example, a flow rate control valve is preferably used so that not only the supply/stop of the liquid but also the adjustment of flow rate can be performed. The temperature controller adjusts the temperature of the liquid within the liquid tank to nearly the same temperature, for example, as the temperature within the chamber (not shown) where the exposure apparatus is housed. Incidentally, the tank for supplying the liquid, the compression pump, the temperature controller, the valve, and the like do not all have to be equipped in exposure apparatus <b>100</b>, and at least part of them can also be substituted by the equipment or the like available in the plant where exposure apparatus <b>100</b> is installed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">Liquid recovery unit <b>6</b> includes a liquid tank, a suction pump, a valve for controlling recovery/stop of the liquid via liquid recovery pipe <b>31</b>B, and the like. As the valve, a flow rate control valve is preferably used similar to the valve of liquid supply unit <b>5</b>. Incidentally, the tank for recovering the liquid, the suction pump, the valve, and the like do not all have to be equipped in exposure apparatus <b>100</b>, and at least part of them can also be substituted by the equipment available in the plant where exposure apparatus <b>100</b> is installed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0136">In the embodiment, as the liquid described above, pure water (hereinafter, it will simply be referred to as “water” besides the case when specifying is necessary) that transmits the ArF excimer laser light (light with a wavelength of 193 nm) is to be used. Pure water can be obtained in large quantities at a semiconductor manufacturing plant or the like without difficulty, and it also has an advantage of having no adverse effect on the photoresist on the wafer, to the optical lenses or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">Refractive index n of the water with respect to the ArF excimer laser light is around 1.44. In the water the wavelength of illumination light IL is 193 nm×1/n, shorted to around 134 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0138">Liquid supply unit <b>5</b> and liquid recovery unit <b>6</b> each have a controller, and the respective controllers are controlled by main controller <b>20</b> (refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). According to instructions from main controller <b>20</b>, the controller of liquid supply unit <b>5</b> opens the valve connected to liquid supply pipe <b>31</b>A to a predetermined degree to supply water to the space between tip lens <b>191</b> and wafer W via liquid supply pipe <b>31</b>A, the supply flow channel and the supply opening. Further, when the water is supplied, according to instructions from main controller <b>20</b>, the controller of liquid recovery unit <b>6</b> opens the valve connected to liquid recovery pipe <b>31</b>B to a predetermined degree to recover the water from the space between tip lens <b>191</b> and wafer W into liquid recovery unit <b>6</b> (the liquid tank) via the recovery opening, the recovery flow channel and liquid recovery pipe <b>31</b>B. During the supply and recovery operations, main controller <b>20</b> gives commands to the controllers of liquid supply unit <b>5</b> and liquid recovery unit <b>6</b> so that the quantity of water supplied to the space between tip lens <b>191</b> and wafer W constantly equals the quantity of water recovered from the space. Accordingly, a constant quantity of liquid (water) Lq (refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is held in the space between tip lens <b>191</b> and wafer W. In this case, liquid (water) Lq held in the space between tip lens <b>191</b> and wafer W is constantly replaced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139">As is obvious from the above description, in the embodiment, local liquid immersion unit <b>8</b> is configured including nozzle unit <b>32</b>, liquid supply unit <b>5</b>, liquid recovery unit <b>6</b>, liquid supply pipe <b>31</b>A and liquid recovery pipe <b>31</b>B, and the like. Incidentally, part of local liquid immersion unit <b>8</b>, for example, at least nozzle unit <b>32</b> may also be supported in a suspended state by a main frame (including the barrel platform) that holds projection unit PU, or may also be arranged at another frame member that is separate from the main frame. Or, in the case projection unit PU is supported in a suspended state as is described earlier, nozzle unit <b>32</b> may also be supported in a suspended state integrally with projection unit PU, but in the embodiment, nozzle unit <b>32</b> is arranged on a measurement frame that is supported in a suspended state independently from projection unit PU. In this case, projection unit PU does not have to be supported in a suspended state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0140">Incidentally, also in the case measurement stage MST is located below projection unit PU, the space between a measurement table (to be described later) and tip lens <b>191</b> can be filled with water in the similar manner to the manner described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0141">Incidentally, in the above description, one liquid supply pipe (nozzle) and one liquid recovery pipe (nozzle) are to be arranged as an example. However, the present invention is not limited to this, and a configuration having multiple nozzles as disclosed in, for example, the pamphlet of International Publication No. 99/49504, may also be employed, in the case such arrangement is possible taking into consideration a relation with adjacent members. The point is that any configuration may be employed as far as the liquid can be supplied in the space between an optical member in the lowest end (tip lens) <b>191</b> constituting projection optical system PL and wafer W. For example, the liquid immersion mechanism disclosed in the pamphlet of International Publication No. 2004/053955, or the liquid immersion mechanism disclosed in the EP Patent Application Publication No. 1 420 298 can also be applied to the exposure apparatus of the embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0143" num="0142">Referring back to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, stage unit <b>50</b> is equipped with wafer stage WST and measurement stage MST that are placed above a base board <b>12</b>, an interferometer system <b>118</b> (refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) including Y-axis interferometers <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> that measure position information of stages WST and MST, an encoder system (to be described later) that is used for measuring position information of wafer stage WST on exposure or the like, a stage drive system <b>124</b> (refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) that drives stages WST and MST, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0144" num="0143">On the bottom surface of each of wafer stage WST and measurement stage MST, a noncontact bearing (not shown), for example, a vacuum preload type hydrostatic air bearing (hereinafter, referred to as an “air pad”) is arranged at a plurality of points, and wafer stage WST and measurement stage MST are supported in a noncontact manner via a clearance of around several μm above base board <b>12</b>, by static pressure of pressurized air that is blown out from the air pad toward the upper surface of base board <b>12</b>. Further, stages WST and MST are independently drivable in two-dimensional directions, which are the Y-axis direction (a horizontal direction of the page surface of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and the X-axis direction (an orthogonal direction to the page surface of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), by stage drive system <b>124</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0144">To be more specific, as is shown in the planar view in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, on a floor surface, a pair of Y-axis stators <b>86</b> and <b>87</b> extending in the Y-axis direction are respectively placed on one side and the other side in the X-axis direction having base board <b>12</b> in between. Y-axis stators <b>86</b> and <b>87</b> are each composed of, for example, a magnetic pole unit that incorporates a permanent magnet group that is made up of plural pairs of a north pole magnet and a south pole magnet that are placed at a predetermined distance and alternately along the Y-axis direction. At Y-axis stators <b>86</b> and <b>87</b>, two Y-axis movers <b>82</b> and <b>84</b>, and two Y-axis movers <b>83</b> and <b>85</b> are respectively arranged in a noncontact engaged state. In other words, four Y-axis movers <b>82</b>, <b>84</b>, <b>83</b> and <b>85</b> in total are in a sate of being inserted in the inner space of Y-axis stator <b>86</b> or <b>87</b> whose XZ sectional surface has a U-like shape, and are severally supported in a noncontact manner via a clearance of, for example, around several μm via the air pad (not shown) with respect to corresponding Y-axis stator <b>86</b> or <b>87</b>. Each of Y-axis movers <b>82</b>, <b>84</b>, <b>83</b> and <b>85</b> is composed of, for example, an armature unit that incorporates armature coils placed at a predetermined distance along the Y-axis direction. That is, in the embodiment, Y-axis movers <b>82</b> and <b>84</b> made up of the armature units and Y-axis stator <b>86</b> made up of the magnetic pole unit constitute moving coil type Y-axis linear motors respectively. Similarly, Y-axis movers <b>83</b> and <b>85</b> and Y-axis stator <b>87</b> constitute moving coil type Y-axis linear motors respectively. In the following description, each of the four Y-axis linear motors described above is referred to as a Y-axis linear motor <b>82</b>, a Y-axis linear motor <b>84</b>, a Y-axis linear motor <b>83</b> and a Y-axis linear motor <b>85</b> as needed, using the same reference codes as their movers <b>82</b>, <b>84</b>, <b>83</b> and <b>85</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0145">Movers <b>82</b> and <b>83</b> of two Y-axis linear motors <b>82</b> and <b>83</b> out of the four Y-axis linear motors are respectively fixed to one end and the other end in a longitudinal direction of an X-axis stator <b>80</b> that extends in the X-axis direction.

Further, plate <b>28</b> may be a single plate, but in the embodiment, plate <b>28</b> is configured by combining a plurality of plates, for example, first and second liquid repellent plates that correspond to first liquid repellent area <b>28</b> <i>a </i>and second liquid repellent area <b>28</b> <i>b </i>respectively. In the embodiment, pure water is used as liquid Lq as is described above, and therefore, hereinafter first liquid repellent area <b>28</b> <i>a </i>and second liquid repellent area <b>28</b> <i>b </i>are also referred to as first water repellent plate <b>28</b> <i>a </i>and second water repellent plate <b>28</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0153" num="0152">In this case, exposure light IL is irradiated to first water repellent plate <b>28</b> <i>a </i>on the inner side, while exposure light IL is hardly irradiated to second water repellent plate <b>28</b> <i>b </i>on the outer side. Taking this fact into consideration, in the embodiment, a first water repellent area to which water repellent coat having sufficient resistance to exposure light IL (light in a vacuum ultraviolet region, in this case) is applied is formed on the surface of first water repellent plate <b>28</b> <i>a</i>, and a second water repellent area to which water repellent coat having resistance to exposure light IL inferior to the first water repellent area is applied is formed on the surface of second water repellent plate <b>28</b> <i>b</i>. In general, since it is difficult to apply water repellent coat having sufficient resistance to exposure light IL (light in a vacuum ultraviolet region, in this case) to a glass plate, it is effective to separate the water repellent plate into two sections in this manner, i.e. first water repellent plate <b>28</b> <i>a </i>and second water repellent plate <b>28</b> <i>b </i>around it. Incidentally, the present invention is not limited to this, and two types of water repellent coat that have different resistance to exposure light IL may also be applied on the upper surface of the same plate in order to form the first water repellent area and the second water repellent area. Further, the same kind of water repellent coat may be applied to the first and second water repellent areas. For example, only one water repellent area may also be formed on the same plate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0154" num="0153">Further, as is obvious from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, at the end portion on the +Y side of first water repellent plate <b>28</b> <i>a</i>, a rectangular cutout is formed in the center portion in the X-axis direction, and a measurement plate <b>30</b> is embedded inside the rectangular space (inside the cutout) that is enclosed by the cutout and second water repellent plate <b>28</b> <i>b</i>. A fiducial mark FM is formed in the center in the longitudinal direction of measurement plate <b>30</b> (on a centerline LL of wafer table WTB), and a pair of aerial image measurement slit patterns (slit-shaped measurement patterns) SL are formed in the symmetrical placement with respect to the center of the fiducial mark on one side and the other side in the X-axis direction of the fiducial mark. As each of aerial image measurement slit patterns SL, an L-shaped slit pattern having sides along the Y-axis direction and X-axis direction, or two linear slit patterns extending in the X-axis and Y-axis directions respectively can be used, as an example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0155" num="0154">Further, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, inside wafer stage WST below each of aerial image measurement slit patterns SL, an L-shaped housing <b>36</b> in which an optical system containing an objective lens, a mirror, a relay lens and the like is housed is attached in a partially embedded state penetrating through part of the inside of wafer table WTB and stage main section <b>91</b>. Housing <b>36</b> is arranged in pairs corresponding to the pair of aerial image measurement slit patterns SL, although omitted in the drawing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0156" num="0155">The optical system inside housing <b>36</b> guides illumination light IL that has been transmitted through aerial image measurement slit pattern SL along an L-shaped route and emits the light toward a −Y direction. Incidentally, in the following description, the optical system inside housing <b>36</b> is described as a light-transmitting system <b>36</b> by using the same reference code as housing <b>36</b> for the sake of convenience.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0157" num="0156">Moreover, on the upper surface of second water repellent plate <b>28</b> <i>b</i>, multiple grating lines are directly formed in a predetermine pitch along each of four sides. More specifically, in areas on one side and the other side in the X-axis direction of second water repellent plate <b>28</b> <i>b </i>(both sides in the horizontal direction in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>), Y scales <b>39</b>Y<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>Y<sub>2 </sub>are formed respectively, and Y scales <b>39</b>Y<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>Y<sub>2 </sub>are each composed of a reflective grating (e.g. diffraction grating) having a periodic direction in the Y-axis direction in which grating lines <b>38</b> having the longitudinal direction in the X-axis direction are formed in a predetermined pitch along a direction parallel to the Y-axis (Y-axis direction).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0158" num="0157">Similarly, in areas on one side and the other side in the Y-axis direction of second water repellent plate <b>28</b> <i>b </i>(both sides in the vertical direction in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>), X scales <b>39</b>X<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>X<sub>2 </sub>are formed respectively, and X scales <b>39</b>X<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>X<sub>2 </sub>are each composed of a reflective grating (e.g. diffraction grating) having a periodic direction in the X-axis direction in which grating lines <b>37</b> having the longitudinal direction in the Y-axis direction are formed in a predetermined pitch along a direction parallel to the X-axis (X-axis direction). As each of the scales, the scale made up of a reflective diffraction grating RG (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>) that is created by, for example, hologram or the like on the surface of second water repellent plate <b>28</b> <i>b </i>is used. In this case, each scale has gratings made up of narrow slits, grooves or the like that are marked at a predetermined distance (pitch) as graduations. The type of diffraction grating used for each scale is not limited, and not only the diffraction grating made up of grooves or the like that are mechanically formed, but also, for example, the diffraction grating that is created by exposing interference fringe on a photosensitive resin may be used. However, each scale is created by marking the graduations of the diffraction grating, for example, in a pitch between 138 nm to 4 μm, for example, a pitch of 1 μm on a thin plate shaped glass. These scales are covered with the liquid repellent film (water repellent film) described above. Incidentally, the pitch of the grating is shown much wider in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> than the actual pitch, for the sake of convenience. The same is true also in other drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0158">In this manner, in the embodiment, since second water repellent plate <b>28</b> <i>b </i>itself constitutes the scales, a glass plate with low-thermal expansion is to be used as second water repellent plate <b>28</b> <i>b</i>. However, the present invention is not limited to this, and a scale member made up of a glass plate or the like with low-thermal expansion on which a grating is formed may also be fixed on the upper surface of wafer table WTB, for example, by a plate spring (or vacuum suction) or the like so as to prevent local shrinkage/expansion. In this case, a water repellent plate to which the same water repellent coat is applied on the entire surface may be used instead of plate <b>28</b>. Or, wafer table WTB may also be formed by materials with a low coefficient of thermal expansion, and in such a case, a pair of Y scales and a pair of X scales may be directly formed on the upper surface of wafer table WTB.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0159">Mirror finish is severally applied to the −Y end surface and the −X end surface of wafer table WTB, and a reflection surface <b>17</b> <i>a </i>and a reflection surface <b>17</b> <i>b </i>shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are formed. By severally projecting an interferometer beam (measurement beam) to reflection surface <b>17</b> <i>a </i>and reflection surface <b>17</b> <i>b </i>and receiving a reflected light of each beam, Y-axis interferometer <b>16</b> and an X-axis interferometer <b>126</b> (X-axis interferometer <b>126</b> is not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of interferometer system <b>118</b> (refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) measure a displacement of each reflection surface from a datum position (generally, a fixed mirror is placed on the side surface of projection unit PU, and the surface is used as a datum surface), that is, position information of wafer stage WST within the XY plane, and the measurement values are supplied to main controller <b>20</b>. In the embodiment, as both of Y-axis interferometer <b>16</b> and X-axis interferometer <b>126</b>, a multiaxial interferometer having a plurality of optical axes is used, and based on the measurement values of Y-axis interferometer <b>16</b> and X-axis interferometer <b>126</b>, main controller <b>20</b> can measure rotation information in the θx direction (i.e. pitching), rotation information in the θy direction (i.e. rolling), and rotation information in the θz direction (i.e. yawing) of wafer table WTB in addition to the X-position and Y-position of wafer table WTB. In the embodiment, however, position information within the XY plane (including the rotation information in the θz direction) of wafer stage WST (wafer table WTB) is mainly measured by an encoder system (to be described later) that includes the Y scales and the X scales described above and the like, and the measurement values of interferometers <b>16</b> and <b>126</b> are secondarily used in the cases such as when long-term fluctuation of the measurement values of the encoder system (e.g. due to deformation over time of the scales, or the like) is corrected (calibrated). Further, Y-axis interferometer <b>16</b> is used for measuring the Y-position of wafer table WTB or the like near the unloading position or the loading position (to be described later), for wafer replacement. Further, also in movement of wafer stage WST, for example, between a loading operation and an alignment operation, and/or between an exposure operation and an unloading operation, measurement information of interferometer system <b>118</b>, that is, at least one of position information in directions of five degrees of freedom (the X-axis, Y-axis, θx, θy and θz directions) is used. Incidentally, at least part of interferometer system <b>118</b> (such as an optical system) may be arranged at the main frame that holds projection unit PU, or may also be arranged integrally with projection unit PU that is supported in a suspended state as is described above, but, in the embodiment, interferometer system <b>118</b> is to be arranged at the measurement frame described above.</div>

However, the present invention is not limited to this, and a single stage that is movable in directions of six degrees of freedom may also be employed as wafer stage WST as a matter of course. Further, instead of reflection surface <b>17</b> <i>a </i>and reflection surface <b>17</b> <i>b</i>, a movable mirror made up of a planar mirror may also be arranged at wafer table WTB. Moreover, position information of wafer stage WST is to be measured using the reflection surface of the fixed mirror arranged at projection unit PU as a datum surface, but the position where the datum surface is placed is not limited to projection unit PU, and position information of wafer stage WST does not always have to be measured using the fixed mirror.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0161">Further, in the embodiment, position information of wafer stage WST measured by interferometer system <b>118</b> is not to be used in an exposure operation or an alignment operation (to be described later) but is to be mainly used in a calibration operation of the encoder system (i.e. calibration of measurement values) or the like. However, measurement information of interferometer system <b>118</b> (i.e. at least one of position information in directions of five degrees of freedom) may also be used in operations such as the exposure operation and/or the alignment operation. In the embodiment, the encoder system measures position information of wafer stage WST in directions of three degrees of freedom, that is, position information in the X-axis, Y-axis and θz directions. Then, in the exposure operation or the like, out of measurement information of interferometer system <b>118</b>, only position information related to different directions from measurement directions (the X-axis, Y-axis and θz directions) of position information of wafer stage WST by the encoder system, for example, related to the θx direction and/or the θy direction may also be used. Or, in addition to the position information related to different directions, position information related to the same directions as the measurement directions of the encoder system (i.e. at least one of the X-axis, Y-axis and θz directions) may also be used. Further, interferometer system <b>118</b> may also be capable of measuring position information of wafer stage WST in the Z-axis direction.

In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the plurality of detection points to which a detection beam is severally irradiated are not individually shown, but are shown as an elongate detection area AF that extends in the X-axis direction between irradiation system <b>90</b> <i>a </i>and photodetection system <b>90</b> <i>b</i>. Since the length of detection area AF in the X-axis direction is set to around the same as the diameter of wafer W, position information (surface position information) in the Z-axis direction across the entire surface of wafer W can be measured by only scanning wafer W in the Y-axis direction once. Further, since detection area AF is placed between liquid immersion area <b>14</b> (exposure area IA) and the detection areas of the alignment systems (AL<b>1</b>, AL<b>2</b> <sub>2</sub>, AL<b>2</b> <sub>2</sub>, AL<b>2</b> <sub>3 </sub>and AL<b>2</b> <sub>4</sub>) in the Y-axis direction, the detection operations of the multipoint AF system and the alignment systems can be performed in parallel.

Moreover, the plurality of detection points are to be placed along the X-axis direction. However, the present invention is not limited to this, and all of or some of the plurality of detection points may also be placed at different positions in the Y-axis direction. For example, the plurality of detection points may also be placed along a direction that intersects both of the X-axis and the Y-axis. That is, the positions of the plurality of detection points only have to be different at least in the X-axis direction. Further, a detection beam is to be irradiated to the plurality of detection points in the embodiment, but a detection beam may also be irradiated to, for example, the entire area of detection area AF.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0210" num="0209">In exposure apparatus <b>100</b> of the embodiment having the configuration described above, since the placement of X scales and Y scales on wafer table WTB as described above and the placement of X heads and Y heads as described above are employed, X scales <b>39</b>X<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>X<sub>2 </sub>and head units <b>62</b>B and <b>62</b>D (X heads <b>66</b>) respectively face each other, and Y scales <b>39</b>Y<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>Y<sub>2 </sub>and head units <b>62</b>A and <b>62</b>C (Y heads <b>64</b>) or Y heads <b>64</b> <i>y</i> <sub>1 </sub>and <b>64</b> <i>y</i> <sub>2 </sub>respectively face each other without fail in an effective stroke range of wafer stage WST (i.e. a range in which wafer stage WST moves for the alignment and the exposure operation, in the embodiment), as is exemplified in the drawings such as <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>. Incidentally, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>, the heads that face the corresponding X scales or Y scales are indicated by being circled.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0211" num="0210">Therefore, in the effective stroke range of wafer stage WST described above, main controller <b>20</b> can control position information (including rotation information in the θz direction) within the XY plane of wafer stage WST with high precision by controlling each motor constituting stage drive system <b>124</b>, based on at least three measurement values of encoders <b>70</b>A to <b>70</b>D. Since the influence of air fluctuations that the measurement values of encoders <b>70</b>A to <b>70</b>D receive is small enough to be ignored when comparing with the interferometer, the short-term stability of the measurement values that is affected by air fluctuations is remarkably better than that of the interferometer. Incidentally, in the embodiment, the sizes (e.g. the number of heads and/or the distance between the heads) of head units <b>62</b>B, <b>62</b>D, <b>62</b>A and <b>62</b>C are set in accordance with the effective stork range of wafer stage WST and the sizes (i.e. the formation range of diffraction gratings) of the scales. Accordingly, in the effective stroke range of wafer stage WST, all of four scales <b>39</b>X<sub>1</sub>, <b>39</b>X<sub>2</sub>, <b>39</b>Y<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>Y<sub>2 </sub>face head units <b>62</b>B, <b>62</b>D, <b>62</b>A and <b>62</b>C respectively, but all the four scales do not have to face the corresponding head units. For example, one of X scales <b>39</b>X<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>X<sub>2 </sub>and/or one of Y scales <b>39</b>Y<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>Y<sub>2 </sub>does/do not have to face the head unit. In the case one of X scales <b>39</b>X<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>X<sub>2 </sub>or one of Y scales <b>39</b>Y<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>Y<sub>2 </sub>does not face the head unit, three scales face the head units in the effective stroke range of wafer stage WST, and therefore, position information of wafer stage WST in the X-axis, Y-axis and θz directions can constantly be measured. Further, in the case one of X scales <b>39</b>X<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>X<sub>2 </sub>and one of Y scales <b>39</b>Y<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>Y<sub>2 </sub>do not face the head units, two scales face the head units in the effective stroke range of wafer stage WST, and therefore, position information of wafer stage WST in the θz direction cannot constantly be measured, but position information in the X-axis and Y-axis directions can constantly be measured. In this case, position control of wafer stage WST may also be performed using position information in the θz direction of wafer stage WST measured by interferometer system <b>118</b> in combination.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0212" num="0211">Further, when wafer stage WST is driven in the X-axis direction as indicated by an outline arrow in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, Y head <b>64</b> that measures the position in the Y-axis direction of wafer stage WST is sequentially switched to adjacent Y head <b>64</b> as indicated by arrows e<sub>1 </sub>and e<sub>2 </sub>in the drawing. For example, Y head <b>64</b> circled by a solid line is switched to Y head <b>64</b> circled by a dotted line. Therefore, the measurement values are transferred before and after the switching.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0217" num="0216">Optical system <b>64</b> <i>b </i>is equipped with a polarization beam splitter PBS whose separation plane is parallel to an XZ plane, a pair of reflection mirrors R<b>1</b> <i>a </i>and R<b>1</b> <i>b</i>, lenses L<b>2</b> <i>a </i>and L<b>2</b> <i>b</i>, quarter wavelength plates (hereinafter, referred to as a λ/4 plate) WP<b>1</b> <i>a </i>and WP<b>1</b> <i>b</i>, refection mirrors R<b>2</b> <i>a </i>and R<b>2</b> <i>b</i>, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0218" num="0217">Photodetection system <b>64</b> <i>c </i>includes a polarizer (analyzer), a photodetector, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0219" num="0218">In Y encoder <b>70</b>A, laser beam LB emitted from semiconductor laser LD is incident on polarization beam splitter PBS via lens L<b>1</b>, and is split by polarization into two beams LB<sub>1 </sub>and LB<sub>2</sub>.

Incidentally, “split by polarization” in this case means the splitting of an incident beam into a P-polarization component and an S-polarization component.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0220" num="0219">Predetermined-order diffraction beams that are generated from diffraction grating RG due to irradiation of beams LB<sub>1 </sub>and LB<sub>2</sub>, for example, the first-order diffraction beams are severally converted into a circular polarized light by λ/4 plates WP<b>1</b> <i>b </i>and WP<b>1</b> <i>a </i>via lenses L<b>2</b> <i>b </i>and L<b>2</b> <i>a</i>, and reflected by reflection mirrors R<b>2</b> <i>b </i>and R<b>2</b> <i>a </i>and then the beams pass through λ/4 plates WP<b>1</b> <i>b </i>and WP<b>1</b> <i>a </i>again and reach polarization beam splitter PBS by tracing the same optical path in the reversed direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0221" num="0220">Each of the polarization directions of the two beams that have reached polarization beam splitter PBS is rotated at an angle of 90 degrees with respect to the original direction. Therefore, the first-order diffraction beam of beam LB<sub>1 </sub>that was previously transmitted through polarization beam splitter PBS is reflected off polarization beam splitter PBS and is incident on photodetection system <b>64</b> <i>c</i>, and also the first-order diffraction beam of beam LB<sub>2 </sub>that was previously reflected off polarization beam splitter PBS is transmitted through polarization beam splitter PBS and is synthesized concentrically with the first-order diffraction beam of beam LB<sub>1 </sub>and is incident on photodetection system <b>64</b> <i>c. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0222" num="0221">Then, the polarization directions of the two first-order diffraction beams described above are uniformly arranged by the analyzer inside photodetection system <b>64</b> <i>c </i>and the beams interfere with each other to be an interference light, and the interference light is detected by the photodetector and is converted into an electric signal in accordance with the intensity of the interference light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0223" num="0222">As is obvious from the above description, in Y encoder <b>70</b>A, since the optical path lengths of two beams to be interfered are extremely short and also are almost equal to each other, the influence by air fluctuations can mostly be ignored. Then, when Y scale <b>39</b>Y<sub>1 </sub>(i.e. wafer stage WST) moves in the measurement direction (the Y-axis direction, in this case), the phase of each of the two beams changes and thus the intensity of the interference light changes. This change in the intensity of the interference light is detected by photodetection system <b>64</b> <i>c</i>, and position information in accordance with the intensity change is output as the measurement value of Y encoder <b>70</b>A. Other encoders <b>70</b>B, <b>70</b>C, <b>70</b>D and the like are also configured similar to encoder <b>70</b>A. As each encoder, an encoder having a resolution of, for example, around 0.1 nm is used. Incidentally, in the encoders of the embodiment, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, laser beam LB having a sectional shape that is elongated in the periodic direction of grating RG may also be used, as a detection light. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, beam LB is enlargedly shown exaggeratedly compared with grating RG.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0224" num="0223">In the meantime, the scales of the encoder lack the long-term mechanical stability, because the diffraction grating is deformed due to thermal expansion or other reasons, the pitch of the diffraction grating partially or entirely changes, or the like along with lapse of operating time. Therefore, since the errors included in the measurement values become larger along with lapse of operating time, the errors need to be corrected. In the following description, grating pitch correction and grating deformation correction of scales that are performed in exposure apparatus <b>100</b> of the embodiment will be described referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0225" num="0224">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, reference codes IBY<b>1</b> and IBY<b>2</b> indicate measurement beams of two optical axes out of multiple axes that are irradiated to refection surface <b>17</b> <i>a </i>of wafer table WTB from Y-axis interferometer <b>16</b>, and reference codes IBX<b>1</b> and IBX<b>2</b> indicate measurement beams of two optical axes out of multiple axes that are irradiated to refection surface <b>17</b> <i>b </i>of wafer table WTB from X-axis interferometer <b>126</b>. In this case, measurement beams IBY<b>1</b> and IBY<b>2</b> are placed symmetrically with respect to straight line LV (which coincides with a straight line connecting the centers of a plurality of X heads <b>66</b>), and the substantial measurement axes of Y-axis interferometer <b>16</b> coincide with straight line LV. Therefore, Y-axis interferometer <b>16</b> can measure the Y-position of wafer table WTB without Abbe errors. Similarly, measurement beams IBX<b>1</b> and IBX<b>2</b> are placed symmetrically with respect to straight line LH (which coincides with a straight line connecting the centers of a plurality of Y heads <b>64</b>) that passes through the optical axis of projection optical system PL and is parallel to the X-axis, and the substantial measurement axes of X-axis interferometer <b>126</b> coincide with straight line LH parallel to the X-axis that passes through the optical axis of projection optical system PL. Therefore, X-axis interferometer <b>126</b> can measure the X-position of wafer table WTB without Abbe errors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0226" num="0225">First, deformation of grating lines (warp of grating lines) of the X scales and correction of pitch of grating lines of the Y scales will be described. Herein, reflection surface <b>17</b> <i>b </i>is assumed to be an ideal plane, for the sake of simplification of the description.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0227" num="0226">First of all, main controller <b>20</b> drives wafer stage WST based on the measurement values of Y-axis interferometer <b>16</b> and X-axis interferometer <b>126</b>, and as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the position of wafer stage WST is set at a position with which Y scales <b>39</b>Y<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>Y<sub>2 </sub>are placed just below corresponding head units <b>62</b>A and <b>62</b>C (at least one head) respectively, and also one ends on the +Y side of Y scales <b>39</b>Y<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>Y<sub>2 </sub>(diffraction gratings) coincide with corresponding head units <b>62</b>A and <b>62</b>C respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0228" num="0227">Next, main controller <b>20</b> moves wafer stage WST in the +Y direction as is indicated by an arrow F in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> at a low speed at a level in which short-term fluctuation of the measurement value of Y-axis interferometer <b>16</b> can be ignored and with the measurement value of X-axis interferometer <b>126</b> being fixed to a predetermined value, while maintaining all of the pitching amount, the rolling amount and the yawing amount to zero based on the measurement values of Y-axis interferometer <b>16</b> and Z sensors <b>74</b> <sub>1,4</sub>, <b>74</b> <sub>2,4</sub>, <b>76</b> <sub>1,3 </sub>and <b>76</b> <sub>2,3</sub>, until, for example, the other ends (the ends on the −Y side) of Y scales <b>39</b>Y<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>Y<sub>2 </sub>coincide with corresponding head units <b>62</b>A and <b>62</b>C respectively (in the effective stroke range described above). During the movement, main controller <b>20</b> loads the measurement values of Y linear encoders <b>70</b>A and <b>70</b>C and the measurement values of Y-axis interferometer <b>16</b> (the measurement values by measurement beams IBY<b>1</b> and IBY<b>2</b>) at predetermined sampling intervals, and obtains a relation between the measurement values of Y linear encoders <b>70</b>A and <b>70</b>C and the measurement values of Y-axis interferometer <b>16</b> based on the loaded measurement values. That is, main controller <b>20</b> obtains a grating pitch (a distance between adjacent grating lines) of Y scales <b>39</b>Y<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>Y<sub>2 </sub>that are sequentially placed facing head units <b>62</b>A and <b>62</b>C according to the movement of wafer stage WST and correction information on the grating pitch. The correction information can be obtained, for example, as a correction map that shows a relation between both measurement values in a curved line in the case a horizontal axis indicates the measurement value of the interferometer and a vertical axis indicates the measurement values of the encoders, or the like. The measurement values of Y-axis interferometer <b>16</b> in this case are obtained when scanning wafer stage WST at the extremely low speed described above, and therefore, it can be thought that the measurement values are accurate values in which error can be ignored, because not only a long-term fluctuation error but also a short-term fluctuation error caused by air fluctuations or the like are hardly included in the measurement values. Incidentally, a grating pitch (a distance between adjacent grating lines) of Y scales <b>39</b>Y<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>Y<sub>2 </sub>and correction information on the grating pitch may also be obtained in the procedures similar to the above, by moving wafer stage WST in the −Y direction within the range described above as is indicated by an arrow F′ in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Herein, wafer stage WST is to be driven in the Y-axis direction across the range where both ends of Y scales <b>39</b>Y<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>Y<sub>2 </sub>traverse corresponding head units <b>62</b>A and <b>62</b>C. However, the drive range is not limited to this, and wafer stage WST may also be driven, for example, in the range in the Y-axis direction in which wafer stage WST is moved at the time of exposure operation of a wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0229" num="0228">Further, main controller <b>20</b> also obtains correction information on deformation (warp) of grating lines <b>37</b> that have sequentially faced a plurality of X heads <b>66</b> by performing a predetermined statistical computation, using the measurement values obtained from the plurality of X heads <b>66</b> of head units <b>62</b>B and <b>62</b>D that are sequentially placed facing X scales <b>39</b>X<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>X<sub>2 </sub>according to the movement of wafer stage WST during the movement and the measurement value of interferometer <b>16</b> corresponding to each of the measurement values. On the computation, main controller <b>20</b> computes, for example, the measurement values (or arithmetic weighted mean) of the plurality of heads of head units <b>62</b>B and <b>62</b>D that are sequentially placed facing X scales <b>39</b>X<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>X<sub>2 </sub>and the like, as the correction information on grating warp. This is because the same variation pattern should repeatedly appear in the process where wafer stage WST is moved in the +Y direction or the −Y direction in the case reflection surface <b>17</b> <i>b </i>is an ideal plane, and therefore, correction information on deformation (warp) of grating lines <b>37</b> that have sequentially faced the plurality of X heads <b>66</b> can be accurately obtained by averaging the measurement data obtained by the plurality of X heads <b>66</b>, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0230" num="0229">Incidentally, in the case reflection surface <b>17</b> <i>b </i>is not an ideal plane, the unevenness (bending) of the reflection surface is measured and correction data of the bending is obtained in advance. Then, on the movement of wafer stage WST in the +Y direction or the −Y direction described above, wafer stage WST may accurately be moved in the Y-axis direction by controlling the X-position of wafer stage WST based on the correction data instead of fixing the measurement value of X-axis interferometer <b>126</b> to a predetermined value. Thus, correction information on grating pitch of the Y-scales and correction information on deformation (warp) of grating lines <b>37</b> can be obtained in the same manner as described above. Incidentally, measurement data obtained by a plurality of X heads <b>66</b> is data in plural on the basis of different areas on reflection surface <b>17</b> <i>b</i>, and the heads each measure deformation (warp) of the same grating line, and therefore, there is an incidental effect that the residual error after warp correction of the reflection surface is averaged to be approximate to the true value by the averaging described above and the like (in other words, the influence of the warp residual error can be reduced by averaging the measurement data (warp information on grating lines) obtained by the plurality of heads).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0231" num="0230">Next, deformation of grating lines (warp of grating lines) of the Y scales and correction of pitch of grating lines of the X scales will be described.

That is, main controller <b>20</b> obtains a grating pitch of X scales <b>39</b>X<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>X<sub>2 </sub>that are sequentially placed facing head units <b>62</b>B and <b>62</b>D according to the movement of wafer stage WST and correction information on the grating pitch. The correction information can be obtained, for example, as a map that shows a relation between both measurement values in a curved line in the case a horizontal axis indicates the measurement value of the interferometer and a vertical axis indicates the measurement values of the encoders, or the like. The measurement values of X-axis interferometer <b>126</b> in this case are obtained when scanning wafer stage WST at the extremely low speed described above, and therefore, it can be thought that the measurement values are accurate values in which error can be ignored, because not only a long-term fluctuation error but also a short-term fluctuation error caused by air fluctuations are hardly included in the measurement values.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0233" num="0232">Further, main controller <b>20</b> also obtains correction information on deformation (warp) of grating lines <b>38</b> that have sequentially faced a plurality of Y heads <b>64</b> by performing a predetermined statistical computation, using the measurement values obtained from the plurality of Y heads <b>64</b> of head units <b>62</b>A and <b>62</b>C that are sequentially placed facing Y scales <b>39</b>Y<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>Y<sub>2 </sub>according to the movement of wafer stage WST during the movement and the measurement value of interferometer <b>126</b> corresponding to each of the measurement values. On the computation, main controller <b>20</b> computes, for example, the measurement values (or arithmetic weighted mean) of the plurality of heads of head units <b>62</b>A and <b>62</b>C that are sequentially placed facing Y scales <b>39</b>Y<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>Y<sub>2 </sub>and the like, as the correction information on grating warp. This is because the same variation pattern should repeatedly appear in the process where wafer stage WST is moved in the +X direction or the −X direction in the case reflection surface <b>17</b> <i>a </i>is an ideal plane, and therefore, correction information on deformation (warp) of grating lines <b>38</b> that have sequentially faced the plurality of Y heads <b>64</b> can be accurately obtained by averaging the measurement data obtained by the plurality of Y heads <b>64</b>, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0234" num="0233">Incidentally, in the case where reflection surface <b>17</b> <i>a </i>is not an ideal plane, the unevenness (bending) of the reflection surface is measured and correction data of the bending is obtained in advance. Then, on the movement of wafer stage WST in the +X direction or the −X direction described above, wafer stage WST may accurately be moved in the X-axis direction by controlling the Y-position of wafer stage WST based on the correction data instead of fixing the measurement value of Y-axis interferometer <b>16</b> to a predetermined value. Thus, correction information on grating pitch of the X-scales and correction information on deformation (warp) of grating lines <b>38</b> can be obtained in the same manner as described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0235" num="0234">As is described above, main controller <b>20</b> obtains correction information on grating pitch of the Y scales and correction information on deformation (warp) of grating lines <b>37</b>, and correction information on grating pitch of the X scales and correction information on deformation (warp) of grating lines <b>38</b> at each predetermined timing, for example, with respect to each lot, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0236" num="0235">Then, during the exposure processing of wafers in a lot or the like, while correcting the measurement values obtained from head units <b>62</b>A and <b>62</b>C (i.e. the measurement values of encoders <b>70</b>A and <b>70</b>C) based on the correction information on grating pitch of the Y scales and the correction information on deformation (warp) of grating lines <b>38</b>, main controller <b>20</b> performs position control of wafer stage WST in the Y-axis direction. Thus, it becomes possible to perform position control of wafer stage WST in the Y-axis direction with good accuracy using Y linear encoders <b>70</b>A and <b>70</b>C without being affected by change over time in grating pitch of the Y scales and warp of grating lines <b>38</b>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0238" num="0237">Incidentally, in the description above, correction information on grating pitch and grating line warp is to be obtained for all of Y scales <b>39</b>Y<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>Y<sub>2 </sub>and X scales <b>39</b>X<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>X<sub>2</sub>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0244" num="0243">Next, main controller <b>20</b> moves wafer stage WST in the +Y direction by a predetermined distance based on the measurement values of the four encoders, and sets the position of wafer stage WST at a position at which five alignment systems AL<b>1</b> and AL<b>2</b> <sub>1 </sub>to AL<b>2</b> <sub>4 </sub>can almost simultaneously and individually detect the alignment marks arranged in the five second alignment shot areas AS on wafer W, and almost simultaneously and individually detects the five alignment marks using five alignment systems AL<b>1</b> and AL<b>2</b> <sub>1 </sub>to AL<b>2</b> <sub>4</sub>, and then links the detection results of five alignment systems AL<b>1</b> and AL<b>2</b> <sub>1 </sub>to AL<b>2</b> <sub>4 </sub>and the measurement values of the four encoders at the time of the detection and stores them in a memory (not shown).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0247" num="0246">Then, main controller <b>20</b> computes an array of all the shot areas on wafer W on a coordinate system (e.g. an XY coordinate system using the optical axis of projection optical system PL as its origin) that is set by the measurement axes of the four encoders (four head units), by performing a statistical computation by the EGA method, which is disclosed in, for example, Kokai (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication) No. 61-044429 (the corresponding U.S. Pat. No. 4,780,617) and the like, using the detection results of a total of 16 alignment marks and the corresponding measurement values of the four encoders obtained in the manner described above, and the baseline of secondary alignment system AL<b>2</b> <sub>n</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0248" num="0247">As is described above, in the embodiment, by moving wafer stage WST in the +Y direction and setting the position of wafer stage WST at four points on the moving route, position information of alignment marks in the alignment shot areas AS at 16 points in total can be obtained in a remarkably shorter period of time, compared with the case where a single alignment system sequentially detects alignment marks at 16 points. In this case, for example, as it is easier to understand in particular when considering alignment systems AL<b>1</b>, AL<b>2</b> <sub>2 </sub>and AL<b>2</b> <sub>3</sub>, each of alignment systems AL<b>1</b>, AL<b>2</b> <sub>2 </sub>and AL<b>2</b> <sub>3 </sub>detects a plurality of alignment marks arrayed along the Y-axis direction that are sequentially placed within the detection area (e.g. corresponding to the irradiation area of the detection light), associated with the operation of moving wafer stage WST described above. Therefore, on the foregoing measurement of the alignment marks, it is not necessary to move wafer stage WST in the X-axis direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0249" num="0248">Further, in this case, the number of detection points (the number of measurement points) of alignment marks on wafer W that are almost simultaneously detected by a plurality of alignment systems differs depending on the position within the XY plane of wafer stage WST (the Y-position in particular (i.e. the access degree of wafer W to a plurality of alignment systems). Therefore, when moving wafer stage WST in the Y-axis direction that is orthogonal to the array direction (X-axis direction) of a plurality of alignment systems, the marks at positions different from one another on wafer W can be detected simultaneously using the required number of alignment systems, in accordance with the position of wafer stage WST, in other words, in accordance with the shot array on wafer W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0250" num="0249">Meanwhile, the surface of wafer W is not an ideal plane and normally has some unevenness. Accordingly, in the case the simultaneous measurement by a plurality of alignment systems described above is performed only at a certain position in the Z-axis direction (direction parallel to optical axis AX of projection optical system PL) of wafer table WTB, it is highly probable that at least one alignment system performs detection of an alignment mark in a defocused state. Thus, in the embodiment, measurement error of positions of alignment marks, which is caused by detection of alignment marks performed in a defocused state, is suppressed in the manner described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0251" num="0250">That is, main controller <b>20</b> controls stage drive system <b>124</b> (Z-leveling mechanism (not shown)) and a plurality of alignment systems AL<b>1</b> and AL<b>2</b> <sub>1 </sub>to AL<b>2</b> <sub>4 </sub>so that each of alignment marks formed at the positions that are different from one another on wafer W is almost simultaneously detected by each alignment system corresponding to each alignment mark, while changing a relative positional relation in the Z-axis direction (focus direction) perpendicular to the XY plane between alignment systems AL<b>1</b> and AL<b>2</b> <sub>1 </sub>to AL<b>2</b> <sub>4 </sub>and wafer W mounted on wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST) using the Z-leveling mechanism that constitutes part of stage drive system <b>124</b>, at each position at which the position of wafer stage WST is set for detecting the alignment marks in the respective alignment shot areas described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0252" num="0251"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A to 13C</figref> show a status where detection of marks on wafer W is performed by five alignment systems AL<b>1</b> and AL<b>2</b> <sub>1 </sub>to AL<b>2</b> <sub>4 </sub>in the state shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> where the position of wafer stage WST is set at the detection position of alignment marks in the third alignment shot areas described above. Each of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A to 13C</figref> shows a status where wafer table WTB (wafer W) is located at the different Z-position and different alignment marks are almost simultaneously being detected using alignment systems AL<b>1</b> and AL<b>2</b> <sub>1 </sub>to AL<b>2</b> <sub>4</sub>. In the state of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>, alignment systems AL<b>2</b> <sub>1 </sub>and AL<b>2</b> <sub>4 </sub>on both sides are in a focused state and the remaining alignment systems are in a defocused state.

In the state of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref>, only alignment system AL<b>1</b> in the center is in a focused state and the remaining alignment systems are in a defocused state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0253" num="0252">In this manner, by performing simultaneous measurement of alignment marks by alignment systems AL<b>1</b> and AL<b>2</b> <sub>1 </sub>to AL<b>2</b> <sub>4 </sub>while changing a relative positional relation in the Z-axis direction (focus direction) between a plurality of alignment systems AL<b>1</b> and AL<b>2</b> <sub>1 </sub>to AL<b>2</b> <sub>4 </sub>and wafer W mounted on wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST) by changing the Z-position of wafer table WTB (wafer W), any of the alignment systems can measure the alignment marks in a substantially best focused state. Accordingly, main controller <b>20</b> can accurately detect the marks formed at positions different from one another on wafer W without being affected by unevenness of the wafer W surface or the best focus difference among a plurality of alignment systems, by preferentially using the detection result of the mark, for example, in the most favorable focused state of each alignment system, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0254" num="0253">Incidentally, in the description above, for example, the detection result of the mark in the most favorable focused state of each alignment system is to be preferentially used. However, the present invention is not limited to this, and main controller <b>20</b> may obtain position information of alignment marks also using the detection results of the marks in a defocused state. In this case, the detection results of the marks in a defocused state may also be used by multiplying the detection results by the weight in accordance with the defocused state. Further, the detection result of the mark in the defocused state is sometimes better than that in the best focused state, for example, depending on materials of layers formed on the wafer. In this case, detection of the marks is performed in the focus state with which the most favorable result can be obtained, that is, in a defocused state, and position information of the marks may be obtained using the detection results.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0255" num="0254">Further, as can be seen from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A to 13C</figref>, all the optical axes of all the alignment systems do not always coincide with the same ideal direction (Z-axis direction) accurately, and due to the influence of this tilt (telecentricity) of the optical axes with respect to the Z-axis, the detection results of positions of the alignment marks could include error. Accordingly, it is preferable that the tilt with respect to the Z-axis of the optical axes of all the alignment systems is measured in advance, and the detection results of positions of the alignment marks are corrected based on the measurement results.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0256" num="0255">Next, baseline measurement (baseline check) of primary alignment system AL<b>1</b> will be described.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0265" num="0264">e. On the baseline measurement of the secondary alignment system performed to the wafer at the head of a lot (hereinafter, also referred to as “Sec-BCHK” as needed), first of all, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, main controller <b>20</b> detects a specific alignment mark on wafer W (process wafer) at the head of a lot with primary alignment system AL<b>1</b> (refer to a star-shaped mark in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>). Then, main controller <b>20</b> makes the detection result correspond to the measurement values of encoders <b>70</b>A to <b>70</b>D at the time of the detection, and stores them in a memory. In the state of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, the position within the XY plane of wafer table WTB is controlled by main controller <b>20</b> based on two X heads <b>66</b> facing X scales <b>39</b>X<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>X<sub>2 </sub>(encoders <b>70</b>B and <b>70</b>D) and two Y heads <b>64</b> <i>y</i> <sub>2 </sub>and <b>64</b> <i>y</i> <sub>1 </sub>facing Y scales <b>39</b>Y<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>Y<sub>2 </sub>(encoders <b>70</b>A and <b>70</b>C).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0266" num="0265">f. Next, main controller <b>20</b> moves wafer stage WST in the −X direction by a predetermined distance, and as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>, detects the specific alignment mark with secondary alignment system AL<b>2</b> <sub>1 </sub>(refer to a star-shaped mark in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>), and makes the detection result correspond to the measurement values of encoders <b>70</b>A to <b>70</b>D and stores them in a memory.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0267" num="0266">g. Similarly, main controller <b>20</b> sequentially moves wafer stage WST in the +X direction and sequentially detects the specific alignment mark with the remaining secondary alignment systems AL<b>2</b> <sub>2</sub>, AL<b>2</b> <sub>3 </sub>and AL<b>2</b> <sub>4</sub>, and then sequentially makes the detection results correspond to the measurement values of encoders <b>70</b>A to <b>70</b>D at the time of the detection and stores them in a memory.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0268" num="0267">h. Then, main controller <b>20</b> computes the baseline of each secondary alignment system AL<b>2</b> <sub>n </sub>based on the processing results of the above “e”, and the processing results of the above “f” or “g”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0269" num="0268">In this manner, since the baseline of each secondary alignment system AL<b>2</b> <sub>n </sub>is obtained by detecting the same alignment mark on wafer W with primary alignment system AL<b>1</b> and each secondary alignment system AL<b>2</b> <sub>n </sub>using wafer W (process wafer) at the head of a lot, the difference in detection offset among the alignment systems caused by the process can be corrected by this processing consequently. Incidentally, baseline measurement of secondary alignment system AL<b>2</b> <sub>n </sub>may also be performed using a datum mark on wafer stage WST or measurement stage MST, instead of the alignment mark on the wafer. In this case, fiducial mark FM of measurement plate <b>30</b> used in the baseline measurement of primary alignment system AL<b>1</b> may be used, that is, fiducial mark FM may also be measured by each secondary alignment system AL<b>2</b> <sub>n</sub>. Or, for example, the “n” number of datum marks are arranged on wafer stage WST or measurement stage MST in the same positional relation as that of secondary alignment system AL<b>2</b> <sub>n</sub>, and detection of the datum marks by secondary alignment system AL<b>2</b> <sub>n </sub>may also be executable almost simultaneously. As the datum marks, for example, reference marks M of CD bar <b>46</b> may also be used. Moreover, the datum marks for baseline measurement of secondary alignment system AL<b>2</b> <sub>n </sub>may be arranged on wafer stage WST in a predetermined positional relation with fiducial mark FM for baseline measurement of primary alignment system AL<b>1</b>, and detection of the datum marks by secondary alignment system AL<b>2</b> <sub>n </sub>may also be executable almost simultaneously with detection of fiducial mark FM by primary alignment system AL<b>1</b>. In this case, the number of datum marks for baseline measurement of secondary alignment system AL<b>2</b> <sub>n </sub>may be one, or the datum marks may be arranged in plural, for example, the same number as the number of secondary alignment system AL<b>2</b> <sub>n</sub>. Further, in the embodiment, since each of primary alignment system AL<b>1</b> and secondary alignment system AL<b>2</b> <sub>n </sub>can detect two-dimensional marks (X and Y marks), the baselines in the X-axis and the Y-axis directions of secondary alignment system AL<b>2</b> <sub>n </sub>can be obtained simultaneously by using the two-dimensional marks at the time of baseline measurement of secondary alignment system AL<b>2</b> <sub>n</sub>. In the embodiment, fiducial mark FM and reference marks M, and the alignment marks on the wafer include, for example, the one-dimensional X mark and Y mark in which a plurality of line marks are periodically arrayed in the X-axis and Y-axis directions respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0270" num="0269">Next, a Sec-BCHK operation, which is performed at predetermined timing during the processing of wafers in a lot, for example, a period from when exposure of a wafer ends until when the loading of the next wafer on wafer table WTB is completed, that is, during wafer replacement, will be described. In this case, because the Sec-BCHK is performed at intervals of each wafer replacement, hereinafter the Sec-BCHK is also referred to as the Sec-BCHK (interval).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0271" num="0270">On this Sec-BCHK (interval), as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, main controller <b>20</b> moves measurement stage MST so that straight line LV on which the detection center of primary alignment system AL<b>1</b> is placed substantially coincides with centerline CL and also CD bar <b>46</b> faces primary alignment system AL<b>1</b> and secondary alignment system AL<b>2</b> <sub>n</sub>. Then, main controller <b>20</b> adjusts the θz rotation of CD bar <b>46</b> based on the measurement values of a pair of reference gratings <b>52</b> on CD bar <b>46</b> and Y heads <b>64</b> <i>y</i> <sub>1 </sub>and <b>64</b> <i>y</i> <sub>2 </sub>indicated by being circled in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> that face the pair of reference gratings <b>52</b> respectively (Y-axis linear encoders <b>70</b>E and <b>70</b>F), and also adjusts the XY-position of CD bar <b>46</b>, for example, using the measurement values of the interferometers, based on the measurement values of primary alignment system AL<b>1</b> indicated by being circled in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> that detects reference mark M located on centerline CL of measurement table MTB or in the vicinity thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0272" num="0271">Then, in this state, main controller <b>20</b> obtains each of the baselines of four secondary alignment systems AL<b>2</b> <sub>1 </sub>to AL<b>2</b> <sub>4</sub>, by simultaneously measuring reference mark M on CD bar <b>46</b> that is located within the field of each of the secondary alignment systems using four secondary alignment systems AL<b>2</b> <sub>1 </sub>to AL<b>2</b> <sub>4</sub>. Then, on the subsequent processing, drift of the baselines of four secondary alignment systems AL<b>2</b> <sub>1 </sub>to AL<b>2</b> <sub>4 </sub>is corrected by using the newly measured baselines.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0273" num="0272">Incidentally, the Sec-BCHK (interval) described above is to be performed by simultaneous measurement of different reference marks by a plurality of secondary alignment systems. However, the present invention is not limited to this, and each of the baselines of four secondary alignment systems AL<b>2</b> <sub>1 </sub>to AL<b>2</b> <sub>4 </sub>may also be obtained by sequentially (nonsimultaneously) measuring the same reference mark M on CD bar <b>46</b> with a plurality of secondary alignment systems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0274" num="0273">Next, the operation of position adjustment of secondary alignment system AL<b>2</b> <sub>n </sub>will be briefly described based on <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0275" num="0274">It is assumed that a positional relation between primary alignment system AL<b>1</b> and four secondary alignment systems AL<b>2</b> <sub>1 </sub>to AL<b>2</b> <sub>4 </sub>is the positional relation shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>, before the adjustment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0276" num="0275">As is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>, main controller <b>20</b> moves measurement stage MST so that primary alignment system AL<b>1</b> and four secondary alignment systems AL<b>2</b> <sub>1 </sub>to AL<b>2</b> <sub>4 </sub>are located above CD bar <b>46</b>. Next, in the similar manner to the case of the Sec-BCHK (interval) described above, main controller <b>20</b> adjusts the θz rotation of CD bar <b>46</b> based on the measurement values of Y-axis linear encoders <b>70</b>E and <b>70</b>F (Y heads <b>64</b> <i>y</i> <sub>1 </sub>and <b>64</b> <i>y</i> <sub>2</sub>), and also adjust the XY-position of CD bar <b>46</b> based on the measurement values of primary alignment system AL<b>1</b> that detects reference mark M located on centerline CL of measurement table MTB or in the vicinity thereof. Simultaneously with this adjustment, main controller <b>20</b> rotates each of arms <b>56</b> at the tip of which each secondary alignment system AL<b>2</b> <sub>n </sub>is arranged, around each rotation center as indicated by arrows in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>, by driving rotation drive mechanisms <b>60</b> <sub>1 </sub>to <b>60</b> <sub>4 </sub>based on shot map information including information on size and placement of alignment shot areas on a wafer to be exposed next (i.e. placement of alignment marks on the wafer). In this case, main controller <b>20</b> stops the rotation of each arm <b>56</b> at the position where a desired reference mark M on CD bar <b>46</b> is located in the field (detection area) of each secondary alignment system AL<b>2</b> <sub>n</sub>, while monitoring detection results of each secondary alignment system AL<b>2</b> <sub>n</sub>. Thus, the baseline of secondary alignment system AL<b>2</b> <sub>n </sub>is adjusted (changed) in accordance with the placement of alignment marks arranged in the alignment shot areas to be detected. In other words, the position in the X-axis direction of the detection area of secondary alignment system AL<b>2</b> <sub>n </sub>is changed. Thus, only by moving wafer W in the Y-axis direction, a plurality alignment marks whose positions in the X-axis direction are substantially the same and whose positions in the Y-axis direction are different on wafer W can be sequentially detected by each secondary alignment system AL<b>2</b> <sub>n</sub>. In the embodiment, in the wafer alignment operation, that is, in the detection operation of the alignment marks on the wafer by primary alignment system AL<b>1</b> and secondary alignment system AL<b>2</b> <sub>n</sub>, wafer W is to be one-dimensionally moved only in the Y-axis direction. However, during the operation, the detection area of at least one secondary alignment system AL<b>2</b> <sub>n </sub>and wafer W may also be relatively moved in a direction different from the Y-axis direction (e.g. in the X-axis direction). In this case, the position of the detection area may be adjusted by the movement of secondary alignment system AL<b>2</b> <sub>n</sub>, or only wafer W may be moved in view of the adjustment period of time or change in the baseline.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0277" num="0276">Then, after the baseline of secondary alignment system AL<b>2</b> <sub>n </sub>is adjusted in this manner, main controller <b>20</b> fixes each arm <b>56</b> <sub>n </sub>to a main frame (not shown) by suction by activating each vacuum pad <b>58</b> <sub>n</sub>. Thus, a state of each arm <b>56</b> <sub>n </sub>after the rotation angle adjustment is maintained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0278" num="0277">Incidentally, in the above description, reference marks M formed at different positions on CD bar <b>46</b> are to be simultaneously and individually detected with five alignment systems AL<b>1</b> and AL<b>2</b> <sub>1 </sub>to AL<b>2</b> <sub>4</sub>. However, the present invention is not limited to this, and the baseline of secondary alignment system AL<b>2</b> <sub>n </sub>can also be adjusted, for example, by simultaneously and individually detecting alignment marks formed at different positions on wafer W (process wafer) with five alignment systems AL<b>1</b> and AL<b>2</b> <sub>1 </sub>to AL<b>2</b> <sub>4 </sub>and adjusting the rotation of each arm <b>56</b> <sub>n</sub>. Further, in the embodiment, the baseline (the position of the detection area) of secondary alignment system AL<b>2</b> <sub>n </sub>is to be adjusted using reference marks M of CD bar <b>46</b> or the like. However, the adjustment operation is not limited to this, and for example, secondary alignment system AL<b>2</b> <sub>n </sub>only has to be moved to a target position while measuring its position with the sensor described above. In this case, it is only necessary to employ the sequence in which the baseline that has been measured before the movement is corrected based on the position or the movement amount of secondary alignment system AL<b>2</b> <sub>n </sub>measured by the sensor, or the baseline measurement is executed again after the movement, or at least the baseline measurement of secondary alignment system AL<b>2</b> <sub>n </sub>is performed after the movement.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0279" num="0278">Next, detection of position information (surface position information) of the wafer W surface in the Z-axis direction (hereinafter, referred to as focus mapping) that is performed in exposure apparatus <b>100</b> of the embodiment will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0280" num="0279">On the focus mapping, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>, main controller <b>20</b> controls the position within the XY plane of wafer table WTB based on X head <b>66</b> facing X scale <b>39</b>X<sub>2 </sub>(X linear encoder <b>70</b>D) and two Y heads <b>64</b> <i>y</i> <sub>2 </sub>and <b>64</b> <i>y</i> <sub>2 </sub>facing Y scales <b>39</b>Y<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>Y<sub>2 </sub>respectively (Y linear encoders <b>70</b>A and <b>70</b>C).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0281" num="0280">Then, in this state, main controller <b>20</b> starts scanning of wafer stage WST in the +Y direction, and after starting the scanning, activates (turns ON) both Z sensors <b>72</b> <i>a </i>to <b>72</b> <i>d </i>and the multipoint AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b</i>) by the time when detection beams of the multipoint AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b</i>) begin to be irradiated on wafer W due to movement of wafer stage WST in the +Y direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0282" num="0281">Then, in a state where Z sensors <b>72</b> <i>a </i>to <b>72</b> <i>d </i>and the multipoint AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b</i>) simultaneously operate, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>, position information (surface position information) of the wafer table WTB surface (surface of plate <b>28</b>) in the Z-axis direction that is measured by Z sensors <b>72</b> <i>a </i>to <b>72</b> <i>d </i>and position information (surface position information) of the wafer W surface in the Z-axis direction at a plurality of detection points that is detected by the multipoint AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b</i>) are loaded at predetermined sampling intervals during a period when wafer stage WST is proceeding in the +Y direction, and loaded three kinds of information, i.e. two kinds of the loaded surface position information and the measurement values of Y linear encoders <b>70</b>A and <b>70</b>C at each sampling timing are made to correspond to one another, and are sequentially stored in a memory (not shown).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0283" num="0282">Then, when the detection beams of the multipoint AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b</i>) begin to miss wafer W, main controller <b>20</b> ends the sampling described above and converts the surface position information at each detection point of the multipoint AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b</i>) into data, using the surface position information by Z sensors <b>72</b> <i>a </i>to <b>72</b> <i>d </i>that has been loaded simultaneously, as a datum.</div>

Further, based on the average value of the measurement values of Z sensors <b>72</b> <i>c </i>and <b>72</b> <i>d</i>, surface position information at a predetermined point (e.g. corresponding to a midpoint between the respective measurement points of Z sensors <b>72</b> <i>c </i>and <b>72</b> <i>d</i>, that is, a point on the substantially same X-axis as the array of a plurality of detection points of the multipoint AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b</i>): hereinafter, this point is referred to as a right measurement point) on an area (area where Y scale <b>39</b>Y<sub>1 </sub>is formed) in the vicinity of the +X side end portion of plate <b>28</b> is obtained. Then, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C</figref>, main controller <b>20</b> converts the surface position information at each detection point of the multipoint AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b</i>) into surface position data z<b>1</b> to zk using a straight line that connects the surface position of a left measurement point P<b>1</b> and the surface position of a right measurement point P<b>2</b> as a datum.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0285" num="0284">Since the foregoing converted data is obtained in advance as is described above, afterward, for example, on exposure or the like, the Z-position and the tilt (mainly the θy rotation) with respect to the XY plane of wafer table WTB are computed, by measuring the wafer table WTB surface (a point on the area where Y scale <b>39</b>Y<sub>2 </sub>is formed and a point on the area where Y scale <b>39</b>Y<sub>1 </sub>is formed) with Z sensors <b>74</b> <sub>1,j </sub>and <b>74</b> <sub>2,j</sub>, and <b>76</b> <sub>1,q </sub>and <b>76</b> <sub>2,q</sub>. By using the computed Z-position and tilt with respect to the XY plane of wafer table WTB and surface position data z<b>1</b> to zk described above, surface position control of the upper surface of wafer W can be performed without actually obtaining surface position information of the wafer surface. Accordingly, since there is no problem even if the multipoint AF system is placed at a position away from projection optical system PL, the focus mapping of the embodiment can suitably be applied also to an exposure apparatus whose working distance is short, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0286" num="0285">Incidentally, in the description above, the surface position of left measurement point P<b>1</b> and the surface position of right measurement point P<b>2</b> are to be computed based on the average value of measurement values of Z sensors <b>72</b> <i>a </i>and <b>72</b> <i>b </i>and the average value of measurement values of Z sensors <b>72</b> <i>c </i>and <b>72</b> <i>d </i>respectively. However, the present invention is not limited to this, and the surface position information at each detection point of the multipoint AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b</i>) may also be converted into surface position data, for example, using a straight line that connects the surface positions measured by Z sensors <b>72</b> <i>a </i>and <b>72</b> <i>c</i>, as a datum. In this case, the difference between the measurement value of Z sensor <b>72</b> <i>a </i>and the measurement value of Z sensor <b>72</b> <i>b </i>obtained at each sampling timing, and the difference between the measurement value of Z sensor <b>72</b> <i>c </i>and the measurement value of Z sensor <b>72</b> <i>d </i>obtained at each sampling timing are obtained severally in advance. Then, when performing surface position control at the time of exposure or the like, by measuring the wafer table WTB surface with Z sensors <b>74</b> <sub>1,j </sub>and <b>74</b> <sub>2,j</sub>, and <b>76</b> <sub>1,q </sub>and <b>76</b> <sub>2,q </sub>and computing the Z-position and the tilt (not only the θy rotation but also the θx rotation) with respect to the XY plane of wafer table WTB, surface position control of wafer W can be performed using the computed Z-position and tilt with respect to the XY plane of wafer table WTB, and surface position data z<b>1</b> to zk described above and the differences described above, without actually obtaining surface position information of the wafer surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0287" num="0286">The description so far is made assuming that unevenness does not exist on the wafer table WTB surface. In actual, however, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C</figref>, there is unevenness on the surface of wafer table WTB, that is, the surface of a first partial area <b>28</b> <i>b</i> <sub>1 </sub>where Y scale <b>39</b>Y<sub>2 </sub>is formed, the surface of a second partial area <b>28</b> <i>b</i> <sub>2 </sub>where Y scale <b>39</b>Y<sub>1 </sub>is formed, or the like. However, even in the case unevenness exits on the surface of wafer table WTB as is described above, surface position control with extremely high precision can be performed at a point on a meridian of wafer W (a straight line parallel to the Y-axis that passes through the wafer center).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0288" num="0287">The surface position control at a point on the meridian will be described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0289" num="0288">When the focus mapping is performed, Z sensors <b>72</b> <i>a </i>to <b>72</b> <i>d </i>that serve as datums when performing the mapping detect surface position information of certain positions (XY coordinate positions) on the wafer table WTB surface. Then, as is obvious from the description above, the focus mapping is performed fixing the X-position of wafer stage WST while moving wafer stage WST straight in the +Y direction. In other words, the lines (on the surface of second water repellent plate <b>28</b> <i>b</i>) that Z sensors <b>72</b> <i>a </i>to <b>72</b> <i>d </i>detect the surface position information when performing the focus mapping also become straight lines parallel to the Y-axis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0290" num="0289">When the focus mapping is being performed (when wafer stage WST is moving in the +Y direction), the shot area located on the meridian of the wafer is to be placed at an exposure position (below projection optical system PL) without moving wafer stage WST in the X-axis direction. When the shot area on the meridian reaches the exposure position, a pair of Z sensors <b>74</b> <sub>1,4 </sub>and <b>74</b> <sub>2,4 </sub>that are on the same straight line parallel to the Y-axis as Z sensors <b>72</b> <i>a </i>and <b>72</b> <i>b</i>, and a pair of Z sensors <b>76</b> <sub>1,3 </sub>and <b>76</b> <sub>2,3 </sub>that are on the same straight line parallel to the Y-axis as Z sensors <b>72</b> <i>c </i>and <b>72</b> <i>d </i>are to detect surface position information at points that are the same as the points on wafer table WTB at which Z sensors <b>72</b> <i>a </i>and <b>72</b> <i>b</i>, and Z sensors <b>72</b> <i>c </i>and <b>72</b> <i>d </i>severally detect surface position information at the time of focus mapping. That is, the datum surface measured by the Z sensors that serves as a datum in the detection of surface position information by the multipoint AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b</i>) is the same at the time of focus mapping and at the time of exposure. Therefore, when exposing the shot area on the meridian, even if unevenness or undulation occurs on the surface of wafer table WTB, focus control of the wafer on exposure can be performed using the Z-position obtained at the time of focus mapping without change, without taking the unevenness or undulation into consideration, and therefore highly accurate focus control can be performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0291" num="0290">When exposing the shot areas other than the shot area on the meridian, in the case there is neither unevenness nor undulation on the surface of wafer table WTB, focus control accuracy of the same level as the case of the shot area on the meridian can be secured. In the case there is unevenness or undulation on the surface of wafer table WTB, however, focus control accuracy depends on accuracy of traverse-Z-moving correction (to be described later). Further, in the cases such as when moving wafer stage WST, for example, in the X-axis direction in order to expose the shot areas other than the one on the meridian, main controller <b>20</b> performs the transfer of the measurement values between a plurality of Z sensors along with the movement of wafer stage WST.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0292" num="0291">Next, focus calibration will be described. The focus calibration means the operation in which the processing (focus calibration former processing) of obtaining a relation between surface position information at end portions on one side and the other side of wafer table WTB in the X-axis direction in a certain datum state and a detection result (surface position information) at a representative detection point on the measurement plate <b>30</b> surface of the multipoint AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b</i>), and the processing (focus calibration latter processing) of obtaining surface position information at end portions on one side and the other side of wafer table WTB in the X-axis direction that corresponds to the best focus position of projection optical system PL detected using aerial image measuring unit <b>45</b>, in a state similar to the datum state described above, are performed, and based on the processing results, the processing of obtaining an offset at the representative detection point of the multipoint AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b</i>), that is, the deviation between the best focus position of projection optical system PL and the detection origin of the multipoint AF system, or the like is performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0293" num="0292">On the focus calibration, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>, main controller <b>20</b> controls the position within the XY plane of wafer table WTB based on two X heads <b>66</b> facing X scales <b>39</b>X<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>X<sub>2 </sub>respectively (X linear encoders <b>70</b>B and <b>70</b>D) and two Y heads <b>64</b> <i>y</i> <sub>2 </sub>and <b>64</b> <i>y</i> <sub>1 </sub>facing Y scales <b>39</b>Y<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>Y<sub>2 </sub>respectively (Y linear encoders <b>70</b>A and <b>70</b>C). In the state of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>, the centerline of wafer table WTB coincides with straight line LV. Further, in the state of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>, wafer table WTB is located at a position in the Y-axis direction with which detection beams from the multipoint AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b>B) are irradiated to measurement plate <b>30</b>. Further, although omitted in the drawing, there is measurement stage MST on the +Y side of wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST) and water is held in the space between CD bar <b>46</b> and wafer table WTB, and tip lens <b>191</b> of projection optical system PL (refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0294" num="0293">(a) In this state, main controller <b>20</b> performs the focus calibration former processing as follows. That is, while detecting surface position information of the end portions on one side and the other side of wafer table WTB in the X-axis direction that is detected by Z sensors <b>72</b> <i>a</i>, <b>72</b> <i>b</i>, <b>72</b> <i>c </i>and <b>72</b> <i>d </i>in the vicinity of each of detection points that are located at both end portions of the detection area of the multipoint AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b</i>), main controller <b>20</b> uses the surface position information as a datum and detects surface position information of the surface of measurement plate <b>30</b> (refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) using the multipoint AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b</i>). Thus, a relation between the measurement values of Z sensors <b>72</b> <i>a</i>, <b>72</b> <i>b</i>, <b>72</b> <i>c </i>and <b>72</b> <i>d </i>(surface position information at end portions on one side and the other side of wafer table WTB in the X-axis direction) and the detection result (surface position information) at a detection point (the detection point located in the center or the vicinity thereof out of a plurality of detection points) on the measurement plate <b>30</b> surface of the multipoint AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b</i>), in a state where the centerline of wafer table WTB coincides with straight line LV, is obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0295" num="0294">(b) Next, main controller <b>20</b> moves wafer stage WST in the +Y direction by a predetermined distance, and stops wafer stage WST at a position with which measurement plate <b>30</b> is located directly below projection optical system PL. Then, main controller <b>20</b> performs the focus calibration latter processing as follows. That is, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>, while controlling the position in the optical axis direction of projection optical system PL (Z-position) of measurement plate <b>30</b> (wafer table WTB), using surface position information as a datum, which is measured by a pair of Z sensors <b>74</b> <sub>1,4 </sub>and <b>74</b> <sub>2,4</sub>, and a pair of Z sensors <b>76</b> <sub>1,3 </sub>and <b>76</b> <sub>2,3 </sub>that measure surface position information at the end portions on one side and the other side in the X-axis direction of wafer table WTB, main controller <b>20</b> measures an aerial image of a measurement mark formed on a mark plate (not shown) on reticle R or reticle stage RST by a slit-scan method using aerial image measuring unit <b>45</b>, and based on the measurement results, measures the best focus position of projection optical system PL. In this case, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>, since liquid immersion area <b>14</b> is formed between projection optical system PL and measurement plate <b>30</b> (wafer table WTB), the aerial image measurement described above is performed via projection optical system PL and water. Further, although omitted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>, since measurement plate <b>30</b> of aerial image measuring unit <b>45</b> and the like are mounted on wafer stage WST (wafer table WTB) and the light-receiving element and the like are mounted on measurement stage MST, the aerial image measurement described above is performed while keeping wafer stage WST and measurement stage MST in a contact state (or a proximity state) (refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>). By the measurement described above, the measurement values of Z sensors <b>74</b> <sub>1,4 </sub>and <b>74</b> <sub>2,4</sub>, and <b>76</b> <sub>1,3 </sub>and <b>76</b> <sub>2,3 </sub>(i.e. surface position information at the end portions on one side and the other side in the X-axis direction of wafer table WTB) in a state where the centerline of wafer table WTB coincides with straight line LV are obtained. These measurement values correspond to the best focus position of projection optical system PL.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0296" num="0295">(c) Thus, main controller <b>20</b> can obtain the offset at the representative detection point of the multipoint AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b</i>), that is, the deviation between the best focus position of projection optical system PL and the detection origin of the multipoint AF system, based on the relation between the measurement values of Z sensors <b>72</b> <i>a </i>and <b>72</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>72</b> <i>c </i>and <b>72</b> <i>d </i>(surface position information at the end portions on one side and the other side in the X-axis direction of wafer table WTB) and the detection result (surface position information) of the measurement plate <b>30</b> surface by the multipoint AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b</i>) that is obtained in the focus calibration former processing in the above (a), and based on the measurement values of Z sensors <b>74</b> <sub>1,4 </sub>and <b>74</b> <sub>2,4</sub>, and <b>76</b> <sub>1,3 </sub>and <b>76</b> <sub>2,3 </sub>(i.e. surface position information at the end portions on one side and the other side in the X-axis direction of wafer table WTB) corresponding to the best focus position of projection optical system PL that are obtained in the focus calibration latter processing in the above (b). In the embodiment, the representative detection point is, for example, the detection point in the center of the plurality of detection points or in the vicinity thereof, but the number and/or the position may be arbitrary. In this case, main controller <b>20</b> performs adjustment of the detection origin of the multipoint AF system so that the offset at the representative detection point becomes zero. For example, the adjustment may be performed optically by performing angle adjustment of a plane parallel plate (not shown) inside photodetection system <b>90</b> <i>b</i>, or the detection offset may be electrically adjusted. Alternatively, the offset may be stored, without performing adjustment of the detection origin. Herein, adjustment of the detection origin is to be performed in the optical method referred to above. Thus, the focus calibration of the multipoint AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b</i>) ends. Incidentally, in the optical adjustment of the detection origin, since it is difficult to make the offsets at all the remaining detection points other than the representative detection point be zero, the offsets after the optical adjustment at the remaining detection points are preferably stored.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0297" num="0296">Next, offset correction of detection values among a plurality of light-receiving elements (sensors) that individually correspond to a plurality of detection points of the multiple AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b</i>) (hereinafter, referred to as offset correction among AF sensors) will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0298" num="0297">On the offset correction among AF sensors, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref>, main controller <b>20</b> makes irradiation system <b>90</b> <i>a </i>of the multipoint AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b</i>) irradiate detection beams to CD bar <b>46</b> equipped with a predetermined datum plane, and loads output signals from photodetection system <b>90</b> <i>b </i>of the multipoint AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b</i>) that receives the reflected lights from the CD bar <b>46</b> surface (datum plane).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0299" num="0298">In this case, if the CD bar <b>46</b> surface is set parallel to the XY plane, main controller <b>20</b> can perform the offset correction among AF sensors by obtaining a relation among the detection values (measurement values) of a plurality of sensors that individually correspond to a plurality of detection points based on the output signals loaded in the manner described above and storing the relation in a memory, or electrically adjusting the detection offset of each sensor so that the detection values of all the sensors become, for example, the same value as the detection value of a sensor that corresponds to the representative detection point on the focus calibration described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0300" num="0299">In the embodiment, however, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref>, main controller <b>20</b> detects a tilt of the CD bar <b>46</b> surface using Z sensors <b>72</b> <i>a</i>, <b>72</b> <i>b</i>, <b>72</b> <i>c </i>and <b>72</b> <i>d </i>when loading the output signals from photodetection system <b>90</b> <i>b </i>of the multipoint AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b</i>), and therefore, the CD bar <b>46</b> surface does not always have to be set parallel to the XY plane. In other words, as is modeled in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</figref>, when it is assumed that the detection value at each detection point is the value as severally indicated by arrows in the drawing and a line that connects the upper ends of the detection values has unevenness as shown in a dotted line in the drawing, each detection value only has to be adjusted so that the line that connects the upper ends of the detection values becomes a line shown in a solid line in the drawing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0301" num="0300">Next, traverse-Z-moving correction, in which information used to correct influence of unevenness related to the X-axis direction of the wafer table WTB surface, to be more accurate, of the second water repellent plate <b>28</b> <i>b </i>surface is obtained, will be described. Herein, the traverse-Z-moving correction is performed by simultaneously loading the measurement values of the Z sensors that detect position information of either side areas in a horizontal direction on the surface of second water repellent plate <b>28</b> <i>b </i>of wafer table WTB and the detection values of surface position information of the wafer by the multipoint AF system at predetermined sampling intervals while moving wafer table WTB in the X-axis direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0302" num="0301">On the traverse-Z-moving correction, similar to the case of the focus mapping described above, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref>, main controller <b>20</b> controls the position within the XY plane of wafer table WTB based on two X heads <b>66</b> facing X scales <b>39</b>X<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>X<sub>2 </sub>respectively (X linear encoders <b>70</b>B and <b>70</b>D) and two Y heads <b>64</b> <i>y</i> <sub>2 </sub>and <b>64</b> <i>y</i> <sub>1 </sub>facing Y scales <b>39</b>Y<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>Y<sub>2 </sub>respectively (Y linear encoders <b>70</b>A and <b>70</b>C). In the state of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref>, the centerline of wafer table WTB is located on the +X side of straight line LV, and main controller <b>20</b> measures surface position information of the points in the vicinity of the −X side end portions of the either side areas on the surface of second water repellent plate <b>28</b> <i>b </i>of wafer table WTB using Z sensors <b>72</b> <i>a </i>and <b>72</b> <i>b</i>, and Z sensors <b>72</b> <i>c </i>and <b>72</b> <i>d</i>, and at the same time, detects surface position information of the wafer using the multipoint AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b</i>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0303" num="0302">Subsequently, main controller <b>20</b> moves wafer stage WST in the −X direction at a predetermined speed as is indicated by an outline arrow in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref>. During the movement, main controller <b>20</b> repeatedly executes simultaneous loading of the measurement values of Z sensors <b>72</b> <i>a </i>and <b>72</b> <i>b </i>and Z sensors <b>72</b> <i>c </i>and <b>72</b> <i>d </i>and the detection values of the multipoint AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b</i>) at predetermined sampling intervals. Then, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</figref>, at the point in time when the simultaneous loading described above in a state where Z sensors <b>72</b> <i>a </i>and <b>72</b> <i>b </i>and Z sensors <b>72</b> <i>c </i>and <b>72</b> <i>d </i>face the points in the vicinity of the +X end portions of the either side areas on the surface of second water repellent plate <b>28</b> <i>b </i>of wafer table WTB is completed, main controller <b>20</b> ends the operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0304" num="0303">Then, main controller <b>20</b> obtains a relation between the surface position information at each detection point of the multipoint AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b</i>) and the surface position information by Z sensors <b>72</b> <i>a </i>to <b>72</b> <i>d </i>that has been simultaneously loaded. Then, main controller <b>20</b> computes unevenness related to the X-axis direction of the surface of second water repellent plate <b>28</b> <i>b </i>from a plurality of relations that have been obtained at different sampling timings. In other words, in this case, since the offset among sensors of the multipoint AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b</i>) has been adjusted, the detection values of the sensors corresponding to any detection points should be the same value as far as the same point on the surface of second water repellent plate <b>28</b> <i>b </i>is detected. Accordingly, the differences among the detection values obtained when detecting the same point on the surface of second water repellent plate <b>28</b> <i>b </i>by the sensors corresponding to different detection points are directly reflected by unevenness of the surface of second water repellent plate <b>28</b> <i>b </i>and position variation in the Z-axis direction of the wafer table during the movement. Then, by making use of this relation, unevenness related to the X-axis direction of the surface of second water repellent plate <b>28</b> <i>b </i>is computed from the plurality of relations that have been obtained at different sampling timings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0305" num="0304">In this manner, main controller <b>20</b> obtains information on position variation in the Z-axis direction of the wafer table WTB surface that occurs when wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST) moves in the X-axis direction (is located at different X-positions), based on the results that have been sequentially detected using the multipoint AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b</i>) while moving wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST) in the X-axis direction. Main controller <b>20</b> performs focus control of wafer W while adding this information as a correction amount, on exposure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0306" num="0305">Next, a parallel processing operation using wafer stage WST and measurement stage MST in exposure apparatus <b>100</b> of the embodiment will be described based on <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 to 36</figref>. Incidentally, during the operation described below, main controller <b>20</b> performs opening/closing control of each valve of liquid supply unit <b>5</b> and liquid recovery unit <b>6</b> of local liquid immersion unit <b>8</b> as is described earlier, and the space on the outgoing surface side of tip lens <b>191</b> of projection optical system PL is constantly filled with water. However, description regarding control of liquid supply unit <b>5</b> and liquid recovery unit <b>6</b> will be omitted in the following description, in order to make the description easily understandable. Further, the following description regarding the operations will be made using many drawings, but the reference codes of the same members are shown in some drawings and not shown in the other drawings. That is, the reference codes shown are different in each of the drawings, but these drawings show the same configuration regardless of existence or non-existence of the reference codes. The same is true also in each of the drawings used in the description above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0307" num="0306"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> shows a state where exposure by a step-and-scan method is being performed to wafer W (in this case, to be a mid wafer of a certain lot (one lot containing 25 or 50 wafers), as an example) on wafer stage WST. At this point in time, measurement stage MST is moving following wafer stage WST while keeping a predetermined distance between them. Therefore, the same distance as the predetermined distance is sufficient as a moving distance of measurement stage MST that is needed when going into the contact state (or proximity state) with wafer stage WST described above after the exposure ends.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0308" num="0307">During the exposure, main controller <b>20</b> controls the position (including the θz rotation) within the XY plane of wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST) based on the measurement values of two X heads <b>66</b> indicated by being circled in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> that face X scales <b>39</b>X<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>X<sub>2 </sub>respectively (X encoders <b>70</b>B and <b>70</b>D) and two Y heads <b>64</b> indicated by being circled in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> that face Y scales <b>39</b>Y<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>Y<sub>2 </sub>respectively (Y encoders <b>70</b>A and <b>70</b>C). Further, main controller <b>20</b> controls the position in the Z-axis direction, and the θy rotation (rolling) and the θx rotation (pitching) of wafer table WTB, based on the measurement values of a pair of Z sensors <b>74</b> <sub>1,j </sub>and <b>74</b> <sub>2,j</sub>, and a pair of Z sensors <b>76</b> <sub>1,q </sub>and <b>76</b> <sub>2,q </sub>that respectively face the end portions on one side and the other side in the X-axis direction of the wafer table WTB surface. Incidentally, the position in the Z-axis direction and the θy rotation (rolling) of wafer table WTB may be controlled based on the measurement values of Z sensors <b>74</b> <sub>1,j </sub>and <b>74</b> <sub>2,j</sub>, and <b>76</b> <sub>1,q </sub>and <b>76</b> <sub>2,q </sub>and the θx rotation (pitching) may be controlled based on the measurement values of Y-axis interferometer <b>16</b>. In either case, the control of the position in the Z-axis direction, the θy rotation and θx rotation of wafer table WTB (focus leveling control of wafer W) during the exposure is performed based on the results of the above-described focus mapping performed beforehand.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0309" num="0308">Further, during the exposure, shutters <b>49</b>A and <b>49</b>B are set in a state of closing openings <b>51</b>A and <b>51</b>B, in order to prevent wafer stage WST and measurement stage MST from coming closer together than a predetermined distance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0310" num="0309">The foregoing exposure operation is performed by main controller <b>20</b> repeating a moving operation between shots in which wafer stage WST is moved to a scanning starting position (accelerating starting position) for exposure of each shot area on wafer W based on the result of the above-described wafer alignment (EGA) performed beforehand, the latest baselines of alignment systems AL<b>1</b> and AL<b>2</b> <sub>1 </sub>to AL<b>2</b> <sub>4</sub>, and the like, and a scanning exposure operation in which a pattern formed on reticle R is transferred to each shot area by a scanning exposure method. Incidentally, the exposure operation described above is performed in a state where water is held in the space between tip lens <b>191</b> and wafer W. Further, the exposure operation is performed in the order from the shot area located on the −Y side to the shot area located on the +Y side in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0311" num="0310">Further, main controller <b>20</b> may also accumulate the measurement values of encoders <b>70</b>A to <b>70</b>D and the measurement values of interferometers <b>16</b> and <b>126</b> during exposure and update the correction map described earlier as needed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0312" num="0311">Then, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, before exposure to wafer W ends, for example, before the last shot area is exposed when different shot areas on wafer W are sequentially exposed, main controller <b>20</b> starts the lowering drive of shutters <b>49</b>A and <b>49</b>B via drive mechanisms <b>34</b>A and <b>34</b>B, and sets openings <b>51</b>A and <b>51</b>B in an opened state. After confirming that shutters <b>49</b>A and <b>49</b>B are in a fully opened state via opening/closing sensor <b>101</b>, main controller <b>20</b> moves measurement stage MST (measurement table MTB) to the position shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> by controlling stage drive system <b>124</b> based on the measurement value of Y-axis interferometer <b>18</b> while maintaining the measurement value of X-axis interferometer <b>130</b> to a constant value. At this point in time, the end surface on the −Y side of CD bar <b>46</b> (measurement table MTB) and the end surface on the +Y side of wafer table WTB are in contact with each other. Incidentally, the noncontact state (proximity state) may also be kept by, for example, monitoring the measurement values of the interferometer or the encoder that measures the position of each table in the Y-axis direction and separating measurement table MTB and wafer table WTB in the Y-axis direction at a distance of around 300 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0313" num="0312">Subsequently, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, while keeping the positional relation in the Y-axis direction between wafer table WTB and measurement table MTB, main controller <b>20</b> starts an operation of driving measurement stage MST in the −Y direction and also starts an operation of driving wafer stage WST toward unloading position UP. When these operations are started, in the embodiment, measurement stage MST is moved only in the −Y direction, and wafer stage WST is moved in the −Y direction and −X direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0314" num="0313">When main controller <b>20</b> drives wafer stage WST and measurement stage MST simultaneously as is described above, water that is held in the space between tip lens <b>191</b> of projection unit PU and wafer W (water in liquid immersion area <b>14</b>) sequentially moves from wafer W to plate <b>28</b>, CD bar <b>46</b>, and measurement table MTB, according to movement of wafer stage WST and measurement stage MST to the −Y side. Incidentally, during the foregoing movement, the contact state (or proximity state) of wafer table WTB and measurement table MTB is maintained. Incidentally, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> shows a state right before water in liquid immersion area <b>14</b> is delivered from plate <b>28</b> to CD bar <b>46</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0315" num="0314">When wafer stage WST and measurement stage MST are simultaneously and slightly driven further in the −Y direction from the state of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, position measurement of wafer stage WST (wafer table WTB) by Y encoders <b>70</b>A and <b>70</b>C cannot be performed. Therefore, right before that, main controller <b>20</b> switches the control of the Y-position and the θz rotation of wafer stage WST (wafer table WTB) from the control based on the measurement values of Y encoders <b>70</b>A and <b>70</b>C to the control based on the measurement value of Y-axis interferometer <b>16</b>. Then, since after a predetermined period of time, measurement stage MST reaches a position where the Sec-BCHK (interval) described earlier is performed as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, main controller <b>20</b> stops measurement stage MST at the position, and also drives further wafer stage WST toward unloading position UP while measuring the X-position of wafer stage WST by X head <b>66</b> indicated by being circled in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> that faces X scale <b>39</b>X<sub>1 </sub>(X-linear encoder <b>70</b>B) and measuring the Y-position, the θz rotation and the like by Y-axis interferometer <b>16</b>, and stops wafer stage WST at unloading position UP.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0316" num="0315">Subsequently, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</figref>, main controller <b>20</b> performs the Sec-BCHK (interval) in which relative positions of four secondary alignment systems with respect to primary alignment system AL<b>1</b> are measured in the procedures described previously, using CD bar <b>46</b> of measurement stage MST. In parallel with the Sec-BCHK (interval), main controller <b>20</b> gives the command and makes a drive system of an unload arm (not shown) unload wafer W on wafer stage WST that stops at unloading position UP, and also drives wafer stage WST in the +X direction to move it to loading position LP with a vertical movement pin CT (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>), which has been driven upward when performing the unloading, kept upward a predetermined amount. In this case, the unloading of the wafer is performed as follows: vertical movement pin CT supports wafer W from below and lifts the wafer, and the unload arm proceeds to below wafer W, and then vertical movement pin CT is slightly lowered or the unload arm is slightly raised or the like, and the wafer is delivered from vertical movement pin CT to the unload arm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0317" num="0316">Next, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, main controller <b>20</b> moves measurement stage MST to an optimal waiting position (hereinafter, referred to as an “optimal scrum waiting position”) used to shift a state of measurement stage MST from a state of being away from wafer stage WST to the contact state (or proximity state) with wafer stage WST described previously, and closes shutters <b>49</b>A and <b>49</b>B in the foregoing procedures. In parallel with this operation, main controller <b>20</b> gives the command and makes a drive system of a load arm (not shown) load new wafer W onto wafer table WTB. The loading of wafer W is performed in the following procedures: wafer W held by the load arm is delivered from the load arm to vertical movement pin CT whose state of being raised upward a predetermined amount is maintained, and after the load arm is withdrawn, wafer W is mounted onto the wafer holder by vertical movement pin CT being lowered and the wafer is sucked by a vacuum chuck (not shown). In this case, since the state where vertical movement pin CT is raised upward a predetermined amount is maintained, the wafer loading can be performed in a shorter period of time, compared with the case where vertical movement pin CT is driven downward to be housed inside the wafer holder.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0318" num="0317">In the embodiment, the foregoing optimal scrum waiting position of measurement stage MST is appropriately set in accordance with the Y-coordinates of the alignment marks arranged in the alignment shot areas on the wafer. With this setting, an operation of moving measurement stage MST to the optimal scrum waiting position becomes unnecessary when the state of measurement stage MST shifts to the contact state (or proximity state) described above, and therefore, the number of movement of measurement stage MST can be decreased by one compared with the case where measurement stage MST is made to wait at a position that is away from the optimal scrum waiting position. Further, in the embodiment, as the optimal scrum waiting position described above, the optimal scrum waiting position is set so that the shift to the contact state (or proximity state) described above can be performed at a position where wafer stage WST stops for the wafer alignment described above.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0338" num="0337">Next, main controller <b>20</b> continues the focus mapping while moving wafer stage WST in the +Y direction again.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0339" num="0338">As is described in detail so far, according to the embodiment, while wafer stage WST is moving linearly in the Y-axis direction, surface position information of the wafer W surface is detected by the multipoint AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b</i>) having a plurality of detection points that are set at a predetermined distance in the X-axis direction, and also the alignment marks whose positions are different from one another on wafer W are detected by a plurality of alignment systems AL<b>1</b> and AL<b>2</b> <sub>1 </sub>to AL<b>2</b> <sub>4 </sub>having the detection areas that are arrayed in a line along the X-axis direction. In other words, only by wafer stage WST (wafer W) linearly passing though the plurality of detection points (detection area AF) of the multipoint AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b>B) and the detection areas of a plurality of alignment systems AL<b>1</b> and AL<b>2</b> <sub>1 </sub>to AL<b>2</b> <sub>4</sub>, detection of surface position information on the substantially entire surface of wafer W and detection of all the alignment marks to be detected on wafer W (e.g. the alignment marks in the alignment shot areas in the EGA) are finished, and therefore, the throughput can be improved, compared with the case where a detection operation of alignment marks and a detection operation of surface position information (focus information) are independently (separately) performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0340" num="0339">In the embodiment, as is obvious from the description of the parallel processing operations using wafer stage WST and measurement stage MST described above, in the middle of movement of wafer stage WST from the loading position toward the exposure position (exposure area IA) (i.e. during the movement of wafer stage WST in the Y-axis direction), main controller <b>20</b> makes a plurality of alignment systems AL<b>1</b> and AL<b>2</b> <sub>1 </sub>to AL<b>2</b> <sub>4 </sub>simultaneously detect a plurality of the marks (alignment marks in the alignment shot areas) whose positions in the X-axis direction are different on wafer W, and also makes the multipoint AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b>B) detect surface position information of wafer W that passes through the detection areas of the plurality of alignment systems according to the movement of wafer stage WST in the Y-axis direction. Therefore, the throughput can be improved, compared with the case where a detection operation of alignment marks and a detection operation of surface position information (focus information) are independently performed. Incidentally, in the embodiment, the loading position and the exposure position are to be different in the X-axis direction, but the positions in the X-axis direction may also be substantially the same. In this case, wafer stage WST can be moved substantially linearly from the loading position to the detection areas of the alignment systems (and the multipoint AF system). Further, the loading position and the unloading position may be the same position.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0341" num="0340">Further, according to the embodiment, while measuring the position in the Y-axis direction and the θz rotation (yawing) of wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST) based on the measurement values of a pair of Y heads <b>64</b> <i>y</i> <sub>2 </sub>and <b>64</b> <i>y</i> <sub>1 </sub>facing a pair of Y scales <b>39</b>Y<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>Y<sub>2 </sub>respectively (a pair of Y-axis linear encoders <b>70</b>A and <b>70</b>C), wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST) can be moved in the Y-axis direction. Further, in this case, since movement of wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST) in the Y-axis direction can be realized in a state where the relative positions in the X-axis direction of secondary alignment systems AL<b>2</b> <sub>1 </sub>to AL<b>2</b> <sub>4 </sub>with respect to primary alignment system AL<b>1</b> are adjusted according to the array (such as the size) of the shot areas formed on wafer W, the alignment marks in a plurality of shot areas (e.g. alignment shot areas) whose positions in the Y-axis direction are the same and whose positions in the X-axis direction are different on wafer W can be measured simultaneously by a plurality of alignment systems AL<b>1</b> and AL<b>2</b> <sub>1 </sub>to AL<b>2</b> <sub>4</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0342" num="0341">Further, according to the embodiment, main controller <b>20</b> detects the alignment marks on wafer W using alignment systems AL<b>1</b> and AL<b>2</b> <sub>1 </sub>to AL<b>2</b> <sub>4</sub>, while controlling the position of wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST) based on the measurement values by the encoder system (Y linear encoders <b>70</b>A and <b>70</b>C, X linear encoders <b>70</b>B and <b>70</b>D). In other words, the alignment marks on wafer W can be detected using alignment systems AL<b>1</b> and AL<b>2</b> <sub>1 </sub>to AL<b>2</b> <sub>4 </sub>while controlling the position of wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST) with high precision based on the measurement values of Y heads <b>64</b> facing Y scales <b>39</b>Y<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>Y<sub>2 </sub>respectively (Y linear encoders <b>70</b>A and <b>70</b>C) and X heads <b>66</b> facing X scales <b>39</b>X<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>X<sub>2 </sub>respectively (X linear encoders <b>70</b>B and <b>70</b>D).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0343" num="0342">Further, according to the embodiment, the number of detection points (the number of measurement points) of the alignment marks on wafer W that are simultaneously detected by alignment systems AL<b>1</b> and AL<b>2</b> <sub>1 </sub>to AL<b>2</b> <sub>4 </sub>differs depending on the position within the XY plane of wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST). Therefore, for example, at the time of the foregoing wafer alignment or the like, when moving wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST) in a direction intersecting the X-axis, for example, in the Y-axis direction, it becomes possible to simultaneously detect the alignment marks whose positions are different from one another on wafer W using the required number of alignment systems, in accordance with the position of wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST) in the Y-axis direction, in other words, in accordance with the placement (layout) of the shot areas on wafer W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0344" num="0343">Further, according to the embodiment, at the stage where the alignment marks on wafer W to be detected by the alignment systems remain (e.g. at the point in time when detection of the alignment marks arranged in the second alignment shot areas AS ends), in some cases, main controller <b>20</b> controls adjusting unit <b>68</b> so that adjusting unit <b>68</b> adjusts the optical properties of projection optical system PL based on the detection results of a plurality of (e.g. 8) alignment marks on wafer W that have been detected by the alignment systems by then. In such cases, for example, in the case detection of an image of a predetermined measurement mark (or pattern) by projection optical system PL is performed after the adjustment of the optical properties of projection optical system PL, even if the image of the measurement mark shifts due to the adjustment, the image of the measurement mark after the shift is measured, and as a consequence, the shift of the image of the measurement mark due to the adjustment of the optical properties of projection optical system PL does not become a measurement error factor. Further, since the adjustment described above is started based on the detection results of the alignment marks that have been detected by then before detection of all the alignment marks to be detected is finished, the adjustment can be performed in parallel with the detection operation of the remaining alignment marks. That is, in the embodiment, a period of time required for the adjustment can be overlapped with a period of time from when detection of the alignment marks in the third alignment shot areas AS is started until when detection of the alignment marks in the fourth alignment shot areas AS is finished. Thus, the throughput can be improved, compared with the conventional art in which the adjustment is started after detection of all the marks is finished.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0345" num="0344">Further, according to the embodiment, during a period from when an operation (e.g. the Pri-BCHK former processing) of measuring the positional relation between a projection position of an image of a pattern (e.g. a pattern of reticle R) by projection optical system PL and a detection center of alignment system AL<b>1</b> (baseline of alignment system AL<b>1</b>) is started until when the operation is completed (e.g. the Pri-BCHK latter processing is finished), a detection operation of the alignment marks (e.g. the alignment marks in the three first alignment shot areas and the five second alignment shot areas) on wafer W by alignment systems AL<b>1</b> and AL<b>2</b> <sub>1 </sub>to AL<b>2</b> <sub>4 </sub>is performed. That is, at least part of the detection operation of the marks by the alignment systems can be performed in parallel with the measurement operation of the positional relation. Accordingly, at the point in time when the measurement operation of the positional relation is completed, at least part of the detection operation by the alignment systems of a plurality of alignment marks to be detected on wafer W can be finished. Thus, the throughput can be improved, compared with the case where the detection operation of a plurality of alignment marks by alignment systems is performed before or after the measurement operation of the positional relation.</div>

In other words, according to the embodiment, both tables (or both stages) are controlled so that the detection operation by the alignment systems of a plurality of marks to be detected on wafer W is started in the contact state (or proximity state), and the switching from the contact state (or proximity state) to the separation state is performed before the detection operation of all the plurality of marks is completed. Accordingly, during a period when the detection operation of a plurality of marks to be detected on wafer W is performed, the state switching operation can be finished. Thus, the throughput can be improved, compared with the case where the state switching operation is performed before or after the detection operation of a plurality of marks to be detected on wafer W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0348" num="0347">Further, according to the embodiment, main controller <b>20</b> starts the measurement operation of the baseline of alignment system AL<b>1</b> in the separation state, and ends the measurement operation in the contact state (or proximity state).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0349" num="0348">Further, according to the embodiment, main controller <b>20</b> controls stage drive system <b>124</b> (Z-leveling mechanism (not shown)) and alignment system AL<b>1</b> and AL<b>2</b> <sub>1 </sub>to AL<b>2</b> <sub>4 </sub>so that while changing a relative positional relation in the Z-axis direction (a focus direction) between the plurality of alignment systems and wafer W by the Z-leveling mechanism, the alignment marks whose positions are different from one another on wafer W are simultaneously detected by a plurality of corresponding alignment systems. In other words, while changing the relative positional relation in the focus direction between the plurality of alignment systems and wafer W simultaneously among the plurality of alignment systems, the marks whose positions are different from one another on wafer W are simultaneously detected by a plurality of corresponding alignment systems. Thus, each alignment system can perform the mark detection, for example, in the most favorable focused state, and by preferentially using the detection result or the like, the marks whose positions are different from one another on wafer W can be detected with good accuracy without being affected by unevenness of the wafer W surface and the best focus differences among the plurality of alignments systems. Incidentally, in the embodiment, alignment systems AL<b>1</b> and AL<b>2</b> <sub>1 </sub>to AL<b>2</b> <sub>4 </sub>are to be placed substantially along the X-axis direction. However, the method in which while changing the relative positional relation in the focus direction between a plurality of alignment systems and wafer W simultaneously among the plurality of alignment systems, the marks whose positions are different from one another on wafer W are simultaneously measured by a plurality of corresponding alignment systems is also effective in other placements of alignment systems different from the placement described above. The point is that marks formed at positions different from one another on wafer W only have to be detected almost simultaneously with a plurality of alignment systems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0350" num="0349">Further, according to the embodiment, the encoder system, which includes encoders <b>70</b>A to <b>70</b>D whose measurement values have good short-term stability, and the like, measures position information of wafer table WTB within the XY plane with high precision without being affected by air fluctuations or the like, and also the surface position measuring system, which includes Z sensors <b>72</b> <i>a </i>to <b>72</b> <i>d</i>, <b>74</b> <sub>1,1 </sub>to <b>74</b> <sub>2,6</sub>, <b>76</b> <sub>1,1 </sub>to <b>76</b> <sub>2,6</sub>, and the like, measures position information of wafer table WTB in the Z-axis direction orthogonal to the XY plane with high precision without being affected by air fluctuations or the like. In this case, since both of the encoder system and the surface position measuring system directly measure the upper surface of wafer table WTB, simple and direct position control of wafer table WTB, and therefore, of wafer W can be performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0351" num="0350">Further, according to the embodiment, on the focus mapping described previously, main controller <b>20</b> simultaneously activates the surface position measuring system and the multipoint AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b</i>), and converts the detection results of the multipoint AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b</i>) into data, using the measurement results of the surface position measuring system as datums. Accordingly, by obtaining the converted data in advance, it becomes possible to perform surface position control of wafer W by only measuring position information of wafer table WTB in the Z-axis direction and position information in a tilt direction with respect to the XY plane by the surface position measuring system afterward, without obtaining surface position information of wafer W. Accordingly, in the embodiment, although the working distance between tip lens <b>191</b> and the wafer W surface is short, focus-leveling control of wafer W on exposure can be executed with good accuracy, without problems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0352" num="0351">In the embodiment, as is obvious from the description of the parallel processing operation using wafer stage WST and measurement stage MST described above, in the process in which wafer W moves from the position (loading position LP) where wafer W is carried to wafer stage WST to the position where predetermined processing to wafer W, for example, exposure (pattern formation) is performed, main controller <b>20</b> performs the simultaneous operation of the surface position measuring system and the multipoint AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b</i>) and the data converting processing (focus mapping) described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0353" num="0352">Further, in the embodiment, in the process from when a detection operation by alignment systems AL<b>1</b> and AL<b>2</b> <sub>1 </sub>to AL<b>2</b> <sub>4 </sub>of a plurality of marks to be detected (e.g. the wafer alignment operation described above) is started until when the detection operation of a plurality of marks is completed, main controller <b>20</b> starts the simultaneous operation of the surface position measuring system and the multipoint AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b</i>) and also starts the data converting processing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0354" num="0353">Further, according to the embodiment, as is described above, since the surface position of wafer table WTB, and thus, the surface position of wafer W can be controlled with high precision, it becomes possible to perform highly accurate exposure hardly having exposure defect caused by surface position control error, which makes it possible to form an image of a pattern on wafer W without image blur.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0355" num="0354">Further, according to the embodiment, for example, prior to exposure, main controller <b>20</b> measures surface position information of wafer W using the detection values (measurement values) of the multipoint AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b</i>), and taking surface position information at end portions of wafer table WTB on one side and the other side in the X-axis direction as a datum. Also on exposure, main controller <b>20</b> performs position adjustment of wafer W in a direction parallel to optical axis AX of projection optical system PL and a tilt direction with respect to the plane orthogonal to optical axis AX, taking surface position information at end portions of wafer table WTB on one side and the other side in the X-axis direction as a datum. Accordingly, although surface position information of wafer W is measured prior to exposure, surface position control of wafer W can be performed with high precision on actual exposure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0356" num="0355">Further, according to the embodiment, a partial section of aerial image measuring unit <b>45</b> is arranged at wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST) and part of the remaining section is arranged at measurement stage MST, and aerial image measuring unit <b>45</b> measures an aerial image of a measurement mark formed by projection optical system PL. Therefore, for example, at the time of the focus calibration described previously, when aerial image measuring unit <b>45</b> measures the best focus position of projection optical system PL, the measurement can be performed using the position of wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST), at which a partial section of aerial image measuring unit <b>45</b> is arranged, in a direction parallel to the optical axis of projection optical system PL as a datum of the best focus position. Accordingly, when exposing a wafer with illumination light IL, the position of wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST) in a direction parallel to the optical axis of projection optical system PL is adjusted with high precision based on the measurement result of the best focus position. Further, since only a partial section of aerial image measuring unit <b>45</b> is arranged at wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST), wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST) is not increased in size and the position controllability can favorably be secured. Incidentally, the whole remaining section of aerial image measuring unit <b>45</b> does not have to be arranged at measurement stage MST, but the remaining section may also be arranged partially at measurement stage MST and outside the measurement stage MST, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0357" num="0356">Further, according to the embodiment, Y-axis interferometer <b>18</b> and X-axis interferometer <b>130</b> measure position information of measurement stage MST, and four linear encoders <b>70</b>A to <b>70</b>D measure position information of wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST). Herein, linear encoders <b>70</b>A to <b>70</b>D are reflective encoders that include a plurality of gratings (i.e. Y scales <b>39</b>Y<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>Y<sub>2</sub>, or X scales <b>39</b>X<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>X<sub>2</sub>) that are placed on wafer table WTB and have a grating in a predetermined pitch whose periodic direction is a direction parallel to the Y-axis or the X-axis respectively, and a plurality of heads (Y heads <b>64</b> or X heads <b>66</b>) to which scales <b>39</b>Y<sub>1</sub>, <b>39</b>Y<sub>2</sub>, <b>39</b>X<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>X<sub>2 </sub>are placed facing. Therefore, in linear encoders <b>70</b>A to <b>70</b>D, the optical path length of the beam irradiated from each head to the facing scale (grating) is much shorter, compared with those of Y-axis interferometer <b>18</b> and X-axis interferometer <b>130</b>, and therefore, the beam is difficult to be affected by air fluctuations, and short-term stability of the measurement values is superior to those of Y-axis interferometer <b>18</b> and X-axis interferometer <b>130</b>. Accordingly, it becomes possible to stably perform position control of wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST) holding a wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0358" num="0357">Further, according to the embodiment, the placement distance in the X-axis direction between a plurality of Y heads <b>64</b> whose measurement direction is the Y-axis direction is narrower than a width in the X-axis direction of Y scale <b>39</b>Y<sub>1 </sub>or <b>39</b>Y<sub>2</sub>, and the placement distance in the Y-axis direction between a plurality of X heads <b>66</b> whose measurement direction is the X-axis direction is narrower than a width in the Y-axis direction of X scale <b>39</b>X<sub>1 </sub>or <b>39</b>X<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, when moving wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST), the Y-position of wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST) can be measured based on the measurement values of Y linear encoder <b>70</b>A or <b>70</b>C that irradiates detection lights (beams) to Y scale <b>39</b>Y<sub>1 </sub>or <b>39</b>Y<sub>2</sub>, while sequentially switching a plurality of Y heads <b>64</b>, and in parallel with this operation, the X-position of wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST) can be measured based on the measurement values of X linear encoder <b>70</b>B or <b>70</b>D that irradiates detection lights (beams) to X scale <b>39</b>X<sub>1 </sub>or <b>39</b>X<sub>2</sub>, while sequentially switching a plurality of X heads <b>66</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0359" num="0358">Further, according to the embodiment, when moving wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST) in the Y-axis direction for obtaining the correction information on grating pitch of the scales described above, main controller <b>20</b> obtains correction information (correction information on grating warp) used to correct warp of each grating line <b>37</b> that constitutes X scales <b>39</b>X<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>X<sub>2</sub>, in the procedures described previously. Then, while correcting the measurement values obtained from head units <b>62</b>B and <b>62</b>D based on the Y-position information of wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST) and the correction information on grating warp of X scales <b>39</b>X<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>X<sub>2</sub>, (and the correction information on grating pitch), main controller <b>20</b> performs the driving of wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST) in the X-axis direction using X scales <b>39</b>X<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>X<sub>2 </sub>and head units <b>62</b>B and <b>62</b>D. Accordingly, it becomes possible to accurately perform the driving of wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST) in the X-axis direction using head units <b>62</b>B and <b>62</b>D that use X scales <b>39</b>X<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>X<sub>2 </sub>(encoders <b>70</b>B and <b>70</b>D), without being affected by the warp of each grating constituting X scales <b>39</b>X<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>X<sub>2</sub>. Further, by performing the similar operation to the above operation also with respect to the Y-axis direction, the driving of wafer table WTB (wafer stage WST) in the Y-axis direction can also be performed with good accuracy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0360" num="0359">Incidentally, in the embodiment above, the case has been exemplified where a pair of Y scales <b>39</b>Y<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>Y<sub>2 </sub>used for Y-axis direction position measurement and a pair of X scales <b>39</b>X<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>X<sub>2 </sub>used for X-axis direction position measurement are arranged on wafer table WTB, and corresponding to these scales, a pair of head units <b>62</b>A and <b>62</b>C are placed on one side and the other side in the X-axis direction with projection optical system PL in between, and two head units <b>62</b>B and <b>62</b>D are placed on one side and the other side in the Y-axis direction with projection optical system PL in between. However, the present invention is not limited to this, and only one scale of at least either pair of Y scales <b>39</b>Y<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>Y<sub>2 </sub>for Y-axis direction position measurement or X scales <b>39</b>X<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>X<sub>2 </sub>for X-axis direction position measurement may be arranged alone, not in pairs on wafer table WTB, or only one head unit of at least either of a pair of head units <b>62</b>A and <b>62</b>C or two head units <b>62</b>B and <b>62</b>D may be arranged. Further, the direction in which the scales are arranged and the direction in which head units are arranged are not limited to orthogonal directions such as the X-axis direction and the Y-axis direction as in the embodiment above, but only have to be directions that intersect each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0361" num="0360">Incidentally, in the description above, the case has been described where while wafer replacement is being performed on wafer stage WST, the Sec-BCHK (interval) is performed using CD bar <b>46</b> of measurement stage MST. However, the present invention is not limited to this, and at least one of irregular illuminance measurement (and illuminance measurement), aerial image measurement, wavefront aberration measurement and the like is performed using the measurement members of measurement stage MST, and the measurement result may also be reflected in exposure of a wafer that is performed after that. Specifically, for example, adjustment of projection optical system PL can be performed by adjusting unit <b>68</b> based on the measurement result.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0362" num="0361">Incidentally, in the embodiment above, the case has been described where wafer table WTB is moved at a low speed (extremely low speed) at a level in which short-term fluctuation of the measurement values of the interferometers can be ignored when performing the calibration to obtain the correction information on grating pitch of scales. However, the present invention is not limited to this, and wafer table WTB can also be moved at a speed which is not an extremely low speed. In this case, for example, in the case correction information on grating pitch of Y scales <b>39</b>Y<sub>1 </sub>and <b>39</b>Y<sub>2</sub>, or the like is obtained, correction information (e.g. correction map) of grating pitch of the Y scales may also be independently obtained, by setting the wafer table at the positions that are different in the X-axis direction, and while moving the wafer table in the Y-axis direction as in the embodiment above at each of the X-positions, simultaneously loading the measurement values of encoders <b>70</b>A and <b>70</b>C, the measurement value of Y-axis interferometer <b>16</b> and the measurement values of head units <b>62</b>A and <b>62</b>C during the movement, setting up the simultaneous equations using the sampling values that have been obtained in the twice-operations of simultaneous loading, and solving the simultaneous equations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0363" num="0362">Further, in the embodiment above, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, an encoder by a diffraction interference method in which the light from the light source is branched by the optical element such as the beam splitter and two reflection mirrors to reflect the light after the branch are equipped is to be used as encoders <b>70</b>A to <b>70</b>F. However, the types of encoders are not limited to this, and an encoder by a diffraction interference method using three gratings, or an encoder equipped with light reflection block that is disclosed in, for example, Kokai (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication) No. 2005-114406 and the like may also be used. Further, in the embodiment above, head units <b>62</b>A to <b>62</b>D are to have a plurality of heads placed at a predetermined distance. However, the present invention is not limited this, and a single head may also be employed, which is equipped with a light source that emits a light beam to an area elongated in the pitch direction of the Y scale or X scale, and multiple light-receiving elements that are densely arrayed in the pitch direction of the Y scale or the X scale and receive a reflected light (diffracted light) of the light beam from the Y scale or X scale (diffraction grating).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0364" num="0363">Further, in the embodiment above, damage of the diffraction gratings may also be prevented by covering the reflective diffraction gratings with a protection member (such as a thin film, or a glass plate) that can transmit the detection lights from head units <b>62</b>A to <b>62</b>D. Further, in the embodiment above, the reflective diffraction gratings are to be arranged on the upper surface of wafer stage WST substantially parallel to the XY plane, but the reflective diffraction gratings may also be arranged on the lower surface of wafer stage WST, for example. In this case, head units <b>62</b>A to <b>62</b>D are, for example, placed on the base plate to which the lower surface of wafer stage WST faces. Moreover, in the embodiment above, wafer stage WST is to be moved within the horizontal plane, but may also be moved within a plane that intersect the horizontal plane (such as a ZX plane). Further, in the case reticle stage RST is two-dimensionally moved, an encoder system having the configuration similar to the above-described encoder system may also be arranged to measure position information of reticle stage RST.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0365" num="0364">Incidentally, in the embodiment above, interferometer system <b>118</b> is to be capable of measuring position information of wafer stage WST in directions of five degrees of freedom (the X-axis, Y-axis, θx, θy and θz directions), but may be capable of measuring also position information in the Z-axis direction. In this case, at least at the time of exposure operation, position control of wafer stage WST may also be performed using the measurement values of the encoder system described above and the measurement values of interferometer system <b>118</b> (including at least position information in the Z-axis direction). Interferometer system <b>118</b> measures position information in the Z-axis direction of wafer stage WST, by arranging a reflection surface, which is inclined at a predetermined angle (e.g. 45 degrees) with respect to the XY plane, on the side surface of wafer stage WST, and irradiating a measurement beam via the reflection surface to a reflection surface arranged on, for example, on the barrel platform or the measurement frame described above, as is disclosed in, for example, Kokai (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication) No. 2000-323404 (the corresponding U.S. Pat. No. 7,116,401), Kohyo (published Japanese translation of International Publication for Patent Application) No. 2001-513267 (the corresponding U.S. Pat. No. 6,208,407), and the like. Interferometer system <b>118</b> can also measure position information in the θx direction and/or the θy direction, in addition to the Z-axis direction, using a plurality of measurement beams. In this case, the measurement beams used to measure position information in the θx direction and/or the θy direction that are irradiated to the movable mirror of wafer stage WST do not have to be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0366" num="0365">Incidentally, in the embodiment above, a plurality of Z sensors <b>74</b> <sub>i,j </sub>and <b>76</b> <sub>p,q </sub>are to be arranged at head units <b>62</b>C and <b>62</b>A. However, the present invention is not limited to this, and a surface position sensor similar to the Z sensor may also be arranged on, for example, the measurement frame. Further, a distance between the encoder head or the Z sensor and the upper surface of the wafer stage is preferably equal to or less than a distance between tip optical element <b>191</b> of projection optical system PL and the upper surface of the wafer stage, for example, shorter than the distance. Thus, the measurement accuracy can be improved. In this case, a simple Z sensor is effective, precisely because it is difficult to arrange the AF sensor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0367" num="0366">Incidentally, in the embodiment above, the lower surface of nozzle unit <b>32</b> and the lower end surface of the tip optical element of projection optical system PL are to be substantially flush. However, the present invention is not limited to this, and for example, the lower surface of nozzle unit <b>32</b> may also be placed closer to the image plane of projection optical system (i.e. to the wafer) than the outgoing surface of the tip optical element. That is, the configuration of local liquid immersion unit <b>8</b> is not limited to the above-described configuration, and the configurations can be used, which are described in, for example, EP Patent Application Publication No. 1 420 298, the pamphlet of International Publication No. 2004/055803, the pamphlet of International Publication No. 2004/057590, the pamphlet of International Publication No. 2005/029559 (the corresponding U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2006/0231206), the pamphlet of International Publication No. 2004/086468 (the corresponding U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0280791), Kokai (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication) No. 2004-289126 (the corresponding U.S. Pat.

Further, as disclosed in the pamphlet of International Publication No. 2004/019128 (the corresponding U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0248856), the optical path on the object plane side of the tip optical element may also be filled with liquid, in addition to the optical path on the image plane side of the tip optical element. Furthermore, a thin film that is lyophilic and/or has dissolution preventing function may also be formed on the partial surface (including at least a contact surface with liquid) or the entire surface of the tip optical element. Incidentally, quartz has a high affinity for liquid, and also needs no dissolution preventing film, while in the case of fluorite, at least a dissolution preventing film is preferably formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0368" num="0367">Incidentally, in the embodiment above, pure water (water) is to be used as liquid, however, the present invention is not limited to this as matter of course. As the liquid, liquid that is chemically stable, having high transmittance to illumination light IL and safe to use, such as a fluorine-containing inert liquid may be used. As the fluorine-containing inert liquid, for example, Fluorinert (the brand name of 3M United States) can be used. The fluorine-containing inert liquid is also excellent from the point of cooling effect. Further, as the liquid, liquid which has a refractive index higher than pure water (a refractive index is around 1.44), for example, liquid having a refractive index equal to or higher than 1.5 may be used. As this type of liquid, for example, a predetermined liquid having C—H binding or O—H binding such as isopropanol having a refractive index of about 1.50, glycerol (glycerin) having a refractive index of about 1.61, a predetermined liquid (organic solvent) such as hexane, heptane or decane, or decalin (decahydronaphthalene) having a refractive index of about 1.60, or the like can be cited. Alternatively, a liquid obtained by mixing arbitrary two or more of these liquids may be used, or a liquid obtained by adding (mixing) at least one of these liquids to (with) pure water may be used. Alternatively, as the liquid, a liquid obtained by adding (mixing) base or acid such as H<sup>+</sup>, Cs<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>−</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub> <sup>2−</sup>, or PO<sub>4</sub> <sup>2−</sup> to (with) pure water may be used. Moreover, a liquid obtained by adding (mixing) particles of Al oxide or the like to (with) pure water may be used. These liquids can transmit ArF excimer laser light. Further, as the liquid, liquid, which has a small absorption coefficient of light, is less temperature-dependent, and is stable to a projection optical system (tip optical member) and/or a photosensitive agent (or a protection film (top coat film), an antireflection film, or the like) coated on the surface of a wafer, is preferable. Further, in the case an F<sub>2 </sub>laser is used as the light source, fomblin oil may be selected. Further, as the liquid, a liquid having a higher refractive index to illumination light IL than that of pure water, for example, a refractive index of around 1.6 to 1.8 may be used. As the liquid, supercritical fluid can also be used. Further, the tip optical element of projection optical system PL may be formed by quartz (silica), or single-crystal materials of fluoride compound such as calcium fluoride (fluorite), barium fluoride, strontium fluoride, lithium fluoride, and sodium fluoride, or may be formed by materials having a higher refractive index than that of quartz or fluorite (e.g. equal to or higher than 1.6). As the materials having a refractive index equal to or higher than 1.6, for example, sapphire, germanium dioxide, or the like disclosed in the pamphlet of International Publication No. 2005/059617, or kalium chloride (having a refractive index of about 1.75) or the like disclosed in the pamphlet of International Publication No. 2005/059618 can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0369" num="0368">Further, in the embodiment above, the recovered liquid may be reused, and in this case, a filter that removes impurities from the recovered liquid is preferably arranged in a liquid recovery unit, a recovery pipe or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0370" num="0369">Further, in the embodiment above, the case has been described where the exposure apparatus is a liquid immersion type exposure apparatus. However, the present invention is not limited to this, but can also be employed in a dry type exposure apparatus that performs exposure of wafer W without liquid (water).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0371" num="0370">Incidentally, in the embodiment above, the case has been described where the present invention is applied to the exposure apparatus that is equipped with all of wafer stage WST (movable body), measurement sage MST (another movable body), the alignment systems (AL<b>1</b>, AL<b>2</b> <sub>4 </sub>to AL<b>2</b> <sub>4</sub>), the multipoint AF system (<b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b</i>), the Z sensors, interferometer system <b>118</b>, the encoder system (<b>70</b>A to <b>70</b>F) and the like, but the present invention is not limited to this. For example, the present invention can also be applied to an exposure apparatus in which measurement stage MST or the like is not arranged. The present invention can be applied as far as an exposure apparatus is equipped with the wafer stage (movable body) and other partial constituents out of the above-described constituents. As an example, the invention focusing on the mark detection system, for example, can be applied as far as an exposure apparatus is equipped with at least wafer stage WST and the alignment systems. Further, it is a matter of course that both of the interferometer system and the encoder system do not always have to be arranged.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0372" num="0371">Further, in the embodiment above, the case has been described where aerial image measuring unit <b>45</b> is dividedly placed at different stages, specifically, at wafer stage WST and measurement stage MST. However, the sensor that is dividedly placed is not limited to the aerial image measuring unit, but may be a wavefront aberration measuring instrument or the like, for example. Further, the different stages do not limited to the combination of the substrate stage and measurement stage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0373" num="0372">Further, in the embodiment above, the case has been described where the present invention is applied to a scanning exposure apparatus by a step-and-scan method or the like. However, the present invention is not limited to this, but may also be applied to a static exposure apparatus such as a stepper. Even with the stepper or the like, by measuring the position of a stage on which an object subject to exposure is mounted by encoders, generation of position measurement error caused by air fluctuations can substantially be nulled likewise. In this case, it becomes possible to set the position of the stage with high precision based on correction information used to correct short-term fluctuation of the measurement values of the encoders using the measurement values of the interferometers and based on the measurement values of the encoders, and as a consequence, highly accurate transfer of a reticle pattern onto the object can be performed. Further, the present invention can also be applied to a reduction projection exposure apparatus by a step-and-stitch method that synthesizes a shot area and a shot area, an exposure apparatus by a proximity method, a mirror projection aligner, or the like. Moreover, the present invention can also be applied to a multi-stage type exposure apparatus equipped with plural wafer stages, as is disclosed in, for example, Kokai (Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publications) No. 10-163099 and No. 10-214783 (the corresponding U.S. Pat. No. 6,590,634), Kohyo (published Japanese translation of International Publication for Patent Application) No. 2000-505958 (the corresponding U.S. Pat. No. 5,969,441), the U.S. Pat. No. 6,208,407, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0374" num="0373">Further, the magnification of the projection optical system in the exposure apparatus of the embodiment above is not only a reduction system, but also may be either an equal magnifying system or a magnifying system, and projection optical system PL is not only a dioptric system, but also may be either a catoptric system or a catadioptric system, and in addition, the projected image may be either an inverted image or an upright image. Moreover, exposure area IA to which illumination light IL is irradiated via projection optical system PL is an on-axis area that includes optical axis AX within the field of projection optical system PL. However, for example, as is disclosed in the pamphlet of International Publication No. 2004/107011, exposure area IA may also be an off-axis area that does not include optical axis AX, similar to a so-called inline type catadioptric system, in part of which an optical system (catoptric system or catadioptric system) that has plural reflection surfaces and forms an intermediate image at least once is arranged, and which has a single optical axis. Further, the illumination area and exposure area described above are to have a rectangular shape. However, the shape is not limited to rectangular, but may also be circular arc, trapezoidal, parallelogram or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0375" num="0374">Incidentally, a light source of the exposure apparatus in the embodiment above is not limited to the ArF excimer laser, but a pulse laser light source such as a KrF excimer laser (output wavelength: 248 nm), an F<sub>2 </sub>laser (output wavelength: 157 nm), an Ar<sub>2 </sub>laser (output wavelength: 126 nm) or a Kr<sub>2 </sub>laser (output wavelength: 146 nm), or an extra-high pressure mercury lamp that generates an emission line such as a g-line (wavelength: 436 nm) or an i-line (wavelength: 365 nm) can also be used. Further, a harmonic wave generating unit of a YAG laser or the like can also be used. Besides, as is disclosed in, for example, the pamphlet of International Publication No. 1999/46835 (the corresponding U.S. Pat. No. 7,023,610), a harmonic wave, which is obtained by amplifying a single-wavelength laser beam in the infrared or visible range emitted by a DFB semiconductor laser or fiber laser as vacuum ultraviolet light, with a fiber amplifier doped with, for example, erbium (or both erbium and ytteribium), and by converting the wavelength into ultraviolet light using a nonlinear optical crystal, may also be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0376" num="0375">Further, in the embodiment above, illumination light IL of the exposure apparatus is not limited to the light having a wavelength equal to or more than 100 nm, and it is needless to say that the light having a wavelength less than 100 nm may be used. For example, in recent years, in order to expose a pattern equal to or less than 70 nm, an EUV exposure apparatus that makes an SOR or a plasma laser as a light source generate an EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) light in a soft X-ray range (e.g. a wavelength range from 5 to 15 nm), and uses a total reflection reduction optical system designed under the exposure wavelength (e.g. 13.5 nm) and the reflective mask has been developed. In the EUV exposure apparatus, the arrangement in which scanning exposure is performed by synchronously scanning a mask and a wafer using a circular arc illumination can be considered, and therefore, the present invention can also be suitably applied to such an exposure apparatus. Besides, the present invention can also be applied to an exposure apparatus that uses charged particle beams such as an electron beam or an ion beam.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0377" num="0376">Further, in the embodiment above, a transmissive type mask (reticle), which is a transmissive substrate on which a predetermined light shielding pattern (or a phase pattern or a light attenuation pattern) is formed, is used. Instead of this reticle, however, as is disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,778,257, an electron mask (which is also called a variable shaped mask, an active mask or an image generator, and includes, for example, a DMD (Digital Micromirror Device) that is a type of a non-emission type image display device (spatial light modulator) or the like) on which a light-transmitting pattern, a reflection pattern, or an emission pattern is formed according to electronic data of the pattern that is to be exposed may also be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0378" num="0377">Further, as is disclosed in, for example, the pamphlet of International Publication No. 2001/035168, the present invention can also be applied to an exposure apparatus (lithography system) that forms line-and-space patterns on a wafer by forming interference fringes on the wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0379" num="0378">Moreover, the present invention can also be applied to an exposure apparatus that synthesizes two reticle patterns via a projection optical system and almost simultaneously performs double exposure of one shot area by one scanning exposure, as is disclosed in, for example, Kohyo (published Japanese translation of International Publication for Patent Application) No. 2004-519850 (the corresponding U.S. Pat. No. 6,611,316).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0380" num="0379">Further, an apparatus that forms a pattern on an object is not limited to the exposure apparatus (lithography system) described above, and for example, the present invention can also be applied to an apparatus that forms a pattern on an object by an ink-jet method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0381" num="0380">Incidentally, an object on which a pattern is to be formed (an object subject to exposure to which an energy beam is irradiated) in the embodiment above is not limited to a wafer, but may be other objects such as a glass plate, a ceramic substrate, a film member, or a mask blank.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0382" num="0381">The usage of the exposure apparatus is not limited to the exposure apparatus used for manufacturing semiconductor devices. The present invention can be widely applied also to, for example, an exposure apparatus for manufacturing liquid crystal display devices which transfers a liquid crystal display device pattern onto a square-shaped glass plate, and to an exposure apparatus for manufacturing organic EL, thin-film magnetic heads, imaging devices (such as CCDs), micromachines, DNA chips or the like. Further, the present invention can also be applied to an exposure apparatus that transfers a circuit pattern onto a glass substrate or a silicon wafer not only when producing microdevices such as semiconductor devices, but also when producing a reticle or a mask used in an exposure apparatus such as an optical exposure apparatus, an EUV exposure apparatus, an X-ray exposure apparatus, and an electron beam exposure apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0383" num="0382">Incidentally, the mark detecting apparatus of the present invention can be applied not only to the exposure apparatus, but can also be applied widely to other substrate processing apparatuses (such as a laser repair apparatus, a substrate inspection apparatus and the like), or to apparatuses equipped with a movable body such as a stage that moves within a two-dimensional plane such as a position setting apparatus for specimen or a wire bonding apparatus in other precision machines.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0384" num="0383">Further, the exposure apparatus (the pattern forming apparatus) of the embodiment above is manufactured by assembling various subsystems, which include the respective constituents that are recited in the claims of the present application, so as to keep predetermined mechanical accuracy, electrical accuracy and optical accuracy. In order to secure these various kinds of accuracy, before and after the assembly, adjustment to achieve the optical accuracy for various optical systems, adjustment to achieve the mechanical accuracy for various mechanical systems, and adjustment to achieve the electrical accuracy for various electric systems are performed. A process of assembling various subsystems into the exposure apparatus includes mechanical connection, wiring connection of electric circuits, piping connection of pressure circuits, and the like among various types of subsystems. Needless to say, an assembly process of individual subsystem is performed before the process of assembling the various subsystems into the exposure apparatus. When the process of assembling the various subsystems into the exposure apparatus is completed, a total adjustment is performed and various kinds of accuracy as the entire exposure apparatus are secured. Incidentally, the making of the exposure apparatus is preferably performed in a clean room where the temperature, the degree of cleanliness and the like are controlled.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0385" num="0384">Incidentally, the above disclosures of the various publications, the pamphlets of the International Publications, and the U.S. Patent Application Publication descriptions and the U.S. Patent descriptions that are cited in the embodiment above and related to exposure apparatuses and the like are each incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0386" num="0385">Next, an embodiment of a device manufacturing method in which the foregoing exposure apparatus (pattern forming apparatus) is used in a lithography process will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0387" num="0386"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref> shows a flowchart of an example when manufacturing a device (a semiconductor chip such as an IC or an LSI, a liquid crystal panel, a CCD, a thin film magnetic head, a micromachine, and the like). As is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, first of all, in step <b>201</b> (design step), function and performance design of device (such as circuit design of semiconductor device) is performed, and pattern design to realize the function is performed. Then, in step <b>202</b> (mask manufacturing step), a mask on which the designed circuit pattern is formed is manufactured. Meanwhile, in step <b>203</b> (wafer manufacturing step), a wafer is manufactured using materials such as silicon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0388" num="0387">Next, in step <b>204</b> (wafer processing step), the actual circuit and the like are formed on the wafer by lithography or the like in a manner that will be described later, using the mask and the wafer prepared in steps <b>201</b> to <b>203</b>. Then, in step <b>205</b> (device assembly step), device assembly is performed using the wafer processed in step <b>204</b>. Step <b>205</b> includes processes such as the dicing process, the bonding process, and the packaging process (chip encapsulation), and the like when necessary.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0389" num="0388">Finally, in step <b>206</b> (inspection step), tests on operation, durability, and the like are performed on the devices made in step <b>205</b>. After these steps, the devices are completed and shipped out.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0390" num="0389"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref> is a flowchart showing a detailed example of step <b>204</b> described above. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, in step <b>211</b> (oxidation step), the surface of wafer is oxidized. In step <b>212</b> (CDV step), an insulating film is formed on the wafer surface. In step <b>213</b> (electrode formation step), an electrode is formed on the wafer by deposition. In step <b>214</b> (ion implantation step), ions are implanted into the wafer. Each of the above steps <b>211</b> to <b>214</b> constitutes the pre-process in each stage of wafer processing, and the necessary processing is chosen and is executed at each stage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0391" num="0390">When the above-described pre-process ends in each stage of wafer process, post-process is executed as follows. In the post-process, first in step <b>215</b> (resist formation step), a photosensitive agent is coated on the wafer. Then, in step <b>216</b> (exposure step), the circuit pattern of the mask is transferred onto the wafer by the exposure apparatus (pattern forming apparatus) described above and the exposure method (pattern forming method) thereof. Next, in step <b>217</b> (development step), the wafer that has been exposed is developed, and in step <b>218</b> (etching step), an exposed member of an area other than the area where resist remains is removed by etching. Then, in step <b>219</b> (resist removing step), when etching is completed, the resist that is no longer necessary is removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0392" num="0391">By repeatedly performing the pre-process and the post-process, multiple circuit patterns are formed on the wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0393" num="0392">By using the device manufacturing method of the embodiment described above, because the exposure apparatus (pattern forming apparatus) in the embodiment above and the exposure method (pattern forming method) thereof are used in the exposure step (step <b>216</b>), exposure with high throughput can be performed while maintaining the high overlay accuracy. Accordingly, the productivity of highly integrated microdevices on which fine patterns are formed can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0394" num="0393">While the above-described embodiments of the present invention are the presently preferred embodiments thereof, those skilled in the art of lithography systems will readily recognize that numerous additions, modifications, and substitutions may be made to the above-described embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.
