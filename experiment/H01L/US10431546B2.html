<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Forming semiconductor devices by laminating semiconductor wafers has been studied for the purposes of reducing footprints and the like. For such semiconductor devices, there is a demand to provide electrical continuity between semiconductor wafers. A technique of bonding semiconductor wafers and then electrically connecting circuits provided on the semiconductor wafers is disclosed in US2011/0102657. Specifically, a connection hole is formed in each semiconductor wafer and the connection holes are filled with a conductive material to provide the electrical continuity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a diagram of exemplified defects that can be caused in a semiconductor device when the manufacturing method described in US2011/0102657 is used. With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a first semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> and a second semiconductor substrate <b>20</b> have been bonded and laminated with a first wiring structure <b>31</b> and a second wiring structure <b>32</b> interposed therebetween. The first wiring structure <b>31</b> includes a first conductive line <b>311</b>, and the second wiring structure <b>32</b> includes a second conductive line <b>322</b>. In order to connect the first conductive line <b>311</b> and the second conductive line <b>322</b> electrically, this laminate has been perforated to form holes <b>65</b> and <b>66</b> which are then filled with a conductive material <b>68</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, one hole is provided for each conductive line, namely the hole <b>65</b> extending toward the second conductive line <b>322</b> and the hole <b>66</b> extending toward the first conductive line <b>311</b>. Hence, a foreign substance <b>531</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, would prevent a connection hole from being formed to reach the second conductive line <b>322</b>, posing a risk of connection failure between the substrates due to defective perforation. Furthermore, even if a hole is formed successfully to reach the first conductive line <b>311</b>, a foreign substance <b>532</b> may prevent a conductive material from being filled in the hole successfully to reach the first conductive line <b>311</b>, posing a risk of the connection failure between the substrates due to defective filling of the conductive material. As a matter of course, the defective filling may occur in the hole <b>65</b>, and the defective perforation may happen to the hole <b>66</b>. As described above, the related art suffers from a low degree of reliability of the electrical continuity between the first conductive line <b>311</b> and the second conductive line <b>322</b>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">As described above, the connecting member <b>69</b> according to the present embodiment includes conductive sections (the first penetrating conductive section <b>6821</b> and the second penetrating conductive section <b>6822</b>), each of which is connected to the second wiring section <b>320</b>. Note that providing a plurality of penetrating conductive sections in contact with the second wiring section <b>320</b> results in a plurality of conductive sections residing separately in a plane parallel to the semiconductor substrate as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. The conductive sections have substantially an identical potential through at least the second wiring section <b>320</b>. In other words, the conductive sections are electrically continuous. In this way, even if one penetrating conductive section suffers from a connection failure, the connection between the first wiring section <b>310</b> and the second wiring section <b>320</b> is secured because of another penetrating conductive section. In other words, by providing redundancy for the connection between the second wiring section <b>320</b> and the first wiring section <b>310</b>, the reliability of the connection between the second wiring section <b>320</b> and the first wiring section <b>310</b> is improved. Three or more conductive sections may be in contact with the second wiring section <b>320</b>. Such a connecting method enables improvement of the reliability of the electrical continuity between the first wiring section <b>310</b> and the second wiring section <b>320</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">Also note that the redundancy is provided for both the conductive sections (the non-penetrating conductive sections) in contact with the first wiring section <b>310</b> and the conductive sections (the penetrating conductive sections) in contact with the second wiring section <b>320</b>. One of the conductive sections in contact with the first wiring section <b>310</b> and the conductive section in contact with the second wiring section <b>320</b>, however, may be provided with the redundancy. It is desirable, though, that at least the conductive section (the penetrating conductive section) for the second wiring section <b>320</b> be provided with the redundancy. This is because the conductive section (the penetrating conductive section) in contact with the second wiring section <b>320</b> is typically extended deeply than the conductive section in contact with the first wiring section <b>310</b>, and, thus, more susceptible to the connection failure due to a foreign substance.</div>

For example, in a case in which the image sensing region <b>11</b> includes pixels arrayed in rows and columns, and signals output from these columns are transferred in parallel to the signal processing region <b>22</b>, the connecting member <b>69</b> is provided for each column. For example, in a case in which the image sensing region <b>11</b> includes a pixel array of 3000 rows×4000 columns, the number of connecting members <b>69</b> can be 4000. If even one of the 4000 connecting members <b>69</b> suffers a problem, an operation of all the 3000 pixels in the row of the one connecting member <b>69</b> will be unstable, possibly resulting in a lowered yield if the instability brings about an intolerable effect. By providing the redundancy for the connecting member <b>69</b>, however, the yield can be improved.</div>

In particular, a foreign substance, which is produced during processing inside a forming apparatus for a connection hole or a film forming apparatus for a conductive material, is less likely to be removed by washing or the like, and thus has a significant effect on the perforation of the connection hole and the filling of the conductive material. The by-product is more likely to be produced during the formation of a deep connection hole (a penetrating connection hole) in comparison with the formation of a shallow connection hole (a non-penetrating connection hole) In addition, a foreign substance is more likely to cause the defective formation during the formation of a deep connection hole (a penetrating connection hole) in comparison with the formation of a shallow connection hole (non-penetrating connection hole).

If, however, the second conductive line <b>322</b> in the second semiconductor wafer <b>222</b> is exposed at a surface of the second wiring structure <b>32</b>, perforating the first semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> and the first wiring structure <b>31</b> is sufficient, and hence the second semiconductor wafer <b>222</b> does not have to be perforated. Furthermore, if the first conductive line <b>311</b> is exposed at a surface of the first wiring structure <b>31</b>, the formation of the non-penetrating connection hole may be excluded.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">Subsequently, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>, a conductive material, such as copper and tungsten, is deposited in regions including the coupling groove <b>64</b>, the light shield groove <b>82</b>, the first non-penetrating connection hole <b>651</b> and the second non-penetrating connection hole <b>652</b>, and the first penetrating connection hole <b>661</b> and the second penetrating connection hole <b>662</b>. A surface is then polished with the CMP (Chemical Mechanical Polishing) to remove an excess conductive material. In this way, the conductive material present inside the coupling groove <b>64</b>, the light shield groove <b>82</b>, the first non-penetrating connection hole <b>651</b> and the second non-penetrating connection hole <b>652</b>, and the first penetrating connection hole <b>661</b> and the second penetrating connection hole <b>662</b> survives. In other words, the connecting member <b>69</b> is formed with a so-called damascene process. In this example, a dual damascene process is employed, in which a groove (a trench) and a hole (a via) are both formed and then filled with a conductive material. In addition, in this example, a trench-first dual-damascene process is used, in which the groove (the trench) is formed before the hole (the via). A via-first dual-damascene process may also be used, in which the hole (the via) is formed before the groove (the trench). Here, a plating method may be used for filling the copper as the conductive material, and a sputtering method or a CVD method may be used for filling the tungsten. The light shield <b>63</b> is also formed through the damascene process. In this way, the coupling groove <b>64</b>, the light shield groove <b>82</b>, the first non-penetrating connection hole <b>651</b> and the second non-penetrating connection hole <b>652</b>, and the first penetrating connection hole <b>661</b> and the second penetrating connection hole <b>662</b> are filled with the conductive material. The group of metal layers <b>45</b> formed in the first wiring structure <b>31</b> and the group of metal layers <b>55</b> formed in the second wiring structure <b>32</b> are electrically connected. This creates the connecting member <b>69</b> in the region inside the isolating section <b>42</b> and the light shield <b>63</b> in the light-shielded region. The non-penetrating conductive sections <b>6811</b> and <b>6812</b> are formed in the first non-penetrating connection hole <b>651</b> and the second non-penetrating connection hole <b>652</b>, respectively. The penetrating conductive sections <b>6821</b> and <b>6822</b> are formed in the first penetrating connection hole <b>661</b> and the second penetrating connection hole <b>662</b>, respectively. The coupling conductive section <b>680</b>, which is formed in the coupling groove <b>64</b> and includes damascene wiring, electrically connects the non-penetrating conductive sections <b>6811</b> and <b>6812</b> and the penetrating conductive sections <b>6821</b> and <b>6822</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">At this point, the fourth metal layer <b>55</b> <i>d</i>, formed in the second wiring structure <b>32</b> on the second semiconductor substrate <b>20</b>, is provided with the barrier metal layer. Hence, even if the connecting member <b>69</b> is made of copper, the diffusion of the copper is prevented. In addition, the side walls, which are located inside the first non-penetrating connection hole <b>651</b> and the second non-penetrating connection hole <b>652</b>, and the first penetrating connection hole <b>661</b> and the second penetrating connection hole <b>662</b>, and penetrate the first semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>, are provided with the insulating films <b>67</b>. Hence, the connecting member <b>69</b> and the first semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> are electrically isolated from each other, and will not be connected with each other. In addition, in this example of the present embodiment, the connecting member <b>69</b> is formed inside the isolating section <b>42</b> provided in the first semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>, which also prevents the electrical connection between the connecting member <b>69</b> and the first semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">In the step to form the connecting member <b>69</b> according to this example of the present embodiment, the coupling groove <b>64</b>, the light shield groove <b>82</b>, the first non-penetrating connection hole <b>651</b> and the second non-penetrating connection hole <b>652</b>, and the first penetrating connection hole <b>661</b> and the second penetrating connection hole <b>662</b> are formed in three separate phases using the damascene process to fill the copper. This, however, is not intended to be limiting. Various modifications are possible as long as the connecting member <b>69</b> is formed to electrically connect the first metal layer <b>45</b> <i>a</i>, located in the first wiring structure <b>31</b> on the top of the first semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>, and the fourth metal layer <b>55</b> <i>d</i>, located in the second wiring structure <b>32</b> on the top of the second semiconductor substrate <b>20</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">For example, the connecting member <b>69</b> can be deposited with the CVD method or the sputtering method, and formed with typical lithography and the dry etching. In this way, however, sensitivity degradation due to the deposition of metal layers will be less likely to be tolerable. Hence, it is desirable that a damascene wiring structure with minimized lamination of insulating films be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">Furthermore, in this example, the light shield groove <b>82</b>, which is for forming the light shield <b>63</b>, is formed simultaneously with the coupling groove <b>64</b>, which is for forming the connecting member <b>69</b>. The light shield groove <b>82</b> may be, however, formed after the formation of the coupling groove <b>64</b>, the first non-penetrating connection hole <b>651</b> and the second non-penetrating connection hole <b>652</b>, the first penetrating connection hole <b>661</b> and the second penetrating connection hole <b>662</b>, and the isolating section <b>42</b>. In this case, the light shield groove <b>82</b> is formed on a layer identical to that of the coupling groove <b>64</b>. Also, the light shield groove <b>82</b> is filled with the conductive material simultaneously with the coupling groove <b>64</b>, the first non-penetrating connection hole <b>651</b> and the second non-penetrating connection hole <b>652</b>, and the first penetrating connection hole <b>661</b> and second penetrating connection hole <b>662</b>. Processing the light shield groove <b>82</b> simultaneously with the coupling groove <b>64</b>, the first non-penetrating connection hole <b>651</b> and the second non-penetrating connection hole <b>652</b>, and the first penetrating connection hole <b>661</b> and the second penetrating connection hole <b>662</b> simplifies steps. In this case, though, during the formation of the isolating section <b>42</b>, an isolating section <b>42</b> may be formed also inside the light shield groove <b>82</b>, which may lead to failure to provide a desired line width of the light shield <b>63</b>. With smaller pixels, it is desirable that the light shield groove <b>82</b> be formed in a separate phase from the coupling groove <b>64</b>, the first non-penetrating connection hole <b>651</b> and the second non-penetrating connection hole <b>652</b>, and the first penetrating connection hole <b>661</b> and the second penetrating connection hole <b>662</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">The light shield <b>63</b> can be formed with tungsten, aluminum, or the like in a separate step prior to forming the connecting member <b>69</b>. Forming the light shield <b>63</b> through the damascene process simultaneously with the formation of the connecting member <b>69</b>, however, can simplify steps. This also allows the reduction in thickness of the insulating layers (e.g. the insulating layer <b>62</b>) located at the side of a light receiving section (the backside) of the first semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>, contributing to an improvement of the sensitivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">The first penetrating connection hole <b>661</b> and the second penetrating connection hole <b>662</b> have depths 1.5 to 10 times deeper than those of the first non-penetrating connection hole <b>651</b> and the second non-penetrating connection hole <b>652</b>. Hence, even when the first non-penetrating connection hole <b>651</b> and the second non-penetrating connection hole <b>652</b> are successfully filled with the conductive material, the first penetrating connection hole <b>661</b> and the second penetrating connection hole <b>662</b>, each having an identical opening size with the first non-penetrating connection hole <b>651</b> and the second non-penetrating connection hole <b>652</b>, may have a void.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">In this example of the present embodiment, the first penetrating connection hole <b>661</b> and the second penetrating connection hole <b>662</b>, and the first non-penetrating connection hole <b>651</b> and the second non-penetrating connection hole <b>652</b> are formed with different opening sizes depending on the depths thereof. This allows the formation of the holes that have aspect ratios most suitable for the filling of the conductive material and prevent an increase in the layout space. This can prevent a void caused during the filling of the conductive material in the first penetrating connection hole <b>661</b> and the second penetrating connection hole <b>662</b>, which are deep.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">Furthermore, in this example of the present embodiment, the first non-penetrating connection hole <b>651</b> and the second non-penetrating connection hole <b>652</b> are connected to the first metal layer <b>45</b> <i>a</i>, which is the lowermost layer in the first wiring structure <b>31</b> on the first semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>. Hence, a space near the first non-penetrating connection hole <b>651</b> and the second non-penetrating connection hole <b>652</b>, or a space deeper than the first non-penetrating connection hole <b>651</b> and the second non-penetrating connection hole <b>652</b> can be used as an effective space that allows routing of a conductive line. This is advantageous for shrinkage of a chip.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">Note that, in this example of the present embodiment, the connecting member <b>69</b> is insulated from the first semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> by the insulating film <b>67</b> and the isolating section <b>42</b>. The insulation, however, may be provided by either one of the insulating film <b>67</b> and the isolating section <b>42</b>. When the isolating section <b>42</b> is not formed, the region for the isolating section <b>42</b> is eliminated, allowing a reduction in area of pixels and an increase in area of the photodiode (PD).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref>, caps <b>70</b>, which are each a SiN film or a SiCN film having a thickness of 10 to 150 nm, are then formed so as to cover the tops of the connecting member <b>69</b> and the light shield <b>63</b>. Subsequently, an opening is formed in the insulating layer <b>62</b>, which has a low refractive index and is located above the photodiode (PD). The high-refractive insulating layer <b>71</b>, having a refractive index higher than that of the insulating layer <b>62</b>, is formed in a desired region including the opening. The high-refractive insulating layer <b>71</b> may be, for example, formed of SiN or resin. This forms the optical waveguide LG with the high-refractive insulating layer <b>71</b> formed in the opening as the core and the low-refractive insulating layer <b>62</b> as the clad. The optical waveguide LG, thus formed, allows efficient collection of the light entering through the backside of the first semiconductor substrate into the photodiode (PD). Subsequently, the intermediate layer <b>72</b> is formed over an entire surface including the insulating layer <b>62</b> for planarization. In this example of the present embodiment, the caps <b>70</b> and the insulating layer <b>71</b> are formed separately in individual steps, but the insulating layer <b>71</b> may serve as the caps <b>70</b>. Also in this example of the present embodiment, the optical waveguide LG is formed on the side of the light entry surface of the photodiode (PD). The optical waveguide LG, however, may be excluded.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">Furthermore, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref>, the color filter <b>73</b>, having optical transparency to, for example, red (R), green (G), and blue (B), is formed on the intermediate layer <b>72</b> in accordance with each pixel. The color filter <b>73</b> can be formed by forming and patterning an organic film containing a pigment or a dye of a desired color. The color filter <b>73</b> can be formed above the photodiode (PD) constituting a desired pixel array. The color filter <b>73</b> may, in addition to a light transmitting section that filters light of primary colors selectively, include a light transmitting section that filters light of colors complementary to the primary colors or white light. Subsequently, the micro lens <b>74</b> is formed in the image sensing region that includes the top of the color filter <b>73</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">Subsequently, the insulating layer <b>62</b> and the like formed on the top of the first semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> are etched to expose the first semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>. The first semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> and the interlayer insulating film <b>46</b> are further etched successively to form the opening <b>77</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, so that the fourth metal layer <b>55</b> <i>d</i>, formed in the second wiring structure <b>32</b> on the top of the second semiconductor substrate <b>20</b>, is exposed. The fourth metal layer <b>55</b> <i>d</i>, thus exposed, constitutes the electrode pad <b>78</b> that is used to establish a connection with external wiring. Subsequently, the laminate <b>300</b>, which is formed by joining the two semiconductor wafers, is subjected to the dicing process with the first semiconductor wafer <b>111</b> and the second semiconductor wafer <b>222</b> of the laminate <b>300</b> together, so that the laminate <b>300</b> is divided into chips. A divided first semiconductor wafer <b>111</b> constitutes the first member <b>100</b> and a divided second semiconductor wafer <b>222</b> constitutes the second member <b>200</b>. In this way, the semiconductor device <b>1</b>, provided with the first member <b>100</b>, the second member <b>200</b>, and the connecting member <b>69</b>, is obtained. The semiconductor device <b>1</b>, formed as described above, is provided with a bonding wire connected to the electrode pad <b>78</b> in a similar manner as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Note that the first semiconductor wafer <b>111</b> and the second semiconductor wafer <b>222</b> may be diced separately. In this case, a first chip, obtained by dicing the first semiconductor wafer <b>111</b>, can be the first component, and a second chip, obtained by dicing the second semiconductor wafer <b>222</b>, can be the second component. In other words, it is also possible to bond the first chip and the second chip and then form the connecting member <b>69</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">An example of a second embodiment will be now described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a configuration as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> taken along the line P-Q of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is a diagram of plan views of part (including a connecting member <b>69</b>) of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> enclosed by a broken line at positions A, B, C, D, E, and F.

The first common penetrating conductive section <b>6831</b> and the second common penetrating conductive section <b>6832</b> are each connected to a first wiring section <b>310</b> and a second wiring section <b>320</b>. The first common penetrating conductive section <b>6831</b> corresponds to a combination of the first non-penetrating conductive section <b>6811</b> and the first penetrating conductive section <b>6821</b>, provided separately in the first embodiment, and serves as the first non-penetrating conductive section <b>6811</b> and the first penetrating conductive section <b>6821</b>. Similarly, the second common penetrating conductive section <b>6832</b> corresponds to a combination of the second non-penetrating conductive section <b>6812</b> and the second penetrating conductive section <b>6822</b>, provided separately in the first embodiment. In this way, by providing a plurality of conductive sections (common penetrating conductive sections) that is connected to both the first wiring section <b>310</b> and the second wiring section <b>320</b>, the redundancy of the connecting member <b>69</b> is increased, thereby improving the reliability of the electrical continuity.

In addition to a common penetrating conductive section, a non-penetrating conductive section connected solely to the first wiring section <b>310</b> and a penetrating conductive section connected solely to the second wiring section <b>320</b> may also be provided.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">In the present embodiment, part of a first semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> is removed in advance, so that conductive sections of the connecting member <b>69</b> do not penetrate the first semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>.

Two penetrating conductive sections, namely a first penetrating conductive section <b>6821</b> and a second penetrating conductive section <b>6822</b>, are provided to penetrate a first semiconductor wafer. This improves the reliability of the connecting member <b>69</b>. A non-penetrating conductive section <b>681</b> for a first wiring section <b>310</b> can be short in length because the first semiconductor substrate <b>10</b> does not have to be penetrated. One non-penetrating conductive section <b>681</b>, therefore, may be provided as described in this example. Alternatively, a plurality of conductive sections in contact with the first wiring section <b>310</b> may be provided. Furthermore, the number of penetrating conductive sections in contact with a second wiring section <b>320</b> may be larger than the number of conductive sections in contact with the first wiring section <b>310</b> when the plurality of conductive sections in contact with the first wiring section <b>310</b> is provided.

Different diameters provided for the penetrating conductive sections can ensure the reliability of the connection in accordance with the size of a possible foreign substance. This is because the probability of the existence of a foreign substance increases in proportion to the diameter of a conductive section.
