<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a curable composition for photoimprint and a method of producing a film, an optical component, a circuit board, or an electronic component using the composition.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">With the increase in requirement for miniaturization of semiconductor devices, micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMSs), and other devices, fine processing technology (also called photo-nanoimprint technology), in which a resist (curable composition for photoimprint) is molded with a mold on a substrate (wafer) to form a resist pattern on the substrate, has been attracting attentions, in addition to known photolithography technology.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">In the photo-nanoimprint technology described in PTL 1, a resist is applied to a pattern-forming region on a substrate (arrangement step). Subsequently, the resist is molded using a mold provided with a pattern (mold contact step). The resist is cured by irradiation with light (light irradiation step) and is then detached (mold-releasing step) to form a resin pattern (photocured product) on the substrate. The whole process described above is repeated at another position on the substrate to form a fine structure on the entire substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">In some cases of producing, for example, a semiconductor device or MEMS, a substrate that has been already machined is further micromachined by photo-nanoimprint technology. In such a case, it is necessary to exactly adjust the position of the mold with respect to the pattern already formed on the substrate. This step is called alignment step and is performed between the mold contact step and the light irradiation step. Furthermore, in many cases of the photo-nanoimprint technology, a series of steps (shot) from the arrangement step to the mold-releasing step is performed plural times on one substrate.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0006">Technical Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">In the light irradiation step, for example, the substrate absorbs the irradiated light and generates heat (exposure heat). The thermal distortion in the substrate caused by the exposure heat reaches also the area adjoining the region irradiated with light, leading to a problem of a low alignment precision of the shot in an adjacent region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">A reduction in the light exposure amount of irradiation, in order to improve the alignment precision by decreasing the exposure heat, causes insufficient curing of the curable composition for photoimprint, leading to a problem of occurrence of a defect, pattern collapse, in the mold-releasing step.</div>

The substrate <b>102</b> (substrate to be machined) may be provided with surface treatment such as silane coupling treatment, silazane treatment, or formation of an organic thin film, for improving the adhesion with the curable composition for photoimprint.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">The mold <b>104</b> needs to be made of a light-permeable material considering the subsequent step (light irradiation step). The material constituting the mold <b>104</b> can be, for example, glass, quartz, PMMA, a light-permeable resin such as a polycarbonate resin, a transparent metal vapor-deposited film, a flexible film made of, e.g., polydimethylsiloxane, a photocured film, or a metal film. When the mold <b>104</b> is made of a light-permeable resin, the resin is required not to be dissolved in the solvent contained in the curable composition for photoimprint <b>101</b>. Quartz has a small thermal expansion coefficient and low pattern distortion and can be therefore particularly used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">The mold <b>104</b> may be subjected to surface treatment for improving the detachability between the curable composition for photoimprint <b>101</b> and the surface of the mold <b>104</b>, prior to this mold contact step of bringing the curable composition for photoimprint into contact with the mold. The surface treatment is performed by, for example, applying a mold release agent to the surface of a mold to form a mold release agent layer. Examples of the mold release agent to be applied to the surface of a mold include silicon-based mold release agents, fluorine-based mold release agents, polyethylene-based mold release agents, polypropylene-based mold release agents, paraffin-based mold release agents, montan-based mold release agents, and carnauba-based mold release agents. Commercially available application-type mold release agents such as Optool DSX manufactured by Daikin Industries, Ltd. can also be used.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">This step can be performed under the atmosphere, a reduced-pressure atmosphere, or an inert gas atmosphere and can be particularly performed under a reduced-pressure atmosphere or an inert gas atmosphere for preventing influence of oxygen and moisture on the photocuring reaction. Examples of the inert gas that can be used in the case of performing this step under an inert gas atmosphere include nitrogen, carbon dioxide, helium, argon, and various chlorofluorocarbon gases, and also gas mixtures thereof. When this step is performed under a specific gaseous atmosphere, including the atmosphere, the pressure can be 0.0001 atmospheres or more and 10 atmospheres or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">The mold contact step may be performed under an atmosphere containing a condensable gas (hereinafter, referred to as condensable gas atmosphere).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">When the mold contact step is performed under a condensable gas atmosphere, the gas filled in the concavities of the fine pattern is liquefied to eliminate the gas bubbles, resulting in an excellent filling property. The condensable gas may be dissolved in the curable composition for photoimprint.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">The condensable gas may have any boiling point that is not higher than the ambient temperature in the mold contact step. The boiling point is preferably −10° C. to 23° C. and more preferably 10° C. to 23° C. A boiling point within this range can provide a further excellent filling property.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">The condensable gas at the ambient temperature in the mold contact step can have any vapor pressure that is not higher than the mold pressure in the pressing in the mold contact step, and the vapor pressure can be 0.1 to 0.4 MPa. A vapor pressure within this range can provide a further excellent filling property. In a vapor pressure at an ambient temperature of higher than 0.4 MPa, the effect by elimination of the gas bubbles is apt to be insufficient. In contrast, in a vapor pressure at an ambient temperature of lower than 0.1 MPa, a reduction in pressure is necessary, resulting in a tendency of complicating the apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">The ambient temperature in the mold contact step is not particularly limited and can be 20° C. to 25° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">Examples of the condensable gas include fluorocarbons, e.g., chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) such as trichlorofluoromethane; hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) such as fluorocarbon (FC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), and 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane (CHF<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CF<sub>3</sub>, HFC-245fa, PFP); and hydrofluoroethers (HFEs) such as pentafluoroethylmethylether (CF<sub>3</sub>CF<sub>2</sub>OCH<sub>3</sub>, HFE-245mc).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">Among these fluorocarbons, from the viewpoint of an excellent filling property at an ambient temperature of 20° C. to 25° C. in the mold contact step, 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane (vapor pressure at 23° C.: 0.14 MPa, boiling point: 15° C.), trichlorofluoromethane (vapor pressure at 23° C.: 0.1056 MPa, boiling point: 24° C.), and pentafluoroethylmethylether can be particularly used.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">The condensable gas may be used alone or in combination of two or more thereof. Furthermore, these condensable gases may be used as gas mixtures with non-condensable gases such as air, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, helium, and argon. The non-condensable gas mixed with a condensable gas can be helium from the viewpoint of the filling property. Helium can permeate through the mold simultaneous with the liquefaction of the condensable gas when the gases (condensable gas and helium) in the atmosphere are, together with (a part of) the coating film <b>106</b>, filled in the concavities of the fine pattern formed on the mold <b>104</b> in the mold contact step.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139">Many of commercially available curing aids (photopolymerization initiators) show sensitivity to ultraviolet light, and therefore ultraviolet light can be particularly used as the light (irradiation light <b>107</b>) to be irradiated to the curable composition for photoimprint <b>101</b>.

In particular, the ultra-high pressure mercury lamps can be used. The light sources may be used alone or in combination. The coating film <b>106</b> filled in the fine pattern of the mold may be entirely irradiated with light or may be partially irradiated with light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0140">The light irradiation onto the substrate may be dividedly performed in plural times. For example, a partial region A can be irradiated with light in a first irradiation step, and a region B other than the region A can be irradiated with light in a second irradiation step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0141">On this occasion, the curable composition for photoimprint of the embodiment described above can be cured with a small amount of light.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0144" num="0143">Accordingly, the curable composition for photoimprint can be cured with a low light exposure amount (10 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>or more and 75 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>or less, more preferably 10 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>or more and 30 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>or less) such that the thermal stain in the substrate due to expansion of the substrate by heat (exposure heat) generated by light absorbed by the substrate hardly reaches the region adjoining the region A where the light is irradiated. Accordingly, a defect of destroying the pattern hardly occurs in the subsequent mold-releasing step, and the alignment precision in the step [3] is hardly decreased when the steps of [1] to [5] are conducted at the adjacent portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0144">The thermal expansion amount of the substrate by exposure can be calculated as follows.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0324" num="0325">It was supposed from the resulting reduced moduli that nanoimprint patterns of the curable composition for photoimprint (a-12) formed as in Example 1 can be satisfactory without causing a defect such as the pattern collapse.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0325" num="0326">It is believed that the curable composition for photoimprint (a-12) can form a satisfactory pattern at a light exposure amount of 30 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>. It can therefore be expected that the thermal distortion remaining in the subsequent shot is 1 nm or less and that a high alignment precision can be achieved.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0328" num="0329">As in Example 1, a cured film (b-4-200) was produced on a silicon wafer by exposing a film having a thickness of 3.2 μm of the curable composition for photoimprint (b-4) to light of 200 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>. A film having a thickness of 3.2 μm of the curable composition for photoimprint (b-4) exposed to light of 10 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>was formed into an insufficiently cured film (b-4-10).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0329" num="0330">The Young's moduli of the resulting cured films were not measured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0115" num="0000">(3-2) Measurement of Reduced Modulus of Cured Film</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0330" num="0331">As in Example 1, the reduced modulus of the resulting cured film (b-4-200) was measured. The reduced modulus Er<sub>200 </sub>of the cured film (b-4-200) was 2.73 GPa. The reduced modulus Er<sub>10 </sub>of the insufficiently cured film (b-4-10) was approximately zero, and the value of Er<sub>10</sub>/Er<sub>200 </sub>was judged to be approximately zero.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0116" num="0000">(4) Observation of Nanoimprint Patterns</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0331" num="0332">It was supposed from the resulting reduced moduli that a defect such as the pattern collapse occurs in many nanoimprint patterns of the curable composition for photoimprint (b-4) formed as in Example 1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0332" num="0333">It was believed that the minimum light exposure amount of the curable composition for photoimprint (b-4) necessary for forming satisfactory patterns not having a defect such as the pattern collapse is large. It was therefore supposed that such a light exposure amount remains a thermal distortion of 2.9 nm or more in the subsequent shot and that the alignment precision is lower than those in Examples 1 to 12.</div>
