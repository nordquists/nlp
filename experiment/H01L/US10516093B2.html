<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/280,678, filed on Sep. 29, 2016, which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/423,687, filed on Feb. 24, 2015, now U.S. Pat.

<heading id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a piezoelectric material, in particular, a lead-free piezoelectric material. The present invention also relates to a piezoelectric element and an electronic apparatus including the piezoelectric material.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Lead zirconate titanate, which is a typical piezoelectric material containing lead, is used in a variety of piezoelectric devices such as actuators, oscillators, sensors, and filters. However, it has been pointed out that lead components in discarded piezoelectric devices will be dissolved into the soil if the piezoelectric devices are exposed to acid rain and will cause ecological damages. Accordingly, researches and developments of lead-free piezoelectric materials have been actively conducted for providing lead-free piezoelectric devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Typical lead-free piezoelectric materials that are currently widely being studied are piezoelectric materials including potassium niobate. However, since the raw material (e.g., potassium carbonate) powder used in synthesis of piezoelectric materials containing potassium has high moisture absorbing properties, it is difficult to exactly weigh a raw material powder at an intended molar ratio. In addition, piezoelectric materials containing potassium niobate (KNbO<sub>3</sub>) have deliquescency, and the piezoelectricity of some piezoelectric ceramics containing potassium niobate deteriorates with time. Furthermore, in some piezoelectric materials containing potassium niobate, the successive phase transition temperature between tetragonal and orthorhombic crystals is within the operating temperature range (e.g., from 0° C. to 80° C.) of the piezoelectric device. The piezoelectricity significantly varies in a temperature range around the successive phase transition temperature, which causes a problem that the performance of piezoelectric device significantly varies depending on the operating temperature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">NPL 1 also reports on a piezoelectric material not containing lead and potassium, i.e., a solid solution of sodium niobate (NaNbO<sub>3</sub>) and barium titanate (BaTiO<sub>3</sub>) (hereinafter, referred to as NN-BT), which is an antiferroelectric material. It is disclosed that the piezoelectric ceramic containing sodium niobate and barium titanate at a ratio of 9:1 had a piezoelectric constant d<sub>33 </sub>of 147 pC/N.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">PTL 1 discloses a niobate-based piezoelectric ceramic having a high electromechanical coupling factor and high heat resistance by adding cobalt oxide (CoO) to NN-BT. However, the insulation is low, i.e., 10<sup>6</sup>Ω or less, and, therefore, polarization of some samples are difficult.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">PTL 2 provides a method of producing a niobate-based piezoelectric ceramic having a high Curie temperature and satisfactory piezoelectric properties. It is disclosed that the piezoelectric ceramic of a solid solution of NN-BT and strontium titanate (SrTiO<sub>3</sub>) had a piezoelectric constant d<sub>33 </sub>of 14 to 126 pm/V.</div>

<heading id="h-0012">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">Embodiments of the present invention will now be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">The present invention provides a lead-free piezoelectric material having a basic configuration of NN-BT and showing satisfactory piezoelectricity and insulation. The piezoelectric material of the present invention can be used in a variety of purposes, such as capacitors, memories, and sensors, using the characteristics as a dielectric.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">The piezoelectric material of the present invention is composed of a main component containing a perovskite-type metal oxide represented by Formula (1) and an additive component containing at least one element selected from Mn and Ni. The content of the Mn is 0 mol or more and 0.005 mol or less based on 1 mol of the perovskite-type metal oxide, and the content of the Ni is 0 mol or more and 0.05 mol or less based on 1 mol of the perovskite-type metal oxide.
<br/>
(Na<sub>x</sub>Ba<sub>1-y</sub>)(Nb<sub>y</sub>Ti<sub>1-y</sub>)O<sub>3 </sub>(wherein, 0.80≤x≤0.94, and 0.83≤y≤0.94).   Formula (1):
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">The perovskite-type metal oxide of the present invention refers to a metal oxide having a perovskite-type structure (also referred to as perovskite structure), which is ideally a tetragonal structure, as described in Iwanami Dictionary of Physics and Chemistry, 5th Edition (Iwanami Shoten, Published on Feb. 20, 1998). The metal oxide having a perovskite-type structure is generally expressed by a chemical formula: ABO<sub>3</sub>. In the perovskite-type metal oxide, elements A and B occupy specific unit cell positions called A-site and B-site, respectively, in the ion forms. For example, in a cubic unit cell, the element A is placed at the vertexes of the cubic, and the element B is placed at the body-centered position of the cubic. The element O occupies the face-centered positions as anions of oxygen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">The perovskite-type metal oxide represented by Formula (1) contains at least one element selected from Mn and Ni and may further contain Cu. In such a case, the piezoelectric material of the present invention can also be represented by Formula (2):
<br/>
(Na<sub>x</sub>Ba<sub>1-y</sub>)(Nb<sub>y</sub>Ti<sub>1-y</sub>)O<sub>3</sub>—(NiO)<sub>z</sub>—(CuO)<sub>v</sub>—(MnO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>w</sub>,   Formula (2):
<br/>
wherein, the value of each parameter is as follows: 0.80≤x≤0.94, 0.83≤y≤0.94, 0≤z≤0.05, 0≤v≤0.01, 0≤w≤0.005, and 0&lt;z+w.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">The metal oxide represented by Formula (2), the metal elements positioned at the A-site are Na and Ba, and the metal elements positioned at the B-site are Nb and Ti. However, the Na, Ba, Ni, Cu, and Mn atoms may be partially positioned at the B-site. Similarly, the Ti, Nb, Ni, Cu, and Mn atoms may be partially positioned at the A-site. In addition, in order to readily produce the piezoelectric material of the present invention or to adjust the physical properties of the piezoelectric material of the present invention, the Ba may be partially replaced with a divalent metal element, such as Sr or Ca. Similarly, the Nb may be partially replaced with a pentavalent metal element, such as Ta or V, in a range of 20 mol % or less. Similarly, the Ti may be partially replaced with Zr or Sn in a range of 20 mol % or less; and the Na may be partially replaced with Li in a range of 15 mol % or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">Furthermore, the characteristics of the piezoelectric material of the present invention are not deteriorated even if other elements are also substituted, as long as the substitution amounts are each 0.1 mol % or less based on the content of Ba or Nb contained in piezoelectric material represented by Formula (2).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">The molar ratio of the elements at the B-site to the element O in Formula (2) is basically 1:3, but the molar ratio may shift slightly (e.g., in a range of 1.00:2.94 to 1.00:3.06) as long as the perovskite-type structure is the primary phase of the metal oxide. Such a case is included in the scope of the present invention. The perovskite-type structure of the metal oxide can be confirmed by structural analysis, such as X-ray diffraction or electron beam diffraction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">The piezoelectric material according to the present invention may be in any form, such as a ceramic, powder, single crystal, film, or slurry, and, in particular, can be in a ceramic form. Throughout the specification, the term “ceramic” refers to aggregate (also referred to as bulk body) of crystal grains of a metal oxide as the base component and fired by heat treatment, a so-called polycrystal. The ceramic includes those processed after sintering.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">In Formula (2), if the value of x is smaller than 0.80, the amount of Na relative to Nb is low to cause occurrence of an impurity phase (a phase having an X-ray diffraction pattern similar to that of Ba<sub>4</sub>Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>9</sub>, Ba<sub>6</sub>Ti<sub>7</sub>Nb<sub>9</sub>O<sub>42</sub>, Ba<sub>3</sub>Nb<sub>4</sub>Ti<sub>4</sub>O<sub>21</sub>, Ba<sub>3</sub>Nb<sub>3.2</sub>Ti<sub>5</sub>O<sub>21</sub>, or the like). A metal oxide sample containing a large amount of impurity phase has a low resistivity of 10<sup>7 </sup>to 10<sup>8 </sup>Ω·cm and makes the polarization treatment difficult.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">A value of x larger than 0.94 decreases the piezoelectricity. In a range of x of 0.80≤x≤0.94, occurrence of impurity phase can be inhibited, and a satisfactory piezoelectricity is achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">In Formula (2), when the value of y, which indicates the amount of Nb at the B-site, is smaller than 0.83, the Curie temperature is low and may decrease to be lower than 110° C. A value of y larger than 0.94 decreases the piezoelectricity. In a range of y of 0.83≤y≤0.94, a high Curie temperature and satisfactory piezoelectricity are achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">When the value of y is in a range of 0.83≤y≤0.94, the Curie temperature is roughly in a range of 110° C. to 310° C., and the polarization treatment can be readily performed. Furthermore, when the value of y is in a range of 0.88≤y≤0.90, the Curie temperature is roughly in a range of 190° C. to 230° C., and a reduction in piezoelectric performance due to heat in the device-producing process is prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">The term “Curie temperature” indicates the temperature at which the piezoelectricity of a piezoelectric material is lost. Throughout the specification, the temperature showing a maximum dielectric constant near the phase transition temperature between the ferroelectric phase and the paraelectric phase is the Curie temperature. The perovskite-type metal oxide of the present invention has a successive phase transition temperature, which is the temperature causing successive phase transition from a tetragonal ferroelectric phase to an orthorhombic ferroelectric phase, in a temperature range lower than the Curie temperature. Since the relative dielectric constant becomes the maximum or shows a point of reverse curve at the successive phase transition temperature, the successive phase transition temperature can be determined by evaluating the temperature dependability of the relative dielectric constant, as in Curie temperature. For example, a solid solution represented by 0.9 (NaNbO<sub>3</sub>)−0.1 (BaTiO<sub>3</sub>) causes phase transition from orthorhombic crystals to tetragonal crystals and then to cubic crystals with an increase in temperature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">The maximum piezoelectric performance is obtained at near the successive phase transition temperature. Accordingly, if it is required that the constant piezoelectric performance be not affected by temperature in the operating temperature range (e.g., −30° C. to 60° C.) of a device, the successive phase transition should be out of the operating temperature range. If it is important that the piezoelectric performance is high at a certain temperature than that the piezoelectric performance does not depend on temperature, the successive phase transition can be within the operating temperature range of the device. A material that can adjust the successive phase transition temperature in accordance with the specification of a device has high versatility.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">The piezoelectric material of the present invention is characterized in that in addition to the perovskite-type metal oxide represented by Formula (1), at least one element selected from Mn and Ni is contained in the material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">In Formula (2), the value of w, which indicates the content of Mn, is in a range of 0≤w≤0.005; the value of z, which indicates the content of Ni, is in a range of 0≤z≤0.05; and w and z satisfy a requirement of 0&lt;w+z. In Formula (2), the addition forms of Mn and Ni are respectively MnO<sub>2 </sub>and NiO, for convenience, but the Mn and Ni in the piezoelectric material of the present invention may be in any state. The piezoelectric material of the present invention containing 0.5 mol % or less of Mn (w≤0.005) can have high resistivity, piezoelectric constant, electromechanical coupling factor, electromechanical quality factor, Youngs's modulus, and density. The piezoelectric material of the present invention containing 5 mol % or less of Ni can have high resistivity, piezoelectric constant, electromechanical coupling factor, electromechanical quality factor, Youngs's modulus, and density. In addition, the piezoelectric material of the present invention containing 5 mol % or less of Ni (z≤0.05) can have a low sintering temperature. The sintering temperature is the lowest firing temperature necessary for obtaining a sintered compact having a relative density of 95% or more. When the spontaneous polarization of the piezoelectric material of the present invention is pinned, Mn and Ni can reduce the pinning of the spontaneous polarization. A reduction in pinning causes an increase in remnant polarization value or a decrease in coercive field in the polarization-electric field hysteresis curve. Furthermore, the direction of the spontaneous polarization can be readily aligned by polarization treatment, the phase of the impedance in resonance varies more largely, or the electromechanical coupling factor is increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">The at least one element selected from Mn and Ni may be present at the A-site (12-fold coordination) of the perovskite structure, at the B-site (6-fold coordination), or at the both and may be present at grain boundaries of a ceramic.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">In sintering of crystals containing sodium niobate as a component, Na may evaporate or diffuse to cause a shortage of Na relative to Nb in the sample composition after sintering. That is, a deficiency occurs in the A-site. However, a raw material powder containing an excess amount of a Na raw material may cause a reduction in insulation of the sintered compact. The deficiency can be compensated by adding Ni to the piezoelectric material such that a part of Ni occupies the A-site. Alternatively, raw materials may be weighed to intentionally cause a shortage of Na relative to Nb within a range not exceeding 5%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">The piezoelectric material of the present invention can contain 0.01 mol or less (excluding 0 mol) of Cu based on 1 mol of perovskite-type metal oxide represented by Formula (1). Herein, in Formula (2), the addition form of Cu is CuO for convenience, but the Cu in the piezoelectric material of the present invention may be in any state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">The piezoelectric material of the present invention containing 1 mol % or less of Cu can have high resistivity, electromechanical coupling factor, electromechanical quality factor, Youngs's modulus, and density and can have a low firing temperature.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">Cu may be present at the A-site (12-fold coordination) of the perovskite structure, at the B-site (6-fold coordination), or at the both and may be present at grain boundaries of a ceramic.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">A reduction in crystal deficiency by occupation of the A-site by at least one element selected from Mn and Ni can provide at least one of the following effects:

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0063">Occupation of the B-site by the at least one element selected from Mn and Ni forms oxygen defects and defect dipoles to form an internal electric field.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0070">The magnitude of the internal electric field is a half of the difference in magnitude between the positive and negative coercive fields obtained from the polarization-electric field hysteresis curve.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0071">All of the Mn and Ni components are not necessarily present at the A-site or B-site, and a part of the Mn and Ni components may be present at grain boundaries. The Mn and the Ni can be present at grain boundaries in the oxide form. The disproportionate presence of a part of the Mn and Ni components at grain boundaries inhibits pores. As a result, effects, such as an increase in electromechanical quality factor and an increase in Youngs's modulus, are obtained. In addition, the presence of Mn and Ni at grain boundaries reduces the grain-boundary friction to harden the material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0072">The distribution of Mn and Ni in a sample and the occupation sites in crystals can be evaluated by electron microscopic observation, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman scattering, or transmission electron microscopic observation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0073">When a part of Mn and Ni is present at both the A-site and the B-site, the above-mentioned effects are additively provided. Since the effects additively provided can be controlled by the amounts of Mn and Ni, Mn and Ni may be present at both the A-site and the B-site.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0074">When Ni is present only at the A-site, since a Ni ion is smaller than a Na ion and a Ba ion, the unit cell volume decreases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0075">The volume of a unit cell can be evaluated by X-ray diffraction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0076">An amount of Ni higher than 0.05 mol based on 1 mol of the perovskite-type metal oxide (z&gt;0.05) may cause occurrence of an impurity phase to reduce the piezoelectricity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0077">The piezoelectric material of the present invention can satisfy a requirement of x&lt;y in Formula (1). When x is smaller than y, Ni is taken in the crystal lattice to readily exhibit the effects of the present invention. The composition of starting materials may be adjusted such that x is smaller than y. If x is not smaller than y, the insulation of a sample decreases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0078">In order to obtain a piezoelectric ceramic from the piezoelectric material of the present invention, a green compact before firing is formed. The green compact is a solid of a molded raw material powder. The raw material powder should have high purity. Since contamination with Mg considerably affects the piezoelectric performance of a sample, a raw material containing less Mg should be used. Examples of the molding include uniaxial pressing, cold hydrostatic pressing, hot hydrostatic pressing, casting, and extrusion. The green compact can be produced from a granulated powder. Sintering of the green compact formed from a granulated powder has an advantage that the size distribution of the crystal grains of the sintered compact can be readily uniformized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0079">The raw material powder of the piezoelectric material may be granulated by any method. Spray drying is advantageous from the viewpoint of providing a granulated powder with a more uniform grain diameter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0080">Examples of the binder that can be used in granulation include polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinyl butylal (PVB), and acrylic resins. The binder is used in an amount of 1 to 10 parts by weight based on the amount of the raw material powder of the piezoelectric material, in particular, 2 to 5 parts by weight from the viewpoint of increasing the density of a green compact.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0081">The green compact may be sintered by any method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0082">Examples of the sintering include sintering in an electric furnace, sintering in a gas furnace, electrical heating, microwave sintering, millimeter-wave sintering, and hot isostatic pressing (HIP). The electric furnace and the gas furnace may be continuous furnaces or batch furnaces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0083">The sintering may be performed at any temperature and can be performed at a temperature allowing a reaction of each compound and sufficient growth of crystals. From the viewpoint of giving grains of the piezoelectric material having a grain diameter in the range of 0.3 to 100 μm, the sintering temperature can be 1050° C. or more and 1300° C. or less, such as 1100° C. or more and 1200° C. or less. The piezoelectric material sintered in such a temperature range shows satisfactory piezoelectric performance. In order to stably reproduce the properties of a piezoelectric material prepared by sintering treatment, the sintering is performed at a constant temperature within the above-mentioned range for 2 to 48 hours. Though sintering such as two-stage sintering may be employed, a rapid decrease in temperature should be avoided in light of productivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0084">The sintered piezoelectric material may be heat-treated at a temperature not lower than the Curie temperature after polishing processing. Mechanical polishing generates a residual stress inside the piezoelectric material, but the heat treatment at a temperature not lower than the Curie temperature relieves the residual stress to further enhance the piezoelectric properties of the piezoelectric material. The heat treatment may be performed for any period of time, such as 1 hour or more.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0085">If the crystal grains in the piezoelectric material of the present invention have a grain diameter exceeding 100 μm, strength sufficient for cutting and polishing processes may not be obtained. If the grain diameter is smaller than 0.3 μm, the piezoelectricity decreases. Accordingly, the grains can have an average grain diameter of 0.3 μm or more and 100 μm or less, in particular, 0.5 μm or more and 70 μm or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0086">When the piezoelectric material of the present invention is used as a film formed on a substrate, the piezoelectric material can have a thickness of 200 nm or more and 10 μm or less, in particular, 300 nm or more and 3 μm or less. The piezoelectric material film having a thickness of 200 nm or more and 10 μm or less can provide an electromechanical conversion function sufficient as a piezoelectric element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0087">The films may be stacked by any method. Examples of the method include a chemical solution deposition method (CSD method), a sol-gel method, an metalorganic chemical vapor deposition method (MOCVD method), sputtering, a pulsed laser deposition method (PLD method), hydrothermal synthesis, and an aerosol deposition method (AD method). Among them, chemical solution deposition or sputtering can readily increase the area of the film to be formed. The substrate used for the piezoelectric material of the present invention can be a single-crystal substrate cut and polished in the (001) plane or (110) plane. The piezoelectric material film formed on the single-crystal substrate cut and polished in a specific crystal plane can also be highly oriented in the same direction.</div>

The metal compound may contain copper. Throughout the specification, the term “powder” is intended to mean an assembly of solid grains and may be an assembly of grains containing Ba, Na, Ti, Nb, Ni, Cu, and Mn or may be an assembly of different types of grains containing arbitrary elements.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0114">An exemplary method of producing a slurry in the step (A) will be described. The metal compound powder is mixed with a solvent in an amount of 1.6 to 1.7 times the weight of the powder. The solvent can be, for example, toluene, ethanol, a solvent mixture of toluene and ethanol, n-butyl acetate, or water. The mixture is mixed with a ball mill for 24 hours, followed by addition of a binder and a plasticizer thereto. Examples of the binder include polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinyl butylal (PVB), and acrylic resins. In a case of using PVB as the binder, the PVB is weighed such that the weight ratio of the solvent to the PVB is, for example, 88:12. Examples of the plasticizer include dioctyl sebacate, dioctyl phthalate, and dibutyl phthalate. In a case of using dibutyl phthalate as the plasticizer, the plasticized is weighed in an amount that is the same as that of the binder. The mixture is mixed again with a ball mill overnight, and the amounts of the solvent and the binder are controlled such that the slurry has a viscosity of 300 to 500 mPa·s.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0115">The green compact in the step (B) is a mixture of the metal compound powder, the binder, and the plasticizer in a sheet form. The green compact in the step (B) can be prepared by, for example, sheet molding. The sheet molding can be performed by, for example, a doctor blade method. The doctor blade method is a method for forming a sheet form compact by applying a slurry onto a base material with a doctor blade and drying the slurry. As the base material, for example, a PET film can be used. The compact can be readily detached from the PET film by coating the PET film with fluorine at the surface to which the slurry is applied. The drying may be natural drying or hot air drying. The compact may have any thickness and can be controlled depending on the thickness of the multilayered piezoelectric element. The thickness of the compact can be increased by, for example, increasing the viscosity of the slurry.</div>

In order to reduce the driving voltage, the thickness and the pitch distance of the piezoelectric material layers <b>504</b> may be reduced. In such a case, a layered product including the precursor of the piezoelectric material layers <b>504</b> and the internal electrodes <b>505</b> is formed, and then the layered product is fired for simultaneously firing the piezoelectric material layers and the internal electrodes. Furthermore, the material for the internal electrodes is required not to cause a change in shape and a decrease in conductivity at the temperature necessary for sintering the piezoelectric material layers <b>504</b>. A metal such as Ag, Pd, Au, Cu, or Ni, which has a lower melting point and is less expensive compared to Pt, or an alloy thereof can be used for the internal electrodes <b>505</b> <i>a, </i> <b>505</b> <i>b </i>and external electrodes <b>506</b> <i>a, </i> <b>506</b> <i>b. </i>The external electrodes <b>506</b> <i>a, </i> <b>506</b> <i>b </i>may be provided after firing of the layered product.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0117">The electrodes can be formed by screen printing. In the screen printing, a screen printing plate is placed on a compact disposed on a base material, and a metal paste is applied onto the compact through the screen printing plate with a spatula. The screen printing plate is at least partially provided with a screen mesh, and the metal paste is applied onto the compact through the screen mesh portion. A pattern can be formed in the screen mesh of the screen printing plate and can be transferred to the compact with the metal paste to pattern an electrode on the compact.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0118">After formation of the electrodes in the step (C), one or a plurality of stacked compacts detached from the base material is pressure bonded to each electrode. Examples of the pressure bonding include uniaxial pressing, cold hydrostatic pressing, and hot hydrostatic pressing. The hot hydrostatic pressing can apply an isotropically uniform pressure. Good bonding can be achieved by increasing the temperature to around the glass transition temperature of the binder during the press bonding. A desired thickness can be obtained by stacking a plurality of green compacts and press bonding them. For example, the green compacts can be laminated through thermocompression bonding by stacking 10 to 100 green compacts and applying a pressure of 10 to 60 MPa in the laminating direction at 50° C. to 80° C. for 10 seconds to 10 minutes. A plurality of green compacts can be precisely laminated by placing alignment marks to the electrodes and adjusting alignment of the green compacts with the marks. The green compacts can also be precisely laminated by providing through-holes for positioning to the compacts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0119">In the step (D), a sintering temperature of 1200° C. or less allows the use of a metal such as Ag, Pd, Au, Cu, or Ni, which has a lower melting point and is less expensive compared to Pt, or an alloy thereof.

A piezoelectric material to which a voltage applied expands and contracts by the transverse piezoelectric effect.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0171">Raw materials were weighed such that x, y, z, v, and w in Formula (2): (Na<sub>x</sub>Ba<sub>1-y</sub>)(Nb<sub>y</sub>Ti<sub>1-y</sub>)O<sub>3</sub>—(NiO)<sub>z</sub>—(CuO)<sub>v</sub>—(MnO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>w </sub>were those shown in Table 1. The raw material powders were mixed with a ball mill for 12 hours.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0172">The raw materials used in Comparative Examples 1 to 4 and Examples 1 to 17 were powders of sodium niobate (NaNbO<sub>3</sub>) having a purity of 99% or more, barium titanate (BaTiO<sub>3</sub>) having a purity of 99% or more, nickel(II) oxide (NiO(II)) having a purity of 99.9%, copper(II) oxide (CuO(II)) having a purity of 99.9%, and manganese(IV) oxide (MnO<sub>2</sub>(IV)) having a purity of 99.9%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0173">The powder mixture was calcined in the atmosphere at 900° C. to 1100° C. over 2 to 5 hours. The calcined powder was pulverized, and a PVB binder was added thereto in an amount of 3% by weight relative to the weight of the calcined powder, followed by granulation. The granulated powder was placed in a die and was compressed at a pressure of 200 MPa to give a compact having a diameter of 17 mm and a thickness of about 1 mm. The resulting compact was fired in the air at 1150° C. to 1250° C. for 2 to 6 hours to give a sintered compact. The calcination process may be omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0174">The density of each sintered compact was measured by an Archimedes's method, and relative density was calculated. The relative density was 94% or more in all sintered compacts. The density of each sample of the present invention containing at least one element selected from Mn and Ni was higher than that of each sample having the same composition except that the sample did not contain both Mn and Ni. In samples containing Ni, the temperature necessary for calcination and firing could be decreased by 50° C. to 100° C. compared to those of samples not containing Ni.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0175">The sintered compact was ground so as to have a thickness of about 0.5 mm. The ground sintered compact or a powder prepared by pulverizing the ground sintered compact was evaluated for the constituent phase and the lattice constant by X-ray diffraction, which confirmed that each sample was approximately a single phase of a perovskite structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0176">The compositions of the sintered compacts were evaluated by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrophotometry (ICP). In all samples excluding Comparative Example 3 and Example 16, the ratio (Na/Nb) of the number of moles of Na to the number of moles of Nb was in a range of 96% to 99%, which means a loss of Na. The grain diameters in the sintered compacts were evaluated by optical microscopic or electron microscopic observation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0177">The grain diameters of sintered compacts were observed with an electron microscope. The average grain diameters were in a range of 2 to 70 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0167" num="0178">The distributions of Cu in the sintered compacts were investigated by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. At least in Example 4, Ni was present grain boundaries between grains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0179">Incidentally, a titanium adhesive layer having a thickness of 30 nm was formed between an electrode and a ceramic. The resulting ceramic layer provided with the electrode was cut into a strip-like piezoelectric element of 10×2.5×0.5 mm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0169" num="0180">The resistivity was evaluated with a semiconductor parameter analyzer. A DC voltage of several tens to a hundred volts was applied to each sample, and the resistance at 30 seconds after the start of application of the voltage was measured. The resistivity was calculated from the resulting resistance and the sample size.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0170" num="0181">The polarization-electric field hysteresis measurement was performed for judging the presence or absence of ferroelectricity in a practical electric field for a target element at room temperature. A material showing ferroelectricity in a certain temperature range is regarded to have piezoelectricity in the same temperature range and can also be used as a memory material. Specifically, the amount of polarization when an AC electric field (triangle waves) was applied to the piezoelectric element of the present invention was measured. The frequency of the AC electric field was 10 to 100 Hz. The magnitude of the electric field was up to about ±50 kV/cm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0171" num="0182">Polarization treatment was performed prior to the evaluation of piezoelectric properties. Specifically, a voltage of 1.5 to 5 kV/mm was applied to each sample in an oil bath maintained at 110° C. to 150° C. for 30 minutes, and the temperature was decreased to room temperature while applying the voltage. In Comparative Examples 2 to 4, the insulation resistivity was low such as 10<sup>6 </sup>Ω·cm (=10<sup>−3 </sup>GΩ·cm), and polarization treatment could not be performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0172" num="0183">The Youngs's modulus (Y<sub>11</sub>), electromechanical coupling factor (k<sub>31</sub>), piezoelectric constant (d<sub>31</sub>), and electromechanical quality factor (Qm) of the strip-like piezoelectric element were measured by a resonance-antiresonance method. The piezoelectric constant (d<sub>33</sub>) of the strip-like piezoelectric element was evaluated with a d<sub>33 </sub>meter utilizing the principle of a Berlincourt method. The relative dielectric constant was measured with an impedance analyzer. Throughout the specification, the relative dielectric constant is the value at a measuring frequency of 1 kHz with an application of an AC electric field of 500 mV. The measurement was performed after polarization treatment. The temperature dependability of the relative dielectric constant was evaluated by starting the measurement of the relative dielectric constant at room temperature, cooling the sample from the room temperature to −100° C., and then heating up to 350° C., and the changes in relative dielectric constant were recorded. The Curie temperature and the successive phase transition temperature were calculated from the maximum value of the relative dielectric constant. The typical characteristics of the samples are shown in Tables 2 and 3.</div>

<heading id="h-0020">Piezoelectric Material and Piezoelectric Element of Examples 1 to 4, 9, and 10 and Comparative Examples 1 and 2</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0175" num="0186">The samples in Examples 1 to 4 were prepared by adding 0.002 to 0.01 mol of Ni based on 1 mol of the perovskite-type metal oxide represented by Formula (1). The resistivities of the samples in Examples 1 to 4 increased in this order and were higher than that of the sample not containing Ni in Comparative Example 1. The addition of Ni increased the electromechanical coupling factor and the piezoelectric constant d<sub>31 </sub>or d<sub>33</sub>. In addition, the Youngs's modulus was increased, but the electromechanical quality factor was decreased. In Examples 9 and 10, the Curie temperature and the successive phase transition temperature could be controlled by changing the value of y, i.e., the amount of Nb. In addition, the electromechanical quality factor or the electromechanical coupling factor and the piezoelectric constant d<sub>31 </sub>or d<sub>33 </sub>were improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0176" num="0187">Here, if the addition amount of NiO was larger than 5 mol % as in Comparative Example 2, no perovskite-type metal oxide was formed, and the resistivity was significantly low. Therefore, the piezoelectric properties were not measured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0177" num="0188">It was also confirmed that the addition of Ni increases the amount of polarization determined by polarization-electric field hysteresis measurement. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows polarization-electric field hysteresis curves in Comparative Example 1 and Examples 1 to 4 and 11 to 13. It was confirmed that the addition of Ni increased the polarization when a certain electric field was applied, compared to Comparative Example.</div>
<heading id="h-0021">Piezoelectric Material and Piezoelectric Element of Examples 11 to 16 and Comparative Example 4</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0178" num="0189">The samples in Examples 11 to 13 were prepared by adding 0.001 to 0.005 mol of Mn based on 1 mol of the perovskite-type metal oxide represented by Formula (1). (Though the calcination was omitted in these Examples, the same results as those when the calcination was performed were obtained.) The resistivities of the samples in Examples 11 to 13 were higher than that in the sample not containing Mn in Comparative Example 1. The addition of Mn increased the electromechanical coupling factor and the piezoelectric constant d<sub>31 </sub>or d<sub>33</sub>. In addition, the Youngs's modulus was increased, but the Curie temperature was decreased with the amount of Mn. This is thought to be caused by solution of at least a part of Mn inside the crystals. Here, since the resistivity of the sample in Example 13 was lower than those of the samples in Examples 11 and 12, the amount of Mn in a sample not containing Ni should be less than 0.005 mol based on 1 mol of the perovskite-type metal oxide represented by Formula (1).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0179" num="0190">In Examples 14 to 16, the Curie temperature and the successive phase transition temperature could be controlled by changing the value of y, i.e., the amount of Nb. It was also confirmed that the addition of Mn increases the amount of polarization determined by polarization-electric field hysteresis measurement. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> also shows polarization-electric field hysteresis curves in Examples 11 to 13. It was confirmed that the addition of Mn increases the polarization under a certain electric field, compared to Comparative Example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0180" num="0191">If the addition amount of Mn was larger than 0.005 mol % as in Comparative Example 4, no perovskite-type metal oxide was formed, and the resistivity was significantly low. Therefore, the piezoelectric properties were not measured.</div>
<heading id="h-0022">Examples 5 and 6 and Comparative Example 3</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0181" num="0192">The samples in Examples 5 and 6 were prepared by adding 0.005 mol of Ni and also 0.002 mol or 0.005 mol of Cu based on 1 mol of the perovskite-type metal oxide represented by Formula (1). The electromechanical quality factor was improved compared to the sample not containing Cu in Example 2.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0182" num="0193">Here, if the addition amount of CuO was larger than 1 mol % as in Comparative Example 3, no perovskite-type metal oxide was formed. Therefore, the piezoelectric properties were not measured.</div>

The sintered compact was cut into a size of 10×2.5 mm. The side faces were ground, and a pair of external electrodes (a first electrode and a second electrode) for alternately short-circuiting the internal electrodes was formed by sputtering Au to produce a multilayered piezoelectric element as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>.</div>
