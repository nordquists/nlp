<heading id="h-0007">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">Embodiments for implementing the light emitting device and the method for manufacturing thereof of the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following embodiment, the light emitting device and the method for manufacturing thereof that embody the technological concept of the present invention are just examples, and unless otherwise specified, the constituent parts discussed in the embodiments are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. Further, constitutions described in examples and the embodiments can be employed in other examples and embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">The sizes and the arrangement relationships of the members in each of drawings are occasionally shown exaggerated for ease of explanation.</div>
<heading id="h-0008">Light-Transmissive Member</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">The light-transmissive member of the present embodiment includes a sheet and a color conversion material layer. In one embodiment, the light-transmissive member includes a light-reflective sheet that has a through-hole, and a color conversion material layer that includes a light-transmissive resin containing a color conversion material and disposed in the through-hole. The light-transmissive member preferably has suitable strength, and is self-standing. Therefore, it does not necessarily have to be rigid, and it is preferably flexible enough so that the color conversion material layer can be held without being damaged.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">At least one of the same surface sides of the sheet and the color conversion material layer, such as the upper surfaces, can be flush, that is, can be level or in a same plane, without any step between their upper surfaces, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>. The terms “flush”, “level”, “in the same plane” and “without any step” here is intended to allow unevenness of about several dozen microns, and preferably about a few dozen microns. For example, these terms include the structure where no intentional processing is performed on the surfaces so that one of the surfaces protrudes above the other. Accordingly, the dimensions of the color conversion material layer can be stabilized, and in turn those of the light-transmissive member, and thus proper assembly to the other members can be achieved. Stabilizing the dimensions of the light transmissive layer also allows facilitating to provide a lens or the like on the upper surface of the color conversion material layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">Alternatively, the color conversion material layer may have recess and/or protrusion (concave and/or convex) with respect to the upper surface and/or the lower surface of the sheet (see the light-transmissive members <b>10</b>A to <b>10</b>H in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). In the case where the color conversion material layer is concave, light convergence or another such effect can be exhibited. In the case where it is convex with respect to the lower surface of the sheet, bonding performance or bonding adhesion to the light emitting element being used can be improved. In the case where it is convex with respect to the upper surface of the sheet, this improves the light extraction efficiency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">The light-transmissive member may have a flat shape or, for example, being intentionally machined to have a bend, curve, etc. This allows the light-transmissive member to be thin. Alternatively, it may have the shape of a so-called micro-lens, a fly-eye lens, or the like, in which the upper surface of the color conversion material layer has a shape that is textured in the thickness direction of the light-transmissive member itself (see the light-transmissive member <b>10</b>K in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). This allows the light emitting device with the light-transmissive member to improve optical coupling efficiency to a light-guide plate in the case of being used in a backlight, for example, depending on the application of the light-transmissive member.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">The light-transmissive member may include one color conversion material layer in the through-hole of on one sheet, or may include a plurality of color conversion material layers are arranged in the through-holes of one sheet so that the color conversion material layers are respectively disposed in the respective through-holes. A size of the light-transmissive member in the case of disposing just one color conversion material layer is preferably somewhat greater than the size of the light emitting element, etc., being used. For example, it may measure 0.1 to 200×0.1 to 200 mm. The size of the light-transmissive member in the case of disposing a plurality of color conversion material layers can be suitably set depending on the size, number, and so forth of the color conversion material layer discussed below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">The outer peripheral portion of the color conversion material layer of the light-transmissive member (that is, a sheet) may be machined to provide the through-hole or to be in a fittable shape. In the case where the light-transmissive member is relatively large, and/or is long and slender, it is preferable to provide a shape for positioning or fitting to other components. This allows making assembly and joining to the light emitting device or the light emitting element discussed below without any misalignment.</div>
<heading id="h-0009">Sheet</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">The sheet is a member that supports the color conversion material layer. The sheet is light reflective. The term “light reflective” here means that the light reflectivity with respect to the light emitted from the light emitting element is at least 60%, and preferably at least 70%, 80%, or 90%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">Also, “light reflective sheet” includes a sheet whose material is light-reflective and a sheet where a material which is not light-reflective is processed to be imparted with light-reflectivity. The processing to be light reflective can be performed in any step of the manufacturing the light-transmissive member.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">That is, for the light reflective sheet, a light reflective material (a first light reflective material) or a material that is not light reflective, such as a light-transmissive material or a light absorbent material, may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">Examples of the light reflective materials include metals and light reflective substances (e.g., titanium dioxide, silicon dioxide, zinc dioxide, zirconium dioxide, potassium titanate, alumina, aluminum nitride, boron nitride, mullite, niobium oxide, barium sulfate, coloring agent, and various types of rare earth oxides such as yttrium oxide, gadolinium oxide, etc.). The metal or light reflective substance may itself be made into a sheet, or a granular material may be formed into a sheet with a binder such as a resin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">For instance, the sheet can be either a single layer or a stack of a metal or a dielectric material. Further, the light reflective sheet can be obtained by adding the above-mentioned light reflective substance in an amount of about 10 to 95 wt %, and preferably about 20 to 80 wt %, and more preferably about 30 to 70 wt %, and even more preferably about 30 to 60 wt %, to a resin, an inorganic material, glass, or the like, or a composite thereof. The light reflective sheet can also be one in which the surface of one of these metal, dielectric, or resin sheets is covered with a light reflective substance or a metal film (a second light reflective material), etc. Such an arrangement allows facilitating to form the sheet as desired. It also allows ensuring a sufficient strength. Furthermore, sufficient resistance can be ensured against temperature changes in the filling and curing of the light-transmissive resin discussed below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">Examples of the materials of metals used for the light reflective metal films include single layer films or laminate films of silver, aluminum, copper, gold, platinum, palladium, rhodium, nickel, tungsten, molybdenum, chromium, titanium, and alloys of these. The material for the metals used for the light reflective sheet is similar to these. Examples of the dielectric film include single layer film and laminate films that are used in this field. An example is SiO<sub>2</sub>/Nb<sub>3</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>or other such laminate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">Examples of resins that can serve as a base material include thermosetting resins, thermoplastic resins, modified resins of these resins, and hybrid resins that contain one or more of these resins. Specific examples of the resin includes epoxy resins, modified epoxy resins (silicone-modified epoxy resin, etc.), silicone resin, modified silicone resin (an epoxy modified silicone resin, etc.), hybrid silicone resin, a polyimide (PI), a modified polyimide resin, polyamide (PA), polyethylene terephthalate resin, polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), GF reinforced polyethylene terephthalate (GF-PET), polycyclohexane terephthalate resins, polyphthalamide (PPA), polycarbonate (PC), polyphenylene sulfide (PPS), polysulfone (PSF), polyether sulfone (PES), a modified polyphenylene ether (m-PPE), polyether ether ketone (PEEK), polyetherimide (PEI), liquid crystal polymer (LCP), ABS resin, phenol resin, acrylic resin, PBT resin, urea resin, BT resin, a polyurethane resin, polyacetal (POM), an ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHPE), a syndiotactic polystyrene (SPS), an amorphous polyarylate (PAR), a fluorocarbon resin, and an unsaturated polyesters.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">Examples of the inorganic materials include single layer structures or multilayered structures that contain aluminum oxide, aluminum nitride, zirconium oxide, zirconium nitride, titanium oxide, titanium nitride, zinc oxide, mixtures of these, or other such ceramics, or low-temperature sintered ceramics, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">As the light transmissive material, the light transmissive material of the above-mentioned resin, glass, a dielectric material or the like can be used. As the light absorbing material, ceramics described above, paper, fiber, pulp, carbon, a dielectric, a composite material such as glass epoxy or the like can be used. Light absorbing material may have a light conversion function. In the case where the light reflective sheet is formed from one of these light-transmissive materials and/or light absorbing materials, the light reflective characteristics that are given during manufacturing of the light-transmissive member are preferably obtained by covering the inner surface of a through-hole (or through-holes) discussed below and a surface of the light reflective sheet with a light reflective material. It is preferable that the entire surfaces including the front and bark and the side surfaces is covered by the light reflective material, but a part of the sheet may not be covered, as long as substantially the entire surfaces of the side walls of the through-hole touching the color conversion material layer is covered by the light reflective sheet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">The light reflective sheet may contain a diffusing agent, a light scattering agent (such as barium sulfate, titanium dioxide, aluminum oxide, or silicon oxide), or the like. Also, any glass cloth, filler, or the like such as glass fiber, wollastonite, and other such fibrous fillers, and carbon, silicon oxide, and other such inorganic fillers used in the field of semiconductor BGA mounting may be contained in order to ensure good heat dissipation, strength, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">In particular, it is preferable for the light reflective sheet to be obtained by forming a light reflective material that contains a light reflective substance and a resin into the light reflective sheet, since such sheets are readily available.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">The thickness of the light reflective sheet can be suitably set according to the materials being used and so forth, and it is preferably thick enough to ensure the proper strength and light reflectivity. For example, the thickness may be from a few dozen microns to about 1 mm, with a few dozen microns to about 500 μm being preferable, and about 100 to 300 μm being even preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">In addition to the light reflective substance and the light transmissive resin, the reflective sheet may also contain a light emitting material. In particular, in the case where the size of the through-hole, in which the color conversion material layer is disposed, is smaller than the light emitting element, containing the light emitting material allows reducing the escape of light (e.g., blue light) from the light emitting element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">The size of the through-hole in plan view may be, for example, {a few hundred microns to a few millimeters}×{a few hundred microns to a few millimeters}, or {a few hundred microns to 1 mm}×{a few hundred microns to 1 mm}, or a shape with a size that corresponds to these surface areas. Examples of the shape of the through-hole in plan view include circular, elliptical, polyhedral, and shapes that are approximate to these. It is especially preferable for the plan view shape of the through-hole to be substantially similar to the plan view shape of the light emitting element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">The through-hole may have the same shape and size in the thickness direction of the sheet, or their shape and size may vary from one surface to the surface opposite to the one surface as shown see the light-transmissive members <b>10</b>I and <b>10</b>J in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> such as a truncated elliptical cone or a truncated prismatic cone.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">The size and shape of the through-hole may correspond to the size and shape of the color conversion material layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">In the case where a plurality of through-holes are arranged on a single sheet, it is preferable that they are spaced enough that the sheet will not be broken by the arrangement of the through-holes. An example of a spacing between the through-holes is about 0.01 mm to a few millimeters. This arrangement may be random, or the through-holes may be arranged in a ring shape as shown in the light-transmissive member <b>100</b>A in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, and the through-holes are preferably arranged regularly in the row and or column direction as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1D and 2A</figref>.</div>
<heading id="h-0010">Color Conversion Material Layer</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">The color conversion material layer is formed substantially without any voids in the through-hole, and the color conversion material layer is made of a color conversion material and a cured light transmissive resin. The color conversion material layer may also contain the above-mentioned diffusing agent, light scattering agent, glass cloth, fillers, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">The color conversion material can be a material known in this field such as yttrium-aluminum-garnet (YAG)-based phosphors activated by cerium, lutetium-aluminum-garnet (LAG)-based phosphors activated by cerium, nitrogen-containing calcium aluminosilicate (CaO—Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>—SiO<sub>2</sub>)-based phosphors activated by europium and/or chromium, silicate ((Sr, Ba)<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>)-based phosphors activated by europium, β-SiAlON phosphors and KSF-based phosphors (K<sub>2</sub>SiF<sub>6</sub>:Mn). It may also be a crystallized or sintered phosphor, a sintered composite of a phosphor and an inorganic material, or the like. This allows obtaining a light emitting device that emits mixed color light (such as white light) that is a mixture of primary and secondary light of a visible wavelength, or a light emitting device that emits secondary light of a visible wavelength when excited by primary light such as ultraviolet light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">Further, examples of the color conversion material include a luminescent material referred to as a so called nanocrystal or quantum dot, which is nano-size high-dispersive particles of semiconductor materials, for example group II-VI, group III-V and group IV-VI semiconductors, more specifically ZnS, CdS, CdSe, InAgS<sub>2</sub>, InCuS<sub>2</sub>, core-shell type CdS<sub>X</sub>—Se<sub>1-X</sub>/ZnS, and GaP. The color conversion material may also be, InAs InP, InAsP, InGaP, ZnTe, ZnSeTe, ZnSnP, or ZnSnP<sub>2</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">In this embodiment, a color conversion material with which there are disadvantages in terms of heat resistance, water resistance, and environmental gas resistance can be used effectively. More specifically, a color conversion material that is vulnerable to heat and/or moisture generated by the processing involved in assembly of the light emitting device discussed below, such as a KSF phosphor that may be readily degraded by water of a dicer, and quantum dots that are susceptible to heating during reflow, can be effectively used without impairing its characteristics, etc. That is, the light-transmissive member including the color conversion material can be cut in advance with a laser or the like to adjust the size of the pieces, and these are directly fixed to individual light emitting elements, or fixed to the light emitting elements after the light emitting devices including the light emitting elements have been mounted on a secondary mounting substrate by reflow, etc., which allows the color conversion material to be effectively provided impairing its characteristics, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">In particular, in the case where the light emitting device is used for the backlight of a liquid crystal display, etc., it is preferable to use a color conversion material that is excited by blue light and emits red light (such as a KSF-based phosphor) and a color conversion material that is excited by blue light and emits green light (such as a beta-SiAlON phosphor). Using such materials allows for expanding the color reproduction range of the display in which the light emitting device is used. In particular, KSF has a sharper peak of the emission spectrum than other color conversion materials which emits red color such as CASN or SCASN. Thus, in the case where light is extracted through a color filter used in the display device, amount of red light with low luminosity factor can be decreased, and there will be less lights that go through a (such as green) color filter of other color. As a result, green light and red light of higher color purity can be obtained, and the color reproducibility of the liquid crystal display can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">The color conversion material may be used in any form, such as a pulverized form, spherical form, or hollow or porous granules. A particle of the color conversion material preferably has a median particle size of 50 μm or less, more preferably 30 μm or less, even more preferably 10 μm or less, or a corresponding size. The median particle size refers to a particle size obtained by an air permeability method in F.S.S.S.No (Fisher Sub Sieve Sizer's No).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">The color conversion material is preferably contained in an amount of about 10 to 90 wt % with respect to the total weight of the color conversion material layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">The light-transmissive resin that constitutes the color conversion material layer can be selected from among the above-mentioned resins that are light-transmissive resins. Of these, it is preferable to select one with less expansion and shrinkage during curing or under temperature changes. Also, in the case where a resin is used as a material of the light reflective sheet, it is preferably to use the same resin as that of the light reflective sheet. This can ensure good adhesion between the light-reflective sheet and the color conversion material, and allows the light-transmissive member to be manufactured stably.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">Using the light-transmissive member such as this allows for improving visibility of the light emitting device. That is, disposing the color conversion material layer in the through-hole formed in the light reflective sheet, or in other words, disposing the color conversion material layer so as to be completely surrounded by the light reflective sheet, allows for improving a distinct boundary between the light emission region and the non-emission region of the light emitting device simply, easily, and precisely.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">In particular, in the case of using a color conversion material that tends not to absorb light, or in which optical absorption tends to decrease, is used in the color conversion material layer, it will be necessary to increase the proportion of the color conversion material in the color conversion material layer, or to make the color conversion material layer relatively thicker in order to ensure the proper amount of the color conversion material. Even in the case where a light-transmissive resin contains a relatively large amount of the color conversion material, or even in the case where film thickness control is required to ensure the proper amount of color conversion material, the above mentioned configuration allows these requirements to be met with case, and thus allows a high-quality light-transmissive member to be obtained, which can be used in the manufacture of a high-quality light emitting device.</div>
<heading id="h-0011">Functional Film</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">A processing may be performed on an upper surface and and/or a lower surface of the light-transmissive member, and particularly on the upper surface and/or lower surface of the color conversion material layer, to protect from humidity and corrosive gas, or to enhance their strength, etc. More specifically, the protective processing is to dispose one or more functional films having the function of protection, moisture-proofing, reinforcement, or the like as a single layer or multilayered structure (see the light-transmissive member <b>10</b>L in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">For example, as long as it is light-transmissive, this functional film can be formed from the above-mentioned resin that constitutes the light reflective sheet, etc. A filler or the like may be added to the resin for the sake of reinforcement, etc. More specifically, examples include a film of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, SiOx, or the like with high gas barrier properties, and epoxy resins, silicone epoxy hybrid resins, fluororesins, parylene-based gas barrier films, and so forth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">Also, the light-transmissive member, and particularly a single light-transmissive member having a single color conversion material layer, can be small, so a sheet of glass or the like may be disposed on the upper surface of the light-transmissive member to ensure the strength of the light-transmissive member, or the upper surface may be coated with a light-transmissive resin or the like, or further processing may be performed for the sake of reinforcement.</div>
<heading id="h-0012">First Method for Manufacturing Light-Transmissive Member</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">The light-transmissive member can be manufactured by the following steps.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">In addition, the following steps can be optionally included.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">(e) Cutting the sheet for each through-hole or each group of through-holes;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">(f) forming a functional film; and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">(g) sorting the color or light flux according to the light conversion ability of color conversion material layers in the through-holes on the sheet.</div>
<heading id="h-0013">(a) Sheet Preparation</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">First, a sheet is prepared.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">The sheet here, as discussed above, may be formed from a light reflective material, or may be formed from a material other than a light reflective material, such as a light-transmissive material or a light absorbing material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">The sheet can be formed by using a method that is known in the field of plastic molding, such as injection molding, extrusion molding, heat molding, or compression molding.</div>
<heading id="h-0014">(b) Formation of Through-Hole</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">A through-hole is formed in the sheet. The through-hole may be formed by using any method known in this field. Examples of the method include laser light irradiation or delineation, punching, stamping, etching, and blasting.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">In particular, through-hole can be formed with good precision by irradiation with a laser beam. A fundamental wave, double wave, triple wave, quadruple wave, or the like of a CO<sub>2 </sub>laser or a solid state laser can be used for this laser. As to the wavelength, a wavelength in infrared region is preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">After the formation of the through-hole, it is preferable to remove any scorching, smears, or the like by washing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">Also, in the preparation of the sheet in step (a), the sheet preparation and the through-hole formation may be performed simultaneously, such as by using a metal mold having a recess and a protrusion that corresponds to the through-hole to form a light reflective material, a light-transmissive material, or a light absorbing material.</div>
<heading id="h-0015">(c) Imparting of Light Reflecting Function to Sheet</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">A light reflecting function may be imparted to the sheet during the formation of the sheet, so that the sheet can be a light reflective sheet. That is, steps (a) and (c) may be performed at the same time. Also, a light reflecting function may be imparted separately to the sheet after the through-hole have been formed (step (b)) in a sheet made of a material other than a light reflective material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">In the case where the impaction of a light reflecting function to the sheet is performed simultaneously with the formation of the sheet, then the sheet should be formed from a light reflective material (the first light reflective material), as discussed above. In this case, for example, a method in which a metal or a dielectric material is formed as the sheet, a method in which a material containing one of the above-mentioned light reflective substances in a light-transmissive resin, an inorganic material, glass, or the like is molded in the form of a sheet, or a method in which the surfaces of the metal or dielectric material, or the sheet including the above-mentioned light reflective substances in a light-transmissive resin are covered by a metal or a light reflective substance can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">In the case where a light reflecting function is imparted to the sheet after the formation of the through-hole, an example of how this is performed includes to cover the surface of the sheet and the inner surfaces of the through-hole with a light reflective material by any method known in this field, such as plating, various kinds of molding, spraying, injection, vapor deposition, inkjet printing, or by using ALD method. The light reflective material used for the covering is preferably as thin as possible. The thickness of the light reflective material covering is, for example, preferably equal to or less than about a few dozen microns.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">Even in the case where the formation of reflective side walls of the light emitting device is physically difficult due to the small size of the light emitting device, utilizing the sheet to which a light reflecting function can be easily imparted allows to introduce or distribute the light from the light emitting device to where it is needed. As a result, the light utilization efficiency can be increased.</div>
<heading id="h-0016">(d) Formation of Color Conversion Material Layer</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">The insides of the through-hole are filled with a light-transmissive resin that contains a color conversion material, and this resin is cured to form a color conversion material layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">Any method known, in this field can be used to fill the through-hole with the light-transmissive resin that contains a color conversion material, such as potting, molding, printing, spraying, and various other such methods. In this step, the filling is preferably performed so that after the light-transmissive resin is cured, the upper surface of the color conversion material layer will be in the same plane with the upper surface of the light reflective sheet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">The curing of the light-transmissive resin can be suitably set according to the type of resin being used. Examples include a method of leaving the resin is allowed to stand for a specific length of time, a method of blowing cold air against the resin, a method of heating the resin (very approximately from around several dozen ° C. up to around a hundred and several dozen ° C.), and a method of irradiating the resin with an energy beam (X rays, ultraviolet rays, visible light rays, etc.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">When a plurality of color conversion material layers are formed on a single sheet, the same color conversion material need not be used for all of the color conversion material layers, and a number of different color conversion materials may be used. In this case, RGB color emission can be achieved using a single light-transmissive member by regularly arranging the layers for each color of the color conversion materials.</div>
<heading id="h-0017">(e) Cutting of Sheet</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">In the case where a plurality of through-holes are thrilled in the sheet in step (a), and a plurality of color conversion material layers are formed in step (d), the light reflective sheet may be cut after step (d). The cutting of the sheet may be performed in any way as long as a sheet, and particularly a light reflective sheet, is disposed around substantially the entire outer periphery of the color conversion material layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">The cutting may be performed so that one color conversion material layer is disposed in one sheet. For example, the light reflective sheet may be cut to a size of about a few tenths of a micron to a few millimeters.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">Also, the light reflective sheet may be cut so that a plurality of color conversion material layers are disposed in a single light reflective sheet. In this case, for example, it is preferable for the color conversion material layers to be cut so that the plurality of color conversion material layers in groups of about 5 to 20, and more preferably in groups of about 7 to 15, and even more preferably in groups of about 8 to 12, are disposed in the single light reflective sheet. These color conversion material layers are preferably arranged in a single row, and the light reflective sheet is cut, for example, to a length of about a few tenths of a micron to 5 cm, and preferably about a few tenths of a micron to a few centimeters.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">The cutting method can be suitably selected depending on the characteristics of the color conversion material, filler, and resin material being used. This cutting can be performed by any sheet cutting method known in this field, such as blade dicing, laser dicing, or cutter scribing. For instance, in the case of using a color conversion material that is not resistant to moisture, it is preferable to select laser dicing. In the case of using a color conversion material that is not resistant to heat, it is preferable to select blade dicing. In the case where the material is resistant to neither moisture nor heat, the color conversion material can be prevented from being directly exposed to moisture and/or heat, as long as the color conversion material layer is not cut directly. Also, since the light-transmissive member is in the form of a sheet, additional processing of a protective film or other such functional film can be easily carried out.</div>
<heading id="h-0018">Second Method for Manufacturing Light-Transmissive Member</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">The light-transmissive member can also be manufactured by the following steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">(d′) A color conversion material layer is formed by curing a light-transmissive resin that contains a color conversion material; and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">(a′) a resin layer having a light reflecting function is formed as a sheet or a multilayered structure on the outer peripheral side surface of the color conversion material layer.</div>
<heading id="h-0019">(d′) Formation of Color Conversion Material Layer</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">In the formation of the color conversion material layer, the material that forma the above-mentioned color conversion material layer is formed as islands on a support sheet by potting, printing, spraying, or any of various other such methods. To form the color conversion material layer in the islands shape, a mask or the like having openings at the sites where the color conversion material layer is to be formed can be utilized. A self-alignment effect can also be used, which takes advantage of hydrophilicity and water repellency between the material for the color conversion material layer and the support sheet. Just one color conversion material layer may be formed, or two or more may be formed. In the case of forming more than one color conversion material layers, the color conversion material layers are preferably formed separated from one another.</div>
<heading id="h-0020">(a′) Formation of Sheet</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">The material constituting the above-mentioned sheet can be used as the material that constitutes the resin layer to be made in the form of a sheet-like shape or a multilayered structure. This material is, for example, melted or dissolved in a solvent to be fluid, and then is formed into a sheet-like shape or a multilayered structure so as to surround the side surface of the color conversion material layer. The side surface of the color conversion material layer here is preferably surrounded entirely.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">In the case where a plurality of color conversion material layers are formed in the previous step, the entire outer peripheral side surface of the light reflective sheet is preferably formed integrally with some or all of these color conversion material layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">The material constituting the above-mentioned resin layer is preferably the above-mentioned light reflective material, but it is sufficient that a light reflecting function is imparted to the resin layer in the end. For imparting light reflectivity, in the case where a material which is not light reflective is used as the material that forms the resin layer, for example, then as mentioned above, it is preferable for the side surface, and preferably the entire side surfaces of the resin layer to be covered with a metal or another light reflective substance by any method known in this field, such as plating, spraying, vapor deposition, printing, or ALD.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">For example, in the case where spraying is performed, a silicone resin containing a high concentration of titanium dioxide is sprayed directly onto a color conversion material layer made in the island shape, after which a silicone resin containing a low concentration of titanium dioxide may be subjected to compression molding and may be made into a sheet. Optionally, a surface of the side that has been sprayed with titanium dioxide may be ground with a grinder to remove the layer containing the titanium dioxide. That is, a resin layer having a light reflecting function may be formed as a multilayered structure on the outer peripheral side surface of the color conversion material layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">Except for above-mentioned steps, all the steps can be performed in a way similar to the first method for manufacturing a light-transmissive member, and optional steps as below may be added.</div>
<heading id="h-0021">(f) Formation of Functional Films</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">Further, the above-mentioned functional films may be formed. These films can be formed by using ALD method, sputtering, vapor deposition, CVD, or another such method.</div>
<heading id="h-0022">(g) Sort According to Color or Light Flux</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">An optical conversion performance of the color conversion material layer formed in the through-hole may be measured to be sorted according to color or light flux. After sorting, the sorted light-transmissive member can be mounted on a light emitting element that emits light of a particular wavelength, in a state in which the light-transmissive member has been made into individual units or not-individualized unit, either before or after step (e). Consequently, a higher yield of the light emitting device can be anticipated, especially in the case where the light flux or color is measured in a slate before individualization in advance.</div>
<heading id="h-0023">Method for Manufacturing Light Emitting Device</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">The light emitting device can be formed by:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">(A) fixing the above-mentioned light-transmissive member on a light emitting element so that the color conversion material layer is disposed on the light emitting element; and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">(B) covering side surfaces of the light emitting element with a light reflective member.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">Steps (A) and (B) are preferably performed in the above order, but may instead be performed simultaneously or in reverse order. Also, a light emitting element may preferably be mounted on the substrate of the light emitting device before or after step (A), and particularly preferable before step (A). A single light emitting element may be mounted on a single substrate, or a plurality of light emitting elements may be mounted on a plurality of substrates, or a plurality of light emitting elements may be mounted on a single substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">Furthermore, in case where a plurality of light emitting elements are mounted on a single substrate, a step of separating them for each light emitting device or a group of light emitting devices may be performed after step (B). That is, the light emitting element whose side surfaces are covered by a light reflective member, or the light emitting element and the light-transmissive member, whose side surfaces are covered by a light reflective member may be made into individual units.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">The damage on the color conversion material, etc., in the assembly process of the light emitting device can be minimized in the case where step (B), the step of separation by light emitting device, and step (A) are performed in that order.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">As discussed below, the light emitting element used here may be mounted on a substrate with terminals.</div>
<heading id="h-0024">(A) Fixing of Light-Transmissive Member and Light Emitting Element</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">The light-transmissive member formed by the method discussed above is fixed to the upper surface of the light emitting element. That is, the light-transmissive member is disposed on the light extraction surface side of the light emitting device. A portion of the upper surface of the light emitting element is preferably in direct contact with the light-transmissive member, and more preferably is firmly adhered to the light-transmissive layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">There may be just one, or two or more of the light-transmissive members used in this step. Also, there may be just one, or two or more of the light emitting elements used in this step. That is, the light emitting device manufactured in this method may include just one light emitting element, or may include two or more. A configuration such as this allows the number of the light emitting elements and the combination of turned-on/turned-off of the light emitting elements to be selected, and allows light distribution and emission color of the light emitting device to be controlled in various ways.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">A single light-transmissive member may be fixed to the upper surface of a plurality of light emitting elements, but from the standpoint of ensuring good visibility, it is preferable that a single light-transmissive member, and particularly a single color conversion material layer, is fixed on a single light emitting element. This can effectively prevents light from leaking in unintended directions from the light emitting element. As a result, visibility can be further improved in individual light emitting elements by the simple manufacturing method discussed above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">Also, in the case where a plurality of light emitting elements are mounted on a substrate, a light-transmissive member on which a plurality of color conversion material layers are disposed at positions corresponding to the light emitting elements are preferably fixed collectively on these light emitting elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">The light emitting element used here can be any light emitting element that is commonly used in this field. Examples of blue and green light emitting elements include those made of ZnSe, nitride semiconductors (In<sub>X</sub>Al<sub>Y</sub>Ga<sub>1-X-Y</sub>N, 0≤X, 0≤Y, X+Y≤1), GaP, or other such semiconductor layers, while examples of red light emitting elements include those made of GaAlAs, AlInGaP, and other such semiconductor layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">The light emitting element is can be formed by stacking a semiconductor layer over an insulated substrate used for semiconductor growth, such as sapphire, but this semiconductor growth substrate may also be removed during forming of the light emitting element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">The light emitting element may be one in which electrodes are disposed on opposite sides of the semiconductor layer, but is preferably one in which the electrodes are disposed on the same side. This allows for face-down mounting (flip-chip mounting) in which the electrodes are joined to the substrate. The light emitting element may have a face-down structure that has a growth substrate, a face-down structure that does not have a growth substrate, a face-up structure that has a growth substrate, a face-up structure that does not have a growth substrate, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">The light emitting element is preferably one that is the same size or smaller than an area defined by outer edges of the color conversion material layer in plan view as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>. This allows substantially all of the light emitted from the light emitting element to be efficiently introduced into the color conversion material layer, and thus allows improving of the light extraction of the light emitting device. The light emitting element may be also one that is the same size (the outer edges substantially coincide) or larger than the outer edge of the color conversion material layer. Also in this case, covering the side surfaces of the light emitting element with a light reflective member (discussed below) allows a light emitting device with good visibility, uniform emission color, and good light distribution and color to be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">A light emitting element <b>14</b> is preferably smaller, than the outer edge of a light-transmissive member <b>10</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A to 12C</figref>. This allows the outer edge of the light-transmissive member to be disposed outside of the outer edge of the light emitting element, and allows a light emitting device with good visibility, uniform emission color, and good light distribution and emission color to be formed. The through-hole in which the color conversion material layer is disposed may be either tapered or reverse tapered from the element side toward the light extraction surface as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12B and 12C</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">Furthermore, a light emitting element that is larger than the outer edge of the light-transmissive member in plan view may be used. In this case, the side surfaces of the light emitting element and the upper surface of the light emitting element (and optionally the side surfaces of the light-transmissive member) are covered by the light reflective member discussed below, which allows a light emitting device with good visibility, high brightness, uniform emission color, and good light distribution and color temperature to be formed. The through-hole in which the color conversion material layer is disposed is preferably reverse tapered, that is, a width of the through-hole is decreased from the element side toward the light extraction surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">The fixing of the light transmissive member to the upper surface of the light emitting element can be accomplished by using a light-transmissive adhesive member, for example. Any adhesive member can be used, so long as it ensures the above-mentioned light-transmissivity and can fix the light-transmissive member to the light emitting element. A material that is not readily degraded by light is preferable as the light-transmissive adhesive member. Examples of the material include silicone adhesives, epoxy adhesives, and silicone-epoxy hybrid adhesives.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">The color conversion material layer or sheet surface can be utilized as the adhesive member itself. That is, the color conversion material layer or the light reflective sheet itself may be given adhesive properties, or the adhesion of the color conversion material layer or sheet may be utilized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">The adhesive member can be formed in a fillet shape that expands from the outer edge of upper surface of the light emitting element to the lower surface of the outer edge of the light-transmissive member in the case of using a light emitting element whose outer edge is smaller than that of the light-transmissive member in plan view. Also, the adhesive member can be formed in a fillet shape that expands from the outer edge of the lower surface of the light-transmissive member to the outer edge of the upper surface the light emitting element in the case of using a light emitting element whose outer edge is larger than the light-transmissive member in plan view. From the standpoint of forming a light emitting device with good visibility, it is preferable for the outer edge of the adhesive member to be disposed more to the inside than the outer edge of the light-transmissive member, or for the outer edge of the adhesive member to be covered by a light reflective member, as discussed below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">The light-transmissive member may also be mounted mechanically on the light emitting element by utilizing a processed surface, texturing on the light reflective sheet that is simultaneously processed in the formation of the above-mentioned through-holes, or the like to fit, partially bond, etc., to the structure of the light emitting element, the light emitting device, and a light source or other such device that emits light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">As discussed above, the light emitting element is preferably mounted on a substrate.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">The light emitting element may be mounted in the face-up mounting, in which the growth substrate side of the light emitting element the opposite side from the side where the electrodes are formed) is joined on the substrate, but flip chip mounting (face down mounting) on the substrate is preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">In the case of face-up mounting, for example, the above-mentioned light-transmissive adhesive member (resin, etc.) can be disposed on the light emitting element so that a portion of the wires is embedded and the light-transmissive member is disposed over this. Also, as will be discussed below, a side surface of a light-transmissive part of the light emitting element, such as sapphire, can be covered with a light reflective member in step (C) and before the mounting of the light-transmissive member in order to improve light extraction from the upper surface of the light emitting element. A made of transparent material with a tapered shape may be provided between the light-reflective member and the transparent the light-transmissive part of the light emitting element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">The light emitting element can be mounted on the substrate via a joining member. Examples of the joining member here include solders such as those based on tin-bismuth, tin-copper, tin-silver, gold-tin, or the like; alloys whose main components are gold and tin, alloys whose main components are gold and germanium, and other such eutectic alloys; silver, gold, palladium, and other such conductive pastes and bumps; ACP, ACF, and other such anisotropic conductive materials low-melting point metal brazes; conductive adhesives that are a combination of these; and conductive composite adhesives.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">In the case of flip-chip mounting, the electrodes of the light emitting element can be directly connected to the wiring pattern of the substrate via these materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">In the case where one or a plurality of light emitting elements are mounted on a plurality of substrates, a plurality of light-transmissive members may be arranged on a single support prior to step (A), or instead of this arrangement, a light-transmissive member equipped with a plurality of color conversion material layers may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">As the support, it is preferable to use a detachable pressure-sensitive adhesive tape or sheet, a temporary fixing agent for a semiconductor, a patternable temporary fixing agent, or the like. Using the support allows the plurality of light-transmissive members to be simultaneously mounted on and fixed to the plurality of light emitting elements. As a result, the manufacturing process can be simplified. The manufacturing process can also be simplified by using a light-transmissive member including a plurality of color conversion material layers.</div>

<heading id="h-0025">(B) Covering with Light Reflective Member</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">The side surfaces of the light emitting element are covered with a light reflective member.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0136">The light reflective member can be made of the light reflective materials discussed above. In particular, in terms of simplicity and ease of covering, it is preferable to use a light reflective substance contained in a resin or an inorganic material. The resin can be selected from among the above-mentioned thermosetting resins, thermoplastic resins, modified resins of these, and hybrid resins that contain one or more of these resins. Of these, the use of a light-transmissive resin is preferable, and from the standpoint of adhesion to the light-transmissive member, etc., it is preferable to use the resin that constitutes the light-transmissive member, and particularly a resin that is the same as the material constituting the light reflective sheet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">As long as it covers the side surfaces of the light emitting element, the light reflective member may cover indirectly, via a space, etc., but is preferably disposed directly, that is, so as to be in contact with the side surfaces of the light emitting element. Covering in this way allows the light emitted from the light emitting element to be distributed more efficiently in a particular direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0138">The side surfaces of the light emitting element that are covered may be just some of these surfaces, but are preferably all the side surfaces. The phrase “side surfaces of the light emitting element” here means, for example, the side surfaces of the semiconductor layer constituting the light emitting element, but in the case of disposing electrodes, then the light reflective member may be disposed on the side surfaces of the electrodes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139">Also, as discussed above, since the light emitting element can be mounted on a substrate, and in that case, the light reflective member preferably covers the side surfaces of the light emitting element and a surface of the substrate. Furthermore, in the case where there is a space between the semiconductor layer and the substrate, then this space may be covered or filled in by the light reflective member. At all of these locations (that is, the side surfaces of the semiconductor layer, the electrode side surfaces, and between the semiconductor layer and the substrate), the same material or different materials may be used as the light reflective member.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0140">In the case of using a material that is the same as the material constituting the above-mentioned light-transmissive member as the light reflective member, the side surfaces of the light emitting elements can be covered by using a method such as potting, transfer molding, compression or molding. These methods can facilitate to cover the side surfaces of the light emitting element. Also, the light reflective member can be easily, securely, and accurately disposed only under the light-transmissive member. In particular, in the case of performing step (B) after step (A), the side surfaces, of the light emitting element can be covered by the light reflective member so that the upper surface of the light reflective member and the lower surface of the light-transmissive member coincide easily and securely.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0141">Also, the side surfaces of the light emitting element and the side surfaces of the light-transmissive member can be covered so that the upper surface of the light reflective member coincides with the upper surface of the light-transmissive member.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0143" num="0142">In the case where a material that is the same as the material constituting the above-mentioned light-transmissive member (such as a resin same as the resin used for the light-transmissive member) is used as the light reflective member, these light emitting elements can be simply covered all at once and integrally by the light reflective member on the substrate on which the light emitting elements are arranged.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0144" num="0143">A molded article in which the location corresponding to the light emitting element is hollow may be used as the light reflective member. In this case, the light reflective member with a form of the molded article may be disposed on the substrate in advance, after which a light emitting element to which a light-transmissive member has been fixed may be disposed on the light reflective member and pressure, applied so that the electrodes of the light emitting element come into contact with the wiring of the substrate. The molded article preferably has a height corresponding to the height of the light emitting element. This allows facilitating to cover the side surfaces of the light emitting element by the light-reflecting member, and also allows the light reflective member to be disposed easily, securely, and accurately only below the light transmissive member (that is, without covering the side surfaces of the light-transmissive member). Also, the upper surface of the light reflective member can be easily and securely made to coincide with the lower surface of the light-transmissive member. In this case, step (B) can be performed before step (A).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0144">The molded article is preferably fixed to the above-mentioned substrate with an adhesive agent or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0145">After step (B), the light-transmissive member, the light reflective member, and/or the substrate, etc., may or may not be separated for each light emitting element or for each group of light emitting elements, if needed, in the case where a plurality of light emitting elements are mounted on a single substrate, in the case where a single light-transmissive member is fixed on a plurality of light emitting elements, in the case where a plurality of light-transmissive members are fixed on a corresponding plurality of light emitting elements, or in other such cases. This allows obtaining a light emitting device with desired light distribution, brightness, size, and so on. The separation in this case can be performed by using blade dicing, laser dicing, or the like.</div>
<heading id="h-0026">Light Emitting Device</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0147" num="0146">The light emitting device according to an embodiment of the present invention mainly includes a light emitting element, a light-transmissive member, and a light reflective member.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0148" num="0147">The light-transmissive member can be the one discussed above, and is fixed on the light emitting element so that the color conversion material layer is disposed on the light emitting element. The color conversion material layer is preferably in contact with a portion of the upper surface of the light emitting element, and more preferably is firmly adhered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0149" num="0148">The outer edge of the light emitting element preferably either coincides with the outer edge of the color conversion material layer in plan view, or is disposed on the inside of the color conversion material layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0150" num="0149">In the case where a single light emitting device includes a plurality of light emitting elements, a light reflective sheet including a plurality of color conversion material layers can be used as the light-transmissive member so that the plurality of light emitting elements are collectively configured by this light-transmissive member.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0150">In a single light emitting device, there may be just one light emitting element or an arrangement of two or more light emitting elements. In the latter case, it is preferable that the light-transmissive member includes a plurality of color conversion material layers, and the color conversion material layer are disposed at positions corresponding to the light emitting elements, and fixed on the light emitting elements. This allows to obtain a light emitting device with good visibility. Also, the color conversion material layers may contain the same color conversion material, or may contain different color conversion materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0152" num="0151">The light emitting element may be mounted on a substrate on which terminals are formed, or may not be mounted. For example, in the case where a single light emitting device includes a plurality of light emitting elements, the light emitting elements can be collectively configured by the substrate on which the terminals are formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0153" num="0152">The upper surface of the light reflective member may coincide with the lower surface of the light-transmissive member, or it may coincide with the upper surface of the light-transmissive member so that the side surfaces of the light-transmissive member are also covered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0154" num="0153">Also, in the case where a single light emitting device includes a plurality of light emitting elements, the light emitting elements can be collectively configured by a light reflective member substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0155" num="0154">A configuration such as this allows a light emitting device to be obtained extremely simply and easily, and very accurately.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0156" num="0155">In particular, in the case where a color conversion material that tends not to absorb light, or in which optical absorption tends to decrease, or the like is used in the color conversion material layer of the light-transmissive member, it will be necessary to increase the proportion of color conversion material in the color conversion material layer, or to make the color conversion material layer relatively thicker in order to ensure the proper amount of color conversion material. Even in the case where a light-transmissive resin contains a relatively large amount of color conversion material, and even in the case where film thickness control is required to ensure the proper amount of color conversion material, these requirements can be met with ease, and a high-quality light emitting device can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0157" num="0156">The light-transmissive member and the light emitting device according to embodiments of the present invention, and their methods of manufacture, will be described below in detail.</div>

The curing of the light-transmissive resin is accomplished by heating at 150° C. for 240 minutes in an oven. This forms a color conversion material layer <b>12</b>. This color conversion material layer <b>12</b> is substantially flush with the light reflective sheet <b>11</b>, with almost no depression in the center of the through-holes <b>11</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0161">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, the light reflective sheet <b>11</b>, including the color conversion material layer <b>12</b>, is cut in the lengthwise direction X of the light reflective sheet, which gives a light-transmissive member <b>100</b> in which five color conversion material layers <b>12</b> are arranged in a row as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0162">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, this member can also be cut in the direction Y, perpendicular to the lengthwise direction X, to form individual light-transmissive members <b>10</b> that each have one color conversion material layer <b>12</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. This individual light-transmissive member <b>10</b> is rectangular in top view, measuring 1.8×0.3 mm, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0163">The cutting here is performed with a dicer with a reduced amount of water usage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0164">In this light-transmissive member <b>1</b> the upper surfaces of the light reflective sheet and the color conversion material layer are flush, that is, there is no step between the two upper surfaces.

In the case where the upper surface and/or lower surfaces of the color conversion material layer is concave with respect to the upper surface and/or lower surface of the light reflective sheet, light convergence or other such effects can be exhibited. Also, in the case where the upper surfaces and/or lower surfaces of the color conversion material layers are convex with respect to the upper surface and/or lower surface of the light reflective sheet, an adhesion the light emitting elements being used can be improved. Furthermore, in the case where the shape is convex with respect to the upper surface of the light reflective sheet, light extraction efficiency can be enhanced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0167">In particular, in the case where the upper surfaces and/or lower surfaces of the color conversion material layers of the light-transmissive member have a curved surface, this is advantageous for use in light-transmissive members with a large surface area and a linear light source.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0208" num="0207">Then, the light reflective sheet <b>11</b> of the light-transmissive member <b>10</b> and the mounting substrate <b>50</b> may be divided by cutting with a dicer or the like between the light emitting elements <b>14</b>A to obtain light emitting devices including a single light emitting element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0209" num="0208">Accordingly, fixing the light-transmissive member after secondary mounting of the light emitting elements can avoid hysteresis of the resin curing and element mounting in the assembly step.
