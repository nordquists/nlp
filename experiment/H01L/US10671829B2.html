<heading id="h-0005">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure describes an electroluminescence display panel capable of displaying a superior image quality. The electroluminescence display panel includes an electroluminescence element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">In particular, an ultrasonic sensor is disposed under the rear surface of the electroluminescence display panel. The electroluminescence display panel may include an organic light emitting diode (OLED) and/or a quantum-dot light emitting diode (QLED).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">By placing a fingerprint sensor under the rear surface of an electroluminescence display panel, a fingerprint recognition function can be provided by touching a user finger on a display area or a cover glass on a display area through an electroluminescence display panel. Further, in such case, a width of the bezel of the display device including the electroluminescence display panel can be minimized, thereby maximizing the area of the electroluminescence display panel of the display device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Further, an ultrasonic signal can be used for recognizing a fingerprint through an electroluminescence display panel, and sensitivity of the ultrasonic signal may be reduced for various reasons. In addition, when the sensitivity of the ultrasonic signal reduced, the recognition success rate may be lowered, and the fingerprint recognition speed may be lowered, so that the user may experience a slow response speed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to perform fingerprint recognition through an electroluminescence display panel, the frequency of the ultrasonic signal of the fingerprint sensor may be at least 10 MHz and if the frequency of the ultrasonic signal is in such a high frequency band, the sensitivity of the ultrasonic signal can be reduced according to the density or the Young's Modulus of the respective elements, and/or thickness of the respective elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">An image quality of the electroluminescence display panel and/or the sensitivity of the fingerprint sensor may be degraded due to electromagnetic interference (EMI) generated between the fingerprint sensor and the electroluminescence display panel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">When the fingerprint sensor is attached to the electroluminescence display panel, the flatness of the substrate of the electroluminescence display panel may be deteriorated by the stress applied to the substrate of the electroluminescence display panel by the fingerprint sensor. Accordingly, a pressed mark of the electroluminescence display panel may be visible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">When the fingerprint sensor is disposed on the rear surface of the electroluminescence display panel, the light-shielding level at the rear surface of the electroluminescence display panel may vary according to the fingerprint sensor arrangement. Thus, the characteristics of the display panel may be varied accordingly. Therefore, a stain defect, for example, a shadow-mura may occur.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">When the fingerprint sensor is disposed on the rear surface of the electroluminescence display panel, the heat radiation characteristic of the rear surface of the electroluminescence display panel may vary according to the arrangement of the fingerprint sensor and an image retention may be generated in a displayed image due to the temperature deviation of the electroluminescence display panel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">Accordingly, it is an object of the present disclosure to provide a structure of a display device capable of improving above-mentioned problems, in which an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor disposed on the rear surface of an electroluminescence display panel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">Accordingly, an object of the present disclosure is to provide a structure of a display device capable of overcoming the above-mentioned problems and improving various problems that may degrade the image quality of the electroluminescence display panel, thereby improving the sensitivity of the ultrasonic sensor signal and improving the speed of fingerprint recognition.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">Hereinafter, various embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to accompanying drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a conceptual diagram schematically illustrating a display device capable of providing a fingerprint recognition function according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a display device <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present disclosure will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">The display device <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present disclosure may include an electroluminescence display panel <b>110</b> and a case supporting the electroluminescence display panel <b>110</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">Various components may be placed inside the case of the display device <b>100</b>. For example, speakers <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, a battery, a printed circuit board, an antenna, a sensor, and/or a camera may be disposed. However, the present disclosure is not limited thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">The electroluminescence display panel <b>110</b> is configured to include a fingerprint recognition area (FDA) configured to recognize or to detect a fingerprint of a finger that is touched when a user's finger touches a specific area of the electroluminescence display panel <b>110</b>. Accordingly, the display device <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present disclosure can recognize a fingerprint by inputting a touch to the electroluminescence display panel <b>110</b>. Thus, the fingerprint recognition area FDA may refer to a particular area of the electroluminescence display panel <b>110</b> configured to detect the fingerprint. According to the embodiments of the disclosure, the fingerprint recognition area FDA may be realized at one or a plurality of different positions of the electroluminescence display panel <b>110</b> as well as the area corresponding to the home button as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">In the case of ultrasonic waves, as the frequency increases, the degree of signal attenuation increases rapidly in low-density materials. Therefore, as the frequency increases, the density of the transmission and reception channel of the ultrasonic wave greatly affects the quality of the ultrasonic signal. To improve the quality of the ultrasonic signal, in one embodiment, the Young's modulus of the corresponding mediums between a user's finger and the fingerprint sensor <b>140</b> within the transmission and reception channel have matching acoustic impedance characteristics. When an ultrasonic signal is emitted toward stacked mediums with matching acoustic impedances, there is less ultrasonic signal reflection at the interface of different mediums compared to when the stacked mediums have mismatched acoustic impedances. That is, when the ultrasonic waves enter from one medium into another medium and the acoustic impedances between the two mediums match, a reflectance of the ultrasonic waves at a boundary between the mediums is reduced. Accordingly, a transmittance of the ultrasonic waves to a next medium is increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">In the case of an ultrasonic image for fingerprint recognition, the resolution of the ultrasonic image increases as the frequency increases.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">The thickness of the first adhesive member <b>150</b> of the display device <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present disclosure may be 5 μm to 15 μm. According to the thickness described above, it is possible to reduce the occurrence of bubbles or a foam while minimizing deterioration of the ultrasonic transmission/reception characteristics, and to provide a sufficient adhesive force. However, the present disclosure is not limited thereto. In other words, the adhesive member <b>150</b> may be a resin having a property of being defoamed, and the air bubbles may be removed in a cured state, so that the ultrasonic transmission/reception quality may not be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">The color of the first adhesive member <b>150</b> according to an embodiment of the present disclosure may be transparent or opaque.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">The first adhesive member <b>150</b> according to an embodiment of the present disclosure may be configured not to include a substance having a low density (e.g., low Young's modulus) such as bubbles or gas. For example, if the first adhesive member is a foam tape, since the foam tape contains a plurality of bubbles, the ultrasonic transmission and reception sensitivity can be rapidly lowered. Therefore, difficulties in fingerprint recognition may arise.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0136">In other words, the first adhesive member <b>150</b> may be a resin that removes air bubbles, which may interfere with the transmission and reception of ultrasonic waves, or does not contain air bubbles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">According to the first adhesive member <b>150</b> according to the embodiment of the present disclosure as described above, the gap between the fingerprint sensor <b>140</b> and the electroluminescence display panel <b>110</b> can be removed and the fingerprint sensor <b>140</b> and the electroluminescence display panel <b>110</b> can be adhered, thereby facilitating the ultrasonic transmission and reception.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0138">On the other hand, if one or both of the rear side of the substrate <b>112</b> and the surface of the fingerprint sensor <b>140</b> that are in contact with each other are implemented or treated with a material having sufficient self-adhesive force, and then the first adhesive member <b>150</b> may not be required.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0141">The electroluminescence display panel <b>110</b> according to an embodiment of the present disclosure may include a flexible substrate <b>112</b>, having a thickness of 3 μm to 30 μm, configured to transmit ultrasonic waves in a fingerprint recognition area FDA, a transistor TFT, on the flexible substrate <b>112</b>, configured to transmit ultrasonic waves in the fingerprint recognition area FDA, an electroluminescence element <b>122</b>, on the transistor TFT, configured to transmit ultrasonic waves in the fingerprint recognition area FDA, a first inorganic encapsulation layer <b>128</b>, on the electroluminescence element <b>122</b>, configured to transmit ultrasonic waves in the fingerprint recognition area FDA, an organic encapsulation layer <b>130</b>, on the first inorganic encapsulation layer <b>128</b>, having a thickness of 3 μm to 10 μm, configured to transmit ultrasonic waves in a fingerprint recognition area FDA, and a second inorganic encapsulation layer <b>132</b>, on the organic encapsulation layer <b>130</b>, configured to transmit ultrasonic waves in the fingerprint recognition area FDA.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0143" num="0142">The transmission and reception channel of the fingerprint sensor <b>140</b> of the display device <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present disclosure may be configured such that ultrasonic waves output from the fingerprint sensor <b>140</b> are reflected by a fingerprint of a user's finger.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0144" num="0143">For example, the substrate <b>112</b> may be formed of glass. As the glass substrate has high density or high Young's modulus value, it can be advantageous for ultrasonic transmission and reception. Further, since the rigidity is excellent even when the fingerprint sensor <b>140</b> is attached to the substrate <b>112</b>, the deformation of the substrate <b>112</b> can be minimized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0144">For example, a portion of the insulating layers of the electroluminescence display panel <b>110</b> may be made of an inorganic material. The inorganic material is relatively high in Young's modulus compared to the organic material and can be relatively thin in thickness compared to the organic material. Thus, the inorganic material may affect less influence to the ultrasonic transmission and reception than the organic material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0145">For example, a part of the insulating layer and a part of the encapsulation unit of the electroluminescence display panel <b>110</b> may be made of an organic material. The organic material has a relatively low Young's modulus as compared to an inorganic material. In addition, the organic material may have a planarizing property and may have a relatively thicker thickness than the inorganic material. In addition, the organic material can easily control its thickness. Thus, the organic material may have a greater effect on signal sensitivity to ultrasonic transmission and reception than the inorganic material. Accordingly, it is possible to control the sensitivity of the ultrasonic signal of the fingerprint sensor <b>140</b> by adjusting the thickness of the insulating layers made of the organic material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0147" num="0146">The thickness of the organic encapsulation layer <b>130</b> of the encapsulation unit (<b>128</b>, <b>130</b>, <b>132</b>) of the electroluminescence display panel <b>110</b> according to an embodiment of the present disclosure may be 3 μm to 10 μm. According to the thickness described above, at the same time, the organic encapsulation layer <b>130</b>, may compensate the foreign matter of the first inorganic encapsulation layer <b>128</b>, may planarize the second inorganic encapsulation layer <b>132</b>, and may perform as a transmission and reception channel of the ultrasonic wave for fingerprint recognition.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0150">In one embodiment, the fingerprint sensor <b>140</b> may operate in a fingerprint sensing mode and a proximity sensor mode.

In the proximity sensor mode, the fingerprint sensor <b>140</b> outputs a signal at a frequency that is less than the frequency of the fingerprint sensor mode. In the proximity sensor mode, the fingerprint sensor <b>140</b> may be used to determine whether the display device is next to a person's face.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0152" num="0151">In addition, a conventional electroluminescence display panel having a glass substrate generally implemented a frit-seal structure in which a glass portion is melted in a non-display area to form a sealed portion by sealing a non-display region.

However, since the frit-seal structure is filled with nitrogen gas above the cathode, there is a problem that the ultrasonic wave for fingerprint recognition is absorbed. Therefore, the embodiments of the present disclosure with the fingerprint sensor <b>140</b> may implement a sealing structure such as a face-seal structure, which is suitable for the fingerprint detection. However, the conventional frit-seal structure is not suitable for the fingerprint detection.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0158">The electroluminescence display panel <b>110</b> of the display device <b>200</b> according to another embodiment of the present disclosure may be configured to include a flexible substrate <b>112</b>, having a thickness of 3 μm to 30 μm, configured to transmit ultrasonic waves in a fingerprint recognition area FDA, a transistor TFT, on the flexible substrate <b>112</b>, configured to transmit ultrasonic waves in the fingerprint recognition area FDA, an electroluminescence element <b>122</b>, on the transistor TFT, configured to transmit ultrasonic waves in the fingerprint recognition area FDA, a first inorganic encapsulation layer <b>128</b>, on the electroluminescence element <b>122</b>, configured to transmit ultrasonic waves in the fingerprint recognition area FDA, an organic encapsulation layer <b>130</b>, on the first inorganic encapsulation layer <b>128</b>, having a thickness of 3 μm to 10 μm, configured to transmit ultrasonic waves in a fingerprint recognition area FDA, and a second inorganic encapsulation layer <b>132</b>, on the organic encapsulation layer <b>130</b>, configured to transmit ultrasonic waves in the fingerprint recognition area FDA. The substrate of the electroluminescence display panel <b>110</b> of the display device <b>200</b> according to another embodiment of the present disclosure may be formed of a material having a flexibility characteristic.

Since the fourth adhesive member <b>156</b> requires a Young's modulus capable of transmitting pressure to the pressure sensor <b>190</b>, the Young's modulus and the thickness of the first adhesive member <b>152</b> may be less restrictive than those of the first adhesive member <b>152</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0393" num="0392">As the Young's modulus of the fourth adhesive member <b>156</b> is low or the thickness is thicker, the pressure transfer characteristics may be reduced.
