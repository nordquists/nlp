<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2012-0100317, filed on Sep. 11, 2012 which is hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Field of Technology</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The embodiments herein relate to an organic light emitting display panel capable of improving luminous efficacy by efficiently extracting light generated in an organic light emitting layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Discussion of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, a variety of flat panel display devices having reduced weight and volume, which are drawbacks of cathode ray tubes (CRTs), have been introduced. Examples of flat panel display devices are liquid crystal displays (LCDs), field emission displays (FEDs), plasma display panels (PDPs), and organic electroluminescent displays (ELDs). Among these display devices, an organic electroluminescent display is a self-emitting device operable without a backlight. Owing to excellent characteristics such as slim design, light weight, simple manufacturing process, wide viewing angle, rapid response, and high contrast ratio, the organic electroluminescent display is spotlighted as a next generation flat panel display.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">In particular, an organic electroluminescent display device emits light using energy generated by transition of excitons, which are generated when holes injected from an anode and electrons injected from a cathode recombine in a light emitting layer, from an excited state to a ground state. All light beams generated in an organic light emitting layer of such an organic electroluminescent display device cannot reach the outside and most of the light beams are lost by total internal reflection. Since only about ¼ light beams generated in the organic light emitting layer reach the outside, the organic electroluminescent display device has low luminous efficacy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, there is still a need to develop various methods of improving luminous efficacy by efficiently extracting light generated in the organic light emitting layer.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY</heading>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating an organic light emitting display panel according to a first embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">The organic light emitting display panel illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes a thin film transistor, a light emitting cell connected to the thin film transistor, a capping layer <b>130</b> formed to protect the light emitting cell, and a front sealing layer <b>140</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">The thin film transistor includes a gate electrode <b>106</b>, a drain electrode <b>110</b> connected to a first electrode <b>122</b> of the light emitting cell, a source electrode <b>108</b> facing the drain electrode <b>110</b>, an active layer <b>114</b> overlapping the gate electrode <b>106</b> while interposing a gate insulating layer <b>112</b> therebetween to form a channel between the source electrode <b>108</b> and the drain electrode <b>110</b>, and an ohmic contact layer <b>116</b> formed on the active layer <b>114</b> except for the channel for ohmic contact with the source electrode <b>108</b> and the drain electrode <b>110</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">An inorganic passivation layer <b>118</b> formed of an inorganic insulating material and an organic passivation layer <b>128</b> formed of an organic insulating material are sequentially formed on the thin film transistor. The organic passivation layer <b>128</b> is formed to planarize the substrate <b>101</b> provided with the thin film transistor thereon. The inorganic passivation layer <b>118</b> is formed to improve stability of interfaces between the organic passivation layer <b>128</b> and each of the gate insulating layer <b>112</b> and the source and drain electrodes <b>108</b> and <b>110</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">The light emitting cell includes a first electrode <b>122</b> formed on the organic passivation layer <b>128</b>, an organic light emitting layer <b>124</b> including a light emitting layer and formed on the first electrode <b>122</b>, and a second electrode <b>126</b> formed on the organic light emitting layer <b>124</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">The organic light emitting layer <b>124</b> includes a hole-related layer, a light emitting layer, and an electron-related layer sequentially formed on the first electrode <b>122</b> or in reverse order. The organic light emitting layer <b>124</b> is formed in a bank hole <b>104</b> defined by a bank insulating layer <b>102</b> that partitions each luminescent region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">The first electrode <b>122</b> is electrically connected to the drain electrode <b>110</b> of the thin film transistor via a pixel contact hole <b>120</b> that penetrates the inorganic passivation layer <b>118</b> and the organic passivation layer <b>128</b>. The first electrode <b>122</b> has a structure formed by laminating an opaque conductive material such as aluminum (Al) and a transparent conductive material such as indium tin oxide (ITO). In this regard, the opaque conductive material contained in the first electrode <b>122</b> reflects light, which is generated in the organic light emitting layer <b>124</b> and proceeds toward the substrate <b>101</b>, toward the second electrode <b>126</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">The second electrode <b>126</b> is formed on the organic light emitting layer <b>124</b>. The second electrode <b>126</b> is formed of a transparent conductive material such as ITO. Thus, light generated in the organic light emitting layer <b>124</b> is emitted upward through the second electrode <b>126</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">The capping layer <b>130</b> induces maximum constructive interference between light beams generated in the organic light emitting layer <b>124</b> to efficiently emit light generated in the organic light emitting layer <b>124</b> to the outside. That is, the capping layer <b>130</b> reflects light beams, which has a predetermined intensity insufficient to pass through the capping layer <b>130</b> or less, among light beams generated in the organic light emitting layer <b>124</b>. Here, light beams that cannot pass through the capping layer <b>130</b> are reflected by an interface between the capping layer <b>130</b> and the lowest layer of the front sealing layer <b>140</b>. The light beams are repeatedly reflected by the interface due to resonance effects to cause constructive interference with other reflected light beams or light beams generated in the organic light emitting layer <b>124</b>. In this case, intensity of the light beams is increased, and the light beams may pass through the capping layer <b>130</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">In order to obtain such resonance effects, the capping layer <b>130</b> has a higher index of refraction than the lowest layer of the front sealing layer <b>140</b>. To this end, the capping layer <b>130</b> may have a single layer or multilayer structure formed of SiO<sub>2</sub>, SiN<sub>x</sub>, ZnS, LiF, PA, PI, TeO<sub>2</sub>, WO<sub>3</sub>, V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, Al<sub>x</sub>O<sub>x</sub>, ZnSe, triamine derivatives, arylene diamine derivatives, CBP, or tris(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminum (Alq3) complexes with a thickness of several to several hundreds of nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">The front sealing layer <b>140</b> blocks infiltration of moisture or oxygen, thereby improving reliability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">To this end, the front sealing layer <b>140</b> includes at least one inorganic barrier layer <b>142</b>, at least one organic barrier layer <b>144</b>, an adhesive film <b>146</b>, and a barrier film <b>148</b> sequentially stacked as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">The at least one inorganic barrier layer <b>142</b> is alternately formed with the organic barrier layer <b>144</b> at least once to primarily block infiltration of external moisture or oxygen. In this context, when referring to “an inorganic barrier layer (referred to as layer “A”) is alternately formed with an organic barrier layer (referred to as layer “B”), or “an inorganic barrier layer is alternately laminated on an organic barrier layer” it means that layer “A” and layer “A” are formed subsequently in a way of “A-B”, “A-B-A”, “A-B-A-B”, “A-B-A-B-A”, etc. The inorganic barrier layer <b>142</b> is formed of at least one selected from the group consisting of aluminum oxide (Al<sub>x</sub>O<sub>x</sub>), silicon oxide (SiO<sub>x</sub>), SiN<sub>x</sub>, SiON, and LiF.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">The organic barrier layer <b>144</b> secondarily blocks infiltration of external moisture or oxygen. In addition, the organic barrier layer <b>144</b> functions as a buffer layer that relieves stress between layers caused by bending of the organic light emitting display device and enhances planarization performance. The organic barrier layer <b>144</b> is formed of an acrylic resin, an epoxy resin, or polymers such as polyimide or polyethylene.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">The barrier film <b>148</b> is bonded to the substrate <b>101</b> provided with the thin film transistor and the light emitting cell via the adhesive film <b>146</b> formed on the bottom surface of the barrier film <b>148</b> to seal the light emitting cell.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">A plurality of thin films <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, and <b>148</b> contained in the front sealing layer <b>140</b> respectively have a thickness of several to several hundreds of μm which is greater than that of the capping layer <b>130</b> and do not have influence on resonance effects by interference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">In addition, among the plurality of thin films <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, and <b>148</b> contained in the front sealing layer <b>140</b>, the inorganic barrier layer <b>142</b> in contact with the capping layer <b>130</b> is formed to have a lower index of refraction than the capping layer <b>130</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">Particularly, the capping layer <b>130</b> is formed to have a high index of refraction of 1.3 to 3.1, and the inorganic barrier layer <b>142</b> constituting the lowest layer of the front sealing layer <b>140</b> is formed to have a low index of refraction of 1.2 to 3. For example, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the inorganic barrier layer <b>142</b> constituting the lowest layer of the front sealing layer <b>140</b>, formed of SiN<sub>x</sub>, and having a thickness of about 0.5 to 100 μm has an index of refraction of 1.8. The capping layer <b>130</b> adjacent to the inorganic barrier layer <b>142</b>, formed of an antimony-based compound, and having a thickness of about 20 to 200 nm has a index of refraction of 2.4, greater than that of the inorganic barrier layer <b>142</b> constituting the lowest layer of the front sealing layer <b>140</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">In addition, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the inorganic barrier layer <b>142</b> constituting the lowest layer of the front sealing layer <b>140</b>, formed of SiON, and having a thickness of about 0.5 to 100 μm has an index of refraction of 1.5. The capping layer <b>130</b> adjacent to the inorganic barrier layer <b>142</b>, formed of SiNx, and having a thickness of about 20 to 200 nm has an index of refraction of 1.8, greater than that of the inorganic barrier layer <b>142</b> that is the lowest layer of the front sealing layer <b>140</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">As described above, according to one embodiment, the inorganic barrier layer <b>142</b> constituting the lowest layer of the front sealing layer <b>140</b> may be formed of a material having a different index of refraction from that of a material used to form the capping layer <b>130</b> contacting the inorganic barrier layer <b>142</b>. Accordingly, the inorganic barrier layer <b>142</b> and the capping layer <b>130</b> may have different indexes of refraction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">Due to such index of refraction difference between the capping layer <b>130</b> and the inorganic barrier layer <b>142</b>, transflective characteristics may be obtained at an interface between the capping layer <b>130</b> and the inorganic barrier layer <b>142</b>. Interference caused by transflective characteristics may improve resonance effects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating an organic light emitting display panel according to a second embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">The organic light emitting display panel illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> has the same elements except that a resonance inducing layer <b>150</b> is further formed in comparison with the organic light emitting display panels illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> and thus a detailed description thereof will not be given.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">The resonance inducing layer <b>150</b> is formed of at least one selected from the group consisting of PA, PI, triamine derivatives, arylene diamine derivatives, CBP, tris(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminum (Alq3) complexes, SiN<sub>x</sub>, SiO<sub>x</sub>, SiON, and LiF between the capping layer <b>130</b> and the lowest inorganic barrier layer <b>142</b> disposed at the lowest layer of the plurality of thin films contained in the front sealing layer <b>140</b>. The resonance inducing layer <b>150</b> has a lower index of refraction than those of the capping layer <b>130</b> and the lowest inorganic barrier layer <b>142</b> disposed at both sides of the resonance inducing layer <b>150</b>. In this regard, the capping layer <b>130</b> and the lowest inorganic barrier layer <b>142</b> may have the same or different indexes of refraction. For example, the resonance inducing layer <b>150</b> may have an index of refraction of 1.2 to 3, and the lowest inorganic barrier layer <b>142</b> and the capping layer <b>130</b> may have indexes of refraction of 1.3 to 3.1. Particularly, for example, the capping layer <b>130</b> is formed of SiNx and has an index of refraction of 1.8, the lowest inorganic barrier layer <b>142</b> is formed of SiN<sub>x </sub>and has an index of refraction of 1.8, and the resonance inducing layer <b>150</b> is formed of SiON and has an index of refraction of 1.5.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">Accordingly, optical resonance occurs when light generated in the organic light emitting layer <b>124</b> is brought to the interface between the capping layer <b>130</b> having a high index of refraction and the resonance inducing layer <b>150</b> having a low index of refraction and the interface between the resonance inducing layer <b>150</b> having a low index of refraction and the lowest inorganic barrier layer <b>142</b> having a high index of refraction. Due to such optical resonance, light generated in the organic light emitting layer <b>124</b> is efficiently emitted to the outside, improving luminous efficacy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a graph and a table for describing efficiency of blue light of the organic light emitting display panel according to the second embodiment of and a conventional organic light emitting display panel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">In a conventional organic light emitting display panel, which does not include the resonance inducing layer <b>150</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, i.e., when the thickness of the resonance inducing layer <b>150</b> is 0 nm, there is no difference in index of refraction between the capping layer <b>130</b> and the lowest inorganic barrier layer <b>142</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Thus, interference caused by transflective characteristics does not occur at the interface between the capping layer <b>130</b> and the lowest inorganic barrier layer <b>142</b>. As a result, optical resonance does not occur.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">On the other hand, when the resonance inducing layer <b>150</b> is formed between the capping layer <b>130</b> and the lowest inorganic insulating layer <b>142</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, optical resonance occurs due to the difference in index of refraction between the capping layer <b>130</b> and the resonance inducing layer <b>150</b> at the interface between the capping layer <b>130</b> having a high index of refraction and the resonance inducing layer <b>150</b> having a low index of refraction by light generated in the organic light emitting layer <b>124</b>. In addition, optical resonance occurs due to the difference in index of refraction between the resonance inducing layer <b>150</b> and the lowest inorganic barrier layer <b>142</b> at the interface between the resonance inducing layer <b>150</b> having a low index of refraction and the lowest inorganic barrier layer <b>142</b> having a high index of refraction by light generated in the organic light emitting layer <b>124</b>. Due to such optical resonance, light generated in the organic light emitting layer <b>124</b> is efficiently emitted to the outside, thereby improving luminous efficacy. Particularly, when the resonance inducing layer <b>150</b> is formed of SiON to a thickness of about 60 to 80 nm, luminous efficacy of blue light may be improved by 8% to 9% compared to the conventional organic light emitting display panel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a graph and a table for describing color coordinate changes of organic light emitting display panels according to one embodiment and a conventional organic light emitting display panel with respect to thickness of a hole transport layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, when the index of refraction of the lowest inorganic barrier layer <b>142</b> is lower than that of the capping layer <b>130</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, a lower CIE-y coordinate value may be obtained when compared with a conventional organic light emitting display panel in which there is no index of refraction difference between the capping layer <b>130</b> and the lowest inorganic barrier layer <b>142</b>. In addition, when the resonance inducing layer <b>150</b> is disposed between the capping layer <b>130</b> and the lowest inorganic barrier layer <b>142</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a far lower CIE_y coordinate value may be obtained when compared to the structure in which the index of refraction of the lowest inorganic barrier layer is lower than that of the capping layer as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">Accordingly, when the hole transport layers (HTLs) of the organic light emitting display panel according to the embodiments herein and the conventional organic light emitting display panel have the same thickness, the CIE_y coordinate value is lower than that of the conventional organic light emitting display panel. Thus, color reproduction rate may be increased according to the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">Meanwhile, according to the embodiments herein, the light emitting cells may have different thicknesses of the capping layer and/or the resonance inducing layer to obtain maximum constructive interference in consideration of optical properties and wavelengths of red, green, and blue light which are respectively emitted by a red light emitting cell, a green light emitting cell, and a blue light emitting cell.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">As is apparent from the above description, the capping layer and the lowest layer of the front sealing layer that is in contact with the capping layer have different indexes of refraction. Due to such index of refraction difference between the capping layer and the lowest layer, optical resonance occurs at the interface therebetween by light generated in the organic light emitting layer. Thus, light generated in the organic light emitting layer is efficiently emitted to the outside, thereby improving luminous efficacy.</div>
