<heading id="h-0008">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">The electrical characteristics of a transistor including an oxide semiconductor layer are varied by influence of an insulating film in contact with the oxide semiconductor layer, that is, by an interface state between the oxide semiconductor layer and the insulating film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">For example, in the case where an insulating film containing silicon is used as the insulating film, when the oxide semiconductor layer is deposited on the silicon oxide film by a sputtering method, silicon might enter the oxide semiconductor layer at the time of the sputtering. In the structure of Non-Patent Document 1, an oxide semiconductor functioning as a channel is in contact with silicon oxide, and thus silicon, which is a constituent atom of the silicon oxide film, might enter the channel, as an impurity. When an impurity such as silicon enters the oxide semiconductor layer, the field-effect mobility of the transistor might decrease.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">Further, when a silicon nitride film is used as the insulating film, many carriers flow through the interface between the silicon nitride film and the oxide semiconductor layer, and thus it is difficult to obtain transistor characteristics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">An object of one embodiment of the present invention is to provide a structure of a transistor having high field-effect mobility.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">Thus, in order that an oxide semiconductor layer through which carriers flow is not in contact with a gate insulating film containing silicon, a buried channel structure in which the oxide semiconductor layer through which carriers flow is separated from the gate insulating film containing silicon is employed. Further, in the case where an oxide semiconductor layer is provided over a base insulating film and a gate insulating film is provided over the oxide semiconductor layer, in order that the oxide semiconductor layer through which carriers flow is not in contact with the base insulating film containing silicon, it is preferable to employ a buried channel structure in which the oxide semiconductor layer through which carriers flow is separated from the base insulating film containing silicon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">Specifically, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a first oxide semiconductor film <b>403</b> <i>a</i>, a second oxide semiconductor film <b>403</b> <i>b</i>, and a third oxide semiconductor film <b>403</b> <i>c </i>are stacked in this order, and the second oxide semiconductor film <b>403</b> <i>b </i>is made to an n-type in order that a conduction band offset (Ec) in an energy band diagram (schematic diagram) illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is greater than or equal to 0.05 eV and preferably greater than or equal to 0.1 eV. The energy band diagram in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is an energy band which corresponds to a portion between C and C′ in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. Note that the energy band diagram illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is mealy an example and thus does not limit the present invention. Any structure of the energy band diagram may be employed as long as the energy level of the bottom of the conduction band in a second oxide semiconductor layer S<b>2</b> is lower than those of the bottoms of the conduction band in a first oxide semiconductor layer S<b>1</b> and a third oxide semiconductor layer S<b>3</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">As a way to make the second oxide semiconductor layer S<b>2</b> an n-type, the second oxide semiconductor layer S<b>2</b> is deposited by a sputtering method in a mixed atmosphere containing nitrogen or dinitrogen monoxide. As another way to make the second oxide semiconductor layer S<b>2</b> an n-type, deposition is performed using a sputtering target containing a very small amount of boron or phosphorus so that the second oxide semiconductor layer S<b>2</b> contains boron or phosphorus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">As a material of the first oxide semiconductor layer S<b>1</b>, a material which can be represented as M1<sub>a</sub>M2<sub>b</sub>M3<sub>c</sub>O<sub>x </sub>(a is a real number greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 2, b is a real number greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5, c is a real number greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 5, and x is an arbitrary real number) is used. Ga, Mg, Hf, Al, Zr, Sn, or the like can be used as the constituent element M2 to function as a stabilizer for reducing the number of oxygen vacancies in an oxide semiconductor. As another stabilizer, one or plural kinds of lanthanoid such as lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce), praseodymium (Pr), neodymium (Nd), samarium (Sm), europium (Eu), gadolinium (Gd), terbium (Tb), dysprosium (Dy), holmium (Ho), erbium (Er), thulium (Tm), ytterbium (Yb), or lutetium (Lu) may be contained. As the constituent element M1, indium or the like is used. As the constituent element M3, zinc or the like is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">Typically, for the first oxide semiconductor layer S<b>1</b>, a gallium oxide film, a gallium zinc oxide film, or a material film in which the content of the constituent element M2 is higher than the content of the constituent element M1 is used. For example, an In—Ga—Zn-based oxide film which is deposited using a sputtering target having any of atomic ratios of In:Ga:Zn=1:3:2, In:Ga:Zn=1:4:2, and In:Ga:Zn=1:5:4 is used. In forming the first oxide semiconductor layer, deposition is preferably performed by a sputtering method in a mixed atmosphere containing more oxygen than a rare gas and more preferably in an oxygen atmosphere (oxygen: 100%), and the resulting oxide semiconductor layer can also be referred to as a first I-type oxide semiconductor layer. The first I-type oxide semiconductor layer is a highly purified oxide semiconductor layer that contains impurities other than the main components of the oxide semiconductor layer as little as possible and is an I-type (intrinsic) oxide semiconductor or close thereto. In such an oxide semiconductor layer, the Fermi level (Ef) can be at the same level as the intrinsic Fermi level (Ei).</div>

Ga, Mg, Hf, Al, Zr, Sn, or the like can be used as the constituent element M5 to function as a stabilizer for reducing the number of oxygen vacancies in an oxide semiconductor. As another stabilizer, one or plural kinds of lanthanoid such as lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce), praseodymium (Pr), neodymium (Nd), samarium (Sm), europium (Eu), gadolinium (Gd), terbium (Tb), dysprosium (Dy), holmium (Ho), erbium (Er), thulium (Tm), ytterbium (Yb), or lutetium (Lu) may be contained. As the constituent element M4, indium or the like is used. As the constituent element M6, zinc or the like is used. Typically, a material film in which the content of the constituent element M4 is higher than the content of the constituent element M5 is used. For example, an In—Ga—Zn-based oxide film which is deposited using a sputtering target having an atomic ratio of In:Ga:Zn=3:1:2 is used. In forming the second oxide semiconductor layer, deposition is preferably performed by a sputtering method in a mixed atmosphere containing nitrogen or a mixed atmosphere containing dinitrogen monoxide, and the resulting oxide semiconductor layer is also referred to as an N-type oxide semiconductor layer. Note that the N-type oxide semiconductor layer has higher carrier density and higher conductivity σ than the first I-type oxide semiconductor layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">For the third oxide semiconductor layer S<b>3</b>, a material which can be represented as M7<sub>g</sub>M8<sub>h</sub>M9<sub>i</sub>O<sub>x </sub>(g is a real number greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 2, h is a real number greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5, i is a real number greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 5, and x is an arbitrary real number) is used. Ga, Mg, Hf, Al, Zr, Sn, or the like can be used as the constituent element M8 to function as a stabilizer for reducing the number of oxygen vacancies in an oxide semiconductor. As another stabilizer, one or plural kinds of lanthanoid such as lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce), praseodymium (Pr), neodymium (Nd), samarium (Sm), europium (Eu), gadolinium (Gd), terbium (Tb), dysprosium (Dy), holmium (Ho), erbium (Er), thulium (Tm), ytterbium (Yb), or lutetium (Lu) may be contained. As the constituent element M7, indium or the like is used. As the constituent element M9, zinc or the like is used. Typically, a material film in which the content of the constituent element M7 is substantially equal to the content of the constituent element M8 is used. For example, an In—Ga—Zn-based oxide film which is deposited using a sputtering target having an atomic ratio of In:Ga:Zn=1:1:1 is used. In forming the third oxide semiconductor layer, deposition is preferably performed by a sputtering method in a mixed atmosphere containing more oxygen than a rare gas and preferably in an oxygen atmosphere (oxygen: 100%), and the resulting oxide semiconductor layer can also be referred to as a second I-type oxide semiconductor layer.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">Reduction of impurities in a gas to be introduced in the deposition chamber, i.e., a gas to be used in deposition, is also important for forming a dense film. Further, it is important to increase the proportion of oxygen contained in a deposition gas and optimize power. By increasing the proportion of oxygen (the upper limit: 100% oxygen) contained in the deposition gas and optimizing the power, plasma damage in deposition can be alleviated. Thus, a dense film is easily formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">Deposition of the oxide semiconductor film is preferably performed while a quadrupole mass analyzer (hereinafter also referred to as Q-mass) is operated continuously in order that the amount of moisture in the deposition chamber, or the like is monitored by the Q-mass before or in deposition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">The oxide semiconductor film is in a single crystal state, a polycrystalline (also referred to as polycrystal) state, an amorphous state, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">When the temperature of a deposition-target substrate, which is an example of deposition conditions, is set to be higher than or equal to 200° C., a dense oxide semiconductor film including a crystal part, i.e., a c-axis aligned crystalline oxide semiconductor (CAAC-OS) film can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">First, the CAAC-OS film is described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">The CAAC-OS film is one of oxide semiconductor films including a plurality of crystal parts, and most of each crystal part fits inside a cube whose one side is less than 100 nm. Thus, there is a case where a crystal part included in the CAAC-OS film fits a cube whose one side is less than 10 nm, less than 5 nm, or less than 3 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">In a transmission electron microscope (TEM) image of the CAAC-OS film, a boundary between crystal parts, that is, a grain boundary is not clearly observed. Thus, in the CAAC-OS film, a reduction in electron mobility due to the grain boundary is less likely to occur.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">According to the TEM image of the crystal parts included in the CAAC-OS film observed in a direction substantially parallel to a sample surface (cross-sectional TEM image), metal atoms are arranged in a layered manner in the crystal parts. Each metal atom layer has a morphology reflected by a surface over which the CAAC-OS film is formed (hereinafter, a surface over which the CAAC-OS film is formed is referred to as a formation surface) or a top surface of the CAAC-OS film, and is arranged in parallel to the formation surface or the top surface of the CAAC-OS film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">On the other hand, according to the TEM image of the CAAC-OS film observed in a direction substantially perpendicular to the sample surface (plan TEM image), metal atoms are arranged in a triangular or hexagonal configuration in the crystal parts. However, there is no regularity of arrangement of metal atoms between different crystal parts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">From the results of the cross-sectional TEM image and the plan TEM image, alignment is found in the crystal parts in the CAAC-OS film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">A CAAC-OS film is subjected to structural analysis with an X-ray diffraction (XRD) apparatus. For example, when the CAAC-OS film including an InGaZnO<sub>4 </sub>crystal is analyzed by an out-of-plane method, a peak appears frequently when the diffraction angle (2θ) is around 31°. This peak is derived from the (009) plane of the InGaZnO<sub>4 </sub>crystal, which indicates that crystals in the CAAC-OS film have c-axis alignment, and that the c-axes are aligned in a direction substantially perpendicular to the formation surface or the top surface of the CAAC-OS film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">On the other hand, when the CAAC-OS film is analyzed by an in-plane method in which an X-ray enters a sample in a direction perpendicular to the c-axis, a peak appears frequently when 2θ is around 56°. This peak is derived from the (110) plane of the InGaZnO<sub>4 </sub>crystal. Here, analysis (ϕ scan) is performed under conditions where the sample is rotated around a normal vector of a sample surface as an axis (ϕ axis) with 2θ fixed at around 56°. In the case where the sample is a single-crystal oxide semiconductor film of InGaZnO<sub>4</sub>, six peaks appear. The six peaks are derived from crystal planes equivalent to the (110) plane. On the other hand, in the case of a CAAC-OS film, a peak is not clearly observed even when ϕ scan is performed with 2θ fixed at around 56°.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">According to the above results, in the CAAC-OS film having c-axis alignment, while the directions of a-axes and b-axes are different between crystal parts, the c-axes are aligned in a direction parallel to a normal vector of a formation surface or a normal vector of a top surface. Thus, each metal atom layer arranged in a layered manner observed in the cross-sectional TEM image corresponds to a plane parallel to the a-b plane of the crystal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">Note that the crystal part is formed concurrently with deposition of the CAAC-OS film or is formed through crystallization treatment such as heat treatment. As described above, the c-axis of the crystal is aligned in a direction parallel to a normal vector of a formation surface or a normal vector of a top surface of the CAAC-OS film. Thus, for example, in the case where a shape of the CAAC-OS film is changed by etching or the like, the c-axis might not be necessarily parallel to a normal vector of a formation surface or a normal vector of a top surface of the CAAC-OS film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">In this specification, a term “parallel” indicates that the angle formed between two straight lines is greater than or equal to −10° and less than or equal to 10°, and accordingly also includes the case where the angle is greater than or equal to −5° and less than or equal to 5°. In addition, a term “perpendicular” indicates that the angle formed between two straight lines is greater than or equal to 80° and less than or equal to 100°, and accordingly includes the case where the angle is greater than or equal to 85° and less than or equal to 95°.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">Further, the degree of crystallinity in the CAAC-OS film is not necessarily uniform. For example, in the case where crystal growth leading to the CAAC-OS film occurs from the vicinity of the top surface of the film, the degree of the crystallinity in the vicinity of the top surface is higher than that in the vicinity of the formation surface in some cases. Further, when an impurity is added to the CAAC-OS film, the crystallinity in a region to which the impurity is added is changed, and the degree of crystallinity in the CAAC-OS film varies depends on regions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">Note that when the CAAC-OS film with an InGaZnO<sub>4 </sub>crystal is analyzed by an out-of-plane method, a peak of 2θ may also be observed at around 36°, in addition to the peak of 2θ at around 31°. The peak of 2θ at around 36° is derived from the (311) plane of a ZnGa<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>crystal; such a peak indicates that a ZnGa<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>crystal is included in part of the CAAC-OS film including the InGaZnO<sub>4 </sub>crystal. It is preferable that in the CAAC-OS film, a peak of 2θ appear at around 31° and a peak of 2θ do not appear at around 36°.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">The CAAC-OS film is an oxide semiconductor film having a low impurity concentration. The impurity is any of elements which are not the main components of the oxide semiconductor film and includes hydrogen, carbon, silicon, a transition metal element, and the like. In particular, an element (e.g., silicon) which has higher bonding strength with oxygen than a metal element included in the oxide semiconductor film causes disorder of atomic arrangement in the oxide semiconductor film because the element deprives the oxide semiconductor film of oxygen, thereby reducing crystallinity. Further, a heavy metal such as iron or nickel, argon, carbon dioxide, and the like have a large atomic radius (or molecular radius); therefore, when any of such elements is contained in the oxide semiconductor film, the element causes disorder of the atomic arrangement of the oxide semiconductor film, thereby reducing crystallinity. Note that the impurity contained in the oxide semiconductor film might become a carrier trap or a source of carriers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">The CAAC-OS film is an oxide semiconductor film having a low density of defect states. For example, oxygen vacancies in the oxide semiconductor film serve as carrier traps or serve as carrier generation sources when hydrogen is captured therein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">The state in which impurity concentration is low and density of defect states is low (the number of oxygen vacancies is small) is referred to as “highly purified intrinsic” or “substantially highly purified intrinsic”. A highly purified intrinsic or substantially highly purified intrinsic oxide semiconductor film has few carrier generation sources, and thus has a low carrier density in some cases. Thus, in some cases, a transistor including the oxide semiconductor film in a channel formation region rarely has a negative threshold voltage (is rarely normally-on). A highly purified intrinsic or substantially highly purified intrinsic oxide semiconductor film has few carrier traps. Accordingly, the transistor including the oxide semiconductor film has little variation in electrical characteristics and high reliability. A charge trapped by the carrier traps in the oxide semiconductor film takes a long time to be released. The trapped charge may behave like a fixed charge. Thus, the transistor including the oxide semiconductor film with a high impurity concentration and a high density of defect states has unstable electrical characteristics in some cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">Since the c-axes of the crystal parts included in the CAAC-OS film are aligned in the direction parallel to a normal vector of a surface where the CAAC-OS film is formed or a normal vector of a surface of the CAAC-OS film, the directions of the c-axes may be different from each other depending on the shape of the CAAC-OS film (the cross-sectional shape of the surface where the CAAC-OS film is formed or the cross-sectional shape of the surface of the CAAC-OS film). Note that when the CAAC-OS film is formed, the direction of c-axis of the crystal part is the direction parallel to a normal vector of the surface where the CAAC-OS film is formed or a normal vector of the surface of the CAAC-OS film. The crystal part is formed by deposition using a sputtering target or by performing treatment for crystallization such as heat treatment after deposition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">During deposition, fine sputtering particles fly from a sputtering target, and a film is formed so that the sputtering particles adhere onto the deposition-target substrate. When the temperature of the substrate is higher than or equal to 200° C., the sputtering particles are rearranged because the substrate is heated. Thus, a dense film is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">A phenomenon in the deposition is described in detail using <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A to 12C</figref>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</figref>, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A to 14C</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">When ions collide with the surface of the sputtering target, the crystal region included in the sputtering target is cleaved along an a-b plane, and sputtered particles whose top and bottom surfaces are each aligned with a layer parallel to the a-b plane (flat-plate-like sputtered particle or pellet-like sputtered particle) are separated from the sputtering target. Assuming that the crystalline particle which is sputtered from a surface of a sputtering target <b>2002</b> and released has c-axis alignment and is a flat-plate-like sputtered particle <b>2001</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, a schematic model diagram in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> can be obtained. The flat-plate-like sputtered particle is preferably in a state illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref>, i.e., is preferably the one with an outermost surface of a (Ga or Zn)O plane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">When the oxygen flow rate is high and the pressure in a chamber <b>2003</b> is high during deposition, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>, oxygen ions are attached onto the flat-plate-like sputtered particle and the sputtered particle can have a large amount of oxygen on its surface. Another flat-plate-like sputtered particle is stacked thereover before the attached oxygen is released; therefore, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref>, a large amount of oxygen can be contained in the film. The oxygen adsorbed on the surface contributes to a reduction in the number of oxygen vacancies in the oxide semiconductor film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">To form an oxide semiconductor film having a crystalline region with c-axis alignment, it is preferable to increase the substrate temperature at the deposition. However, when the substrate temperature is higher than 350° C., the oxygen adsorbed on the surface might be released as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>. Therefore, when the substrate temperature is set to higher than or equal to 150° C. and lower than or equal to 350° C. and preferably higher than or equal to 160° C. and lower than or equal to 230° C. and only an oxygen gas is used as a deposition gas, an oxide semiconductor film having a crystalline region with c-axis alignment, i.e., a CAAC-OS film, can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref> is a model of a process in the deposition, in which one flat-plate-like sputtered particle reaches a surface of a substrate <b>2000</b> to be stabilized. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>, the flat-plate-like sputtered particle reaches the substrate surface while keeping its crystalline state, whereby formation of a CAAC-OS film is facilitated. Further, when flat-plate-like sputtered particles are stacked as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>, formation of a CAAC-OS film is facilitated. Note that the CAAC-OS film is a film which contains a large amount of oxygen and has a reduced number of oxygen vacancies as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">In the CAAC-OS film over the substrate <b>2000</b>, a series of about 2 to 20 indium atoms exist in a lateral direction to form a layer including indium atoms. Note that in some cases, the layer has a series of 20 or more indium atoms; for example, the layer may have a series of 2 to 50 indium atoms, 2 to 100 indium atoms, or 2 to 500 indium atoms in a lateral direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">Layers including indium atoms overlap with each other. The number of layers is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 20, greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10, or greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 4.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">As described above, a stack of the layers including indium atoms often appears to be a cluster including several indium atoms in a lateral direction and several layers in a longitudinal direction. This is because each of the sputtering particles has a flat-plate-like shape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">By increasing the temperature of the deposition-target substrate, migration of sputtering particles is likely to occur on a substrate surface. With this effect, a flat-plate-like sputtered particle reaches the substrate surface, moves slightly, and then is attached to the substrate surface with a flat plane (a-b plane) of the sputtered particle facing toward the substrate surface. Therefore, an oxide semiconductor film having a crystal region which is c-axis-aligned perpendicularly to the surface of the oxide semiconductor film is easily formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">Further, heat treatment at a temperature of higher than or equal to 200° C. may be performed after the deposition of the oxide semiconductor film, so that a denser film is obtained. However, in that case, oxygen vacancies might be generated when impurity elements (e.g., hydrogen and water) in the oxide semiconductor film are reduced. Therefore, before the heat treatment is performed, an insulating layer containing excess oxygen is preferably provided over or below the oxide semiconductor film, in which case oxygen vacancies in the oxide semiconductor film can be reduced by the heat treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">An oxide semiconductor film shortly after deposition is made dense; thus, a dense film which is thin and close to single crystal can be obtained. Since oxygen, hydrogen, or the like hardly diffuses within the film, a semiconductor device including a dense oxide semiconductor film can achieve improvement in reliability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">It is preferable that a CAAC-OS film be used for at least the second oxide semiconductor layer and the channel formation region overlapping with the gate electrode layer be formed with the CAAC-OS film. In the case where a CAAC-OS film is used for the first oxide semiconductor layer, since the first oxide semiconductor layer has the same crystal structure as the second oxide semiconductor layer, the number of levels can be small at the interface thereof, so that high field-effect mobility can be achieved. Further, it is preferable that the second oxide semiconductor layer be formed on and in contact with the first oxide semiconductor layer that is a CAAC-OS film because the second oxide semiconductor layer formed over the first oxide semiconductor layer is easily crystallized using the first oxide semiconductor layer as a crystal seed, so that the first and second oxide semiconductor layers can have the same crystal structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">A transistor having high field-effect mobility can be obtained.</div>

<heading id="h-0010">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. However, the present invention is not limited to the description below, and it is easily understood by those skilled in the art that modes and details disclosed herein can be modified in various ways without departing from the spirit and the scope of the present invention. Therefore, the present invention is not construed as being limited to description of the embodiments.</div>
<heading id="h-0011">Embodiment 1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">In this embodiment, one embodiment of a semiconductor device and one embodiment of a method for manufacturing the semiconductor device will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2D</figref>. In this embodiment, an example of a method for manufacturing a transistor including an oxide semiconductor film is described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">First, an insulating film <b>433</b> is formed over a substrate <b>400</b> having an insulating surface and a conductive film is formed thereover by a sputtering method, an evaporation method, or the like. The conductive film is etched so that a conductive layer <b>491</b> and wiring layers <b>434</b> and <b>436</b> are formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">There is no particular limitation on a substrate that can be used as the substrate <b>400</b> having an insulating surface as long as it has heat resistance enough to withstand heat treatment performed later. For example, a glass substrate of barium borosilicate glass, aluminoborosilicate glass, or the like, a ceramic substrate, a quartz substrate, or a sapphire substrate can be used. A single crystal semiconductor substrate or a polycrystalline semiconductor substrate of silicon, silicon carbide, or the like; a compound semiconductor substrate of silicon germanium or the like; an SOI substrate; or the like can be used as the substrate <b>400</b>, or the substrate provided with a semiconductor element can be used as the substrate <b>400</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">For example, the insulating film <b>433</b> can be formed using one or more insulating films selected from the following: an oxide insulating film of silicon oxide, gallium oxide, hafnium oxide, yttrium oxide, aluminum oxide, or the like; a nitride insulating film of silicon nitride, aluminum nitride, or the like; an oxynitride insulating film of silicon oxynitride, aluminum oxynitride, or the like; or a nitride oxide insulating film of silicon nitride oxide or the like. Note that “silicon nitride oxide” refers to the one that contains more nitrogen than oxygen and “silicon oxynitride” refers to the one that contains more oxygen than nitrogen. Here, for example, silicon oxynitride refers to the one that contains oxygen, nitrogen, and silicon at concentrations ranging from 50 atomic % to 70 atomic %, 0.5 atomic % to 15 atomic %, and 25 atomic % to 35 atomic %, respectively. In the case where a substrate which is provided with a semiconductor element is used, a silicon nitride film which is deposited by a plasma chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method using a mixed gas of silane (SiH<sub>4</sub>) and nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) as a supply gas is preferably used as the insulating film <b>433</b>. This silicon nitride film also functions as a barrier film and prevents hydrogen or a hydrogen compound from entering an oxide semiconductor layer to be formed later, thereby improving the reliability of the semiconductor device. A silicon nitride film deposited by a plasma CVD method using a mixed gas of silane (SiH<sub>4</sub>), nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>), and ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) as a supply gas includes fewer defects than the silicon nitride film deposited using a mixed gas of silane (SiH<sub>4</sub>) and nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) as a supply gas. When the silicon nitride film deposited using a mixed gas of silane (SiH<sub>4</sub>), nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>), and ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) is formed to a thickness greater than or equal to 300 nm and less than or equal to 400 nm, an ESD resistance can be 300 V or higher. Therefore, when a stack in which a silicon nitride film which is deposited using a mixed gas of silane (SiH<sub>4</sub>) and nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) as a supply gas is stacked over the silicon nitride film which is deposited to a thickness greater than or equal to 300 nm and less than or equal to 400 nm using a mixed gas of silane (SiH<sub>4</sub>), nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>), and ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) is used as the insulating film <b>433</b>, a barrier film having a high ESD resistance can be achieved.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0195" num="0194">The semiconductor device having the circuit configuration in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> utilizes a characteristic in which the potential of the gate electrode layer of the transistor <b>160</b> can be held, and thus enables data writing, holding, and reading as follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0196" num="0195">Writing and holding of data are described. First, the potential of the fourth wiring is set to a potential at which the transistor <b>162</b> is turned on, so that the transistor <b>162</b> is turned on. Accordingly, the potential of the third wiring is supplied to the gate electrode layer of the transistor <b>160</b> and to the capacitor <b>164</b>. That is, predetermined charge is supplied to the gate electrode layer of the transistor <b>160</b> (writing). Here, charge for supply of a potential level or charge for supply of a different potential level (hereinafter referred to as a low-level charge and a high-level charge) is given. After that, the potential of the fourth wiring is set to a potential at which the transistor <b>162</b> is turned off, so that the transistor <b>162</b> is turned off. Thus, the charge given to the gate electrode layer of the transistor <b>160</b> is held (holding).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0197" num="0196">Since the off-state current of the transistor <b>162</b> is extremely small, the charge of the gate electrode layer of the transistor <b>160</b> is held for a long time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0198" num="0197">Next, reading of data is described. By supplying an appropriate potential (a reading potential) to the fifth wiring while a predetermined potential (a constant potential) is supplied to the first wiring, the potential of the second wiring varies depending on the amount of charge held in the gate electrode layer of the transistor <b>160</b>. This is because in general, when the transistor <b>160</b> is an re-channel transistor, an apparent threshold voltage V<sub>th_H </sub>in the case where the high-level charge is given to the gate electrode layer of the transistor <b>160</b> is lower than an apparent threshold voltage V<sub>th_L </sub>in the case where the low-level charge is given to the gate electrode layer of the transistor <b>160</b>. Here, an apparent threshold voltage refers to the potential of the fifth wiring, which is needed to turn on the transistor <b>160</b>. Thus, the potential of the fifth wiring is set to a potential V<sub>0 </sub>which is between V<sub>th_H </sub>and V<sub>th_L</sub>, whereby charge given to the gate electrode layer of the transistor <b>160</b> can be determined. For example, in the case where the high-level charge is given in writing, when the potential of the fifth wiring is set to V<sub>0 </sub>(&gt;V<sub>th_H</sub>), the transistor <b>160</b> is turned on. In the case where a low-level charge is given in writing, even when the potential of the fifth wiring is set to V<sub>0 </sub>(&lt;V<sub>th_L</sub>), the transistor <b>160</b> remains in an off state. Therefore, the stored data can be read by the potential of the second wiring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0199" num="0198">Note that in the case where memory cells are arrayed to be used, only data of desired memory cells needs to be read. In the case where such reading is not performed, a potential at which the transistor <b>160</b> is turned off regardless of the state of the gate electrode layer of the transistor <b>160</b>, that is, a potential smaller than V<sub>th_H </sub>may be given to the fifth wiring. Alternatively, a potential at which the transistor <b>160</b> is turned on regardless of the state of the gate electrode layer, that is, a potential higher than V<sub>th_L </sub>may be given to the fifth wiring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0200" num="0199"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates another example of one embodiment of the structure of the storage device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0201" num="0200"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a perspective view of a storage device.

The memory cell <b>3170</b> <i>a </i>and the memory cell <b>3170</b> <i>b </i>can have a configuration similar to the circuit configuration described in this embodiment with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0203" num="0202">A transistor in which a channel formation region is formed in an oxide semiconductor film is used as each transistor included in the memory cells <b>3170</b> <i>a </i>and <b>3170</b> <i>b</i>. The structure of the transistor in which the channel formation region is formed in the oxide semiconductor film is the same as the structure described in Embodiment 1; thus, the description of the structure is omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0204" num="0203">The logic circuit <b>3004</b> includes a transistor in which a semiconductor material other than an oxide semiconductor is used as a channel formation region. For example, the transistor can be a transistor obtained in such a manner that an element isolation insulating layer is provided on a substrate including a semiconductor material (e.g., silicon) and a region serving as the channel formation region is formed in a region surrounded by the element isolation insulating layer. Note that the transistor may be a transistor obtained in such a manner that the channel formation region is formed in a semiconductor film such as a polycrystalline silicon film formed on an insulating surface or in a silicon film of an SOI substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0205" num="0204">The memory cell arrays <b>3400</b>(<b>1</b>) to <b>3400</b>(<i>n</i>) and the logic circuit <b>3004</b> are stacked with interlayer insulating layers provided therebetween, and electrical connection or the like may be established as appropriate by an electrode or a wiring penetrating the interlayer insulating layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0206" num="0205">When a transistor having a channel formation region formed using an oxide semiconductor and having extremely small off-state current is applied to the semiconductor device in this embodiment, the semiconductor device can store data for an extremely long period. In other words, power consumption can be adequately reduced because refresh operation becomes unnecessary or the frequency of refresh operation can be extremely low. Moreover, stored data can be held for a long period even when power is not supplied (note that a potential is preferably fixed).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0207" num="0206">Further, in the semiconductor device described in this embodiment, high voltage is not needed for writing data and there is no problem of deterioration of elements. For example, unlike a conventional non-volatile memory, it is not necessary to inject and extract electrons into and from a floating gate; thus, the problem of deterioration of a gate insulating film does not occur. In other words, the semiconductor device according to one embodiment of the present invention does not have a limit on the number of times of writing which is a problem in a conventional nonvolatile memory, and reliability thereof is drastically improved. Furthermore, data is written depending on the on state and the off state of the transistor, whereby high-speed operation can be easily realized.</div>
