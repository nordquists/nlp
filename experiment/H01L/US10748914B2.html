<heading id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments disclosed herein pertain to ferroelectric capacitors, to ferroelectric field effect transistors, and to methods used in forming an electronic component comprising conductive material and ferroelectric material.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Memory is one type of integrated circuitry, and is used in computer systems for storing data. Memory may be fabricated in one or more arrays of individual memory cells. Memory cells may be written to, or read from, using digit lines (which may also be referred to as bit lines, data lines, sense lines, or data/sense lines) and access lines (which may also be referred to as word lines). The digit lines may conductively interconnect memory cells along columns of the array, and the access lines may conductively interconnect memory cells along rows of the array. Each memory cell may be uniquely addressed through the combination of a digit line and an access line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Memory cells may be volatile or non-volatile. Non-volatile memory cells can store data for extended periods of time including when the computer is turned off. Volatile memory dissipates and therefore requires being refreshed/rewritten, in many instances multiple times per second. Regardless, memory cells are configured to retain or store memory in at least two different selectable states. In a binary system, the states are considered as either a “0” or a “1”. In other systems, at least some individual memory cells may be configured to store more than two levels or states of information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">A capacitor is one type of electronic component that may be used in a memory cell. A capacitor has two electrical conductors separated by electrically insulating material. Energy as an electric field may be electrostatically stored within such material. One type of capacitor is a ferroelectric capacitor which has ferroelectric material as at least part of the insulating material. Ferroelectric materials are characterized by having two stable polarized states and thereby can comprise programmable material of a memory cell. The polarization state of the ferroelectric material can be changed by application of suitable programming voltages, and remains after removal of the programming voltage (at least for a time). Each polarization state has a different charge-stored capacitance from the other, and which ideally can be used to write (i.e., store) and read a memory state without reversing the polarization state until such is desired to be reversed. Less desirable, in some memory having ferroelectric capacitors the act of reading the memory state can reverse the polarization. Accordingly, upon determining the polarization state, a re-write of the memory cell is conducted to put the memory cell into the pre-read state immediately after its determination. Regardless, a memory cell incorporating a ferroelectric capacitor ideally is non-volatile due to the bi-stable characteristics of the ferroelectric material that forms a part of the capacitor. One type of memory cell has a select device electrically coupled in series with a ferroelectric capacitor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">A field effect transistor is another type of electronic component that may be used in a memory cell. These transistors comprise a pair of conductive source/drain regions having a semiconductive channel region there-between. A conductive gate is adjacent the channel region and separated there-from by a thin gate insulator material. Application of a suitable voltage to the gate allows current to flow from one of the source/drain regions to the other through the channel region. When the voltage is removed from the gate, current is largely prevented from flowing through the channel region. Field effect transistors may also include additional structure, for example reversibly programmable charge storage regions as part of the gate construction. Transistors other than field effect transistors, for example bipolar transistors, may additionally or alternately be used in memory cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">One type of transistor is a ferroelectric field effect transistor (FeFET) wherein at least some portion of the gate construction comprises ferroelectric material. Again, such materials are characterized by two stable polarized states. These different states in field effect transistors may be characterized by different threshold voltage (V<sub>t</sub>) for the transistor or by different channel conductivity for a selected operating voltage. Polarization state of the ferroelectric material can be changed by application of suitable programming voltages, and which results in one of high channel conductance or low channel conductance. The high and low conductance, invoked by the ferroelectric polarization state, remains after removal of the programming gate voltage (at least for a time). The status of the channel conductance can be read by applying a small drain voltage which does not disturb the ferroelectric polarization.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Capacitors and transistors may be used in circuitry other than memory circuitry.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">Embodiments of the invention encompass a method used in forming an electronic component that comprises conductive material and ferroelectric material. Embodiments of the invention also encompass a ferroelectric capacitor independent of method of manufacture. Embodiments of the invention also encompass a ferroelectric field effect transistor independent of method of manufacture.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, method embodiments will be initially described with respect to an example substrate fragment <b>10</b> comprising a base substrate <b>12</b>, and which may comprise a semiconductor substrate. In the context of this document, the term “semiconductor substrate” or “semiconductive substrate” is defined to mean any construction comprising semiconductive material, including, but not limited to, bulk semiconductive materials such as a semiconductive wafer (either alone or in assemblies comprising other materials thereon), and semiconductive material layers (either alone or in assemblies comprising other materials). The term “substrate” refers to any supporting structure, including, but not limited to, the semiconductive substrates described above. Materials may be aside, elevationally inward, or elevationally outward of the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>-depicted materials. For example, other partially or wholly fabricated components of integrated circuitry may be provided somewhere about or within fragment <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">Substrate <b>12</b> may comprise any one or more of conductive/conductor (i.e., electrically herein), semiconductive, or insulative/insulator (i.e., electrically herein) materials. In the context of this document, a conductor/conductive material has compositional intrinsic electrical conductivity of at least 3×10<sup>4 </sup>Siemens/cm (i.e., at 20° C. everywhere herein) as opposed to electrical conductivity that could occur by movement of positive or negative charges through a thin material that is otherwise intrinsically insulative. An insulator/insulative material has compositional intrinsic electrical conductivity of no greater than 1×10<sup>−9 </sup>Siemens/cm (i.e., it is electrically resistive as opposed to being conductive or semiconductive). Any of the materials, regions, and structures described herein may be homogenous or non-homogenous, and regardless may be continuous or discontinuous over any material which such overlie. Further, unless otherwise stated, each material may be formed using any suitable or yet-to-be developed technique, with atomic layer deposition, chemical vapor deposition, physical vapor deposition, epitaxial growth, diffusion doping, and ion implanting being examples.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">A non-ferroelectric metal oxide-comprising insulator material <b>14</b> has been formed over substrate <b>12</b>. Any suitable existing or yet-to-be-developed non-ferroelectric metal oxide-comprising insulator material may be used. In one embodiment, the non-ferroelectric insulator material comprises one or more of transition metal oxide, zirconium, zirconium oxide, hafnium, hafnium oxide, lead zirconium titanate, tantalum oxide, strontium oxide, strontium titanium oxide, titanium oxide, and barium strontium titanate, and which may have dopant therein which comprises one or more of silicon, aluminum, lanthanum, yttrium, erbium, calcium, magnesium, strontium, lutetium, dysprosium, gadolinium, praseodymium, chromium, niobium, tantalum, hafnium, zirconium, vanadium manganese, cobalt, nickel, carbon and any other rare earth element. One particular example includes a hafnium and zirconium based oxide having suitable dopant therein. Other examples include a hafnium and silicon based oxide having suitable dopant therein; a yttrium and zirconium based oxide having suitable dopant therein; and a hafnium, silicon, and zirconium based oxide. Insulator material <b>14</b> may be deposited in any phase (e.g., amorphous or crystalline) and which phase may remain or change during subsequent processing. By way of examples, any of the non-ferroelectric metal oxide-comprising insulator materials described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,709,359 to Boeske et al. and/or 8,304,823 to Boeske may be used, and such references are herein incorporated by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">An example thickness for insulator material <b>14</b> is from about 10 Angstroms to about 200 Angstroms, and in one embodiment from about 30 Angstroms to about 90 Angstroms. In this document, “thickness” by itself (no preceding directional adjective) is defined as the mean straight-line distance through a given material or region perpendicularly from a closest surface of an immediately adjacent material of different composition or of an immediately adjacent region. Additionally, the various materials and regions described herein may be of substantially constant thickness or of variable thickness. If of variable thickness, thickness refers to average thickness unless otherwise indicated, and such material or region will have some minimum thickness and some maximum thickness due to the thickness being variable. As used herein, “different composition” only requires those portions of two stated materials or regions that may be directly against one another to be chemically and/or physically different, for example if such materials or regions are not homogenous. If the two stated materials or regions are not directly against one another, “different composition” only requires that those portions of the two stated materials or regions that are closest to one another be chemically and/or physically different if such materials or regions are not homogenous. In this document, a material, region, or structure is “directly against” another when there is at least some physically touching contact of the stated materials, regions, or structures relative one another. In contrast, “over”, “on”, “adjacent”, “along”, and “against” not preceded by “directly” encompass “directly against” as well as construction where intervening material(s), region(s), or structure(s) result(s) in no physical touching contact of the stated materials, regions, or structures relative one another.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a composite stack <b>16</b> comprising at least two different composition non-ferroelectric metal oxides has been formed over substrate <b>12</b>, and in one embodiment as shown over metal oxide-comprising insulator material <b>14</b>. In the context of this document, “composite stack” means a construction comprising multiple layers wherein individual of at least two different composition non-ferroelectric metal oxides are in different layers and without precluding intermixing of at least some immediately adjacent of the layers. Use of “layer” and “layers” does not require blanketing or complete coverage of such over underlying material, and such may be discontinuous or only partially received over underlying material. Regardless, the composite stack has an overall conductivity of at least 1×10<sup>2 </sup>Siemens/cm. In one embodiment, the composite stack has an overall conductivity no greater than 1×10<sup>3 </sup>Siemens/cm. An example overall thickness for composite stack <b>16</b> is from about 5 Angstroms to about 50 Angstroms, and in one embodiment from about 10 Angstroms to about 20 Angstroms.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">In one ideal embodiment and as shown, composite stack <b>16</b> and metal oxide-comprising insulator material <b>14</b> are formed directly against one another. In one embodiment, each of the at least two different composition non-ferroelectric metal oxides has conductivity of at least 1×10<sup>2 </sup>Siemens/cm. In one embodiment, at least one of the at least two different composition non-ferroelectric metal oxides does not have conductivity of at least 1×10<sup>2 </sup>Siemens/cm (i.e., composition and volume of the other non-ferroelectric metal oxide material(s) being sufficient such that the overall composite stack has conductivity of at least 1×10<sup>2 </sup>Siemens/cm). In one embodiment, the at least two different composition non-ferroelectric metal oxides are selected from among TiO<sub>x</sub>, AlO<sub>x</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, ScO<sub>x</sub>, Sc<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, ZrO<sub>x</sub>, YO<sub>x</sub>, Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, MgO<sub>x</sub>, MgO, HfO<sub>x</sub>, SrO<sub>x</sub>, SrO, Ta<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub>, NbO<sub>x</sub>, GdO<sub>x</sub>, MoO<sub>x</sub>, RuO<sub>x</sub>, LaO<sub>x</sub>, V<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub>, IrO<sub>x</sub>, CrO<sub>x</sub>, ZnO<sub>x</sub>, PrO<sub>x</sub>, CeO<sub>x</sub>, SmO<sub>x</sub>, and LuO<sub>x</sub>, with “x” as used in empirical formulas herein for oxides being any suitable number such that at least some of the material comprises molecular oxide, although which may not necessarily be overall stoichiometric throughout the material or even a majority of such material be stoichiometric. Desired conductivity/resistivity can be achieved depending upon quantity of metal atoms and oxygen atoms in the composition(s).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts composite stack <b>16</b> as comprising four layers <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, and <b>24</b>, with each by way of example only being shown as being of the same constant thickness. Fewer layers may be used (i.e., at least two layers of different compositions) or more than four layers may be used, and independent of whether of the same respective thicknesses, of different respective thicknesses, of the same or different variable thicknesses, etc. In one embodiment, the composite stack is formed to comprise only two different composition non-ferroelectric metal oxides (e.g., only two different composition non-ferroelectric metal oxides are selected from among TiO<sub>x</sub>, AlO<sub>x</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, ScO<sub>x</sub>, Sc<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, ZrO<sub>x</sub>, YO<sub>x</sub>, Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, MgO<sub>x</sub>, MgO, HfO<sub>x</sub>, SrO<sub>x</sub>, SrO, Ta<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub>, NbO<sub>x</sub>, GdO<sub>x</sub>, MoO<sub>x</sub>, RuO<sub>x</sub>, LaO<sub>x</sub>, V<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub>, IrO<sub>x</sub>, CrO<sub>x</sub>, ZnO<sub>x</sub>, PrO<sub>x</sub>, CeO<sub>x</sub>, SmO<sub>x</sub>, and LuO<sub>x</sub>, per the above). In one embodiment, the composite stack is formed to comprise two alternating layers, and in one embodiment only two alternating layers, of each of the two different composition non-ferroelectric metal oxides (e.g., A/B/A/B, where A and B are only two different ones of TiO<sub>x</sub>, AlO<sub>x</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, ScO<sub>x</sub>, Sc<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, ZrO<sub>x</sub>, YO<sub>x</sub>, Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, MgO<sub>x</sub>, MgO, HfO<sub>x</sub>, SrO<sub>x</sub>, SrO, Ta<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub>, NbO<sub>x</sub>, GdO<sub>x</sub>, MoO<sub>x</sub>, RuO<sub>x</sub>, LaO<sub>x</sub>, V<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub>, IrO<sub>x</sub>, CrO<sub>x</sub>, ZnO<sub>x</sub>, PrO<sub>x</sub>, CeO<sub>x</sub>, SmO<sub>x</sub>, and LuO<sub>x</sub>). In one embodiment, the composite stack is formed to consist essentially of the at least two different composition non-ferroelectric metal oxides. However in another embodiment, the composite stack is formed to comprise additional material, for example additionally comprising SiO<sub>x </sub>(e.g., within and/or as an elevationally outermost or innermost layer of the composite stack).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, conductive material <b>26</b> has been formed over composite stack <b>16</b> and insulator material <b>14</b>, and in one embodiment as shown directly against composite stack <b>16</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">In accordance with the method embodiments, composite stack <b>16</b> is used to render non-ferroelectric metal oxide comprising insulator material <b>14</b> to be ferroelectric. Composite stack <b>16</b> remains non-ferroelectric in the finished circuitry construction. Material <b>14</b> is insulative both before and after transformation from being non-ferroelectric to being ferroelectric. A composite stack comprising at least two different composition non-ferroelectric metal oxides enables rendering of non-ferroelectric metal oxide-comprising insulator material <b>14</b> to be ferroelectric. In one embodiment, metal oxide-comprising insulator material <b>14</b> is rendered ferroelectric before forming any of conductive material <b>26</b>. Alternately, metal oxide-comprising insulator material <b>14</b> is rendered ferroelectric after forming some or all of conductive material <b>26</b>.</div>

Example respective flow rates are 100 to 2,000 sccm, 100 to 2,000 sccm, and 1,000 to 20,000 sccm. Example temperature and pressure ranges are 200° C. to 350° C. and 0.1 Torr to 5 Torr. Plasma (whether direct or remote) may or may not be used. Such example deposition conditions will be sufficient to render non-ferroelectric material <b>14</b> to be ferroelectric during deposition of composite stack <b>16</b>. Alternate conditions (some including different precursors) may be determined and selected by the artisan.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">In one embodiment, composite stack <b>16</b> is used to render non-ferroelectric metal oxide-comprising insulator material <b>14</b> to be ferroelectric after a depositing of composite stack <b>16</b> over insulator material <b>14</b>.
