<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Amplifiers are commonly used to amplify a signal. For example, in radio frequency (RF) or cellular applications, base stations or other infrastructure components employ amplifiers to broadcast signals over greater distances. For communication schemes having relatively high peak-to-average ratios, Doherty amplifier topologies are commonly used to improve efficiency. A Doherty amplifier topology typically includes a pair of amplifiers, a main (or carrier) amplifier and a peaking (or auxiliary) amplifier. The peaking amplifier is biased to turn on when the input signal increases above a level that would cause the main amplifier to saturate, thereby reducing the impedance at the output of the main amplifier to enable the main amplifier to deliver more current in conjunction with current delivered by the peaking amplifier.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">The following detailed description is merely illustrative in nature and is not intended to limit the embodiments of the subject matter or the application and uses of such embodiments. As used herein, the word “exemplary” means “serving as an example, instance, or illustration.” Any implementation described herein as exemplary is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other implementations. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, or the following detailed description.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments of the subject matter described herein relate to amplifiers and impedance matching circuitry suitable for use in Doherty amplifier topologies that are capable of achieving relatively high gain and relatively high efficiency relative to conventional Doherty amplifier topologies. As described in greater detail below, in an exemplary embodiment, the output impedance matching circuitry for the peaking amplifier has a circuit topology and a physical topology that is different from the output impedance matching circuitry of the main amplifier. As a result, when the amplifiers and their associated output impedance matching circuitry are implemented in a single device package or integrated circuit, the inductive coupling between the outputs of the amplifiers may be reduced by virtue of the differences in the phase relationships between the output signals from the output impedance matching circuitry in conjunction with the physical differences of the output impedance matching circuitry. As used herein, a circuit topology should be understood as referring to an interconnection of electrical components, wherein two circuit topologies are different if the electrical components are interconnected in a different manner or interchanged for different electrical components, while a physical topology should be understood as referring to the physical structure or shape of the electrical circuit, wherein two physical topologies are different if there is any deviation among their physical shapes in any dimension.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">In an exemplary embodiment, the main amplifier output impedance matching circuitry <b>106</b> is realized as a high-pass impedance matching circuit topology.
