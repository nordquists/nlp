<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the present disclosure relate to a fingerprint identification apparatus and an electronic device having the fingerprint identification apparatus.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">With rapid development of display technologies, electronic devices with a biometric identification function have gradually entered into people's life and work, where a fingerprint identification technology has become one of the most widely used and inexpensive identification technologies in biometric identification technologies due to its uniqueness and stability, and has attracted more and more attention. The application fields of the fingerprint identification technology are also wider and wider.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Currently, the fingerprint identification technology in an electronic device generally adopts an optical technology, a silicon technology (capacitive and radio), and an ultrasonic technology, etc. It is easy to generate parasitic capacitance between electrodes at both ends of a capacitor in the capacitive fingerprint identification and internal components of a display panel in the electronic device, and a fingerprint detection signal and a display signal may interfere with each other, so as to affect accuracy of the fingerprint identification. Therefore, in the fingerprint identification technology, the optical technology is more advantageous than the capacitive technology, and an optical fingerprint identification sensor may implement detection and identification functions by detecting light reflected from a human finger. In order to achieve the fingerprint identification in a display field of the electronic device, the optical fingerprint identification sensor needs to be disposed in a non-display area between pixel units in the display field. In order to ensure an aperture ratio of pixels, an area provided for the optical fingerprint identification sensor is very limited, and the area of the optical fingerprint identification sensor is small, leading to a small absorption light area, and a low photocurrent being generated. Thus, it is easy to produce errors for fingerprint detection and identification.</div>

Apparently, the described embodiments are just a part but not all of the embodiments of the disclosure. Based on the described embodiments herein, those skilled in the art can obtain other embodiment(s), without any inventive work, which should be within the scope of the disclosure.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">Each component or structure in the drawings is not drawn in strict scale, and for clarity, the size of each component or structure may be exaggerated or reduced, such as increasing the thickness of the layer, the width of the electrode and etc., but these should not be used to limit the scope of the present disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a partial cross-sectional schematic diagram of an optical fingerprint identification apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an optical fingerprint identification apparatus comprises: a first substrate <b>101</b>, a second substrate <b>102</b>, a thin film transistor <b>10</b> and a fingerprint identification sensor <b>30</b>. Light <b>91</b> emitted by a light source (not shown in figure) is incident on a finger <b>90</b> that is in contact with or approaching the second substrate <b>102</b>, the finger <b>90</b> reflects the incident light <b>91</b>, and the reflected light irradiates on the fingerprint identification sensor <b>30</b>, and a photoelectric induction unit <b>31</b> of the fingerprint identification sensor <b>30</b> converts optical signals of the reflected light into current signals. Because geometric characteristics of ridge lines of a fingerprint and geometric characteristics of valley lines of a fingerprint are different, and the ridge lines are convex and the valley lines are concave, in a case that the ridge lines and the valley lines are irradiated by the light, reflection intensities of the ridge lines and the valley lines are also different, so that the current signals obtained by respective photoelectric induction units <b>31</b> of the fingerprint identification sensor <b>30</b> are also different. The fingerprint identification is achieved by detecting the sizes of the current signals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">The optical fingerprint identification apparatus may be disposed in an active area (AA) of a display device, for example, disposed in a non-display part between pixel units. In this case, in order to ensure that the display device has a sufficient aperture ratio, areas for manufacturing respective photoelectric induction units <b>31</b> of the fingerprint identification sensor <b>30</b> are very limited. A photosensitive surface of the photoelectric induction unit <b>31</b> of the fingerprint identification sensor <b>30</b> is a flat surface, and an area of the photosensitive surface is relatively small. During a fingerprint identification process, the received optical signals are small, the generated current signals are small, and the performance and accuracy of the fingerprint identification are low. In addition, the fingerprint identification apparatus further needs to separately provide a light shielding layer disposed above the thin film transistor <b>10</b> which is used for driving the photoelectric induction unit <b>31</b>, so as to prevent external light from irradiating on the thin film transistor <b>10</b> to affect electrical performance thereof. However, a lateral surface of the thin film transistor <b>10</b> may still be affected by irradiation of the light, so that performance of the thin film transistor <b>10</b> is affected. The fingerprint identification apparatus has many manufacturing procedures and a high production cost.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">At least one embodiment of the present disclosure provides a fingerprint identification apparatus and an electronic device having the fingerprint identification apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">A fingerprint identification apparatus according to an embodiment of the present disclosure comprises: a first substrate; a second substrate disposed opposite to the first substrate; and a fingerprint identification sensor disposed between the first substrate and the second substrate. The fingerprint identification sensor comprises a plurality of photoelectric induction units, and each of the photoelectric induction units comprises a curved photoelectric induction part.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">The fingerprint identification apparatus can be formed integrally with a display device, and thus, the photoelectric induction area is increased by using the curved photoelectric induction part of the photoelectric induction unit without affecting the aperture ratio of the display device, so as to increase induction photocurrent signals, improve the accuracy of the fingerprint detection and identification, and achieve fingerprint detection with high quality.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">For example, in the fingerprint identification apparatus provided by an embodiment of the present disclosure, a first electrode may be an opaque electrode, the first electrode may cover above a thin film transistor in a driving circuit, and a top surface and four lateral sides (front, back, left and right) of the thin film transistor can be covered by the first electrode, so as to better block the external ambient light and improve the stability of the thin film transistor; in addition, a step of separately forming a light shielding layer on the thin film transistor can be reduced, so that productivity can be further increased, the cost can be saved, and the process steps can be reduced.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">First Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a partial cross-sectional schematic diagram of a fingerprint identification apparatus provided by an embodiment, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> only shows a part of the relevant structures so as to illustrate the fingerprint identification apparatus more clearly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a fingerprint identification apparatus <b>1</b> of the embodiment comprises: a first substrate <b>100</b>, a second substrate <b>200</b> and a fingerprint identification sensor. The second substrate <b>200</b> is disposed opposite to the first substrate <b>100</b>. The fingerprint identification sensor is disposed between the first substrate <b>100</b> and the second substrate <b>200</b>, the fingerprint identification sensor comprises a plurality of photoelectric induction units <b>300</b>, and each of the photoelectric induction units <b>300</b> comprises a curved photoelectric induction part <b>3000</b>. Thus, an area of the photoelectric induction units <b>300</b> used for photoelectric induction at least includes a non-planar part. Compared with a planar part, the non-planar part has a larger surface area when occupying the same projected area (occupied area) on the first substrate <b>100</b>, so that a photoelectric induction area may be larger, and more photo-generated charges are generated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a schematic plan view of a fingerprint identification sensor. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the fingerprint identification sensor comprises a plurality of photoelectric induction units <b>300</b>, and the plurality of photoelectric induction units <b>300</b> may be arranged in an array with m rows and n columns (m, n being integers). <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> is a schematic circuit diagram of each photoelectric induction unit <b>300</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, each photoelectric induction unit may comprise a photodiode (PD). In order to output photo-charges generated by the photodiode due to light irradiation, each photoelectric induction unit may be provided with a read switch transistor M<b>11</b>. For example, a gate electrode of the read switch transistor M<b>11</b> is connected to a row scanning line, a source electrode of the read switch transistor M<b>11</b> is connected to each photoelectric induction unit, and a drain electrode of the read switch transistor M<b>11</b> is connected to a column scanning line. The photoelectric induction unit is not limited to include the photodiode, but may also include other suitable elements, such as a phototransistor or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">For example, the first substrate <b>100</b> may be a transparent substrate, such as a glass substrate, a quartz substrate, or other suitable substrates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">For example, the second substrate <b>200</b> may be a transparent substrate, such as a glass substrate, a quartz substrate, a plastic substrate, or other substrates that can be in contact with a finger <b>900</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">For example, the fingerprint identification apparatus provided by the embodiment may further comprise a driving circuit, and the driving circuit is used to drive the photoelectric induction unit <b>300</b>. The driving circuit comprises a thin film transistor <b>500</b>, and the thin film transistor <b>500</b> can be used as a signal-reading switch of a corresponding photosensitive induction unit <b>300</b>. According to needs, the driving circuit also may comprise elements such as a storage capacitor, a transmission transistor and the like, and the embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited to the specific structure of the driving circuit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the fingerprint identification apparatus provided by the embodiment may further comprise an interlayer insulating layer <b>160</b> between the thin film transistor <b>500</b> and the photoelectric induction unit <b>300</b>.

The thin film transistor <b>500</b> comprises a gate electrode <b>130</b>, a gate insulating layer <b>135</b>, an active layer <b>120</b>, a third electrode <b>150</b> and a fourth electrode <b>151</b>. Here, the third electrode <b>150</b> may be a source electrode or a drain electrode, and correspondingly, the fourth electrode <b>151</b> may be the drain electrode or the source electrode. For example, the photoelectric induction unit <b>300</b> comprises a first electrode <b>301</b>, a second electrode <b>303</b> and a photoelectric induction layer <b>302</b> sandwiched between the first electrode <b>301</b> and the second electrode <b>303</b>.

It is to be noted that, although only one photoelectric induction unit <b>300</b> of the fingerprint identification apparatus is shown in the figure, one of ordinary skill in the art may know that a plurality of photoelectric induction units <b>300</b> may be disposed on the first substrate <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">For example, the thin film transistor <b>500</b> may be a bottom-gate thin film transistor or a top-gate thin film transistor. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, in the embodiment, the thin film transistor <b>500</b> is a bottom-gate thin film transistor. For the bottom-gate thin film transistor, the gate electrode <b>130</b> may prevent the light coming from a side of the first substrate <b>100</b> from irradiating onto the active layer <b>120</b>; for the top-gate thin film transistor, a light shielding layer may be additionally formed to block the light coming from a side of the first substrate <b>100</b> from irradiating onto the active layer <b>120</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">For example, materials of the third electrode <b>150</b>, the fourth electrode <b>151</b> and the gate electrode <b>130</b> may comprise copper-based metals, aluminum-based metals, nickel-based metals, and so on. The copper-based metals have characteristics of low resistivity and good conductivity, so as to improve signal transmission ratios of the source electrode and the drain electrode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">For example, a material used for the active layer <b>120</b> may be amorphous silicon, polysilicon, oxide semiconductor or other suitable materials. The polysilicon may be high temperature polysilicon or low temperature polysilicon, and the oxide semiconductor, for example, may be indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO), indium zinc oxide (IZO), zinc oxide (ZnO) or gallium zinc oxide (GZO), etc.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">A principle of implementing the fingerprint identification by the fingerprint identification apparatus provided by an embodiment of the present disclosure is described below in conjunction with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, light <b>911</b> and light <b>912</b> (such as, visible light or infrared light) emitted by a light source (not shown in figure) irradiate through the first substrate <b>100</b> onto the finger <b>900</b> that is in contact with or approaching the second substrate <b>200</b>, uneven ridge lines <b>902</b> and valley lines <b>901</b> on the finger <b>900</b> (only the ridge lines and the valley lines of part of a fingerprint of the finger <b>900</b> are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, referring to wavy lines in the figure for details) reflects the light, but directions, intensities and the like of the light reflected by the ridge lines <b>902</b> and the valley lines <b>901</b> are different. In general, an intensity of the light reflected by a ridge line <b>902</b> of the finger <b>900</b> is greater than an intensity of the light reflected by a valley line <b>901</b> of the finger <b>900</b>, and the reflected light of different intensities enters the photoelectric induction unit <b>300</b> in the fingerprint identification sensor. The photoelectric induction layer <b>302</b> in the photoelectric induction unit <b>300</b> absorbs the optical signals reflected by the ridge lines <b>902</b> and the valley lines <b>901</b> of the finger <b>900</b> and converts the received optical signals into current signals. The current signals are transmitted to the thin film transistor <b>500</b> through the first electrode <b>301</b> that is electrically connected to the fourth electrode <b>151</b> under action of an electric field formed by the first electrode <b>301</b> and the second electrode <b>303</b>, and then the current signals are transmitted to a touch chip (not shown) through the thin film transistor <b>500</b>. During a process that the finger <b>900</b> contacts with the surface of the second substrate <b>200</b>, the touch chip detects the difference of the current signals output by the photoelectric induction unit <b>300</b> at different times, and a fingerprint two-dimensional pattern of the finger <b>900</b> formed by the ridge lines <b>902</b> and the valley lines <b>901</b> can be obtained by combining the output signals of the plurality of photoelectric induction units <b>300</b>, so as to achieve fingerprint identification.
