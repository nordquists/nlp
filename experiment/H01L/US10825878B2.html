<heading id="h-0004">Discussion</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Demand for portable display devices and interest in flexible display devices that may be bent, folded, or otherwise deformed via external forces of a user are increasing. A flexible display device may include a flexible substrate, a thin film transistor (TFT), and a light emitting unit. When an inorganic material is arranged in a bent region of the flexible display device, stress caused by bending the flexible display device may, in turn, cause the inorganic material to be transformed (e.g., volumetrically deformed) and damaged. When a step difference is provided in the bent region and a metal material is arranged on the step difference, the metal material may be cut off, cracked, or otherwise damaged due to the step difference.</div>

<heading id="h-0007">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of various exemplary embodiments. It is apparent, however, that various exemplary embodiments may be practiced without these specific details or with one or more equivalent arrangements. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring various exemplary embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">Unless otherwise specified, the illustrated exemplary embodiments are to be understood as providing exemplary features of varying detail of various exemplary embodiments. Therefore, unless otherwise specified, the features, components, modules, layers, films, panels, regions, aspects, etc. (hereinafter collectively referred to as “elements”), of the various illustrations may be otherwise combined, separated, interchanged, and/or rearranged without departing from the disclosed exemplary embodiments. Further, in the accompanying figures, the size and relative sizes of elements may be exaggerated for clarity and/or descriptive purposes. When an exemplary embodiment may be implemented differently, a specific process order may be performed differently from the described order. For example, two consecutively described processes may be performed substantially at the same time or performed in an order opposite to the described order. Also, like reference numerals denote like elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">When an element is referred to as being “on,” “connected to,” or “coupled to” another element, it may be directly on, connected to, or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present. When, however, an element is referred to as being “directly on,” “directly connected to,” or “directly coupled to” another element, there are no intervening elements present. Further, the D1-axis, the D2-axis, and the D3-axis are not limited to three axes of a rectangular coordinate system, and may be interpreted in a broader sense. For example, the D1-axis, the D2-axis, and the D3-axis may be perpendicular to one another, or may represent different directions that are not perpendicular to one another. For the purposes of this disclosure, “at least one of X, Y, and Z” and “at least one selected from the group consisting of X, Y, and Z” may be construed as X only, Y only, Z only, or any combination of two or more of X, Y, and Z, such as, for instance, XYZ, XYY, YZ, and ZZ. As used herein, the term “and/or” includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">Although the terms “first,” “second,” etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are used to distinguish one element from another element. Thus, a first element discussed below could be termed a second element without departing from the teachings of the present disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">Spatially relative terms, such as “beneath,” “below,” “under,” “lower,” “above,” “upper,” “over,” and the like, may be used herein for descriptive purposes, and, thereby, to describe one element's relationship to another element(s) as illustrated in the drawings. Spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of an apparatus in use, operation, and/or manufacture in addition to the orientation depicted in the drawings. For example, if the apparatus in the drawings is turned over, elements described as “below” or “beneath” other elements or features would then be oriented “above” the other elements or features. Thus, the exemplary term “below” can encompass both an orientation of above and below. Furthermore, the apparatus may be otherwise oriented (e.g., rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations), and, as such, the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments and is not intended to be limiting. As used herein, the singular forms, “a,” “an,” and “the” are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Moreover, the terms “comprises,” “comprising,” “includes,” and/or “including,” when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof. It is also noted that, as used herein, the terms “substantially,” “about,” and other similar terms, are used as terms of approximation and not as terms of degree, and, as such, are utilized to account for inherent deviations in measured, calculated, and/or provided values that would be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">Various exemplary embodiments are described herein with reference to sectional illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized exemplary embodiments and/or intermediate structures. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, exemplary embodiments disclosed herein should not be construed as limited to the particular illustrated shapes of regions, but are to include deviations in shapes that result from, for instance, manufacturing. In this manner, regions illustrated in the drawings are schematic in nature and shapes of these regions may not illustrate the actual shapes of regions of a device, and, as such, are not intended to be limiting.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure is a part. Terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense, unless expressly so defined herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a view of a flexible display device, according to one or more exemplary embodiments. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the flexible display device of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in a bent state, according to one or more exemplary embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the flexible display device has a substrate SUB including a first non-bent region FA<b>1</b>, a bent region BA, and a second non-bent region FA<b>2</b>. The first non-bent region FA<b>1</b> and the second non-bent region FA<b>2</b> may be manufactured in various shapes to implement various functions. For example, a light emitting unit (or structure) DIS that displays an image and a thin film transistor layer TFT that drives the light emitting unit DIS may be arranged in (e.g., overlap) the first non-bent region FA<b>1</b>. Although illustrated as single layers, the light emitting unit DIS and the thin film transistor layer TFT may include a plurality of layers, as will become more apparent below. A circuit pattern SD that applies a signal for driving at least one of the thin film transistor layer TFT and the light emitting unit DIS may be arranged in (e.g., overlap) the second non-bent region FA<b>2</b>. A conductive layer CL may be arranged in (e.g., overlap) the bent region BA.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, in at least one of the first non-bent region FA<b>1</b> and the second non-bent region FA<b>2</b>, a barrier layer BR, a gate insulating layer GI, a first interlayer insulating layer ILD<b>1</b>, a second interlayer insulating layer ILD<b>2</b>, and the conductive layer CL are sequentially arranged on the substrate SUB.

The material of which the substrate SUB is formed may vary and may include fiber glass reinforced plastic.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">The barrier layer BR increases smoothness of a surface (e.g., top surface) of the substrate SUB and/or prevents impurities from the substrate SUB from permeating into the gate insulating layer GI, the first interlayer insulating layer ILD<b>1</b>, the second interlayer insulating layer ILD<b>2</b>, and the conductive layer CL. The barrier layer BR may have a tapered sidewall provided with continuously arranged curved surfaces CS<b>1</b>, CS<b>2</b>, and CS<b>3</b>. According to one or more exemplary embodiments, the number of curved surfaces provided on the sidewall of the barrier layer BR may be larger than three.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">The barrier layer BR may have a multilayer structure. Among the multiple layers, a layer that contacts the substrate SUB may include at least one of silicon nitride, silicon oxide, and silicon oxynitride, and may increase the smoothness of the substrate SUB. Among the multiple layers, layers that do not contact the substrate SUB may include at least one of silicon nitride, silicon oxide, and silicon oxynitride, and may prevent the impurities from the substrate SUB from permeating into the gate insulating layer GI, the first interlayer insulating layer ILD<b>1</b>, the second interlayer insulating layer ILD<b>2</b>, and the conductive layer CL.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">The gate insulating layer GI may include at least one of the materials described to be included in the barrier layer BR.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">An opening OPN is formed in each of the barrier layer BR, the gate insulating layer GI, the first interlayer insulating layer ILD<b>1</b>, and the second interlayer insulating layer ILD<b>2</b> in a region overlapping the bent region BA. Since the opening OPN separates opposing portions of the barrier layer BR, the gate insulating layer GI, the first interlayer insulating layer ILD<b>1</b>, and the second interlayer insulating layer ILD<b>2</b> in a region overlapping the bent region BA, although the bent region BA is bent, stress is not applied to (or may be reduced in) the barrier layer BR, the gate insulating layer GI, the first interlayer insulating layer ILD<b>1</b>, and the second interlayer insulating layer ILD<b>2</b>. In addition, since the conductive layer CL is arranged on a tapered surface provided with a flat part or the curved surfaces CS<b>1</b> through CS<b>12</b>, although the bent region BA is bent, the conductive layer CL is not cut off, cracked, or otherwise damaged. To this end, the tapered surface provided with a flat part and/or curved surfaces CS<b>1</b> through CS<b>12</b> may increase surface area in which the conductive layer CL contacts at least one of the barrier layer BR, the gate insulating layer GI, the first interlayer insulating layer ILD<b>1</b>, and the second interlayer insulating layer ILD<b>2</b>. This increase in contacting surface area may also prevent (or at least reduce) the potential for the conductive layer CL from lifting off of (e.g., delaminating from) the barrier layer BR, the gate insulating layer GI, the first interlayer insulating layer ILD<b>1</b>, and the second interlayer insulating layer ILD<b>2</b>.</div>
