<heading id="h-0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0002">Field of the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to diodes (LEDs), and more particularly, present invention relates to light emitting diodes LEDs.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">Discussion of the Related Art</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Light emitting diodes LEDs are well-known semiconductor devices that convert electrical current into light. An LED produces light by exciting electrons across the band gap between a conduction band and a valence band of a semiconductor active (light-emitting) layer. The electron transition generates light at a wavelength (color) that depends on the band gap. Thus, the color of the light (wavelength) emitted by an LED depends on the semiconductor material(s) of the active layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">LEDs are widely available in a range of colors, for example, red, green, blue, yellow, and orange. However, conventional LEDs are relatively monochromatic light sources. Unfortunately, some applications require white light, which includes all primary colors. For example, laptop computers often require white-light backlights. Usually, white light is supplied either by incandescent bulbs or by fluorescent lamps. Although inexpensive, incandescent bulbs have fairly short lifetimes and low luminous efficiency. While more efficient, fluorescent lamps also tend to have limited lifetimes. Furthermore, fluorescent lamps require relatively large, heavy and expensive support devices, such as voltage stabilizers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">A white LED source could be made by fabricating closely spaced (or otherwise light-mixed) red, green, and blue LEDs that emit light in proper proportions. However, blue LEDs have been relatively difficult to fabricate, primarily because of difficulties in fabricating high quality crystals having a suitable band gap. Despite these difficulties, blue GaN-based LEDs have recently become commercially available. This has enabled white LEDs to actually be fabricated by mixing green, red and blue light together.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">While successful in producing white light, three-component (green, red and blue) LEDs have problems. For example, three-component LEDs will use significantly more power than a single component LED. Additionally, three-component LEDs require careful balancing of optical outputs to achieve high quality white light, a balance that is difficult to maintain over time and temperature, and that requires careful and expensive fabrication. The necessity of optical balancing combined with a relatively complicated drive circuitry means that three-component LEDs are, in practice, difficult and expensive to fabricate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Because of the forgoing problems with three-component LEDs it is would be advantageous to produce white light using only a single-element LED. Such single element white LEDs are known. For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a prior art single-element, white LED <b>12</b>. The LED <b>12</b> incorporates an yttrium-aluminum garnet (YAG) phosphor. Essentially, the phosphor layer produces white light from blue light. As shown, the single element white LED <b>12</b> is comprised of a blue LED chip <b>14</b> that is located on a base <b>15</b>, which is inside an organic YAG phosphor <b>16</b>. The YAG phosphor <b>16</b> is embedded in a dome-shaped package <b>17</b> having a hemispherical top <b>18</b>. The package <b>17</b> protects the resulting LED from damage caused by static electricity, moisture, and other environmental influences. Extending from the package <b>17</b> are two leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>. Bonding wires <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> connect the anode and cathode of the LED chip <b>14</b> to the leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Still referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, when electric power is applied to the LED chip <b>14</b> via the leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> and the bonding wires <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>, the LED chip <b>14</b> emits blue light. A part of the blue light passes through the YAG phosphor <b>16</b>, while another part is absorbed by the YAG phosphor <b>16</b>. The result is white light from the package <b>17</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Thus, a key to making white LEDs using the method illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is suitable blue LEDs. A beneficial approach to fabricating such blue LEDs is to incorporate active layers comprised of Gallium-Nitride (GaN) and Indium to produce InGaN/GaN semiconductor layers. In fact, the energy efficiency of GaN-based white LEDs has surpassed that of incandescent lamps, and is now comparable with that of fluorescent lamps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Despite their numerous advantages, white LEDs similar to the one shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> have problems. One set of problems relates to degradation of the bonding wires <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>, the LED chip <b>14</b>, and the leads <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> due to direct contact and subsequent chemical reaction with the YAG phosphor <b>16</b>. Additionally, the YAG phosphor <b>16</b> can be degraded by such chemical reactions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">Another problem with white LEDs similar to the one shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is that the hemispherical top <b>18</b> of the package <b>17</b> results in a “ring pattern” in the emitted light. Thus, the emitted light has poor luminance uniformity. The hemispherical top <b>18</b> also makes it difficult to reliably coat phosphors inside the package if such coating is required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">Another problem with white LEDs similar to the one shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is that the actual production of white light does not come from the light-producing LED chip <b>14</b>, which emits only blue light, but from phosphor <b>16</b> within the package <b>17</b>. Thus, the package not only provides protection, it is a functional requirement. Thus, the foregoing technique is not well suited for use with surface mount packaging.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">U.S. Pat. No. 6,337,536, by inventors Matsubara et al., which issued on Jan. 8, 2002, and which is entitled, “White color light emitting diode and neutral color light emitting diode,” discloses a white light emitting source that uses an n-type ZnSe single crystal substrate. The substrate is doped with I, Cl, Br, Al, Ga, or In emission centers, and includes an epitaxial film active layer structure of ZnSe, ZnCdSe or ZnSeTe. The active layer emits blue or blue-green light. The emission centers convert the blue or blue-green light to yellow or orange. The blue or blue-green light and the yellow or orange light synthesize white light or a neutral color light between red and blue.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">While the techniques taught in U.S. Pat. No. 6,337,536 are generally successful, they have problems. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,337,536 teaches a thick substrate. Therefore, the light intensity is heavily dependent on the thickness of the substrate. Furthermore, the materials used in U.S. Pat. No. 6,337,536 may not be optimal in specific applications.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">Therefore, a new single-element, white LED would be beneficial. Particularly beneficial would be a single-element, white LED that reduces or eliminates bonding wire, LED chip, connector lead, and phosphor degradation. Also beneficial would be a single-element, white LED that does not produce a ring pattern and that improves the uniformity of emitted light. Such a single-element, white LED would beneficially be fabricated as an on-chip, single-element, white LED that does not require a package for white light emissions. A method of fabricating white light emitting diodes without coating phosphor inside packages would be useful. Also beneficial would be a single-element, white LED with a light output that does not depend on the thickness of a substrate. More generally, a method of fabricating light emitting diodes using thin film fluorescent coatings would be beneficial.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">The following summary of the invention is provided to facilitate an understanding of some of the innovative features unique to the present invention, and is not intended to be a full description. A full appreciation of the various aspects of the invention can be gained by taking the entire specification, claims, drawings, and abstract as a whole.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">The principles of the present invention provide for white LEDs and for methods of fabricating white LEDs. Embodiments of white LEDs that are in accord with the principles of the present invention have reduced or eliminated bonding wire, LED chip, lead, and/or phosphor degradation. Such white LEDs can be fabricated on-chip, with improved light uniformity, and in such a manner that the light output is not heavily dependent on the thickness of a substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">According to the broad principles of the present invention, an LED element that produces light at a first wavelength and having p and n contacts is fabricated on a substrate. Then, a tinted thin film covers the LED element. A passivation layer is located on the LED element, but in such a manner that the p and n contact pads are exposed. Electrical power applied to the p and n contacts causes the LED element to emit light at the first wavelength. The thin film converts light at the first wavelength to at least a second wavelength.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">According to the principles of the present invention a white LED includes a blue-LED element that includes p and n contact pads. A thin film material, such as a phosphor (like YAG) or a tin-containing compound, covers the blue-LED element. Such thin film materials are beneficially formed using metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), atomic layer chemical vapor deposition (ALD), plasma enhanced MOCVD, plasma enhanced ALD, photo enhanced CVD, or other chemical vapor deposition methods.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">A passivation layer, beneficially about a 1000 .ANG.-thick SiO.sub.2 or Si.sub.xN.sub.y layer, can be located on the blue-LED element, but in such a manner that the p and n contact pads are exposed. The passivation layer can be formed using PECVD, sputtering, electron beam evaporation, or coating with a material, such as epoxy or flowable Si0.sub.2. PECVD is particularly beneficial in that it provides protected sidewalls. Spin-coating is a useful method of material coating. The passivation layer can then be patterned to expose the p and n contact pads using photolithography and a suitable etchant (such a BOE, HF, and/or photo-resist stripping).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">Wire bonds connect to the p and n contact pads. A second passivation layer can be formed over the p and n pads, over ends of the wire bonds, and over the first passivation layer. The result is an on-chip, single-element, white LED that is capable of emitting white-light without being encapsulated. Furthermore, an on-chip, single-element, white LED can be formed without a ring-patterned light. However, the resulting on-chip, single-element, white LED could be encapsulated in a package (such as a lamp or surface mount package) as required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">According to the principles of the present invention, an LED includes an LED element that includes p and n contact pads and that emits light at a first wavelength. A fluorescent thin film material (such as a phosphor or a tin-containing material) covers the LED element. Such thin film materials are beneficially formed using metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), atomic layer chemical vapor deposition (ALD), plasma enhanced MOCVD, plasma enhanced ALD, photo enhanced CVD, or other chemical vapor deposition methods. A passivation layer, beneficially about a 1000 .ANG.-thick SiO.sub.2 or Si.sub.xN.sub.y layer, can be located on the LED element, but in such a manner that the p and n contact pads are exposed. The fluorescing material converts light emitted by the LED element into at least a second wavelength.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">The novel features of the present invention will become apparent to those of skill in the art upon examination of the following detailed description of the invention or can be learned by practice of the present invention. It should be understood, however, that the detailed description of the invention and the specific examples presented, while indicating certain embodiments of the present invention, are provided for illustration purposes only because various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those of skill in the art from the detailed description of the invention and claims that follow.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">The following generally describes a process for fabricating on-chip white LEDs. While that description is an advantageous method of fabricating white LEDs, the principles of the present invention are not limited to that described method. Accordingly, the present invention is to be limited only by the claims that follow as understood and interpreted according to United States Patent Laws.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">Fabrication of a white light emitting diode that is in accord with the principles of the present invention begins with procurement of, such as by fabrication, a blue-LED chip having p and n contact pads. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> illustrate suitable blue-LED chips. In particular, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a lateral topology blue-LED chip <b>30</b> that is fabricated on a sapphire substrate <b>32</b>. An n-GaN buffer layer <b>34</b> is formed on the substrate <b>32</b>. A relatively thick n-GaN epitaxial layer <b>36</b> is then formed on the buffer layer <b>34</b>. An active layer <b>38</b> having multiple quantum wells of aluminum-indium-gallium-nitride (AlInGaN) or of InGaN/GaN is then formed on the n-type GaN epitaxial layer <b>36</b>. A p-GaN layer <b>40</b> is then formed on the active layer <b>38</b>. A transparent conductive layer <b>42</b> is then formed on the p-GaN layer <b>40</b>. The transparent conductive layer <b>42</b> may be made of any suitable material, such as Ru/Au, Ni/Au or indium-tin-oxide (ITO). A p-type electrode <b>44</b> is then formed on one side of the transparent conductive layer <b>42</b>. Suitable p-type electrode materials include Ni/Au, Pd/Au, Pd/Ni and Pt. A p contact pad <b>46</b> is then formed on the p-type electrode <b>44</b>. Beneficially, the p contact pad <b>46</b> is Au. The transparent conductive layer <b>42</b>, the p-GaN layer <b>40</b>, the active layer <b>38</b> and part of the n-GaN layer <b>36</b> are then etched to form a step. Because of the difficulty of wet etching GaN, a dry etch is beneficially usually used to form the step. The LED <b>30</b> is then completed by forming an n-electrode pad <b>48</b> (such as Cr or Au) and an n contact pad <b>50</b> (such as Au) on the step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an alternative blue LED, specifically a vertical topology GaN-based LED <b>54</b>. An example of this alternative blue LED structure is disclosed in U.S. application Ser. No. 9/905,969 entitled “DIODE HAVING HIGH BRIGHTNESS AND METHOD THEREOF” filed on Jul. 17, 2001, and U.S. application Ser. No. 9/983,994 entitled “DIODE HAVING VERTICAL STRUCTURE AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURING THE SAME” filed on Oct. 26, 2001, both of which are incorporated in this application as if fully set forth herein. The LED <b>54</b> is partially fabricated on a sapphire substrate that is subsequently removed. Removal of sapphire substrate may be done by, for example, laser lift-off. As shown, the LED <b>54</b> includes a GaN buffer layer <b>55</b> having an n-metal contact <b>56</b> on a bottom surface and a relatively thick n-GaN layer <b>58</b> on the other. The n-metal contact <b>56</b> is beneficially formed from a high reflective layer that is overlaid by a high conductivity metal (beneficially Au) to form an n contact pad <b>57</b>. An active layer <b>60</b> having a multiple quantum well is formed on the n-type GaN layer <b>58</b>, and a p-GaN layer <b>62</b> is formed on the active layer <b>60</b>. A transparent conductive layer <b>64</b> is then formed on the p-GaN layer <b>62</b>, and a p-type electrode <b>66</b> is formed on the transparent conductive layer <b>64</b>. A p contact pad <b>68</b> is then formed on the p-type electrode <b>66</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">The vertical GaN-based LED <b>54</b> has advantages in that step etching is not required. However, to locate the n-metal contact <b>56</b> below the GaN buffer layer <b>55</b>, the sapphire substrate (not shown) that is used for initial GaN growth is removed. Sapphire substrate removal using laser lift-off is known, reference U.S. Pat. No. 6,071,795 to Cheung et al., entitled, “Separation of Thin Films From Transparent Substrates By Selective Optical Processing,” issued on Jun. 6, 2000, and Kelly et al. “Optical process for liftoff of group HI-nitride films”, Physica Status Solidi (a) vol. 159, 1997, pp. R3-R4). Furthermore, highly advantageous methods of fabricating GaN semiconductor layers on sapphire (or other insulating and/or hard) substrates are taught in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/118,317 entitled “A Method of Fabricating Vertical Devices Using a Metal Support Film” and filed on Apr. 9, 2002 by Myung Cheol Yoo, and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/118,316 entitled “Method of Fabricating Vertical Structure” and filed on Apr. 9, 2002 by Lee et al. Additionally, a method of etching GaN and sapphire (and other materials) is taught in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/118,318 entitled “A Method to Improve Light Output of GaN-Based Light Emitting Diodes” and filed on Apr. 9, 2002 by Yeom et al., all of which are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">In principle, the vertical GaN-based LED <b>54</b> is preferred. Reasons for this include the fact that a 2″ diameter sapphire wafer has the potential to produce about 35,000 vertical GaN-based LEDs, but only about 12,000 lateral GaN-based LEDs. Furthermore, the lateral topology is more vulnerable to static electricity, primarily because the two electrodes/pads (<b>44</b>/<b>46</b> and <b>48</b>/<b>50</b>) are close together. Additionally, as the lateral topology is fabricated on an insulating substrate, and as the vertical topology can be attached to a heat sink, the lateral topology has relatively poor thermal dissipation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">While the vertical GaN-based LED <b>54</b> will be preferred in many applications, at the present time, lateral topology blue LED chips <b>30</b> are more common. Furthermore, the principles of the present invention are fully applicable to both types of blue LEDs (as well as with hybrids and variations). Therefore, without implying any loss of generality, the subsequent description of the fabrication of single-element white LEDs will make specific reference to the use of a lateral blue-LED chip <b>30</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a passivation layer <b>80</b> is formed over the blue LED chip <b>30</b>. A suitable passivation layer <b>80</b> may be an SiO.sub.2 or Si.sub.xN.sub.y layer of 1000 .ANG.-thick, for example, formed on exposed surfaces of the LED chip <b>30</b> using PECVD. Alternatively, the passivation layer <b>80</b> may be formed by sputtering, electron beam evaporation, or by coating with a suitable protective material, such as epoxy or flowable SiO.sub.2. Note that spin-coating is a particularly useful coating technique. However, PECVD is beneficial because it can form the passivation layer <b>80</b> on the sidewalls of the blue LED chip <b>30</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the passivation layer <b>80</b> is then patterned to expose the p and n contact pads <b>46</b> and <b>50</b> using a suitable etchant. For example, BOE, HF, and/or photo-resist stripping can be used to expose the pads.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">Then, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a thin film layer <b>86</b> of, for example, a fluorescent material (such as phosphor or a tin-containing compound) is formed on the passivation layer <b>80</b> so as to cover the blue LED element. Other suitable materials can be used for the thin film layer <b>86</b> to convert a light of first wavelength (a first color) to a light of second wavelength (a second color). Here, if a blue LED is used and coated with a phosphor thin film, for example, in accordance with the present invention, the blue light would be converted to white light by the phosphor, thus producing an “on-chip” white LED. Using different color LEDs and different color influencing materials would result in different colors produced directly from the chip.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">The thin film layer is beneficially formed using metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), atomic layer chemical vapor deposition (ALD), plasma enhanced MOCVD, plasma enhanced ALD, photo enhanced CVD, or other chemical vapor deposition methods. Preferably, the thin film layer <b>86</b> is about 10 .mu.m or so thick. Thus, the thin film layer <b>86</b> is an integral element of the chip, and not part of a package. Regarding the film thickness, in general the thinner the better. The thickness can be reduced by growing dense thin film layers.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the thin film layer <b>86</b> is patterned to expose the p and n contact pads <b>46</b> and <b>50</b> using a suitable solvent (which will depend on the composition of the thin film layer <b>86</b>). Bonding wires <b>90</b> and <b>92</b> are then bonded to the p and n contact pads <b>46</b> and <b>50</b>, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, an optional second passivation layer <b>94</b> (which is optically transparent) is then formed over the structure of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Beneficially the first and second passivation layers <b>80</b> and <b>94</b> are formed using the same process. The result is a white LED <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">The white LED <b>100</b> can then be encapsulated into a package, such as a lamp package or a surface mount package. However, the white LED <b>100</b> also can be used unpackaged and/or as part of another assembly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">In some applications it will be beneficial to incorporate a reflector between a contact pad and an adjacent semiconductor layer. For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, if a vertical LED <b>54</b> is used as the blue light source for a white LED <b>101</b>, it might be advantageous to incorporate a reflective layer <b>104</b> between the n-metal contact <b>56</b> and the n contact pad <b>57</b>. In that case, it is advantageous to include the second passivation layer <b>94</b> under the n contact pad <b>57</b> after the bonding wire <b>92</b> is attached. Likewise, the second passivation layer <b>94</b> is beneficially over the p contact pad <b>68</b>. However, is should be understood that in all cases the second passivation layer <b>94</b> is optional.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">The foregoing embodiments have described new, useful, and nonobvious white LEDs <b>101</b>. However, the general principles of depositing thin films that change the color of input light, such as by a thin film material, are applicable to more than just white LEDs. It is entirely possible to implement LEDs that emit other than white light by depositing various thin film materials on LEDs that emit light of different colors. Therefore, while the embodiments and examples set forth herein are presented to best explain the present invention and its practical application and to thereby enable those skilled in the art to make and utilize the invention, others who are skilled in the art will recognize that the foregoing description and examples have been presented for the purpose of illustration and example only.</div>
