<div html="" itemprop="content"><abstract lang="EN" load-source="patent-office" mxw-id="PA421899792">
<div class="abstract" id="p-0001" num="0000">An integrated circuit device includes a substrate and a magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ). The MTJ includes at least a pinned layer, a barrier layer, and a free layer. The MTJ is formed over a surface of the substrate. Of the pinned layer, the barrier layer, and the free layer, the free layer is formed first and is closest to the surface. This enables a spacer to be formed over a perimeter region of the free layer prior to etching the free layer. Any damage to the free layer that results from etching or other free layer edge-defining process is kept at a distance from the tunneling junction by the spacer.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to integrated circuit devices with magnetic tunneling junctions and methods for manufacturing them.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Magnetic media such as used in hard disk drives and magnetic tapes allow information to be stored for long periods of time. For traditional magnetic media, data access time is limited by mechanical systems. Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) and Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) have data access times on the ns scale for both read and write operations. These memories types are volatile: data is stored only as long as power is supplied to refresh the capacitor charge in DRAM and to keep the transistors on in SRAM. The need for non-volatile memory is reflected by the increasing demand for Flash memory. Flash technology has comparatively slow access times (in the μs range) and can be rewritten only a limited number of times. For these reasons, there has been keen interest in commercializing magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM), which provides non-volatile storage and read and write speeds similar to DRAM and SRAM.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">An MRAM cell is formed by a magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ), which is a structure in which two ferromagnetic layers are separated by a thin insulating barrier. When a potential difference is applied across the two ferromagnetic layers, current flows through the insulating barrier by quantum mechanical tunneling. The resistance of the MTJ depends on the relative orientation of magnetic elements in the two ferromagnetic layers. The resistance is lowest when the magnetizations are aligned in parallel and highest when they are anti-parallel. One of the relative orientations can be used to represent a “1” and the other to represent a “0”. In general, the magnetic orientation of one of the layers (the pinned layer) is kept fixed while the magnetic orientation of the other layer (the free layer) is set in a write operation. The state of the MRAM cell can be queried by measuring the junction's resistance. For an array of MRAM cells to provide reliable data storage, a sufficiently great difference in resistance between the two possible states must be realized for each cell in the array.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">The inventors realized that defects in MRAM cells can be caused by conventional manufacturing processes. In particular, the free layer has been found to be susceptible to plasma damage and contamination by metal ions during etching. The inventors solved this problem by reversing the usual order of the film stack to place the free layer on the bottom. This facilitates etching the free layer separately from the other layers and forming a protective sidewall barrier for the free layer before etching any other layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">The reverse layer order in the MTJ stack further allows a spacer to be formed over a perimeter region of the free layer prior to etching the free layer. The spacer is a sidewall barrier for the pinned layer and other layers of the MTJ stack. The spacer keeps any damage to the free layer that results from etching or other free layer edge-defining process at a distance from the magnetic tunneling junction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> provides a flow chart for a process <b>100</b>A, which is an example according to one embodiment of the present disclosure. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-9</figref> illustrate an integrated circuit device <b>200</b>A as it undergoes manufacturing by the method <b>100</b>A. The integrated circuit device <b>200</b>A is itself an example of another embodiment of the present disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">The process <b>100</b>A begins with some routine acts: act <b>101</b>, providing a semiconductor substrate <b>241</b>, act <b>103</b>, putting the semiconductor substrate <b>241</b> through front-end-of-line (FEOL) processing, and act <b>105</b>, forming first, second, and third metal interconnect layers (M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>, and M<b>3</b>). In this example, an MTJ <b>261</b> is formed above the third metal interconnect layer M<b>3</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. This and other examples provided herein can be modified to form the MTJ <b>261</b> at any other desired location within an integrated circuit device. The semiconductor substrate <b>241</b> and interconnect layers M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>, and M<b>3</b> are collectively represented by substrate <b>202</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-9</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">The process <b>100</b>A continues with a series of acts <b>110</b> that form a stack <b>222</b> for MTJs <b>261</b> over substrate <b>202</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The stack <b>222</b> includes a bottom electrode layer <b>201</b> formed by act <b>111</b>, a free layer <b>203</b> formed by act <b>113</b>, a barrier layer <b>205</b> formed by act <b>115</b>, a bottom pinned layer <b>207</b> (or simply “the pinned layer <b>207</b>”) formed by act <b>117</b>, an interlayer <b>209</b> formed by act <b>119</b>, a top pinned layer <b>211</b> formed by act <b>121</b>, an anti-ferromagnetic layer <b>213</b> formed by act <b>123</b>, and a top electrode layer <b>215</b> formed by act <b>125</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">Interlayer <b>209</b>, top pinned layer <b>211</b>, and anti-ferromagnetic layer <b>213</b> are all provided to keep fixed the magnetic orientation of bottom pinned layer <b>207</b>. One or more of these layers can be omitted or replaced in any way that allows bottom layer <b>207</b> to remain a pinned layer. Bottom pinned layer <b>207</b> and top pinned layer <b>211</b> are aligned anti-parallel. Bottom pinned layer <b>207</b>, interlayer <b>209</b>, and top pinned layer <b>211</b> collectively provide a virtual anti-ferromagnetic structure. Bottom pinned layer <b>207</b> is what is generally referred to as “the pinned layer” of magnetic tunneling junction <b>261</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">The process <b>100</b>A continues with a series of acts that provide a mask for patterning MTJ stack <b>222</b>. Act <b>127</b> is forming a hard mask layer <b>223</b>. Act <b>129</b> is forming a photoresist <b>225</b>. Act <b>131</b> is selectively exposing photoresist <b>225</b> according to the desired pattern for MTJs <b>261</b> formed out of MTJ stack <b>222</b>. The pattern can form the MTJ stack <b>222</b> into an array of individual MRAM cells. Act <b>133</b> is developing photoresist <b>225</b> to provide a structure as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">Process <b>100</b>A continues with a series of acts <b>140</b> that pattern and encapsulate MTJ stack <b>222</b>. Encapsulation refers to forming a barrier around the edges or sides of MTJ stack <b>222</b> that are exposed by etching. In some embodiments, encapsulation takes place in situ, meaning within the same tool as the one in which MTJ stack <b>222</b> is etched. In situ encapsulation reduces the risk of contamination of MTJ stack <b>222</b> and especially of free layer <b>203</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> provides a schematic illustration of a tool <b>400</b> within which acts <b>140</b> of the process <b>100</b>A can all be completed. The tool <b>400</b> provides an example of a tool that enables in situ encapsulation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">The tool <b>400</b> includes interconnected chambers, each of which is configured to carry out certain types of processing. Wafer handling equipment within a central area <b>413</b> allows movement of wafers between the various chambers without exposing the wafers to the ambient environment of the plant in which the tool <b>400</b> is located. The tool <b>400</b> includes a chamber <b>401</b> configured to load wafers for processing, chambers <b>403</b>, <b>405</b>, and <b>411</b> each configured for a particular class of etch processes, and a chamber <b>409</b> for depositing encapsulating materials. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes notations to illustrate an example flow of a wafer among the chambers of tool <b>400</b> as the wafer progresses through process <b>100</b>A.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">Processing within the tool <b>400</b> begins with a series of acts that etch MTJ stack <b>222</b> through bottom pinned layer <b>207</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. These etches generally continue through barrier layer <b>205</b>, whereby the free layer <b>203</b> provides an etch stop layer. The series of acts include act <b>141</b>, etching the hard mask layer <b>223</b>, act <b>143</b>, stripping the photoresist <b>225</b>, act <b>145</b>, etching top electrode <b>215</b> and act <b>147</b>, etching the rest of MTJ stack <b>222</b> through bottom pinned layer <b>207</b>. The photoresist <b>225</b> can be removed at a different stage of processing from the one illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Stripping can be carried out simultaneously with one of the etch processes. Etching top electrode <b>215</b>, anti-ferromagnetic layer <b>213</b>, and bottom pinned layer <b>207</b> before exposing free layer <b>203</b> is enabled by the reverse MTJ stack <b>222</b> provided by the present disclosure and protects free layer <b>203</b> from plasma damage and contamination that could otherwise occur while etching these layers. In embodiments of the present disclosure, free layer <b>203</b> is bottom-most among these layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">The process <b>100</b>A continues with act <b>149</b>, depositing a layer of sidewall barrier material and act <b>151</b>, etching the sidewall barrier material to form the sidewall barrier material into spacers <b>217</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The hard mask layer <b>223</b> can be removed while etching the spacers <b>217</b> or can be allowed to remain through further processing. Spacers <b>217</b> are formed over free layer <b>203</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">Act <b>153</b> etches through free layer <b>203</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. For each MTJ <b>261</b>, the free layer <b>203</b> includes a central region <b>203</b>A and a perimeter region <b>203</b>B. Plasma damage and contamination that occurs during etching can be restricted to the perimeter region <b>203</b>B by selecting a suitable width <b>224</b> for spacers <b>217</b>. Moreover, any damage or contamination of free layer <b>203</b> within the region <b>203</b>B can be kept a distance <b>228</b> from the edge of bottom pinned layer <b>207</b>. The distance <b>228</b> can be sufficiently great that there is no significant interaction between any damaged portions <b>226</b> of free layer <b>203</b> and bottom pinned layer <b>207</b>. Spacers <b>217</b> are functional to protect those portions of free layer <b>203</b> that are sufficiently close to the pinned layer <b>207</b> for quantum mechanical tunneling between the two layers to occur at an appreciable rate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">Act <b>155</b> is depositing another layer of sidewall barrier material. Act <b>157</b> is etching this layer of sidewall barrier material to form sidewall spacers <b>219</b>, a second set of sidewall spacers, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In some embodiments, spacers <b>219</b> can be deposited immediately after free layer <b>203</b> is etched and before any other layers are etched to avoid contamination of free layer <b>203</b> that might occur while etching other layers. In some embodiments, sidewall spacers <b>219</b> are deposited in-situ with etching <b>153</b>. Depositing sidewall spacers <b>219</b> in situ minimizes any contamination of free layer <b>203</b>. Spacers <b>219</b> protect free layer <b>203</b> while bottom electrode <b>201</b> is etched. In some embodiments, the width <b>224</b> is sufficiently great that any damage or contamination at the edges of free layer <b>203</b> that might occur while etching bottom electrode <b>201</b> does not affect the functioning of MTJ <b>261</b>. In those embodiments, spacers <b>219</b> are unnecessary acts and <b>155</b> and <b>157</b> can be skipped. Spacers <b>219</b> protect free layer <b>203</b> while bottom electrode <b>201</b> is being etched. In some embodiments, etching of bottom electrode <b>201</b> is delayed until a later stage of processing during which the sidewalls of free layer <b>203</b> are otherwise protected. Those are also embodiments in which spacers <b>219</b> are unnecessary acts and <b>155</b> and <b>157</b> can be skipped.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">Act <b>159</b> is etching bottom electrode <b>201</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Act <b>161</b> forms a capping layer over MTJ <b>261</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Act <b>163</b> is further BEOL processing to complete formation of the device <b>200</b>A. Due to spacers <b>219</b>, bottom electrode <b>201</b> has a lager footprint than free layer <b>203</b>. Due to sidewall spacers <b>217</b>, free layer <b>203</b> has a larger footprint than bottom pinned layer <b>207</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> provides a flow chart of a process <b>100</b>B, which is an example according to another embodiment of the present disclosure. The description of process <b>100</b>A generally applies to process <b>100</b>B except that in process <b>100</b>B instead of etching through the unmasked portion of free layer <b>203</b> with act <b>153</b>, the unmasked portions are rendered non-conductive and non-magnetic by a chemical reaction, such as oxidation <b>154</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-13</figref> illustrate an integrated circuit device <b>200</b>B as it undergoes manufacturing by the method <b>100</b>B. The description of integrated circuit device <b>200</b>A generally applies to integrated circuit device <b>200</b>B and vice versa except for differences that result from using oxidation <b>154</b> in place of etching <b>153</b>.</div>

Oxidation <b>154</b> renders a portion <b>203</b>C of the free layer <b>203</b> to a non-conductive state. The oxidized portion <b>203</b>C extends through the thickness of free layer <b>203</b> in the exposed areas and also somewhat into the portion <b>203</b>B of the free layer <b>203</b> that is under spacer <b>217</b>. By choosing a suitable width <b>224</b> for the spacer <b>217</b>, the portion of the free layer <b>203</b>C that is affected by oxidation <b>154</b> can be kept a distance <b>228</b> from the edge of bottom pinned layer <b>207</b>. As in the device <b>200</b>A, distance <b>228</b> can be made sufficiently great that there is no significant interaction between any damaged portions of free layer <b>203</b> and bottom pinned layer <b>207</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">Process <b>100</b>B continues like process <b>100</b>A with act <b>155</b>, depositing additional sidewall barrier material and act <b>157</b> etching this additional barrier material to form spacer <b>219</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Spacers <b>219</b> provide an additional layer of protection for the operative portion of free layer <b>203</b> when etching bottom electrode <b>201</b> by act <b>159</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. Spacers <b>219</b> are optional in that they may not be required, particularly if the width <b>224</b> of spacers <b>217</b> is sufficiently great.</div>
