<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This is a continuation application (CA) of PCT Application No. PCT/JP2016/074794, filed on Aug. 25, 2016, which claims priority to Japan Patent Application No. P2015-182974 filed on Sep. 16, 2015 and is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from prior Japanese Patent Applications No. P2015-182974 filed on Sep. 16, 2015 and PCT Application No. PCT/JP2016/074794, filed on Aug. 25, 2016, the entire contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The embodiments described herein relate a SiC epitaxial wafer, a manufacturing apparatus of the SiC epitaxial wafer, a fabrication method of the SiC epitaxial wafer, and a semiconductor device.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, much attention has been given to Silicon Carbide (SiC) semiconductors capable of realizing high breakdown voltage, high current use, low on resistance, high degree of efficiency, power consumption reduction, high speed switching, etc., since the SiC semiconductors have wider bandgap energy and higher breakdown voltage performance at high electric field, compared with Silicon (Si) semiconductors or Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) semiconductors. The SiC has received attention also in terms of environmental protections since occurrence of carbon dioxide gas (CO<sub>2</sub>) can be reduced due to the low power consumption performance thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Recently, the SiC devices have been applied to many applicable fields, e.g. air-conditioning apparatuses (air-conditioners), solar power generation systems, automobile systems, and train-vehicle systems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Since SiC compound semiconductors capable of taking equal to or greater than 200 types of crystal polymorphisms, there may be stable structures different between a substrate (bulk) and an epitaxial growth layer formed on the substrate. Accordingly, the epitaxial growth layer formed on the SiC substrate having an off angle is 0 degree may include many crystal defects. Accordingly, it is general to provide an off angle in the substrate in order to form the SiC epitaxial growth layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">In such a situation, one of the important problems in a case of applying the SiC is a point of cost. As a detail of the costs of SiC devices, wafer costs account for approximately 50%, SiC epitaxial growth costs account for approximately 22%, and fabrication process costs account for approximately 28%. For example, it is advantageous to use 150-mm (6-inch) φ wafers in terms of reducing the SiC device fabrication costs per unit area. However, it is general to use substrates having an off angle of 4 degrees, as the present 6-inch φ SiC wafers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">One method for a cost reduction of the SiC devices is to reduce such an off angle of the SiC substrate. However, if low-off angle substrates are used, it is difficult to realize high-quality epitaxial growth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">There has also already been reported results of SiC epitaxial growth performed on 4H—SiC substrates having an off angle of 2 degrees, from some groups. According to these reports, doping uniformity and film thickness uniformity can be satisfactorily controlled. However, occurrence of step bunching is increased and a triangular defect density is also increased, compared with SiC epitaxial growth on the SiC substrates having the off angle of 4 degrees. On the other hand, occurrence of the triangular defect can be relatively suppressed under high growth temperatures.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Also for such low-off angle SiC substrates on the SiC epitaxial growth layers, it is desired to provide a SiC epitaxial growth technique which is capable of reducing occurrence of such step bunching or a triangular defect density, and is excellent in film thickness uniformity and uniformity of carrier density in a tradeoff relationship with the reduction of the defect density, and is capable of reducing the costs.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">(a) Firstly, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the hexagonal-crystal SiC ingot <b>13</b> is prepared. Subsequently, a plurality pieces of the SiC bare wafer <b>14</b> are obtained by cutting the SiC ingot <b>13</b> with the off angle θ of less than 4 degrees in the [11-20] axis direction with respect to the (0001) surface. Next, the cut surface <b>15</b> ((0001) surface) of the SiC bare wafer <b>14</b> is polished by a machining process, such as lap processing etc.
<br/>
(b) Subsequently, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the cut surface <b>15</b> ((0001) surface) is removed by equal to or greater than approximately 500 nm, for example. As a removing method, Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) technology, plasma etching technology, etc. are applicable, for example. Preferably, plasma etching may be applied. Although it is required for relative long time for CMP with less damage to remove the surface by equal to or greater than 500 nm since the SiC is an extremely hard material, the removing process will be completed in a short time, e.g., approximately 20 minutes, if the plasma etching is used. Due to an improvement of polishing technique, it is possible to remove the damaged layer in approximately 20 minutes per one wafer even if CMP is used, and therefore the plasma etching or the CMP can appropriately be selected. On the other hand, with regard to the cut surface <b>15</b> of the SiC bare wafer <b>14</b>, the damage received by the plasma etching is small since the SiC is extremely hard. The damaged layer on the cut surface <b>15</b> of the SiC bare wafer <b>14</b> generated by the machining process after the cutting process is sufficiently removed by the above-mentioned removing process, and thereby the SiC substrate <b>2</b> having a thickness t<b>1</b> of approximately 200 μm to approximately 500 μm is obtained.
<br/>
(c) Subsequently, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, an oxidation treatment is applied on the principal surface <b>4</b> ((0001) surface) of the SiC substrate <b>2</b>, and thereby the oxide film <b>16</b> is formed on the principal surface <b>4</b> of the SiC substrate <b>2</b>. The oxidation treatment may be performed with a dry oxidation method or a wet oxidation method. Although illustration is omitted, the aforementioned oxide film <b>16</b> is formed also in a back side surface and a peripheral surface of the SiC substrate <b>2</b>. Then, the oxide film <b>16</b> is removed using a fluoric acid (HF). By applying the formation process and the removing process of the oxide film <b>16</b>, the damaged layer which cannot be removed by neither the CMP nor the plasma etching, and an altered layer (damaged layer) generated at the time of applying the CMP or plasma etching can be certainly removed from the cut surface <b>15</b> of the SiC bare wafer <b>14</b>. The formation process and the removing process for the oxide film <b>16</b> may be performed only after the removing treatment of the cut surface <b>15</b> by equal to or greater than 500-nm thickness, but also only before the removing treatment or also before and after the removing treatment.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139">A mechanism of increasing conversion probability from the basal plane dislocation (BPD) to the threading edge dislocation (TED) in the Sic epitaxial growth layer is as follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0140">The BPD is extended in parallel to a c-plane (0001) of the SiC crystal in the hexagonal crystal structure, and the TED is extended in a direction vertically to the c-plane (0001).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0141">SiC epitaxial growth by a Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) method advances by a step flow growth on the SiC substrate provided with an off angle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0143" num="0142">When the SiC epitaxial growth layer is formed, the dislocation is transmitted to be extended from the SiC substrate to the SiC epitaxial growth layer, but the TED extended substantially to a layer thickness direction becomes shorter than the BPD extended substantially to be vertical to the layer thickness direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0144" num="0143">Since an energy of the TED of which a dislocation introduction (development) is short becomes small as the energy of the dislocation introduction (development) at the time of increasing the layer thickness of the SiC epitaxial growth layer, the BPD is easily converted into the TED.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0144">An effect of the BPD being converted into the TED, it is more remarkable as the off angle to become small. If the off angle is varied from 4 degrees to 2 degrees, the length of the BPD to be extended by the SiC epitaxial growth becomes approximately twice as shown with the dashed line arrows in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>, and an energy difference in the case of being converted into the TED becomes large. Since the length of the BPD when not being converted becomes long and the energy difference of the dislocation introduction (decompression) between the TED and the BPD becomes large, if the off angle becomes small in particular, a conversion probability of the BPD to the TED becomes high.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0145">For example, the conversion probability from the BPD to the TED when the layer thickness of the SiC epitaxial growth layer is 10 μm is 99.26% in a substrate having the off angle of 4 degrees, but is 99.97% in a substrate having the off angle of 1 degree.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0161">Moreover, an experimental result of reducing the carrot defect density has been confirmed if the off angle is changed from 4 degrees to 4 degrees. A mechanism thereof is as follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0162">Although the carrot defect is a defect which grows up in a down step direction at the time of the epitaxial growth, with the threading screw dislocation (TSD) as a starting point, a length of the carrot defect occurring at the time of growing up the layer thickness of the epitaxial growth layer becomes long if the substrate off angle becomes small. If the off angle is changed from 4 degrees to 4 degrees, the length of the carrot defect becomes approximately twice. This has affected a magnitude relationship between an energy change due to an introduction of the carrot defect and an energy change in a case of being as in the TSD without occurrence of a carrot defect. As a result, if the off angle is changed from 4 degrees to 2 degrees, the carrot defect density is reduced.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0251" num="0250">When the C/Si ratio at the time of the drift layer growth is 0.9, it is preferable that the C/Si ratio of material gas at the time of forming the buffer layer <b>3</b>B is within a range of 0.6 to 0.9. It is more preferable that the C/Si ratio of material gas at the time of forming the buffer layer <b>3</b>B is approximately 0.75. If the C/Si ratio of material gas is equal to or less than 0.6, since the Si composition of an adhered film to the furnace wall of the CVD apparatus becomes high, a film stress becomes large and thereby a furnace material is easily cracked.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0252" num="0251">If the layer thickness of the buffer layer <b>3</b>B is formed thickly, the reduction effect of the defect density can be certainly obtained.
