<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a Continuation of PCT International Application No. PCT/JP2015/065403 filed on May 28, 2015, which was published under PCT Article 21(2) in Japanese, and which claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119(a) to Japanese Patent Application No. 2014-113443 filed on May 30, 2014. The above applications are hereby expressly incorporated by reference, in their entirety, into the present application.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0003">1. Field of the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a laminate, a method of producing the same, a polarizing plate, a liquid crystal display device, and an organic EL display device.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">2. Description of the Related Art</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">In various display devices such as a liquid crystal display device and an organic EL display device, a polarizing plate is used. For example, as a polarizing plate included in a liquid crystal display device, in order to realize higher quality image display through optical compensation using phase difference, a polarizing plate including a polarizer and an optically anisotropic layer is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">As the polarizing plate, for example, JP2004-53770A discloses a polarizing plate having an optically anisotropic layer formed from a polarizing film (polarizer) and liquid crystal molecules, in which the optically anisotropic layer is provided on the surface of the polarizer via an alignment film. That is, a polarizing plate having a polarizer, an alignment film, and an optically anisotropic layer in this order is disclosed.</div>
<heading id="h-0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">On the other hand, in recent years, reduction in thickness of display devices (for example, an in-place-switching (IPS) mode liquid crystal display device) has been advanced, and according to the reduction in thickness, there has been a demand for reduction in thickness of members (for example, a polarizing plate) to be used. In consideration of such a circumstance, the use of a thinner polarizer can be expected to lead to further reduction in thickness of display devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">When the present inventors made an attempt to produce an alignment film by arranging a layer of a composition for forming an alignment film directly on a thin polarizer and subjecting the layer to a rubbing treatment with reference to JP2004-53770A, it was found that when a treatment of pressing and rubbing the layer with rubbing rollers was carried out due to a decrease in the mechanical strength of the polarizer resulting from a reduction in thickness, there arose problems in that the polarizer was torn, the alignment film was peeled off, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Here, when the present inventors conducted studies of using a so-called photo alignment film that exhibits alignment capability by light irradiation as an alignment film, in the laminate including the obtained polarizer and photo alignment film, the moisture-heat resistance of the polarizer was not always sufficient and further improvement was required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention has been made in consideration of the above circumstances, and an object thereof is to provide a laminate that includes a polarizer and a photo alignment film and is excellent in the moisture-heat resistance of the polarizer.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail. The following description of the constitutional requirements is made on the basis of representative embodiments of the present invention, but it should not be construed that the present invention is limited to those embodiments. The numerical range which is shown by “to” used in the present specification means the range including the numerical values described before and after “to” as the lower limit and the upper limit, respectively. In addition, it is defined that “orthogonal” and “parallel” with respect to angle mean ranges expressed by precise angle ±10°, and “equal” and “different” with respect to angle can be determined based on a criterion that whether the difference is less than 5° or not.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">In the present invention, the “tilt angle” means an angle formed between a tilted liquid crystal compound and the plane of layer, and means a largest angle out of angles formed between the direction of maximum refractive index and the plane of layer in a refractive index ellipsoid of the liquid crystal compound. Accordingly, as for a rod-like liquid crystal compound having a positive optical anisotropy, the tilt angle means an angle formed between the longitudinal direction of the rod-like liquid crystal compound, that is, the direction of director, and the plane of layer. In the present invention, the “average tilt angle” means an average value of the tilt angles observed at the upper interface and the lower interface of the optically anisotropic layer. The tilt angle (that is, an inclination with respect to the plane of the optically anisotropic layer in a direction in which the refractive index of the optically anisotropic layer is the maximum) can be measured using an automatic birefringence system (for example, KOBRA 21ADH, manufactured by OJI SCIENCE INSTRUMENTS).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">In the present specification, Re(λ) and Rth(λ) represent an in-plane retardation and a retardation in a thickness direction at a wavelength λ, respectively. Re(λ) is measured by making light having a wavelength of λ nm incident to a film in a normal direction using KOBRA 21ADH or WR (manufactured by OJI SCIENCE INSTRUMENTS). Upon selecting the measurement wavelength λ, a wavelength-selecting filter can be manually exchanged or the measurement value can be changed by programming to conduct measurement.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">In the case in which the film to be measured is expressed as a monoaxial or biaxial refractive index ellipsoid, Rth(λ) is calculated as follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">Rth(λ) is calculated with KOBRA 21ADH or WR based on the retardation values obtained by measuring Re(λ) above at a total of 6 points in directions tilted at intervals of 10° from the normal direction of the film up to 50° on one side relative to the normal direction around an in-plane slow axis (determined by KOBRA 21ADH or WR) as a tilt axis (rotation axis) (in the case in which the film does not have a slow axis, an arbitrary in-plane direction of the film may be taken as the rotation axis) by making light having a wavelength of λ nm incident to the film from each of the tilted directions, a hypothetical value of average refractive index, and an inputted film thickness value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">In the above description, in a case of a film that has a direction in which the retardation value thereof is zero at a certain tilt angle relative to the in-plane slow axis thereof in the normal direction taken as a rotation axis, the retardation value at a tilt angle larger than the tilt angle is converted into the corresponding negative value and then calculated by KOBRA 21ADH or WR. Additionally, with the slow axis taken as the tilt axis (rotation axis) (in the case in which the film does not have a slow axis, an arbitrary in-plane direction of the film may be taken as the rotation axis), the retardation values are measured in two arbitrary tilted directions and, based on the above values, the hypothetical value of average refractive index, and the inputted film thickness, Rth can be also calculated according to Equations (1) and (2) below.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">In the equations, Re(θ) represents the retardation value in the direction tilted by an angle θ from the normal direction. nx represents the refractive index in the in-plane slow axis direction. ny represents the refractive index in the direction orthogonal to the in-plane nx, and nz represents the refractive index in the direction orthogonal to nx and ny. d represents the thickness of the film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">In the case in which the film to be measured cannot be expressed as a monoaxial or biaxial refractive index ellipsoid, that is, the film to be measured has no so-called optical axis, Rth(λ) is calculated as follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">Rth(λ) is calculated with KOBRA 21ADH or WR based on the retardation values obtained by measuring Re (λ) above at a total of 11 points in directions tilted at intervals of 10° from −50° up to +50° relative to the normal direction of the film around an in-plane slow axis (determined by KOBRA 21ADH or WR) as a tilt axis (rotation axis) by making light having a wavelength of λ nm incident to the film from each of the tilted directions, a hypothetical value of average refraction index and an inputted film thickness value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">In the above measurement, the hypothetical value of average refractive index is available from values listed in catalogues of various optical films in Polymer Handbook (JOHN WILEY &amp; SONS, INC.). Those having the average refractive indices unknown can be measured using an ABBE refract meter. The average refractive indices of some major optical films are listed below: cellulose acylate (1.48), cycloolefin polymer (1.52), polycarbonate (1.59), polymethylmethacrylate (1.49) and polystyrene (1.59). KOBRA 21ADH or WR calculates nx, ny and nz, by inputting the hypothetical values of these average refractive indices and the film thickness. Base on thus-calculated nx, ny and nz, the expression of Nz=(nx−nz)/(nx−ny) is further calculated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">One characteristic of the laminate according to the present invention is that a photo alignment film is formed by bringing a composition for forming a photo alignment film including a predetermined component into direct contact with the polarizer. In the composition for forming a photo alignment film, a compound having a crosslinking group (Compound B or C which will be described later) is included. Although the details of the reason for improving the moisture-heat resistance of the polarizer are not clear, it is assumed that the reason is an influence of the compound having a crosslinking group. More specifically, it is considered that since the compound is bondable to the polarizer via the crosslinking group and the adhesiveness between the photo alignment film and polarizer is improved, in the case in which, for example, a dichromatic component such as iodine or the like is included in the polarizer, the movement of the dichromatic component is suppressed and as a result, the moisture-heat resistance (durability under a wet hot environment) of the polarizer is improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">The laminate of the present invention has a polarizer, and a photo alignment film that is adjacently arranged on the polarizer.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">Hereinafter, the materials used and procedures in each step will be described in detail.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">[Step 1: Coating Film Forming Step]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">Step 1 is a step of forming a coating film on the polarizer by bringing a composition for forming a photo alignment film into direct contact with the surface of the polarizer. By carrying out the step, a coating film corresponding to a precursor film of a photo alignment film (photo alignment material layer) is obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">In the following description, first, the members and materials used in the step will be described in detail and then the procedure of the step will be described in detail.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">(Polarizer)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">The polarizer may be a member having a function of converting light into predetermined linearly polarized light (linear polarizer) and an absorption type polarizer can be mainly used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">As the absorption type polarizer, an iodine-based polarizer, a dye-based polarizer using a dichroic dye, a polyene-based polarizer, and the like can be used. In the iodine-based polarizer and the dye-based polarizer, there are a coating type polarizer and a stretching type polarizer and any type of polarizer can be used. However, a polarizer that is produced by adsorbing iodine or a dichroic dye to polyvinyl alcohol and stretching the polyvinyl alcohol film is preferable.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">In addition to the absorption type polarizer, reflective type polarizers such as a polarizer obtained by laminating thin films having different birefringent properties, a wire grid type polarizer, a polarizer obtained by combining a cholesteric liquid crystal having a selective reflection range and a ¼ wavelength plate, and the like can also be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">The thickness of the polarizer is not particularly limited and from the viewpoint of reducing the thickness of an image display device, the thickness is preferably 35 μm or less, more preferably 3 to 25 μm, and still more preferably 5 to 20 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">(Composition for Forming Photo Alignment Film)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">The composition for forming a photo alignment film is a composition used for forming a photo alignment film and contains Compound A having a photo-aligned group and Compound B having a crosslinking group, or Compound C having a photo-aligned group and a crosslinking group. That is, the composition for forming a photo alignment film contains two types of compounds of Compound A having a photo-aligned group and Compound B having a crosslinking group, or one molecule having two types of functional groups such as Compound C having a photo-aligned group and a crosslinking group. In the case of using Compound C, in addition to above Compound C, Compound A and/or Compound B may be further included in the composition for forming a photo alignment film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">The photo-aligned group included in Compound A and Compound C is a functional group capable of imparting anisotropy to the film by light irradiation. More specifically, the photo-aligned group is a group capable of causing a change in the molecular structure in the group by action of light, for example, irradiation of plane polarized light, typically, a group capable of causing at least one photoreaction selected from a photoisomerization reaction, a photodimerization reaction, and a photodecomposition reaction by action of light, for example, irradiation of plane polarized light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">Among these photo-aligned groups, a group causing a photoisomerization reaction (a group having a structure causing photoisomerization) and a group causing a photodimerization reaction (a group having a structure causing photodimerization) are preferable and a group causing a photodimerization reaction is more preferable.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">[Step 2: Photo Alignment Film Forming Step]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">Step 2 is a step of forming a photo alignment film from the coating film obtained in Step 1 above. The photo alignment film refers to an alignment film which exhibits the force for restricting the alignment by light irradiation as described later.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">For the procedure of forming such a photo alignment film, a method of carrying out a curing treatment and a photo alignment treatment on the coating film in random order may be used. More specifically, a curing treatment may be carried out on the coating film and then a photo alignment treatment may be carried out on the coating film. Alternatively, a photo alignment treatment may be carried out on the coating film and then a curing treatment may be carried out on the coating film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">Hereinafter, the procedures of the respective treatments will be described in detail.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">(Curing Treatment)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">The curing treatment means a treatment of conducting reaction of the above crosslinking groups. By carrying out the treatment, a reaction between crosslinking groups in the coating film or a reaction of the polarizer and the crosslinking group in the coating film is conducted. By conducting such a reaction, the moisture-heat resistance of the polarizer is improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">In the procedure of the curing treatment, a treatment is selected appropriately according to the type of the crosslinking group. It is preferable that in the case in which the crosslinking group is a photocrosslinking group, a light irradiation treatment (photocuring treatment) is carried out and in the case in which the crosslinking group is a thermal crosslinking group, a heating treatment (thermosetting treatment) is carried out.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">The type of light source used in the light irradiation treatment is not particularly limited. The light irradiation treatment is preferably carried out with light at a wavelength in an absorption band different from the absorption band of the photo-aligned group and specifically, irradiation with ultraviolet rays of 320 nm or less is preferable and irradiation with light having a wavelength of 250 to 300 nm is more preferable. However, in the case in which the photo alignment film decomposes by ultraviolet rays of 320 nm or less, a polymerization treatment with ultraviolet rays of 320 nm or more is preferably carried out.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">In addition, the light used for irradiation is preferably light that is diffused and not polarized in order not to disturb the alignment of the photo-aligned group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">In the case in which light for irradiation is emitted from the same direction as the irradiation direction in the photo alignment treatment, the alignment state of the photo-aligned group is less likely to be disturbed and thus an arbitrary wavelength can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">The heating temperature of the heating treatment is not particularly limited. The optimal heating temperature is selected appropriately according to the type of the thermal crosslinking group and typically is preferably within a range of 40 to 300° C. and more preferably within a range of 50 to 150° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">(Photo Alignment Treatment)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">The photo alignment treatment is a treatment for imparting liquid crystal alignment capability by irradiating the photo-aligned group included in the coating film with light and aligning the photo-aligned group in a predetermined direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">One method for the photo alignment treatment is a method of irradiating the coating film with polarized light. Irradiation with polarized light may be carried out in a direction normal (vertical) to the surface of the coating film or in a direction oblique to the surface of the coating film in order to imparting a pre-tilt angle. In addition, a combination of these may be carried out. The type of polarized light is not particularly limited and either of linearly polarized light and elliptically polarized light may be used. However, in order to effectively carrying out photo alignment, linearly polarized light having a high extinction ratio is preferably used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">Another method for the photo alignment treatment is a method of irradiating the coating film with non-polarized light (light without polarization). In the case of irradiation with non-polarized light, the surface of the coating film is irradiated with the non-polarized light in an oblique direction. At this time, the incident angle of the non-polarized light is preferably within a range of 10 to 80° with respect to the normal line of the surface of the coating film and considering uniformity in irradiation energy on the irradiated surface, the obtained pre-tilt angle, alignment efficiency, and the like, the incident angle is more preferably within a range of 20 to 60° and most preferably 45°.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">In order to obtain polarized light in the light irradiation device, there is a need to use a polarizing filter and the like and thus there is a defect that the intensity of light used for irradiation of the surface of the coating film is reduced. However, in the method of irradiation with non-polarized light, there is no need to provide a polarizing filter and the like in the irradiation device and a high irradiation intensity can be obtained. Thus, there is a merit that an irradiation time for photo alignment can be shortened.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">In addition, when a photomask is used in the case of irradiation with polarized light, liquid crystal alignment capability can be imparted to the photo alignment film in patterns in two or more different directions. Specifically, it is possible to impart liquid crystal alignment capability to exposed portions in patterns by covering the coating film with a photomask and irradiating the entire surface with polarized light or non-polarized light. If necessary, this operation is repeated plural times and liquid crystal alignment capability can be imparted in plural directions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">The type of light used for irradiation of the photo alignment treatment is not particularly limited and light having the most suitable wavelength can be selected according to the absorption band of the photo-aligned group. For example, ultraviolet rays including light having a wavelength of 150 nm to 800 nm and visible rays can be used and light having a wavelength of 350 nm to 500 nm is preferably used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">Examples of the light source of the light for irradiation include a xenon lamp, a high-pressure mercury lamp, an ultra-high-pressure mercury lamp, a metal halide lamp, and a UV laser such as KrF or ArF.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">When the light from such a light source is led to pass through a polarization filter, the Glan-Thompson prism, or a Glan-Taylor prism, it is possible to obtain linearly polarized light. In addition, in the case of using either of polarized light and non-polarized light, it is particularly preferable that the light for irradiation is almost parallel light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">The amount of irradiation in the photo alignment treatment is not particularly limited and from the viewpoint of effectively imparting liquid crystal alignment capability and reducing the production cost, the amount of irradiation is preferably 0.1 to 3,000 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>and more preferably 1 to 1,000 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">&lt;Laminate&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">Through the above steps, a laminate having the polarizer and the photo alignment film that is arranged adjacently on the polarizer can be obtained. The laminate of the present invention is capable of meeting the demand for a reduction in thickness of a display device since the polarizer and the photo alignment film are in direct contact with each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">The definition of the polarizer included in the laminate is as described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">The photo alignment film included in the laminate is a film that contains a compound having a group for imparting liquid crystal alignment capability by absorption of light (photo-aligned group) and has liquid crystal alignment capability as described above. In the photo alignment film, the photo-aligned group is aligned in a predetermined direction by the above photo alignment treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">The thickness of the photo alignment film is not particularly limited and is appropriately adjusted so that the photo alignment film, which will be described later, has a desired thickness. In the range of the above desired thickness, from the viewpoint of the alignment and handleability of the photo alignment film, the thickness is preferably 10 nm to 10 μm and more preferably 20 nm to 1 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">As described above, the crosslinking groups included in Compound B and Compound C react with each other during the curing treatment and most of the groups are deactivated. However, some of these may remain in the photo alignment film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">The laminate may include layers other than the polarizer and the photo alignment film and for example, an optically anisotropic layer may be arranged on the photo alignment film (on the surface opposite to the polarizer).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">Hereinafter, the optically anisotropic layer will be described in detail.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">(Optically Anisotropic Layer)</div>

The optically anisotropic layer preferably includes a liquid crystal compound. It is preferable that the liquid crystal compound is fixed in a state in which the liquid crystal compound is aligned in a predetermined direction in the optically anisotropic layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">The type of the liquid crystal compound is not particularly limited and can be classified into a rod-like type (rod-like liquid crystal compound) and a disk-like type (disk-like liquid crystal compound, discotic liquid crystal compound) depending on the shape. Further, each type includes a low molecular type and a high molecular type, respectively. The “high molecular type” generally means a polymer having a degree of polymerization of 100 or more (Kobunshi Butsuri Souten-i Dainamikusu (Polymer Physics and Phase Transition Dynamics), written by Masao Doi, p. 2, Iwanami Shoten, Publishers, 1992).

Examples of the polymerizable monomer include radical polymerizable compounds and cationic polymerizable compounds. Preferable is a polyfunctional radical polymerizable monomer and a compound copolymerizable with the liquid crystal compound containing a polymerizable group is preferable.

These alignment controlling agents are alignment controlling agents capable of horizontally controlling alignment of the rod-like liquid crystal compound in a polarizer interface side or in an air interface side and vertically controlling alignment of the disk-like liquid crystal compound. As these alignment controlling agents, known compounds may be appropriately used. Examples of a polarizer interface-side vertical aligning agent for the disk-like liquid crystal compound include compounds described in paragraphs “0079” to “0104” of JP2012-215704A, and examples of an air interface-side vertical aligning agent for the disk-like liquid crystal compound include compounds described in paragraphs “0106” to “0113” of JP2012-215704A.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0145">The thickness of the optically anisotropic layer varies depending on the materials to be used and a set phase difference value. The thickness is preferably 0.1 to 15 μm, more preferably 0.2 to 10 μm, and still more preferably 0.3 to 8 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0147" num="0146">In addition, the preferable range of the in-plane retardation Re(550) of the optically anisotropic layer at a wavelength of 550 nm varies depending on applications.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0148" num="0147">For example, in the case in which the polarizing plate including the optically anisotropic layer is produced as a λ/4 plate used in a circularly polarizing plate or the like, in order to make the optically anisotropic layer serve as a phase difference region in which the phase difference is about λ/4, Re(550) of the optically anisotropic layer is preferably 10 to 200 nm, more preferably 110 to 180 nm, still more preferably 115 to 170 nm, and particularly preferably 120 to 160 nm. In this case, Rth(550) is not particularly limited and in the case of using the optically anisotropic layer as an A plate, the Nz factor which is represented by (Rth/Re)+0.5 is within a range of 0.8 to 1.2 and is most preferably 1.0.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0149" num="0148">In the case of producing the polarizing plate as a λ/2 plate, in order to make the optically anisotropic layer serve as a phase difference region in which the phase difference is about λ/2, Re(550) is preferably 220 to 325 nm, and more preferably 250 to 300 nm. In this case, Rth(550) is not particularly limited and in the case of using the optically anisotropic layer as an A plate, the Nz factor which is represented by (Rth/Re)+0.5 is within a range of 0.8 to 1.2 and is most preferably 1.0.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0150" num="0149">In addition, in the case of using a laminate formed in a combination of a positive C plate as a λ/2 plate, the most suitable value varies depending on the physical properties of the C plate to be combined but for example, 100 nm≤Re(550)≤180 nm is preferable, 100 nm≤Re(550)≤150 nm is more preferable, and 120 nm≤Re(550)≤140 nm is still more preferable. Although the preferable range of the retardation Rth(550 nm) of the optically anisotropic layer in the thickness direction at a wavelength of 550 nm varies depending on applications, for example, 30 nm≤Rth(550)≤100 nm is preferable, 40 nm≤Rth(550)≤90 nm is more preferable, and 50 nm≤Rth(550)≤80 nm is still more preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0150">As one suitable embodiment of the optically anisotropic layer, an optically anisotropic layer in which a state in which a polymerizable rod-like liquid crystal compound exhibits a smectic phase is fixed or an optically anisotropic layer in which a state in which a polymerizable rod-like liquid crystal compound, which exhibits a smectic phase and a nematic phase, exhibits a nematic phase is fixed may be mentioned.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0152" num="0151">In the above optically anisotropic layer, it is preferable that the molecules of the liquid crystal compound are fixed in a state of smectic phase or nematic phase of homogeneous alignment (horizontal alignment) or nearly horizontal tilted alignment in which the liquid crystal compound has a tilt angle of 10° or smaller. The above tilt angle means that an angle between the direction of maximum refractive index and the plane of layer is 10° or less, preferably 3° or less, and particularly preferably 10 or less. The lower limit of the angle the direction of maximum refractive index and the plane of layer is not particularly limited as long as the lower limit of the angle is 0° or more.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0153" num="0152">The above optically anisotropic layer can be produced by fixing a smectic liquid crystal. In the case of using the smectic liquid crystal, the optically anisotropic layer can be formed in such that first, the smectic liquid crystal is allowed to align (nearly) horizontally and then fixed by polymerization, photocrosslinking, and heat crosslinking.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0154" num="0153">Since the smectic liquid crystal causes only a small depolarization by scattering of the optically anisotropic layer due to fluctuation in alignment, so that it may be more preferably used for applications where a relatively large retardation of 100 nm or more is required. The smectic phase is not particularly limited and may be selectable from SmA, SmB, SmC, or phases of higher orders.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0155" num="0154">Whether the liquid crystal compound is fixed in a state of smectic phase or not can be confirmed by observing the X-ray diffraction pattern. When the liquid crystal compound is fixed in a state of smectic phase, an X-ray diffraction pattern derived from orderliness of the layers will be observed, based on which the state of fixation may be determined. In the optically anisotropic layer of the present invention, a smectic liquid crystal may be fixed in a state of nematic phase. Whether the liquid crystal compound is fixed in a state of nematic phase or not can be confirmed by observing the X-ray diffraction pattern. When the liquid crystal compound is fixed in a state of nematic phase, only a broad halo peak is observed in the high angle region, without a sharp peak on the low angle side which is derived from layer formation. The state of fixation may be determined in this manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0156" num="0155">In the present invention, as long as desired properties can be obtained, an optically anisotropic layer in which the alignment state is fixed using a liquid crystal compound which exhibits only a nematic phase may be used.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0158">Further, as the optically anisotropic layer, an A plate having few scattering components and having high contrast or a plate equivalent to the A plate can be obtained. Particularly, since an A plate having reverse wavelength dispersibility or a plate equivalent to the A plate can be obtained, the plate can be preferably used as a wide band λ/4 plate for an organic EL display device or an optical compensation film for a liquid crystal display device.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0188" num="0187">Three layers consisting of core layer cellulose acylate dope 1 and to each side thereof outer layer cellulose acylate dope 1 were simultaneously cast onto a drum at 20° C. from casting ports. In a state of a solvent content of about 20% by mass, the films were peeled off, two edges of the film in a width direction were fixed with tenter clips, and the remaining solvent in a state of 3 to 15% by mass was dried while conducting 1.2-fold stretching in a horizontal direction. Then, by means of conveyance between the rolls of a heat treatment device, a cellulose acylate film having a thickness of 25 μm was prepared as a polarizing plate protective film <b>01</b>.</div>

Next, the coating film was thermally aged at a film surface temperature of 100° C. for 60 seconds and cooled to 70° C. Then, the film was irradiated with ultraviolet rays at a dose of 1,000 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>in the air using an air cooling metal halide lamp (manufactured by EYEGRAPHICS CO., LTD.) with an output of 70 mW/cm<sup>2 </sup>and the alignment state was fixed to form an optically anisotropic layer A. In the formed optically anisotropic layer A, the rod-like liquid crystal compound was aligned such that the slow axis direction was orthogonal to the polarized light irradiation direction. At this time, the thickness of the optically anisotropic layer was 0.8 μm. Using an automatic birefringence system (KOBRA 21ADH, manufactured by OJI SCIENCE INSTRUMENTS), the light incident angle dependency of Re and the tilt angle of the optical axis (that is, an inclination with respect to the plane of the optically anisotropic layer in a direction in which the refractive index of the optically anisotropic layer is the maximum) were measured.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0251" num="0250">&lt;Various Evaluations&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0252" num="0251">[Evaluation of Moisture-Heat Resistance]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0253" num="0252">In the present invention, the orthogonal transmittance CT of the polarizing plate (the polarizing plate in which the optically anisotropic layer was arranged on the laminate) was measured at a wavelength of 410 nm using an automated polarizing film measurement device VAP-7070 manufactured by JASCO Corporation in the following manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0254" num="0253">Two samples in which the polarizing plate of the present invention was attached to glass with an adhesive (5 cm×5 cm) were prepared. At this time, the polarizing plate was attached to the glass such that the side serving as a polarizing plate protective film is attached to the side opposite to the glass (air interface side). The orthogonal transmittance was measured by setting the glass side of the sample toward the light source. The two samples were respectively measured and the average value was set as the orthogonal transmittance CT.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0255" num="0254">Thereafter, various polarizing plates were stored over time under the temporal conditions which will be described later and then the orthogonal transmittance CT of each polarizing plate was measured in the same manner. Changes in the orthogonal transmittance CT before and after time had passed were obtained and these changes were evaluated as polarizing plate durability based on the following criteria. Grade “A” or “B” is desirable for practical use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0256" num="0255">The relative humidity under an environment without humidity adjustment was within a range of 0 to 20% RH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0257" num="0256">—Temporal Conditions—</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0258" num="0257">Under an environment at 60° C. and a relative humidity of 95% RH for 500 hours</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0259" num="0258">Evaluation Criteria:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0260" num="0259">A: A change in the orthogonal transmittance CT before and after time has passed is less than 0.6%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0261" num="0260">B: A change in the orthogonal transmittance CT before and after time has passed is 0.6 to 1.0%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0262" num="0261">C: A change in the orthogonal transmittance CT before and after time has passed is more than 1.0%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0263" num="0262">[Adhesiveness]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0264" num="0263">The photo alignment film of each laminate obtained in Examples and Comparative Examples was cut with a cutter knife at an interval of 1 mm using an equivalent interval spacer with a guide to form a 10×10 lattice pattern. Subsequently, a cellophane tape was put on the lattice pattern and was caused to firmly adhere to the lattice and then the cellophane tape was peeled off. After the cellophane tape was peeled off, the cut portion of the photo alignment film was observed. Regarding the number of meshes of the lattice in which peeling occurred along the cut line of the photo alignment film or at the intersection point with respect to the total number of lattice patterns, the adhesiveness in the case in which peeling was not confirmed was determined to be excellent (“A”), the adhesiveness in the case in which the number of meshes of the lattice in which peeling occurred with respect to the total number of lattice patterns was less than 15% was determined to be good (“B”), and the adhesiveness in the case in which the number of meshes of the lattice in which peeling occurred with respect to the total number of lattice patterns was 15% or more was determined to be poor (“C”).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0265" num="0264">[Evaluation of Solvent Resistance]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0266" num="0265">The compositions for forming a photo alignment film or the composition for forming an alignment film used in each of Examples and Comparative Examples were respectively applied to silicon wafers using a spin coater and then a predetermined curing treatment was carried out. Thus, a cured film having a thickness of 0.2 μm was formed. For the curing treatment, in the case in which the crosslinking group in the compound included in the composition is a thermal crosslinking group, the coating film was baked on a hot plate at a thermosetting temperature of 130° C. for 60 seconds, and in the case in which the crosslinking group is a photocrosslinking group, the coating film was irradiated with light in the air using an air cooling metal halide lamp (manufactured by EYEGRAPHICS CO., LTD.) with an output of 300 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0267" num="0266">The thickness of the film was measured using F20 manufactured by FILMETRICS. The cured film was immersed in cyclohexanone (CHN) for 60 seconds and then dried at a temperature of 100° C. for 60 seconds to measure the thickness of the film. A cured film that caused no change in the film thickness after the immersion in CHN was evaluated as “A” and a cured film in which a decrease of the thickness of the film after the immersion was observed was evaluated as “B”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0268" num="0267">[Film Hardness]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0269" num="0268">Photo alignment films were prepared in the same operations as in each of Examples and Comparative Examples except that a glass substrate was used instead of the polarizing plate 01. Regarding the photo alignment film, a pencil scratching tester for coating film was used to measure the film hardness. A case in which the pencil hardness measurement result was 3H or higher was determined to be excellent (“A”), a case in which the pencil hardness measurement result was lower than 3H and H or higher was determined to be good (“B”), and a case in which the pencil hardness measurement result was lower than H was determined to be poor (“C”).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0270" num="0269">&lt;Preparation of Liquid Crystal Display Device&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0271" num="0270">The polarizing plate on the visible side was peeled off from the liquid crystal cell of an iPad (in which a photo alignment film was used; manufactured by Apple Inc.) was used as an IPS mode liquid crystal cell in which a photo alignment film was used. The pre-tilt angle in the liquid crystal cell was 0°.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0272" num="0271">The polarizing plate in which the optically anisotropic layer was arranged on each laminate prepared in Examples and Comparative Examples above was laminated on the liquid crystal cell instead of the peeled polarizing plate and thus a liquid crystal display device was prepared. At this time, the lamination was carried out such that the absorption axis of the polarizer and the optical axis of the liquid crystal layer in the liquid crystal cell are orthogonal to each other when observing in a direction vertical to the surface of the liquid crystal cell substrate. In addition, the optically anisotropic layer in the polarizing plate was arranged to be disposed on the side opposite to the backlight.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0273" num="0272">Comparative Example 1 corresponds to an embodiment in which a liquid crystal display device was prepared using the polarizing plate 01 as a polarizing plate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0274" num="0273">The display performance was measured with a commercially available device for measuring a liquid crystal viewing angle and chromaticity characteristics Ezcom (manufactured by ELDIM S.A.) and a backlight of a commercially available liquid crystal display device iPad (manufactured by Apple, Inc.) was used. The measurements were carried out by arranging the liquid crystal cell on which a polarizing plate was laminated such that the optically anisotropic layer is arranged on the side opposite to the backlight. The results are collectively shown in Table.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0275" num="0274">[Panel Contrast (Panel CR)]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0276" num="0275">Using the liquid crystal display device, the luminance (Yw) of the white display mode in a direction vertical to the panel and the luminance (Yb) of the black display mode in a direction vertical to the panel were measured and the contrast ratio (Yw/Yb) in a direction vertical to the panel was calculated. The obtained value was set as a front contrast and evaluated based on the following criteria.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0277" num="0276">A: The front contrast is 95% or higher with respect to Comparative Example 1.</div>
