<heading id="h-0002">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is related to an electrically programmable semiconductor memory device, and particularly in such a semiconductor memory device, related to a nonvolatile semiconductor memory device.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Demand for a nonvolatile semiconductor memory device that is small and has a large capacity has been increasing rapidly, and a NAND type flash memory, in which high integration and large capacitivity can be expected, has been paid attention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">It will be necessary that a design rule should be reduced to proceeded high integration and large capacity. For reducing the design rules, further micro processing of wiring patterns will be required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">For realizing further micro processing such as wiring patterns, a very high quality of processing technique is required; therefore, reduction of the design rules has become difficult.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, in late years, large number of inventions on semiconductor memory devices, in which a three-dimensional memory cell has been suggested to raise integration degree of the memory (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2003-078044, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,599,724, 5,707,885, “Masuoka et al. “Novel Ultrahigh-Density Flash Memory With a Stacked-Surrounding Gate Transistor (S-SGT) Structured Cell”, IEEE TRANSACTION SON ELECTRON DEVICES, VOL. 50, NO. 4, pp 945-951, April 2003”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Many of the conventional semiconductor memory device, in which a three dimensional memory cell is placed, need to proceed Photo Etching Process (hereinafter called “PEP”, which represents so-called a process to proceed a patterning, using photo resist and manufacturing process such as a lithography process and etching, etc.). Here, a Photo Etching Process performed with a smallest line width of the design rule is set as “a critical PEP”, and a Photo Etching Process performed with a line width larger than the smallest line width of the design rule is set as “a rough PEP”. In the conventional semiconductor memory device, in which a three-dimensional memory cell is disposed, it is required that the critical PEP number per one layer of a memory cell part should be equal to or more than 3. Additionally in a conventional semiconductor memory device, there are many of those, in which memory cells are simply stacked, and thus cost increase caused by three-dimensional manufacturing will not be avoided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition, in one of the conventional semiconductor memory devices which placed a three-dimensional memory cell, there is a semiconductor memory device in use of a transistor of a SGT (a column shape) structure (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2003-078044, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,599,724, 5,707,885).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">In a semiconductor memory device in use of a transistor of a SGT (a column shape) structure, a process, in which poly-silicon that will become gate electrodes in its side walls are formed after having formed a channel (a body) part of a stacked memory transistor part in the shape of a pillar, is adopted. It is highly possible that problems such as a shortstop between the adjacent gates occur with micro processing, because the structure from the overhead view is the structure like skewering dumplings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Even more particularly, as disclosed by IEEE TRANSACTION SON ELECTRON DEVICES, VOL. 50, NO 4, pp 945-951, April 2003, after having formed upper pillar and a side wall gate, a lower layer pillar is formed regarding the upper pillar and the sidewall gate as a mask, and thus a lower layer gate is formed. Therefore, as the lower the layer is going, pillar diameter is different. Accordingly, not only a variation of a transistor property occurs in every layer, but also a cell area from the overhead view becomes large, because a pitch at the time of two dimensional placements with a pillar diameter of the bottom layer is fixed. In addition, a pair of adjacent pillars that is disposed in a two dimensional state are separated thoroughly, and an extra process that connects word lines of every layer will be needed. Therefore, the process will become cumbersome.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">As for the nonvolatile semiconductor memory device of conventional stacked type, a number of the word line driver that is necessary has increased because there are word lines that exist at least independently in every layer thus; a tip area has grown large.</div>

In addition, the insulation films <b>12</b> is the insulation film that function as charge storage layers (for example, a silicon oxide film, a silicon nitride film, a lamination film of the silicon oxide films).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">Operation</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">First, “reading operation”, “programming operation” and “erasing operation” in the memory transistors MTr<b>1</b> <i>mn </i>to MTr<b>4</b> <i>mn </i>of one memory strings <b>10</b> according to this embodiment will be explained referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As for the “reading operation” and “program operation” explanation is held by illustrating memory transistor MTr<b>3</b> <i>mn. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">Further, the memory transistors MTr<b>1</b> <i>mn </i>to MTr<b>4</b> <i>mn </i>in this embodiment are what is called a MONOS type transistor including semiconductor <b>11</b>, insulation films (a silicon oxide film, a silicon nitride film, and a lamination film of the silicon oxide film) functioning as a charge storage layer, and a conductor layer (a poly-silicon layer in this embodiment), here explanation will be performed with the assumption that threshold Vth of a memory transistor MTr with a situation that electrons are not accumulated in the charge storage layer (hereinafter called “neutral threshold”) be near 0V.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">Reading Operation</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">At the time of data reading from the memory transistor MTr<b>3</b> <i>mn</i>, Vb<b>1</b> (for example 0.7V), 0V, Vdd (for example 3.0V), and VPW (for example, 0V) are respectively applied to the bit line BLm, source line SL, the selection gate line SGD and SGS, and P-Well area. Then, the word line WL<b>3</b>, wherein the bit desired to be read out bit (MTr<b>3</b> <i>mn</i>) is connected, is set as 0V, and the other word lines WL are set as Vread (for example, 4V). Hereby is determined whether current is charged to the bit line BLm, depending upon whether the threshold Vth of the bit desired to be read out bit (MTr<b>3</b> <i>mn</i>) more or less than 0V, and thus it becomes possible to read out data information of the bit (MTr<b>3</b> <i>mn</i>) by sensing current of the bit line BLm. In addition, the data of other bits (the memory transistor MTr<b>1</b> <i>mn</i>, MTr<b>2</b> <i>mn</i>, and MTr<b>4</b> <i>mn</i>) can be read out with a similar operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">Programming Operation</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">At the time of programming data “0” into the memory transistor MTr<b>3</b> <i>mn</i>, i.e., enhancing threshold of the memory transistor by implanting electrons in the charge storage layer of the memory transistor MTr<b>3</b> <i>mn </i>(shifting the threshold toward a positive direction), 0V, Vdd, Vdd (for example, 3.0 V), Voff (for example 0V) and VPW (for example, 0V) are respectively applied to bit line BLm, the source line SL, the selection gate line SGDn, the selection gate line SGS, and the P-Well area. And the word line WL<b>3</b> of bits desired to be programmed (MTr<b>3</b>) and the other word lines WL, are further set to be Vprog (for example, 18V) and Vpass (for example, 10V), respectively. By doing so, electric field strength, wherein only the desired bits (MTr<b>3</b> <i>mn</i>) are applied to the charge storage layer, are strengthened, electrons are implanted into the charge storage layer, and then the threshold of the memory transistor MTr<b>3</b> <i>mn </i>is shifted toward a positive direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">At the time of programming data “1” into the memory transistor MTr<b>3</b> <i>mn</i>, i.e., the threshold is not enhanced from the erasing state of the memory transistor MTr<b>3</b> <i>mn </i>(electrons are not implanted into the charge storage layer), the gate potential and the source potential of the selection transistor SDTrmn become equivalent potentials by applying to the bit line BLm. Therefore, the selection transistor SDTrmn becomes an off-state, and a potential difference between the channel forming area (a body part) and the word line <b>3</b> of the memory transistor MTr<b>3</b> <i>mn </i>are decreased. As a result, the electron implantation into the charge storage layer of the memory transistor MTr<b>3</b> <i>mn </i>is not occurred. In addition, data may be programmed into the other bits (memory transistors MTr<b>1</b> <i>mn</i>, MTr<b>2</b> <i>mn</i>, and MTr<b>4</b> <i>mn</i>) by the same operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">Erasing Operation</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">At the time of data erasing, data erasing of the memory transistors MTr<b>1</b> <i>mn </i>to MTr<b>4</b> <i>mn </i>is performed a block unit including a plurality of memory strings <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">In the selection blocks (the blocks desired to be erased) Verase (for example 20V) is applied to the P-Well area, the potentials of the selection gate lines SGS and the SGDn are enhanced (for example, to 15V), setting the source line SL to be floating and sliding the time slightly with the timing applying Verase to the P-Well area (sliding at a degree of 4 μsec, for example). By doing so, GIDL (Gate Induced Drain Leak) is occurred near the gate terminal of the selection transistor SSTrmn, and the generated holes are drained into the inside of the semiconductor layer <b>11</b>, which is the body part of the memory transistors MTr<b>1</b> <i>mn </i>to MTr<b>4</b> <i>mn</i>. On the other hand, electrons are flowed into the P-Well direction. Thereby potential near Verase is transmitted to the channel forming area (the body part) of the memory transistor MTr, because of this, if the potentials of the word line WL<b>1</b> to WL<b>4</b> are set to be 0V, the electrons of the charge storage layer are pulled out into the P-Well and thus data deletion of the memory transistors MTr<b>1</b> <i>mn </i>to MTr<b>4</b> <i>mn </i>may be performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">On the other hand, when data erasing of the memory transistor is performed, in the non-selected blocks, potentials of the channel forming area (the body part) of the memory transistors MTr<b>1</b> <i>mn </i>to MTr<b>4</b> <i>mn </i>are enhanced by setting the word lines WL<b>1</b> to WL<b>4</b> being floating, at the same time, potentials of the word lines WL<b>1</b> to WL<b>4</b> are enhanced by coupling and there becomes no potential difference between the word lines WL<b>1</b> to WL<b>4</b> and the charge storage layers of the memory transistors MTr<b>1</b> <i>mn </i>to MTr<b>4</b> <i>mn</i>. Therefore, pulling out (deletion) of the electrons from the charge storage layer is not performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0136">Next, “reading operation”, “program operation” and “erasing operation” of the nonvolatile semiconductor memory device <b>1</b> of this embodiment, wherein the memory strings <b>10</b> are disposed vertically and horizontally with a two dimensional shape for the substrate face, are explained. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an equivalent circuit of the nonvolatile semiconductor memory device <b>1</b> of the present invention according to this embodiment is shown. In the nonvolatile semiconductor memory device <b>1</b> of this embodiment, the potentials of word lines WL<b>1</b> to WL<b>4</b> respectively have the same ones, as described above. Also here, each of the selection gate lines SGS<b>1</b> to SGS<b>3</b> are set to be able to be controlled independently, and these potentials may be set to be controlled by setting them to be the equivalent potentials such as forming the selection gate lines SGS<b>1</b> to SGS<b>3</b> with the same conductor layer and soon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">Further in this case, “reading operation” and “programming operation” in the memory transistor Mtr<b>321</b> shown with a dotted line (a Mtr<b>3</b> of the memory strings that is connected to the bit line BL<b>2</b> and the selection gate lines SGS<b>1</b> and SGD<b>1</b>) will be explained, and “erasing operation” of the memory transistor will be explained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0138">Reading Operation</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a diagram showing bias state in the case that reading operation of data of the memory transistor Mtr<b>321</b> shown by dotted line in the nonvolatile semiconductor memory device <b>1</b> according to this embodiment is performed. Here again, explanation will be performed assuming: the memory transistor Mtr in this embodiment is what is called a MONOS type transistor including the semiconductor <b>11</b>, the insulation film, which function as a charge storage layer (a silicon oxide film, a silicon nitride film, and a lamination film of the silicon nitride film) and the conductor layer (a poly-silicon layer in this embodiment), and a threshold Vth (a neutral threshold) of the memory transistor Mtr in the state, wherein the electrons are laminating in the charge storage layer, is near 0V.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0140">At the time of data reading out from the memory transistor MTr<b>321</b>, Vb<b>1</b> (for example, 0.7V), 0V, 0V, Vdd (for example, 3.0V), and Voff (for example, 0V), and VPW (for example, 0V; however, VPW may be any potentials so far as the P-Well and the memory strings are not in a forward bias) are respectively applied to: the bit line BL<b>2</b>, which the memory transistor Mtr<b>321</b> is connected to, the other bit lines BL, the source line SL, the selection gate lines SGD<b>1</b> and SGS<b>1</b>, in which the memory transistor MTr<b>321</b> is connected, the other selection gate lines SGD and SGS, and the P-Well area. And the word line WL<b>3</b>, which the bit (MTr<b>321</b>) desired to be read out is connected to, is set to be 0V, and the other word lines WL are set to be Vread (for example, 4.5V). Hereby a potential difference occurs between the bit line BL<b>2</b> and the source line SL of the bit (MTr<b>321</b>) reading out data, and the selection gate line SGD<b>1</b> is in an “on” state. Because of this, whether the current is flow or not to the bit line BL<b>2</b> is determined by whether the threshold Vth of the bit desired to be read out (MTr<b>321</b>) is large or small. Therefore, the data information of the bit (MTr<b>321</b>) can be read out by sensing the current of the bit line BL<b>2</b>. In addition, the data of the other bits (the memory transistor MTr<b>1</b> <i>mn</i>) may be read out with a similar operation. As this occurs, for example, the SGD<b>2</b> of the memory transistor MTr<b>322</b> is Voff, despite the threshold Vth is at any value i.e., either “1” or “0” is programmed into the memory transistor MTr<b>322</b>, therefore, current will not flow into the memory transistor MTr<b>322</b> and the memory strings <b>10</b> that the MTr<b>322</b> belongs to. These are memory strings <b>10</b> connected to the bit line BL<b>2</b>, which is similar in all of the memory strings <b>10</b> that is not connected to the selection gate line SGD<b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0141">Also, for example, explaining with an example of the memory transistor MTr<b>331</b>, in the case of the memory strings <b>10</b> that MTr<b>331</b> belongs to, despite a threshold Vth of the memory transistor MTr<b>331</b> is at any value, i.e., either “1” or “0” is programmed into the memory transistor <b>322</b>, current will not be running into the bit line BL<b>3</b>, because the bit line BL<b>3</b> is 0V and has same potential to the source line SL. This is common in all of the memory strings <b>10</b> not connected to the bit line BL<b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0143" num="0142">From the above description, in the nonvolatile semiconductor memory device <b>1</b> of the present invention according to this embodiment, even if the word lines WL<b>1</b> to WL<b>4</b> are respectively made driven with the common potentials, and the selection gate lines SGS<b>1</b> to SGD<b>3</b> are respectively driven with the common potential, the data at the threshold of the optional bits can be read.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0144" num="0143">Programming Operation</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0144"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a diagram showing a bias state in the case of programming operation of the data of the memory transistor MTr<b>321</b> shown with the dotted line, in the nonvolatile semiconductor memory device <b>1</b> of the present invention according to this embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0145">In the case that data “0” is programmed into the memory transistor MTr<b>3</b>, i.e., the threshold of the memory transistor is enhanced by implanting electrons into the charge storage layer of the memory transistor MTr<b>321</b> (shifting the threshold toward a positive direction), 0V, Vdd, Vdd, Vdd, Voff, Voff, VPW (for example, 0V), are respectively applied to: the bit line BL<b>2</b>, which the memory transistor MTr<b>321</b> is connected to the other bit lines, the source line SL, the selection gate line SGD<b>1</b>, which the memory transistor MTr<b>321</b> is connected to the other selection gate line SGD, the selection gate lines SGS<b>1</b> to SGS<b>3</b>, and the P-Well area. Further, by setting the word line WL<b>3</b> of the bit (MTr<b>321</b>) desired to be programmed to be Vprog (for example, 18V) and the other word lines WL to be Vpass (for example, 10V), a channel is formed into all the memory transistors except for the selection gate transistor SSTr<b>21</b>, which a source side selection gate line SGS<b>1</b> is connected to MTr<b>121</b>, MTr<b>221</b>, MTr<b>321</b>, and MTr<b>421</b>, in the memory strings <b>10</b> that the MTr<b>321</b> belongs to, then the potential of the bit line BL<b>2</b> (0V) is transmitted to the channel. Therefore, the filed strength, which is applied to a ONO film including the charge laminating layer that exists between the word line of the desired bit (MTr<b>321</b>) and the column shaped semiconductor becomes strong, the electrons are implanted into the charge storage layer, and then the threshold of the memory transistor MTr<b>321</b> shifts toward a positive direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0147" num="0146">At this time, for example, in the memory transistor MTr<b>322</b>, Voff is applied to the source side selection gate line SGD<b>2</b> so that the potential of the bit line BL<b>2</b> is not transmitted to the channel part of the memory transistor MTr<b>322</b> and thus no implantation of the electrons occurs in the memory transistor MTr<b>322</b>. This is applied to the memory strings <b>10</b> connected to the BL<b>2</b>, which is same to all the memory strings <b>10</b>, in which the memory transistor MTr<b>321</b> is not belonged to.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0148" num="0147">Also for example, in the memory transistor MTr<b>331</b>, the source side potential of the selection transistor SDTr<b>31</b>, which the selection gate line SGD<b>1</b> is connected to, becomes Vdd and the potential of the bit line BL<b>3</b> is also Vdd in the memory strings <b>10</b> that MTr<b>331</b> belongs to. Therefore, the potentials of the source of the selection transistor and the gate of the selection transistor SDTr<b>31</b> become same potentials. As a consequence, the selection transistor SDtr<b>31</b> is not on, and the outer electric potential is not transmitted in the channel part of the memory transistor MTr<b>331</b>, and thus, electron implant will not occur. This is similar to all the memory strings <b>10</b> that are not connected to the bit line <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0149" num="0148">In case that data “1” is programmed in memory transistor MTr<b>321</b>, i.e., the threshold is not enhanced from the erasing state of the memory transistor MTr<b>321</b> (electrons are not implanted into the charge storage layer), the gate potential and the source potential of the selection transistor SDTr<b>21</b> become the same potentials by applying Vdd to the bit line BL<b>2</b>. Therefore, the selection transistor SDTr<b>21</b> becomes off state and the potential difference between the channel formation area (the body part) and the word line WL<b>3</b> of the memory transistor MTr<b>3</b> becomes reduced, so that the electron implant does not occur in the charge storage layer of the memory transistor MTr<b>321</b>. In addition, data of the other bits (memory transistor MTrlmn: in an example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, l is 1 to 4, m is 1 to 3, and n is 1 to 3) may be programmed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0150" num="0149">Also, by setting the potential of each bit line BL adequately with 0V or Vdd, it becomes possible to perform a programming, namely page programming simultaneously on the bit (MTr) of the common word lines WL selected by one selection gate line SGD.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0150">Erasing Operation</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0152" num="0151">At the time of data erasing, data erasing of the memory transistor MTr is performed per block unit including a plurality of memory strings. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a diagram showing a bias state in the case the erasing operation of data of the memory transistor MTr of the selected block, in the nonvolatile semiconductor memory device <b>1</b> of the present invention according to this embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0153" num="0152">In the selected block (the block desired to be erased), Verase (for example, 20V) is applied in the P-Well area, the source line SL is set to be at floating, and sliding the time slightly with the timing applying Verase in the P-Well area (for example, sliding in the degree of 4 μsec), and thus the potentials of the selection gate lines SGS and SGD is enhanced (for example, to 15V). By doing so, GIDL (Gate Induced Drain Leak) is occurred near the gate terminal of the selection transistor SSTr, and the generated holes are drained into the inside of the semiconductor layer <b>11</b>, which is the body part of the memory transistor MTr. On the other hand, electrons are drained into the P-Well direction. Thereby potential near Verase is transmitted to the channel forming area (the body part) of the memory transistor MTr, because of this, if the voltage of the word lines WL<b>1</b> to WL<b>4</b> are set to be 0V, the electrons of the charge storage layer of the memory transistor MTr are pulled out into the P-Well and thus data erasing may be performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0154" num="0153">On the other hand, when performing data erasing of the memory transistors of the selected block, in the no selected block, potentials of the channel forming area (the body part) of the memory transistors MTr<b>1</b> <i>mn </i>to MTr<b>4</b> <i>mn </i>are enhanced by setting the word lines WL<b>1</b> to WL<b>4</b> being floating, at the same time, potential of the word lines WL<b>1</b> to WL<b>4</b> are enhanced by coupling and there becomes no potential difference between the word lines WL<b>1</b> to WL<b>4</b> and the charge storage layers of the memory transistors MTr<b>1</b> to MTr<b>4</b>. Therefore, pulling out (erasing) of the electrons from the charge storage layer is not performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0155" num="0154">Here summarization of a relationship of the potentials among “the reading out operation”, “the programming operation” and “the erasing operation” of the nonvolatile semiconductor memory device <b>1</b> of the present invention according to this embodiment is shown in Table 1.</div>

By the above, it becomes apparent that depth of the diffusion layer in the lower selection gate transistor SSTr differs in the depth 0.05 μm, as compared to depth of the diffusion layer of the upper layer selection gate transistor SDTr.

Further, by setting the gate length L<b>2</b> of the lower layer selection gate transistor SSTr and the gate length L<b>1</b> of the upper layer selection gate transistor SDTr to be different lengths, an overlap amount of gate electrodes of the upper layer selection gate transistor SDTr and the lower layer selection gate transistor SSTr and the drain diffusion layer is set to save sufficiently together with maintaining satisfactory contact resistance, and thus the driving force may be improved.</div>
