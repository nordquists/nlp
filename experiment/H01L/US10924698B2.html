<heading id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a solid-state imaging element represented by a CMOS image sensor, a method of driving the same, and a camera system.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, a CMOS image sensor has attracted attention as a solid-state imaging element (image sensor) that is an alternative to a CCD. This is for the following reasons.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">A dedicated process is necessary to fabricate a CCD pixel. A plurality of power supply voltages are necessary for operation of the CCD pixel, and a plurality of peripheral ICs need to be combined and operated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">On the other hand, a CMOS image sensor overcomes a problem of a very complicated system in such a CCD.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">The same fabrication process as for a typical CMOS integrated circuit can be used to fabricate the CMOS image sensor, which can be driven by a single power supply, and also both an analog circuit and a logic circuit using a CMOS process are incorporated in the same chip.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Thereby, the CMOS image sensor has great merits of the number of peripheral ICs being reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">An output circuit for the CCD is mainly a 1-channel (ch) output using a floating diffusion (FD) amplifier with an FD layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">On the other hand, the CMOS image sensor has an FD amplifier for each pixel, and an output of the CMOS image sensor is mainly a column-parallel output in which any one row in a pixel array is selected and pixels on the row are simultaneously read in a column direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">This is because it is difficult to obtain sufficient driving capability from an FD amplifier arranged in the pixel and accordingly a data rate needs to be lowered and parallel processing is advantageous.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">Here, in such a solid-state imaging element, a unit cell size of a pixel becomes smaller with multiple pixels and miniaturization.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, in the solid-state imaging element, a percentage of an area of a transistor in the pixel increases and an area of a photodiode (PD) becomes small, such that a saturation charge amount and sensitivity are degraded and image quality is deteriorated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">Further, high-speed reading in a number of pixels, such as 30 fps realization in an HD mode, is necessary.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">Thereby, in a solid-state imaging element including pixels having a small unit cell size, methods of adding some pixel signals in an analog or digital manner for enhancement of sensitivity and S/N or high-speed reading have been proposed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">One method is a method in which an FD is shared among a plurality of pixels and charges obtained through photoelectrical conversion in each pixel are added at the FD.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">However, if the FD is formed to add the same color pixels while a unit cell size of the pixel is being reduced, the PD area is further reduced, leading to degradation of a saturation charge amount and sensitivity and deterioration of image quality.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">Another addition method is a method of performing conversion into a digital signal and then addition in a solid-state imaging element with an analog digital (AD) converter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">In an all-pixel mode, one AD conversion is performed in a certain period. However, when digital addition is performed to realize high speed, a plurality of AD conversions are necessary in the certain period, and there are issues of a need for fast AD conversion and generation of noise due to the fast AD conversion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">A source follower addition in which a load MOS circuit connected to a read signal line performs addition is known as a method capable of avoiding issues caused by the FD addition and the digital addition and realizing enhancement of sensitivity and S/N and high speed (e.g., see Patent Literature1).</div>

<heading id="h-0007">Technical Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">In source follower addition in which a plurality of pixel signals are simultaneously read to a read line, the read signal amount becomes an average value of the added pixel charge amounts when added pixel charge amounts are similar with each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">However, when there is a great difference between the added pixel charge amounts, each of the signal amounts added by the source follower is not equal to the average value, but is a signal amount smaller than the average value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">Thereby, the source follower addition causes false color, for example, in edges where contrast is distinct.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">In Patent Literature 1, a plurality of pixels are added to cope with application of colors at the edges.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">However, the method of adding pixels on a plurality of columns to cope with the application of colors at the edges suffers from resolution degradation.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0206" num="0205">As described above, according to the present embodiment, the solid-state imaging element includes the pixel unit <b>110</b> in which the plurality of pixels that perform photoelectric conversion are arranged in a matrix form, and the pixel signal reading unit (ADC group) <b>150</b> for reading data from the pixel unit <b>110</b> in units of rows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0207" num="0206">In the pixel unit <b>110</b>, a plurality of pixels share the FD (output node), the reset transistor <b>113</b>, the amplifying transistor <b>114</b>, and the selecting transistor <b>115</b>. Each pixel in the shared pixel includes a PD <b>111</b> and a transfer transistor <b>112</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0208" num="0207">The vertical signal line <b>116</b> as the read signal line is arranged, one for the columns in which the shared pixel is included. A load MOS transistor <b>121</b> for driving source follower addition, which forms a pixel reading unit in cooperation with the ADC group <b>150</b>, is connected to the vertical signal line <b>116</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0209" num="0208">The gate voltage of the load MOS transistor <b>121</b> is higher than a reference gate voltage when there is no difference between the added charge amounts, to increase the current of the source follower and extend the linearity characteristic when the source follower addition is driven.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0210" num="0209">Alternatively, a method of reducing power consumption by adjusting the current flowing in the load MOS transistor using each pixel for reading of each pixel in driving the source follower addition is adopted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0211" num="0210">The ADC group <b>150</b> includes a plurality of comparators <b>151</b> arranged to correspond to a column arrangement of pixels, for comparing a read signal potential with a reference voltage for judgment and outputting a judgment signal, a plurality of counters <b>152</b> each for counting a comparison time of a corresponding one of the comparators, and memories <b>153</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0212" num="0211">Thus, according to the present embodiment, the following advantageous effects can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0213" num="0212">In general, in a CMOS image sensor, when a unit cell size of a pixel becomes small due to multiple pixels and miniaturization, degradation of sensitivity or S/N is not avoided and a driving method of adding pixel outputs in an analog or digital manner is indispensable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0214" num="0213">As described above, one adding method is the source follower addition in which the addition is performed by the load MOS connected to the read signal line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0215" num="0214">When resolution is necessary, for example, in a still image, charges accumulated in each pixel are output by all-pixel driving without the addition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0216" num="0215">However, when the source follower addition is driven with a bias voltage that is input to the gate of the load MOS upon all-pixel driving and if there is no difference between the two added pixel charge amounts, the output becomes a value corresponding to the average value of the added charge amounts. However, if there is a difference between the added charge amounts, the linearity of the load MOS transistor is broken.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0217" num="0216">According to the present embodiment, the linearity of the load MOS transistor can be enhanced by increasing the bias voltage of the load MOS transistor, and the linearity can be guaranteed even when there is a difference between the added charge amounts, thereby suppressing application of colors, for example, at edges where contrast is distinct.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0218" num="0217">Further, the current flowing in the load MOS transistor when each color is read is optimized according to the incident light amount and the RGB sensitivity ratio, thereby reducing power consumption.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0219" num="0218">For example, conditions in which the difference between the added charge amounts is maximized are darkness, and when pixels in which the FD is completely filled are added. However, even when the 1 frame is accumulated, a maximum difference is reduced in a light amount in which a shutter need not be pressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0220" num="0219">Thereby, the range in which the linearity of the load MOS transistor is maintained can be reduced and consumption current can be accordingly reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0221" num="0220">The solid-state imaging element having such advantageous effects may be applied as an imaging device for a digital camera or a video camera.</div>
