<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0003">1. Field of the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a backside illumination image sensor, a manufacturing method thereof and an image-capturing device equipped with the image sensor.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">2. Description of Related Art</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The image sensors known in the related art include front-side illumination image sensors that have both focus detection pixels and image-capturing pixels (see, for instance, Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 2000-305010).</div>
<heading id="h-0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Since the front-side illumination image sensor in the related art, such as that disclosed in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 2000-305010 necessitates that a wiring through which a signal from a photoelectric conversion unit is read out, a color filter and a light shielding layer be formed between a micro lens and a light receiving unit, the distance (depth) from the micro lens to the light receiving unit, measured at the front-side illumination image sensor is bound to be large. This gives rise a problem that as the pixels at the image sensor are further miniaturized, the focus detection accuracy is likely to be adversely affected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, at the front-side illumination image sensor in the related art disclosed in Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 2000-305010, the wiring through which the signal from the photoelectric conversion unit is read out must be formed on the light entry side of the light receiving unit, which necessitates that the light receiving opening be formed at a position set apart from the wiring and for this reason, the opening through which light enters the light receiving unit tends to be narrow. This leads to another problem in that it becomes increasingly difficult to install focus detection pixels at an image sensor with miniaturized pixels, which adopts a structure that includes focus detection pixels with even smaller light receiving openings (a pair of such light receiving openings equivalent in size to the light-receiving opening at a standard image-capturing pixel) compared to the light receiving openings at image-capturing pixels.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">In reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the basic pixel structure assumed at the image sensor <b>111</b> is described. As explained earlier, the image sensor <b>111</b> is a backside illumination 4TR-CMOS sensor and its basic pixel <b>300</b> is constituted with a photoelectric conversion unit <b>33</b>, a charge/voltage conversion unit <b>34</b> and four transistors, i.e., a transfer gate transistor <b>32</b>, a source follower transistor <b>35</b>, a row selector transistor <b>36</b> and a reset transistor <b>31</b>. In addition, a signal output line V<sub>out</sub>, a source line Vdd, a reset control line ØR, a transfer gate control line ØTG and a row selection control line ØRS are connected to the basic pixel <b>300</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">The reset transistor <b>31</b> resets the potential at the charge/voltage conversion unit <b>34</b> to the initial potential. The transfer gate transistor <b>32</b> transfers the signal charge resulting from the photoelectric conversion to the charge/voltage conversion unit <b>34</b>. The light having reached the photoelectric conversion unit <b>33</b> undergoes photoelectric conversion and the resulting signal charge is stored at the photoelectric conversion unit as explained earlier. The charge/voltage conversion unit <b>34</b> assumes a floating capacitance with which the signal charge is converted to a potential, and the floating capacitance is generated by a diode that functions as a capacitor. The source follower transistor <b>35</b> amplifies the change in the potential at the charge/voltage conversion unit <b>34</b>, which is attributable to the stored charge. The row selector transistor <b>36</b> is engaged in switching operation in order to select a specific basic pixel <b>300</b> for signal transfer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">The signal output line V<sub>out</sub>, via which the signal output from the basic pixel <b>300</b> is transferred, is connected to the drain of the row selector transistor <b>36</b>. The source line Vdd, via which power to be used in the amplification of the potential change at the charge/voltage conversion unit <b>34</b> is supplied, is connected to the source of the reset transistor <b>31</b>. The reset control line ØR, via which the ON/OFF state of the reset transistor <b>31</b> is controlled, is connected to the gate of the reset transistor <b>31</b>. The transfer gate control line ØTG is a wiring via which the signal charge transfer to the charge/voltage conversion unit <b>34</b> is controlled and is connected to the gate of the transfer gate transistor <b>32</b>. The row selection control line ØRS, via which the ON/OFF state of the row selector transistor <b>36</b> is controlled, is connected to the gate of the row selector transistor <b>36</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">In reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the wirings included in a single pixel are described. At the image sensor <b>111</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, two signal output lines V<sub>out</sub>, two source lines Vdd, two reset control lines ØR, two transfer gate control lines ØTG and two row selection control line ØRS are installed in each row of pixels disposed in a side-by-side arrangement, and four signal output lines V<sub>out </sub>are installed in correspondence to each column of pixels. This structure allows the signals from a plurality of basic pixels <b>300</b> to be read out at once, which, in turn, improves the detection speed of the image sensor <b>111</b>. Thus, the wirings in a given pixel <b>51</b> indicated by the dotted lines in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> include wirings to connect with a specific basic pixel <b>300</b> as well as wirings connecting with other basic pixels <b>300</b> instead of the particular basic pixel <b>300</b>. Thus, numerous wirings are included in each pixel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">In reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>, wirings present in the wiring layer <b>17</b> at the image sensor <b>111</b> are described. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> is a plan view of the wirings in the wiring layer <b>17</b>, seen from the side where the micro lens <b>10</b> is present. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> is a sectional view taken along C-C in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>, wirings are formed in a grid pattern over three strata within the wiring layer.

In the third stratum, two transfer gate control lines ØTG and two row selection control lines ØRS are formed. The bias lines Vb are formed to prevent crosstalk.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, the wirings can be formed in the wiring layer <b>17</b> free of any positional restrictions attributable to the presence of the photoelectric conversion unit <b>15</b> <i>a</i>, since the wiring layer <b>17</b> is formed on the side opposite from the light entry side of the photoelectric conversion unit <b>15</b> <i>a</i>. In other words, the structure in the embodiment allows wirings to be also formed in an area that will overlap the projected image of the light receiving area of the photoelectric conversion unit <b>15</b> <i>a</i>, projected from the light receiving surface side at the image sensor <b>111</b>. In contrast, a wiring layer at a front-side illumination image sensor must be formed on the light entry side of the photoelectric conversion unit <b>15</b> <i>a</i>, requiring wirings to be formed without interfering with the light receiving area at the photoelectric conversion unit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">In addition, since the wiring layer <b>17</b> at the image sensor <b>111</b> in the embodiment is not subjected to any positional restrictions attributable to the presence of the photoelectric conversion unit <b>15</b> <i>a</i>, the line width of the wirings can be increased to improve the signal transmission efficiency.</div>

Then, a support substrate <b>62</b> is bonded onto the wiring layer <b>17</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">The semiconductor substrate <b>60</b> is removed through etching as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>. Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>, a resin to constitute the planarizing layer <b>13</b> is evenly applied over the surface from which the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b> has been removed, so as to planarize the surface from which the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b> has been removed, and then a process of resin coating, drying the resin having been applied, pattern exposure and developing is executed multiple times so as to form the light shielding film <b>18</b> and color filters (not shown). The light shielding film <b>18</b> may be formed by dispersing black pigment such as titanium black or carbon black in the resin or by coloring the resin with a black dye. Color filters (not shown) may be formed by dispersing pigments corresponding to various colors (e.g., R, G and B) over the resin or by coloring the resin with dyes corresponding to the various colors (e.g., R, G and B).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>, after a resin to constitute the micro lens fixing layer <b>11</b> is applied over the light shielding film <b>18</b> and the color filters (not shown), a resin to constitute the micro lenses <b>10</b> is applied and then patterned through a lithography process of the known art so as to form micro lens bases <b>63</b>. Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>, micro lenses <b>10</b> are formed by hot-forming the micro lens bases <b>63</b> into a semi-spherical shape on a hot plate or the like. The process for manufacturing the image sensor <b>111</b> is completed when the support substrate <b>62</b> is removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">It is to be noted that while the micro lenses <b>10</b>, the color filters <b>12</b> and the light shielding film <b>18</b> are essential components of the image sensor, it is not crucial that the image sensor include the micro lens fixing layer <b>11</b> or the planarizing layer <b>13</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">The following advantages are achieved through the embodiment described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">(1) The image-capturing pixels <b>210</b> and the focus detection pixels <b>211</b> each include the semiconductor layer <b>16</b> with a photoelectric conversion unit <b>15</b> <i>a </i>formed at one surface thereof and the other surface thereof used as a light receiving surface and the wiring layer <b>17</b> with a wiring through which the signal from the photoelectric conversion unit <b>15</b> <i>a </i>is read out present therein. The wiring layer <b>17</b> at the image-capturing pixels <b>210</b> and the wiring layer <b>17</b> at the focus detection pixel <b>211</b> are each formed on the surface of the respective semiconductor layer <b>16</b>. Each image-capturing pixel <b>210</b> includes a color filter <b>12</b> through which light in a predetermined wavelength range is transmitted, formed at the other surface of the semiconductor layer <b>16</b>, whereas each focus detection pixel <b>211</b> includes a light shielding film <b>18</b>, via which part of the incoming light is blocked, is formed at the other surface of the semiconductor layer <b>16</b>. Thus, no wirings through which signals from the photoelectric conversion units are to be read out are required between the micro lenses <b>10</b> and the photoelectric conversion units <b>15</b> <i>a </i>and the light shielding film <b>18</b> and the color filters <b>12</b> do not overlap each other either. Consequently, the distance (depth) between the micro lenses <b>10</b> and the photoelectric conversion units <b>15</b> <i>a </i>can be reduced, thereby assuring improved focus detection accuracy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">(2) The light shielding film <b>18</b> is constituted of a material prepared by dispersing black pigment such as titanium black or carbon black through a resin or by coloring a resin with black dye. As a result, the extent of reflection of the incoming light at the light shielding film <b>18</b> is minimized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">(3) The light shielding film <b>18</b> is constituted of a material prepared by dispersing black pigment such as titanium black or carbon black through a resin or by coloring a resin with black dye and the color filters <b>12</b> are constituted of a material prepared by dispersing pigments corresponding to specific colors (e.g., R, G and B) through a resin or by coloring the resin with dyes corresponding to the specific color (e.g., R, G and B). Since both the light shielding film and the color filters are constituted of resin, the light shielding film <b>18</b> can be formed through a process similar to the process for forming the color filters <b>12</b>, thereby affording a high level of convenience. For instance, the light shielding film <b>18</b> can be formed through a process similar to the process for forming the color filter <b>12</b>, through repeated execution of a process of resin coating, drying the resin, pattern exposure and developing processing. In addition, since the thickness of the light shielding film <b>18</b> manufactured through a process similar to the process for forming the color filters <b>12</b> can be controlled with ease, adjustment of the input characteristics is enabled. Furthermore, since the light shielding film <b>18</b> for blocking part of the incoming light is present in the layer corresponding to the layer at which the color filters <b>12</b> of the image-capturing pixels <b>210</b> are present, the light shielding film <b>18</b> can be formed during the process of forming the color filters <b>12</b>, thereby affording further convenience.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">(4) The image sensor <b>111</b> is manufactured by forming a P-type epitaxial layer <b>61</b> at the surface of a semiconductor substrate <b>60</b>, forming photoelectric conversion units <b>15</b> <i>a </i>at the surface of the P-type epitaxial layer <b>61</b>, forming a wiring layer <b>17</b> over the photoelectric conversion units <b>15</b> <i>a</i>, removing the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b> from the P-type epitaxial layer <b>61</b>, forming a light shielding film <b>18</b> and color filters <b>12</b> on the surface of the P-type epitaxial layer <b>61</b> from which the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b> has been removed and forming micro lenses <b>10</b> above the light shielding film <b>18</b> and above the color filters <b>12</b>. Since the light shielding film <b>18</b> and the color filters <b>12</b> are formed through a single process, the image sensor <b>111</b> can be manufactured with a high level of efficiency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">(5) Each focus detecting pixel <b>211</b> includes a wiring via which a signal, not from its photoelectric conversion unit <b>15</b> <i>a </i>but from the photoelectric conversion unit of another pixel is read out, installed on the side where one surface of the semiconductor layer <b>16</b> is present. Since this structure allows wirings to be formed so as to allow signals at a plurality of basic pixels <b>300</b> to be read out at once, the detection speed of the image sensor <b>111</b> is improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">(6) The wirings are installed by ensuring that they overlap the projected images of the light receiving areas of the photoelectric conversion units <b>15</b> <i>a</i>, projected from the side where the light receiving surface of the image sensor <b>111</b> is present. As a result, the number of wirings formed at each focus detection pixel <b>211</b> can be increased or the width of the wirings formed at the focus detection pixel can be increased without significantly increasing the number of wiring installation strata. In the case of a front-side illumination image sensor, which requires wirings to be formed by ensuring that they do not overlap the light receiving areas of the photoelectric conversion units, an attempt at forming a greater number of wirings may result in an increase in the number of wiring strata or in a limited width that can be assumed for the wirings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">The embodiment described above allows for the following variations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">(1) The thickness of the light shielding film <b>18</b> may be different from the thickness of the color filters <b>12</b>. Since the thickness of the light shielding film can be set differently from that of the color filters, the focus position can be adjusted as desired for the focus detection pixels <b>211</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">(2) The position of the light shielding film <b>18</b> may be offset along the thickness of the image sensor <b>111</b> relative to the position of the color filters <b>12</b>. By offsetting the position of the light shielding film to a specific extent, focus position adjustment for the focus detection pixels <b>211</b> is enabled.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">(3) While the wiring layer <b>17</b> in the embodiment described above includes three wiring strata, the number of wiring strata in the wiring layer <b>17</b> is not limited to three. For instance, the wiring layer <b>17</b> may include up to 10 wiring strata, so as to increase the number of pixels, the signals from Which are read out simultaneously, or to increase the number of pixels to be controlled simultaneously. The image sensor according to the present invention differs from a front-side illumination image sensor in that an increase in the wiring strata does not result in an increase in the distance between the micro lenses <b>10</b> and the photoelectric conversion units <b>15</b> <i>a</i>. As an alternative, the number of wiring strata in the wiring layer <b>17</b> may be reduced to two in order to provide an image sensor with more limited functions and lower production costs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">(4) The light shielding film <b>18</b> may be constituted of a material prepared by dispersing pigments corresponding to all the colors, R, G and B assumed for the color filters <b>12</b> through the resin or by coloring the resin with dyes corresponding to all the colors, R, G and B assumed for the color filters. As an alternative, the light shielding film <b>18</b> may be formed by layering an R color filter, a G color filter and a B color filter one on top of another.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">(5) While the image sensor <b>111</b> described above is a 4TR-CMOS sensor, the present invention may be adopted in conjunction with a backside illumination image sensor other than a 4TR-CMOS sensor. For instance, it may be adopted in conjunction with another CMOS sensor or in conjunction with a CCD (charge coupled device) sensor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">(6) While the light shielding film <b>18</b> in the embodiment fulfills a light shielding function only, the light shielding film <b>18</b> may also fulfill a function as an electrode or as wiring in addition to the light shielding function. For instance, the light shielding film <b>18</b> may be formed by using a dark colored, electrically conductive material so as to fulfill both the light shielding function and a conducting function (an electrode function or a wiring function). Such a light shielding film <b>18</b> with multiple functions may be constituted of a material prepared by, for instance, dissolving carbon black into an electrically conductive organic material (an electrically conductive high polymer material or an electrically conductive polymer material). It is to be noted that in such a case, control lines can be installed as the light shielding film <b>18</b> with better convenience by disposing focus detection pixels so as to allow them to occupy a whole row at the image sensor rather than disposing focus detection pixels over only part of a row within the image sensor, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">By structuring the image sensor as described above, a further improvement in its functions can be achieved. For instance, signals may be read out from the pixels with higher speed or individual pixels may be controlled independently of one another. An additional function assumed at the light shielding film <b>18</b> may be, for instance, one of the following; the function as a signal line (a signal output line V<sub>out</sub>), the function as a source line Vdd, the function as a control line (a reset control line ØR, a transfer gate control line ØTG or a row selection control and ØRS) and the function as a bias line Vb. With such a light shielding film fulfilling an additional function, it becomes possible to install a greater number of wirings to read out signals from a plurality of pixels at once or to control a plurality of pixels simultaneously, without having to increase the number of wiring strata in the wiring layer <b>17</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">In addition, by allowing the light shielding film <b>18</b> to assume an electrode function or a wiring function, the signal lines, the control lines, the source lines and the bias lines can be isolated from one another with greater freedom. Certain lines among the signal lines, the control lines, the source lines and the bias lines should be formed away from other electrodes or wirings. By assuming the function of such a wiring at the light shielding film <b>18</b> and forming other wirings in the wiring layer <b>17</b>, the wirings can be set apart from one another. For instance, crosstalk may occur when a signal line is formed near a control line. Accordingly, the function of either the signal line or the control line may be fulfilled via the light shielding film <b>18</b> and the other wiring may be formed in the wiring layer <b>17</b>, so as to set the signal line away from the control line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">In such a case, a through hole passing through the P-type epitaxial layer <b>61</b> and the planarizing layer <b>13</b> may be formed through etching or the like and a wiring for electrically connecting the light shielding film <b>18</b> with a photoelectric conversion unit <b>15</b> <i>a </i>or another element formed at the surface of the P-type epitaxial layer <b>61</b> may be formed by using this through hole.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">Furthermore, by forming the color filters <b>12</b> and the light shielding film <b>18</b> with electrically conductive material, the entire layer at which the color filters <b>12</b> and the light shielding film <b>18</b> are present can be utilized as a functional layer functioning as a wiring or an electrode to assure a further improvement in the functions that the image sensor provides.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">The first embodiment described above may be adopted in conjunction with any one of the variations or in conjunction with a plurality of variations. The variations described above may also be adopted in any conceivable combination.</div>
<heading id="h-0009">Second Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">The second embodiment achieved by adopting the present invention in an electronic camera functioning as an image-capturing device is described.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">As is the image sensor in the first embodiment, the image sensor <b>111</b> achieved in the second embodiment is a backside illumination 4TR-CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) sensor.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">The reset transistor <b>31</b> resets the potential at the charge/voltage conversion unit <b>34</b> to the initial potential.

The light having reached the photoelectric conversion unit <b>33</b> undergoes photoelectric conversion and the resulting signal charge is stored at the photographic conversion unit as explained earlier. The charge/voltage conversion unit <b>34</b> assumes a floating capacitance with which the signal charge is converted to a potential, and the floating capacitance is generated by a diode that functions as a capacitor. The source follower transistor <b>35</b> amplifies the change in the potential at the charge/voltage conversion unit <b>34</b>, which is attributable to the stored charge.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23A</figref>, a P-type epitaxial layer <b>61</b> is formed over a semiconductor substrate <b>60</b>, and photoelectric conversion units <b>15</b> <i>a</i>, channel stop portions <b>15</b> <i>b </i>and other elements (not shown) to constitute transistors and the like are formed by forming a diffusion layer at the surface of the P-type epitaxial layer <b>61</b>.

Then, a support substrate <b>62</b> is bonded onto the wiring layer <b>17</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23C</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">The semiconductor substrate <b>60</b> is then removed through etching as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</figref>. Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24B</figref>, the light shielding film <b>14</b>B, constituted of aluminum (Al), is formed through sputtering on the surface from which the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b> has been removed.

The transparent film <b>19</b> may be formed through a process of resin coating, drying the resin having been applied, pattern exposure and developing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25A</figref>, after a resin to constitute the micro lens fixing layer <b>11</b> is applied over the transparent film <b>19</b>, a resin to constitute the micro lenses <b>10</b> is applied and then patterned through a lithography process of the known art so as to form micro lens bases <b>63</b>. Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25B</figref>, micro lenses <b>10</b> are formed by hot-forming the micro lens bases <b>63</b> into a semi-spherical shape on a hot plate or the like. The process for manufacturing the image sensor <b>111</b> is completed when the support substrate <b>62</b> is removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">Over an area where image-capturing pixels <b>210</b> are present, color filters <b>12</b>, instead of the transparent film <b>19</b>, are formed and the light shielding film <b>14</b>A, instead of the light shielding film <b>14</b>B, is formed. The color filters <b>12</b> and the transparent film <b>19</b> are formed through a common process, whereas the light shielding film <b>14</b>A and the light shielding film <b>14</b>B are formed through a common process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">It is to be noted that while the micro lenses <b>10</b>, the color filters <b>12</b> and the transparent film <b>19</b> are essential components of the image sensor, it is not crucial that the image sensor include the micro lens fixing layer <b>11</b> or the planarizing layer <b>13</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">The following advantages are achieved through the second embodiment described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">(1) The image sensor <b>111</b> is a backside illumination image sensor equipped with a plurality of pixels disposed in a two-dimensional pattern, which includes focus detection pixels <b>211</b> and image-capturing pixels <b>210</b>. Since this structure allows the substantial opening area at the light shielding film <b>14</b>B at the focus detection pixels <b>211</b> to be set to a large value, an image sensor equipped with focus detection pixels can be provided even if the pixels are further miniaturized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">In addition, since the wiring layer is formed on the side opposite from the light entry side of the photoelectric conversion units <b>15</b> <i>a</i>, the distance between the micro lenses <b>10</b> and the photoelectric conversion units <b>15</b> <i>a </i>is reduced at least by the extent corresponding to the thickness of the wiring layer, compared to the corresponding distance at a front-side illumination image sensor with the wiring layer formed on the light entry side of the photoelectric conversion units <b>15</b> <i>a</i>, and thus, better focus detection accuracy is assured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">(1) The focus detection pixels <b>211</b> each include the semiconductor layer <b>60</b> with the photoelectric conversion unit <b>15</b> <i>a </i>formed at one surface thereof and the other surface thereof used as the light receiving surface, the light shielding film <b>14</b>B, which blocks part of the light to enter the photoelectric conversion unit <b>15</b> <i>a</i>, and a wiring V<sub>out</sub>, through which the signal output from the photoelectric conversion unit <b>15</b> <i>a </i>is read out. The wiring V<sub>out </sub>is formed on the side where the one surface of the semiconductor layer <b>60</b> is present, whereas the light shielding film <b>14</b>B is formed on the side where the other surface of the semiconductor layer <b>16</b> is present. Since this structure reduces the distance (depth) between the micro lens <b>10</b> and the photoelectric conversion unit <b>15</b> <i>a</i>, compared to the corresponding distance at a front-side illumination image sensor requiring a wiring via which the signal from the photoelectric conversion unit is read out, to be formed between the micro lens and the photoelectric conversion unit, better focus detection accuracy is assured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">(3) Each focus detecting pixel <b>211</b> includes a wiring via which the signal, not from its photoelectric conversion unit <b>15</b> <i>a </i>but from the photoelectric conversion unit of another pixel, is read out, installed on the side where one surface of the semiconductor layer <b>16</b> is present. Since this structure allows wirings to be formed so as to allow signals at a plurality of basic pixels <b>300</b> to be read out at once, the detection speed of the image sensor <b>111</b> is improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">(4) The wirings are installed by ensuring that they overlap the projected images of the light receiving areas of the photoelectric conversion units <b>15</b> <i>a</i>, projected from the side where the light receiving surface of the image sensor <b>111</b> is present. As a result, the number of wirings formed at each focus detection pixel <b>211</b> can be increased or the width of the wirings formed at the focus detection pixel can be increased without significantly increasing the number of wiring installation strata. In the case of a front-side illumination image sensor, which requires wirings to be formed by ensuring that they do not overlap the light receiving areas of the photoelectric conversion units, an attempt at forming a greater number of wirings may result in an increase in the number of wiring strata or in a limited width that can be assumed for the wirings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">(5) Since a higher degree of freedom is afforded with regard to the shapes that the light shielding films <b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>B may assume, the pixel separation performance for the image-capturing pixels can be improved or the occurrence of the line-crawl phenomenon attributable to crosstalk or light leakage among pixels can be prevented effectively by selecting the optimal shapes for the light shielding films <b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">(6) The image sensor <b>111</b> is manufactured by forming a P-type epitaxial layer <b>61</b> at the surface of a semiconductor substrate <b>60</b>, formed photoelectric conversion units <b>15</b> <i>a </i>at the surface of the P-type epitaxial layer <b>61</b>, forming a wiring layer <b>17</b> over the photoelectric conversion units <b>15</b> <i>a</i>, removing the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b> from the P-type epitaxial layer <b>61</b>, forming light shielding films <b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>B on the surface of the P-type epitaxial layer <b>61</b> from which the semiconductor substrate <b>60</b> has been removed, forming a transparent film <b>19</b> and color filters <b>12</b> over the light shielding films <b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>B and forming micro lenses <b>10</b> over the transparent film <b>19</b> and the color filters <b>12</b>. Through this process, the backside illumination image sensor can be manufactured with a high level of efficiency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0136">The second embodiment described above allows for the following variations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">(1) The light shielding films <b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>B may each assume an electrode function or a wiring function. An image sensor with such light-shielding films will provide improved functions. For instance, signals may be read out from the pixels with higher speed or individual pixels may be controlled independently of one another. An additional function assumed at the light shielding film <b>14</b>A or <b>14</b>B may be, for instance, one of the following; the function as a signal line (signal output line V<sub>out</sub>, the function as a source line Vdd, the function as a control line (a reset control line ØR, a transfer gate control line ØTG or a row selection control and ØRS and the function as a bias line Vb. With such a light shielding film fulfilling an additional function, it becomes possible to install a greater number of wirings to read out signals from a plurality of pixels at once or to control a plurality of pixels simultaneously, without having to increase the number of wiring strata in the wiring layer <b>17</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0138">In addition, by allowing the light shielding films <b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>B to assume an electrode function or a wiring function, the signal lines, the control lines, the source lines and the bias blinds can be isolated from one another with greater freedom. Certain lines among the signal lines, the control lines, the source lines and the bias lines should be formed away from other electrodes or wirings. By assuming the function of such a wiring at the light shielding film <b>14</b>A or <b>14</b>B and forming other wirings in the wiring layer <b>17</b>, the wirings can be set apart from one another. For instance, crosstalk may occur when a signal line is formed near a control line. Accordingly, the function of either the signal line or the control line may be assumed at the light shielding film <b>14</b>A or <b>14</b>B and the other wiring may be formed in the wiring layer <b>17</b> so as to set the signal line away from the control line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139">In such a case, a through hole passing through the P-type epitaxial layer <b>61</b> may be formed through etching or the like and a wiring for electrically connecting the light shielding film <b>14</b>A or <b>14</b>B with a photoelectric conversion unit <b>15</b> <i>a </i>or another element formed at the surface of the P-type epitaxial layer <b>61</b> may be formed by using this through hole.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0140">(2) While the wiring layer <b>17</b> in the embodiment described above includes three wiring strata, the number of wiring strata in the wiring layer <b>17</b> is not limited to three. For instance, the wiring layer <b>17</b> may include up to 10 wiring strata, so as to increase the number of pixels, the signals from which are read out simultaneously or to increase the number of pixels to be controlled simultaneously. The image sensor according to the present invention differs from a front-side illumination image sensor in that an increase in the wiring strata does not result in an increase in the distance between the micro lenses <b>10</b> and the photoelectric conversion units <b>15</b> <i>a</i>. As an alternative, the number of wiring strata in the wiring layer <b>17</b> may be reduced to two in order to provide an image sensor with more limited functions at lower cost.</div>
