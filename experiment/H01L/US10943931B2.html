<heading id="h-0002">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to integrated circuit fabrication methods and, more particularly, to methods of forming integrated circuit substrates using semiconductor-on-insulator (SOI) fabrication techniques.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">A variety of conventional methods are available for printing integrated circuit device structures on substrates. Many of these device structures may include nano structures, microstructures, flexible electronics, and/or a variety of other patterned structures. Some of these device structures are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,195,733 and 7,521,292 and in U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2007/0032089, 20080108171 and 2009/0199960, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Progress has also been made in extending the electronic performance capabilities of integrated circuit devices on plastic substrates in order to expand their applicability to a wider range of electronic applications. For example, several new thin film transistor (TFT) designs have emerged that are compatible with processing on plastic substrate materials and may exhibit significantly higher device performance characteristics than thin film transistors having amorphous silicon, organic, or hybrid organic-inorganic semiconductor elements. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,622,367 to Nuzzo et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 7,557,367 to Rogers et al. disclose methods of forming a wide range of flexible electronic and optoelectronic devices and arrays of devices on substrates containing polymeric materials.

<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Methods of forming integrated circuit devices according to some embodiments of the invention include forming a sacrificial layer on a handling substrate and forming a semiconductor active layer on the sacrificial layer. A step is performed to selectively etch through the semiconductor active layer and the sacrificial layer in sequence to define a semiconductor-on-insulator (SOI) substrate, which includes a first portion of the semiconductor active layer. The sacrificial layer may be an electrically insulating layer. A multi-layer electrical interconnect network may be formed on the SOI substrate. This multi-layer electrical interconnect network may be encapsulated by an inorganic capping layer that contacts an upper surface of the first portion of the semiconductor active layer. This inorganic capping layer may be formed as an amorphous silicon layer or a metal layer, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">The capping layer and the first portion of the semiconductor active layer can be selectively etched to thereby expose the sacrificial layer. The sacrificial layer may then be selectively removed from between the first portion of the semiconductor active layer and the handling substrate to thereby define a suspended integrated circuit chip encapsulated by the capping layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">According to additional embodiments of the invention, encapsulating the electrical interconnect network may be preceded by roughening the upper surface of the first portion of the semiconductor active layer so that a greater level of adhesion can be achieved between the capping layer and the semiconductor active layer. In some embodiments of the invention, the upper surface may be roughened by exposing the upper surface to a plasma etchant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">According to additional embodiments of the invention, selectively etching through the semiconductor active layer and the sacrificial layer may include selectively etching the semiconductor active layer and the sacrificial layer in sequence to define a trench therein having a bottom that exposes the handling substrate. This trench, which can be a ring-shaped trench that surrounds the SOI substrate, can be filled with an inorganic anchor (e.g., semiconductor anchor) in advance of forming the multi-layer electrical interconnect network. For example, the trench can be filled by depositing a semiconductor layer into the trench and onto the SOI substrate and then planarizing the deposited semiconductor layer to define a semiconductor anchor. In addition, selectively removing the sacrificial insulating layer from between the first portion of the semiconductor active layer and the handling substrate may include exposing a sidewall of the semiconductor anchor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">In additional embodiments of the invention, the multi-layer electrical interconnect network includes a plurality of interlayer dielectric layers, which can be selectively etched to expose the anchor. The encapsulating step may also include depositing the inorganic capping layer directly onto the exposed anchor. In some of these embodiments of the invention, the inorganic capping layer is formed as amorphous silicon and the anchor is formed as polysilicon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">According to additional embodiments of the invention, a method of forming an integrated circuit device may include forming a semiconductor-on-insulator (SOI) substrate anchored at a periphery thereof to an underlying handling substrate. The SOI substrate includes a semiconductor active layer on an underlying sacrificial layer. The methods further include forming a multi-layer electrical interconnect network, which has a plurality of interlayer dielectric layers, on the SOI substrate. A step is performed to selectively etch through the plurality of interlayer dielectric layers to expose an upper surface of the SOI substrate. The multi-layer electrical interconnect network is then encapsulated with an inorganic capping layer (e.g., a-Si), which contacts the exposed upper surface of the SOI substrate. A step is performed to selectively etch through the capping layer and the semiconductor active layer to expose the sacrificial layer. Then, the sacrificial layer is removed from the SOI substrate to thereby suspend the semiconductor active layer from the handling substrate. According to some of these embodiments of the invention, the step of forming a semiconductor-on-insulator (SOI) substrate may include anchoring the SOI substrate to the underlying handling substrate using a ring-shaped polysilicon anchor. In addition, the step of removing the sacrificial layer may include removing the sacrificial layer from the SOI substrate to thereby expose a sidewall of the ring-shaped polysilicon anchor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">Methods of forming substrates according to additional embodiments of the invention include forming a plurality of spaced-apart sacrificial patterns on a first substrate, such as a glass, quartz, ceramic, plastic metal or semiconductor substrate, for example. A semiconductor layer is formed on the plurality of spaced-apart sacrificial patterns and on portions of the first substrate extending between sidewalls of the plurality of spaced-apart sacrificial patterns. The semiconductor layer is patterned to define openings therein. These openings expose respective ones of the plurality of spaced-apart sacrificial patterns. A step is performed to selectively etch the plurality of spaced-apart sacrificial patterns through the openings to thereby convert at least a first portion of the patterned semiconductor layer into a plurality of suspended semiconductor device layers. These suspended semiconductor device layers are anchored to a second portion of the patterned semiconductor layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">According to additional embodiments of the invention, the step of forming a plurality of spaced-apart sacrificial patterns includes forming a sacrificial layer on the first substrate and then roughening an upper surface of the sacrificial layer. The roughened surface of the sacrificial layer is then selectively etched to define the plurality of spaced-apart sacrificial patterns. In these embodiments of the invention, the step of forming a semiconductor layer includes depositing a semiconductor layer onto the roughened surface of the sacrificial layer. According to some of these embodiments of the invention, the roughening step may include exposing the surface of the sacrificial layer to a chemical etchant prior to cleaning. This sacrificial layer may include a material selected from a group consisting of molybdenum, aluminum, copper, nickel, chromium, tungsten, titanium and alloys thereof. In addition, the semiconductor layer may include a material selected from a group consisting of amorphous silicon, polycrystalline silicon, nanocrystalline silicon, and indium gallium zinc oxide, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">According to still further embodiments of the invention, the step of patterning the semiconductor layer includes selectively etching an upper surface of the semiconductor layer to define the openings. This step of selectively etching the upper surface of the semiconductor layer may be followed by printing the plurality of suspended semiconductor device layers onto a second substrate after the plurality of spaced-apart sacrificial patterns have been removed. This printing may be performed by contacting and bonding the upper surface of the semiconductor layer to the second substrate and then fracturing anchors between the plurality of suspended semiconductor device layers and the second portion of the patterned semiconductor layer by removing the first substrate from the second substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">Additional embodiments of the invention include printing substrates by forming a plurality of spaced-apart sacrificial patterns on a first substrate and then forming at least one thin-film transistor on each of the plurality of spaced-apart sacrificial patterns. A step is then performed to pattern a semiconductor layer associated with each of the plurality of thin-film transistors to define openings therein that expose respective ones of the plurality of spaced-apart sacrificial patterns. The plurality of spaced-apart sacrificial patterns are then selectively etched through the openings. This selective etching step converts at least a first portion of the patterned semiconductor layer into a plurality of suspended semiconductor device layers, which are anchored to a second portion of the patterned semiconductor layer. Following this step, the plurality of suspended semiconductor device layers are printed (e.g., contact bonded) onto a second substrate. The anchors between the plurality of suspended semiconductor device layers and the second portion of the patterned semiconductor layer are then fractured by removing the first and second substrates from each other. This fracturing step results in the formation of a plurality of separated semiconductor device layers that are bonded to the second substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">According to some of these embodiments of the invention, the step of forming at least one thin-film transistor includes forming source and drain electrodes of a first thin-film transistor on a first sacrificial pattern. An amorphous semiconductor layer is then formed on upper surfaces of the source and drain electrodes and on sidewalls of the first sacrificial pattern. An electrically insulating layer is then formed on the amorphous semiconductor layer and a gate electrode of the first thin-film transistor is formed on the electrically insulating layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">According to alternative embodiments of the invention, the step of forming at least one thin-film transistor includes forming a gate electrode of a first thin-film transistor on a first sacrificial pattern and then forming an electrically insulating layer on the gate electrode and on sidewalls of the first sacrificial pattern. An amorphous semiconductor layer is formed on the electrically insulating layer and source and drain electrodes of the first thin-film transistor are formed on the amorphous semiconductor layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">Additional embodiments of the invention include forming an array of suspended substrates by forming a plurality of spaced-apart sacrificial patterns on a first substrate. An amorphous semiconductor layer is formed on the plurality of spaced-apart sacrificial patterns and on portions of the first substrate extending between sidewalls of the plurality of spaced-apart sacrificial patterns. Portions of the amorphous semiconductor layer extending opposite the plurality of spaced-apart sacrificial patterns are then converted into respective semiconductor regions having higher degrees of crystallinity therein relative to the amorphous semiconductor layer. The amorphous semiconductor layer is patterned to define openings therein that expose respective ones of the plurality of spaced-apart sacrificial patterns. A step is then performed to selectively etch the plurality of spaced-apart sacrificial patterns through the openings to thereby convert at least a first portion of the patterned amorphous semiconductor layer into a plurality of suspended semiconductor device layers, which are anchored to a second portion of the patterned amorphous semiconductor layer. According to some embodiments of the invention, the converting step includes annealing the portions of the amorphous semiconductor layer extending opposite the plurality of spaced-apart sacrificial patterns. Alternatively, the converting step may include selectively exposing the portions of the amorphous semiconductor layer extending opposite the plurality of spaced-apart sacrificial patterns to laser light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">According to still further embodiments of the invention, the step of forming a plurality of spaced-apart sacrificial patterns includes forming a sacrificial layer on the first substrate and then roughening a surface of the sacrificial layer. A step is then performed to selectively etch the roughened surface of the sacrificial layer to define the plurality of spaced-apart sacrificial patterns. The step of forming an amorphous semiconductor layer includes depositing an amorphous semiconductor layer on the roughened surface of the sacrificial layer. The roughening step may include exposing the surface of the sacrificial layer to a chemical etchant prior to cleaning.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">The present invention now will be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as being limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">It will be understood that when an element or layer is referred to as being “on,” “connected to” or “coupled to” another element or layer (and variants thereof), it can be directly on, connected or coupled to the other element or layer or intervening elements or layers may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being “directly on,” “directly connected to” or “directly coupled to” another element or layer (and variants thereof), there are no intervening elements or layers present. Like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout. As used herein, the term “and/or” includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items and may be abbreviated as “/”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, third etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another region, layer or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">Spatially relative terms, such as “beneath,” “below,” “lower,” “above,” “upper” and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as “below” or “beneath” other elements or features would then be oriented “above” the other elements or features. Thus, the term “below” can encompass both an orientation of above and below. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the present invention. As used herein, the singular forms “a,” “an” and “the” are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms “comprising”, “including”, having” and variants thereof, when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof. In contrast, the term “consisting of” when used in this specification, specifies the stated features, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, and precludes additional features, steps, operations, elements and/or components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">Embodiments of the present invention are described herein with reference to cross-section and perspective illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments (and intermediate structures) of the present invention. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, embodiments of the present invention should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, a sharp angle may be somewhat rounded due to manufacturing techniques/tolerances.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the present invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.</div>

In some additional embodiments of the invention, a step may be performed to increase a roughness of an upper surface of the sacrificial layer <b>52</b> by exposing the upper surface to a chemical etchant for a sufficient duration to increase an average RMS roughness of the surface, prior to cleaning.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">As illustrated by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the sacrificial layer <b>52</b> is selectively etched using a mask (not shown) to define a plurality of spaced-apart sacrificial patterns <b>52</b>′ and expose portions of the underlying handling substrate <b>50</b>, as illustrated.

The functional layer <b>54</b> may be formed as a semiconductor layer, such as a polysilicon layer, an amorphous silicon layer, a nanocrystalline silicon layer, or an indium gallium zinc oxide layer. The amorphous silicon layer may be formed using a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) technique. Alternatively, the polysilicon layer, amorphous silicon layer, nanocrystalline silicon layer or indium gallium zinc oxide layer may be formed using sputtering techniques.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>, a patterned functional layer <b>54</b> is defined by selectively etching the functional layer <b>54</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> using a mask (not shown), to define a plurality of openings <b>56</b> therein that expose respective portions of the underlying sacrificial patterns <b>52</b>′.

This selective etching step may include exposing the sacrificial patterns <b>52</b>′ to a chemical etchant that passes through the openings in the functional layer <b>54</b> and removes the sacrificial patterns <b>52</b>′.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">As illustrated by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the removal of the sacrificial patterns <b>52</b>′ may result in the formation of a plurality of suspended semiconductor device layers <b>54</b> that are attached by respective pairs of anchors <b>58</b> to a surrounding semiconductor layer.

Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the semiconductor device layers <b>54</b> may be printed at spaced-apart locations onto a second substrate <b>60</b> using a bonding technique. This printing step may also include fracturing the device layers <b>54</b> at the respective anchors <b>58</b> by removing the handling substrate <b>50</b> from the second substrate <b>60</b>, so that the device layers <b>54</b> are provided at spaced locations on the second substrate <b>60</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6A-6C</figref>, additional embodiments of the invention include depositing a sacrificial layer onto a first substrate <b>60</b> (step 1) and then patterning the sacrificial layer to define a plurality of openings therein (step 2) that extend between respective sacrificial patterns <b>62</b>. A device layer <b>64</b> (e.g., amorphous semiconductor layer) is then deposited onto the patterned sacrificial layer and onto portions of the first substrate <b>60</b> exposed by the openings in the sacrificial layer (step 3). Portions of the device layer <b>64</b> are then treated by thermal and/or laser treatment. For example, in the event the device layer <b>64</b> is an amorphous silicon layer, then the portions of the device layer <b>64</b> extending opposite the plurality of spaced-apart sacrificial patterns <b>62</b> may be converted into respective semiconductor regions <b>65</b> having higher degrees of crystallinity therein relative to the surrounding amorphous silicon regions <b>64</b>′.</div>

These openings <b>68</b> expose respective ones of the plurality of spaced-apart sacrificial patterns <b>62</b>. The sacrificial patterns <b>62</b> are then selectively etched through the openings (step 5) to thereby convert at least a first portion of the patterned device layer (e.g., amorphous semiconductor layer) into a plurality of suspended semiconductor device layers <b>65</b>′ that are anchored to a second portion of the patterned device layer <b>64</b>′.
