<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">Reference will now be made in detail to exemplary embodiments of the disclosure, which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Hereinafter, embodiments according to the disclosure will be described with reference to the drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts. It is apparent that the described embodiments are some but not all of the embodiments of the present disclosure. Based on the disclosed embodiments, persons of ordinary skill in the art may derive other embodiments according to the present disclosure, all of which are within the scope of the present disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">Because of photoluminescence capabilities, quantum dots may be used in light emitting layers in light emitting diodes. Specifically, the structure of a quantum dot may include three parts, i.e., a core, a shell, and/or one or more organic ligands bonded to the core-shell structure through a chelate or other bonding manners. The core-shell provides photoluminescence properties for the quantum dot. The organic ligands can, on one hand, stabilize the core-shell structure and, on the other hand, enhance the ability of the core-shell structure to be dissolved or dispersed in organic solvents.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">The molecular structures of the organic ligands usually include a chelating group and an organic chain attached to the chelating group. However, when the organic chain and the quantum dots are contained in a light-emitting layer, the long organic chain may affect the photoluminescence properties of the core-shell structure of the quantum dots, which leads to reduced efficiency of the QD-LED and high turn-on voltages.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">As such, the organic chain with reduced length may be used to increase the efficiency of QD-LED and to lower the turn-on voltages of the QD-LED.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">The present disclosure provides a quantum dot organic ligand. The quantum dot organic ligand may also be referred to as, ligand, organic ligand, and/or QD organic ligand. The disclosed quantum dot organic ligands are applied to quantum dots (QDs) to form QD structure materials, and when these QD structure materials are further applied in quantum-dot-based light emitting diodes (QD-LEDs), the efficiency of the QD-LEDs can be improved and the turn-on voltage (i.e., light-up voltage) of the QD-LEDs can be lowered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">The detailed embodiments are explained as follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">A first aspect of the present disclosure provides a quantum dot organic ligand with the following structure:
<br/>
R1-(R2)<sub>n</sub>-R3
<br/>
where R1 can be a chelating group capable of chelating with a metal; R2 can be a group having a conjugated electron pair, where n is an integer equal to or greater than 1; and R3 can be an organic group.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">R1 is a chelating group capable of chelating with metal(s). The main role of R1 is to provide chelating ability, so that the QD organic ligand can be anchored to the QD core-shell. R1 may be, for example, a phosphine group, a phosphonic acid group, an amino group, a mercapto group, a hydroxyl group, etc. In one embodiment, R1 is a phosphine group or a phosphonic acid group. It should be noted that, the QD core-shell in the present disclosure can be formed with materials including, but not limited to: CdS, CdSe, CdTe, ZnSe, InP, PbS, CsPbCl<sub>3</sub>, CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>, CsPhI<sub>3</sub>, CsPbCl<sub>x</sub>Br<sub>3-x</sub>, CsPbBr<sub>x</sub>I<sub>3-x</sub>, CdS/ZnS, CdSe/ZnS, ZnSe, InP/ZnS, PbS/ZnS, CsPhCl<sub>3</sub>/ZnS, CsPbBr<sub>3</sub>/ZnS, CsPhI<sub>3</sub>/ZnS, CsPbClxBr<sub>3-x</sub>/ZnS, CsPbBrxl<sub>3-x</sub>/ZnS, and combination(s) thereof, where x is a positive integer and x&lt;3.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">R2 is a group having a conjugated electron pair, and n is an integer equal to or greater than 1. Due to presence of the conjugated electron pair in the R2 group, desirable organic ligand can be prepared. There is no particular restriction on R2, as long as it is a group containing one or more conjugated electron pairs, such as a conjugated diene, a benzene ring, a conjugated structure of a benzene ring and a double bond olefin, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">In one embodiment, R2 is a group with benzene ring structure. R2 can include one benzene ring structure, or two or more benzene ring structures. Alternatively, the R2 group can be a group having a condensed-ring aromatic hydrocarbon structure. The group having one benzene ring structure may be, for example, a benzene structure, a toluene structure, an ethylbenzene structure, etc. The group having two or more benzene ring structures may be, for example, biphenyl, terphenyl, or biphenyl or terphenyl having atom(s) substituted by alkyl. In addition to the structure using a single bond to bond multiple benzene rings, R2 can be a group having a condensed-ring aromatic hydrocarbon structure, such as, a naphthalene structure, an anthracene structure, a phenanthrene structure, and a pyrene structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">In addition to the groups described above, there are many groups having conjugated electron pair(s) that can be used as R2. For example, in some embodiments, the R2 group can be selected from: a fluorene structure, a polythiophene structure, a carbazole structure, a pyrrole structure, and an arylamine structure, and a derivative structure from any of the aforementioned structures. These structures have hole-transporting capabilities, and can improve the hole injection of the quantum dots.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">In one embodiment, R2 can include at least one structure selected from the following group: phenazine structure, quinoline structure, thiazole structure, benzimidazole structure, and triazole structure. The phenazine structure, quinoline structure, thiazole structure, benzimidazole structure, and triazole structure all have electron transport capabilities, and can improve the electronic injection of quantum dots.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">R2 can include other organic structures that have electron transport capabilities, for example, condensed ring structures like anthracene and naphthalene. In one embodiment, R2 can include a structure having a luminescence function itself, such as a 9,10-Di(2-naphthyl)anthracene structure and/or a rubrene structure. Further, R2 can include conjugated small molecule having a self-luminous structure, such as 4,4โฒ-Bis(2,2-diphenylvinyl)-1,1โฒ-biphenyl (i.e., DPVBi).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">R3 is an alkane group, which serves to improve the dissolving and dispersion of quantum dots in the solvents. The selection of the alkane group is not limited, and R3 can be a long-chain alkane group having more than 4 carbon atoms, or a short-chain alkane group having 4 or less carbon atoms.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">Selecting a long-chain alkane group as R3 may assist the dissolving and dispersion of quantum dots in the solvents. Accordingly, in one embodiment, R3 can be a long-chain alkane group.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0158">In air atmosphere, PEDOT:PSS (i.e., poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate) was spin-coated on the cleaned glass substrate at a speed of about 3000 rpm for about 1 minute. When the spin-coating was finished, the glass substrate was annealed in air at about 130ยฐ C. for 20 minutes, and the solvent that not volatized was dried. The glass substrate was then transferred to an argon glove box.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0159">3) Preparation of Hole Transport Layer</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0160">In the argon glove box, a toluene solvent of poly(N-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) were spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS film. The revolution speed was about 2500 rpm, and the spin-coating time duration was about 45 seconds. After the spin-coating was completed, the glass substrate was annealed in the glove box at about 120ยฐ C. for about 20 minutes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0161">4) Preparation of Light-Emitting Layer</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0162">The hexane solution containing QDs obtained according to any of Examples 2-4 and 6-7 (e.g., at a concentration of about 30 mg/mL) was spin-coated on the PVK film. The spin coating time duration was about 45 seconds. After the spin-coating was completed, the glass substrate was annealed in the glove box at about 130ยฐ C. for about 30 minutes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0163">5) Preparation of Electron Injection Layer</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0164">An ethanol solution containing ZnO nanoparticles (e.g., at a concentration of about 30 mg/mL) was spin-coated on the previously-formed quantum dot light emitting layer (e.g., at a speed of 1500 rpm for about 45 seconds), thus forming the electron injection layer. Particle size of the ZnO nanoparticles is at most 5 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0165">6) Cathode Vapor Deposition</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0167" num="0166">After the spin-coating was completed, the device was placed in a vacuum deposition chamber, to deposit aluminum cathode with a deposition thickness of about 200 nm. A light emitting diode was then obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0167">The QD-LEDs prepared according to Examples 8-12 respectively contain quantum dot structure materials prepared according to Examples 2-4 and 6-7.</div>
<heading id="h-0015">Example 13: Structure of a QD-LED</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0169" num="0168">This example provides a structure of a QD-LED. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a structure diagram illustrating an exemplary QD-LED according to various embodiments of the present disclosure. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the disclosed QD-LED may include, from bottom to top in sequence: a glass substrate <b>1</b>, an ITO electrode <b>2</b> formed on the surface of the glass substrate <b>1</b>, a hole injection layer <b>3</b>, a hole transport layer <b>4</b>, a light-emitting layer <b>5</b>, an electron injection layer <b>6</b>, and an aluminum layer <b>7</b>. The QD-LED in this example may be prepared according to Examples 8-12. The glass substrate <b>1</b> and the ITO electrode <b>2</b> may use existing glass substrate containing transparent ITO electrode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0170" num="0169">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, it is generally believed in the art that the light emitting-layer <b>5</b> include QD core-shells <b>51</b> and QD organic ligands <b>52</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic view illustrating an internal structure of the light-emitting layer <b>5</b>. The actual internal structure may be more complex than that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. For example, the QD core-shells <b>51</b> and the QD organic ligands <b>52</b> may be cluttered and mutually staggered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0171" num="0170">The QD-LEDs provided in the present disclosure may have two working principles, which are respectively shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5<i>a </i> </figref>and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5<i>b</i> </figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5<i>a </i> </figref>is a diagram illustrating an exemplary working principle of QD-LED according to various embodiments of the present disclosure; and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5<i>b </i> </figref>is a diagram illustrating another exemplary working principle of QD-LED according to various embodiments of the present disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0172" num="0171">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5<i>a</i> </figref>, the QD organic ligands <b>52</b> have conjugated electron pairs, leading to the occurrence of typical electron delocalization effects, which can improve the electron/hole transport. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5<i>a</i> </figref>, a hole h and an electron e can easily move through the QD organic ligands <b>52</b> to the core-shell structure <b>51</b> so that the hole h or the electron e may be further transported/conducted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0173" num="0172">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5<i>b</i> </figref>, the QD organic ligand <b>52</b> itself is a conjugated luminescent functional group. According to the mechanism of Fรถrster energy transfer, electrons e and holes h may form an exciton in the QD organic ligand <b>52</b>, the exciton transfers energy to the QD core-shell <b>51</b>, and then photons are emitted. In this way, the problem that difficult injection of holes/electrons into QD core-shell may be avoided. On the other hand, since the ligand and the QD core-shell are connected by chemical bonds, it is much easier for the exciton to transfer energy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0174" num="0173">According to the above two interpretations, the structure of quantum dot structure materials containing the organic ligands as disclosed in various embodiments of the present disclosure may improve the utilization of electrons and/or holes, which ultimately improves the efficiency of light-emitting diodes, and can also reduce the turn-on voltage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0175" num="0174">Testing results shown that, compared to QDs without conjugated electron pairs in the prior art, the light emitting diodes prepared according to Examples 8-12 have increased efficiency and decreased turn-on voltage. It should be noted that, the test methods from CIE 127-1997 โMeasurement of LEDsโ were applied to test the efficiency of the LEDs. Specifically, external quantum efficiency was measured. In addition, the turn-on voltage, or the light-up voltage, as used herein, refer to the voltage when the brightness of the QD-LED reaches 1 cd/m<sup>2</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0176" num="0175">Other embodiments of the disclosure will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the disclosure disclosed herein. It is intended that the specification and examples be considered as exemplary only, with a true scope and spirit of the disclosure being indicated by the claims.</div>
