<heading id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a bonding apparatus for bonding substrates together, a bonding system provided with the bonding apparatus, a bonding method using the bonding apparatus and a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, high integration of semiconductor devices has been advanced. In a case where a plurality of highly integrated semiconductor devices is arranged in a horizontal plane and is connected by wires for production, there is a concern that the wiring length is increased, the resistance of wires is increased, and the wiring delay is large.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Under the circumstances, there has been proposed the use of a three-dimensional integration technology that three-dimensionally stacks semiconductor devices. In this three-dimensional integration technology, two semiconductor wafers (hereinafter referred to as “wafers”) are bonded through the use of, e.g., a conventional bonding system. For example, the bonding system includes a surface modifying apparatus for modifying a surface of a wafer to be bonded, a surface hydrophilizing apparatus for hydrophilizing the surface of the wafer modified with the surface modifying apparatus, and a bonding apparatus for bonding the wafers whose surfaces are hydrophilized with the surface hydrophilizing apparatus. According to this bonding system, in the surface modifying apparatus, plasma treatment is performed on the surface of the wafer to modify the surface of the wafer. In the surface hydrophilizing apparatus, pure water is supplied to the surface of the wafer to hydrophilize the surface of the wafer. Thereafter, in the bonding apparatus, the wafers are bonded to each other by virtue of a van der Waals force and a hydrogen bond (intermolecular force).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">The bonding apparatus includes an upper chuck configured to hold one wafer (hereinafter referred to as “upper wafer”) on the lower surface thereof, a lower chuck installed under the upper chuck and configured to hold another wafer (hereinafter referred to as “lower wafer”) on the upper surface thereof, and a pressing member provided in the upper chuck and configured to press the central portion of the upper wafer. In such a bonding apparatus, in a state in which the upper wafer held by the upper chuck and the lower wafer held by the lower chuck are disposed to face each other, the central portion of the upper wafer and the central portion of the lower wafer are pressed and brought into contact with each other by the pressing member, whereby the central portions are bonded to each other to form a bonding area. Thereafter, a so-called bonding wave occurs in which the bonding area expands from the central portion of the wafer to the outer peripheral portion thereof. Thus, the upper wafer and the lower wafer are bonded.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to suppress distortion of the laminated wafer after bonding, it is preferable that the bonding wave is uniformly (i.e., concentrically) expanded from the central portion of the wafer toward the outer peripheral portion thereof. However, in the bonding apparatus described above, the bonding wave is not monitored. Therefore, even if the bonding wave is unevenly expanded, it is not possible to grasp such an uneven expansion. Accordingly, there is room for improvement in the wafer bonding process of the related art.</div>

<heading id="h-0007">1. Configuration of Bonding System</heading>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">In the bonding system <b>1</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, for example, two wafers W<sub>U </sub>and W<sub>L </sub>as substrates are bonded to each other. Hereinafter, the wafer arranged at the upper side is referred to as “upper wafer W<sub>U</sub>” as a first substrate, and the wafer arranged at the lower side is referred to as “lower wafer W<sub>L</sub>” as a second substrate. Furthermore, a surface of the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>to be bonded is referred to as a “front surface W<sub>U1</sub>”, and a surface opposite to the front surface W<sub>U1 </sub>is referred to as a “back surface W<sub>U2</sub>”. Similarly, a surface of the lower wafer W<sub>L </sub>to be bonded is referred to as a “front surface W<sub>L1</sub>”, and a surface opposite to the front surface W<sub>L1 </sub>is referred to as a “back surface W<sub>L2</sub>”.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">When bonding the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>and the lower wafer W<sub>L </sub>as will be described later, first, the central portion of the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>is pushed down and brought into contact with the central portion of the lower wafer W<sub>L</sub>. The central portion of the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>and the central portion of the lower wafer W<sub>L </sub>are bonded by virtue of an intermolecular force, whereby a bonding area is formed in the central portions of both wafers. Thereafter, a bonding wave is generated such that the bonding area expands from the central portions of both wafers W<sub>U </sub>and W<sub>L </sub>toward the outer peripheral portions thereof. Thus, the front surfaces W<sub>U1 </sub>and W<sub>L1 </sub>of the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>and the lower wafer W<sub>L </sub>are bonded to each other over the entire surfaces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">The sensors <b>175</b> are provided in the main body part <b>170</b> in order to grasp the bonding wave.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">Various sensors may be used as the sensors <b>175</b>. For example, reflection type fiber sensors may be used as the sensors <b>175</b>. In such a case, light is emitted from the sensors <b>175</b> toward the upper wafer W<sub>U</sub>, and the reflected light is received by the sensors <b>175</b> to measure a received light amount. By measuring the reception amount of the reflected light, it is possible to grasp the degree of orthogonality between the optical axis and the upper wafer W<sub>U</sub>. That is to say, when the amount of reflected light is small, the degree of orthogonality between the optical axis and the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>is large (the inclination of the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>is large). This means that the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>is detached from the upper chuck <b>140</b> and is not in contact with the lower wafer W<sub>L</sub>. On the other hand, when the amount of reflected light is large, the degree of orthogonality between the optical axis and the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>is small (the inclination of the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>is small). This means that the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>is detached from the upper chuck <b>140</b> and is in contact with the lower wafer W<sub>L</sub>. Therefore, by measuring the reflected light amount with the sensors <b>175</b>, it is possible to detect the contact state of the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>and the lower wafer W<sub>L </sub>in the sensors <b>175</b> (in other words, the state of the detachment of the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>from the upper chuck <b>140</b>). This makes it possible to grasp the bonding wave.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">For example, electrostatic capacitance sensors or distance measurement sensors may be used as the sensors <b>175</b>. In the case of using the electrostatic capacitance sensors, the distance between the upper chuck <b>140</b> and the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>can be measured by measuring the electrostatic capacitance with the upper wafer W<sub>U</sub>. In the case of using the distance measurement sensors, the distance between the upper chuck <b>140</b> and the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>can be measured by emitting a laser beam from the sensors <b>175</b> toward the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>and receiving the reflected light by the sensors <b>175</b>. By measuring the distance between the upper chuck <b>140</b> and the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>in this manner, it is possible to detect the contact state between the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>and the lower wafer W<sub>L </sub>in the sensors <b>175</b> (in other words, the state of the detachment of the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>from the upper chuck <b>140</b>). This makes it possible to grasp the bonding wave.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">For example, fluid sensors may be used as the sensors <b>175</b>. In this case, adsorbing pads (not shown) are provided in the main body part <b>170</b>. That is to say, the adsorbing pads may be provided at the positions of reference numeral “<b>175</b>” shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, and the sensors <b>175</b> may be provided in suction pipes (not shown) connected to the respective adsorbing pads. The adsorbing pads are not intended to adsorptively hold the upper wafer W<sub>U</sub>, but are configured to vacuum-draw the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>with a very low pressure, for example, about −10 kPa, that does not affect the bonding wave. The sensors <b>175</b> measure a flow rate or pressure of a gas flowing through the respective suction pipes. For example, when the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>is detached from the upper chuck <b>140</b>, the flow of the gas inside the suction pipes is changed, and the flow rate and pressure of the gas is changed. The sensors <b>175</b> can measure the change in gas flow inside the suction pipes and can detect the detachment of the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>from the upper chuck <b>140</b> (in other words, the contact state between the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>and the lower wafer W<sub>L</sub>). This makes it possible to grasp the bonding wave. The sensor <b>175</b> may be provided in the first suction pipes <b>172</b> <i>a </i>of the first suction portions <b>172</b> and the second suction pipes <b>173</b> <i>a </i>of the second suction portions <b>173</b>, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">As described above, the sensors <b>175</b> are disposed side by side between the first suction portions <b>172</b> and the second suction portions <b>173</b> in a concentric relationship with the main body part <b>170</b> at predetermined intervals in the circumferential direction. Next, the arrangement of the sensors <b>175</b> will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">The arrangement of the sensors <b>175</b> is determined according to the physical properties of the upper wafer W<sub>U</sub>, for example, the anisotropy such as Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is an explanatory view showing a state of expansion of a bonding area between wafers in the related art. The present inventors have found that as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the bonding area A is not concentrically expanded but is non-uniformly expanded when performing a bonding process. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a plan view of the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>held by the upper chuck <b>140</b> as viewed from below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">The upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>is a monocrystalline silicon wafer having a crystal direction of [100] in a direction perpendicular to the front surface W<sub>U1</sub>. The notch portion N of the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>is formed in the outer edge of the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>in a [011] crystal direction. The bonding area A is more rapidly expanded in directions of a 45° period (directions of 45°, 135°, 225° and 315° shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) (hereinafter sometimes referred to as “45° directions”) with reference to a direction oriented in a [010] crystal direction parallel to the front surface W<sub>U1 </sub>of the upper wafer W<sub>U</sub>, from the central portion of the upper wafer W<sub>U</sub>, rather than in directions of a 90° period (directions of 0°, 90°, 180° and 270° shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) (hereinafter sometimes referred to as “90° directions”) with reference to a direction oriented in a [0-11] crystal direction parallel to the front surface W<sub>U1 </sub>of the upper wafer W<sub>U</sub>, from the central portion of the upper wafer W<sub>U</sub>. As a result, the shape of the bonding area A, which was circular at the start of bonding (central portion bonding), is getting close to a quadrangle having vertices located in the 45° directions as the bonding area A is expanded.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">In the present embodiment, the eight sensors <b>175</b> are provided in a concentric relationship with the main body part <b>170</b>. That is to say, the sensors <b>175</b> are provided in the 90° directions and the 45° directions. Therefore, by detecting the detachment of the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>from the upper chuck <b>140</b> with the sensors <b>175</b> and detecting the bonding area A shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, it is possible to grasp the bonding wave.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">The detection results of the sensors <b>175</b> are outputted to the control part <b>70</b>.

The horizontal axis in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref> represents the elapsed time of the bonding process, and the vertical axis represents the output result of the sensors <b>175</b>, namely the position of the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>relative to the upper chuck <b>140</b>. When the detection result of the sensors <b>175</b> is P<b>1</b> (when the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>is close to the upper chuck <b>140</b>), the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>is in contact with the upper chuck <b>140</b> at the positions of the sensors <b>175</b>, and the bonding area A is not reached. When the detection result of the sensors <b>175</b> is P<b>2</b> (when the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>is far from the upper chuck <b>140</b>), the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>is separated from the upper chuck <b>140</b> at the positions of the sensors <b>175</b> and is in contact with the lower wafer W<sub>L</sub>. Thus, the bonding area A is reached.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> shows a case where the bonding area A is uneven and is expanded in a substantially quadrangular shape as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. As described above, the bonding area A is expanded faster in the 45° directions than in the 90° directions. Therefore, a time difference ΔT between the timing when the bonding area A is reached in the 45° directions and the timing when the bonding area A is reached in the 90° directions increases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">Therefore, in order to make the expansion of the bonding area A uniform, the control part <b>70</b> performs control so that the time difference ΔT falls within a predetermined threshold value as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>. There is a correlation between the time difference ΔT and the distortion of the laminated wafer W<sub>T </sub>after bonding. The predetermined threshold value of ΔT is set from the allowable range of distortion of the laminated wafer W<sub>T</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">Specifically, the control of the control part <b>70</b> includes delaying the timing at which the second suction portions <b>173</b> release the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>in the 45° directions, and advancing the timing at which the second suction portions <b>173</b> release the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>in the 90° directions. Thus, at the positions of the eight sensors <b>175</b>, the timings at which the bonding area A is reached can be made substantially the same. Therefore, it is possible to make the expansion of the bonding area A uniform and to make the bonding wave (nearly concentric shape) uniform.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">In the present embodiment, the case where the suction timing of the second suction portions <b>173</b> is controlled based on the detection result of the sensors <b>175</b> has been described.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">First, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the actuator part <b>191</b> is lowered by the cylinder part <b>192</b> of the pressing member <b>190</b>.

Furthermore, since the front surface W<sub>U1 </sub>of the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>and the front surface W<sub>L1 </sub>of the lower wafer W<sub>L </sub>have been hydrophilized in steps S<b>2</b> and S<b>7</b>, respectively, the hydrophilic groups existing between the front surfaces W<sub>U1 </sub>and W<sub>L1 </sub>are hydrogen-bonded (which generates an intermolecular force).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, in addition to the sensors <b>175</b> provided between the first suction portions <b>172</b> and the second suction portions <b>173</b>, a plurality of, for example, eight, sensors <b>175</b> may be arranged side by side at the inner peripheral side of the main body part <b>170</b> inward of the second suction portions <b>173</b> in a concentric relationship with the main body part <b>170</b> at predetermined intervals in the circumferential direction. That is to say, one set of paired sensors <b>175</b>, the central portion of the first suction portion <b>172</b> and the central portion of the second suction portion <b>173</b> are arranged along the central line of the main body part <b>170</b>. In the following description, the sensors <b>175</b> arranged between the first suction portions <b>172</b> and the second suction portions <b>173</b> are referred to as “sensors <b>175</b> <i>a</i>”. The sensors <b>175</b> arranged at the inner peripheral side of the second suction portions <b>173</b> are referred to as “sensors <b>175</b> <i>b”. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">In this case, the suction timings of the second suction portions <b>173</b> lying on the same central line as the sensors <b>175</b> <i>b </i>can be controlled based on the detection result of the sensors <b>175</b> <i>b</i>. Accordingly, it is possible to perform feed-forward control of the second suction portions <b>173</b> in real time and to make the bonding wave uniform in a more reliable manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">In some embodiments, the sensors <b>175</b> <i>a </i>may be omitted and only the sensors <b>175</b> <i>b </i>may be provided. However, since the sensor <b>175</b> <i>a </i>are disposed away from the central portion of the main body part <b>170</b>, it is possible for the sensors <b>175</b> <i>a </i>to more reliably grasp the non-uniform expansion of the bonding area A than the sensors <b>175</b> <i>b</i>. Specifically, for example, when the diameter of the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>is 300 mm, the sensors <b>175</b> <i>a </i>may be arranged beyond the diameter of 240 mm from the central portion of the main body part <b>170</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in the related art, the bonding area A is expanded in a substantially quadrilateral shape. Taking into consideration the symmetry of expansion of the bonding area A, the number of sensors <b>175</b> may be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref>, two sensors <b>175</b> may be arranged in a line on the circumference of the main body part <b>170</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0136">However, if the sensors <b>175</b> are provided over the entire circumference of the main body part <b>170</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, it is possible to grasp the size of the gap between the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>and the lower wafer W<sub>L</sub>. In this regard, the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>and the lower wafer W<sub>L </sub>are not precisely parallel but may be inclined by a minute distance, for example several μm. In this case, as the distance between the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>and the lower wafer W<sub>L </sub>grows larger, air more easily escapes to the outside. Thus, the bonding area A expands rapidly. Even if there is a difference in expansion of the bonding area A, if the sensors <b>175</b> are provided on the entire circumference of the main body part <b>170</b>, it is possible to appropriately grasp the bonding wave.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">In the above embodiment, the contact state between the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>and the lower wafer W<sub>L </sub>is detected using the sensors <b>175</b>, thereby grasping the bonding wave. In some embodiments, the displacement of the actuator part <b>191</b> may be measured to grasp the bonding wave.

When the displacement measured by the laser displacement meter <b>300</b> reaches a predetermined threshold value, it is detected that the central portion of the upper wafer W<sub>U </sub>and the central portion of the lower wafer W<sub>L </sub>are in contact with each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139">The start of the bonding area A can be grasped on the basis of the measurement result obtained by the laser displacement meter <b>300</b> in this manner.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0149" num="0148">Although the preferred embodiments of the present disclosure have been described above with reference to the accompanying drawings, the present disclosure is not limited to such embodiments. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications or changes may be conceived within the scope of the idea described in the claims. It is to be understood that such modifications or changes naturally fall within the technical scope of the present disclosure. The present disclosure is not limited to these embodiments but may take various forms. The present disclosure may also be applied to a case where the substrate is a substrate other than the wafer, such as an FPD (flat panel display), a mask reticle for a photomask or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0150" num="0149">According to the present disclosure in some embodiments, a substrate detection part can detect that a first substrate held by a first holding part is detached from the first holding part. When the first substrate is detached, the first substrate is dropped down and brought into contact with a second substrate. The first substrate and the second substrate are bonded by virtue of an intermolecular force. Accordingly, by detecting the detachment of the first substrate, it is possible to grasp a bonding wave and to inspect a state of the bonding process of the substrates. Further, for example, if the bonding wave is uniform (the state of the bonding process is normal), the bonding process may be continuously performed. On the other hand, for example, if the bonding wave is non-uniform (the state of the bonding process is abnormal), the bonding process may be performed by correcting a process condition. Therefore, according to the present disclosure, it is possible to appropriately perform the bonding process</div>
