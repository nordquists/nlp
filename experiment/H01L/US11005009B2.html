<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">Example embodiments will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings; however, they may be embodied in different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey exemplary implementations to those skilled in the art. The embodiments (or portions thereof) may be combined to form additional embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">In the drawings, the dimensions of layers and regions may be exaggerated for clarity of illustration. It will also be understood that when a layer or element is referred to as is being “on” another layer or substrate, it can be directly on the other layer or substrate, or intervening layers may also be present. Further, it will be understood that when a layer is referred to as being “under” another layer, it can be directly under, and one or more intervening layers may also be present. In addition, it will also be understood that when a layer is referred to as being “between” two layers, it can be the only layer between the two layers, or one or more intervening layers may also be present. Like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">When an element is referred to as being “connected” or “coupled” to another element, it can be directly connected or coupled to the another element or be indirectly connected or coupled to the another element with one or more intervening elements interposed therebetween. In addition, when an element is referred to as “including” a component, this indicates that the element may further include another component instead of excluding another component unless there is different disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a bar-type LED <b>10</b> which includes an active layer <b>12</b> between first and second conductive semiconductor layers <b>11</b> and <b>13</b>.

The second electrode may be electrically connected to the second conductive semiconductor layer <b>13</b>. For example, the first electrode may be electrically connected to the bar-type LED <b>10</b> through one surface of the first conductive semiconductor layer <b>11</b> (in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a lower surface of the bar-type LED <b>10</b>), which is not covered by the insulating film <b>14</b>.

The material of the first conductive semiconductor layer <b>11</b> may be different in another embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">The active layer <b>12</b> is on the first conductive semiconductor layer <b>11</b> and may be formed to have a single- or multiple-quantum well structure. In some embodiments, a clad layer doped with a conductive dopant may be formed over and/or under the active layer <b>12</b>. For example, the clad layer may be implemented as an AlGaN layer or InAlGaN layer. In one embodiment, a material such as AlGaN or AlInGaN may be used for the active layer <b>12</b>. If an electric field having a predetermined voltage or more is applied to different ends of the bar-type LED <b>10</b>, the bar-type LED <b>10</b> emits light based on a combination of electron-hole pairs in the active layer <b>12</b>.</div>

Further, when the insulating film <b>14</b> is formed, it is possible to reduce or minimize surface defects of the bar-type LED <b>10</b>, and thus improve lifespan and efficiency. Furthermore, when a plurality of bar-type LEDs <b>10</b> are densely arranged, insulating film <b>14</b> may prevent an undesired short circuit from occurring between bar-type LEDs <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">The above-described bar-type LED <b>10</b> may be used as a light emitting source for various light emitting devices.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">The timing controller <b>110</b> receives various control signals and image data, for driving the light emitting display panel <b>140</b>, from an outside source (e.g., a system for transmitting image data). The timing controller <b>110</b> realigns the received image data and transmits the realigned image data to the data driver <b>130</b>. Also, the timing controller <b>110</b> generates scan control signals and data control signals for driving respective scan and data drivers <b>120</b> and <b>130</b>. The generated scan and data control signals are transmitted to the scan and data drivers <b>120</b> and <b>130</b>, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">The scan driver <b>120</b> receives a scan control signal from the timing controller <b>110</b> and generates a scan signal corresponding to the scan control signal.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">The pixels <b>142</b> emit light with luminance that correspond to the input data signals during each frame period. A pixel <b>142</b> that receives a data signal corresponding to a black luminance does not emit light during a corresponding frame period, thereby displaying black grayscale value.

In some embodiments, the self-alignment of the bar-type LED nLED may be induced as a DC or AC voltage is applied to the first and second electrodes <b>210</b> and <b>220</b>. For example, when a voltage is applied to the first and second electrodes <b>210</b> and <b>220</b>, dipolarity is induced to the bar-type LED nLED by an electric field between the first and second electrodes <b>210</b> and <b>220</b>.
