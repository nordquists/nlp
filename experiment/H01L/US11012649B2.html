<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div html="" itemprop="content"><abstract lang="EN" load-source="docdb" mxw-id="PA448561863" source="national office">
<div class="abstract">A control pulse is generated a first control signal line coupled to a transfer gate of a pixel to enable photocharge accumulated within a photosensitive element of the pixel to be transferred to a floating diffusion node, the first control signal line having a capacitive coupling to the floating diffusion node. A feedthrough compensation pulse is generated on a second signal line of the pixel array that also has a capacitive coupling to the floating diffusion node. The feedthrough compensation pulse is generated with a pulse polarity opposite the pulse polarity of the control pulse and is timed to coincide with the control pulse such that capacitive feedthrough of the control pulse to the floating diffusion node is reduced.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates to the field of integrated-circuit image sensors.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Low-light performance continues to be a challenge for CMOS image sensors. In particular, as pixel geometries continue to shrink, second-order sampling inaccuracies have caused readout noise to climb. And, while the SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) loss is somewhat countered in medium-to-bright light conditions by increased resolution, in office lighting conditions, the reduced electron capture of small pixels pushes signal levels so low that readout noise is dominating performance at a wider range of the illumination spectrum.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">Image sensors that compensate for disruptive control-signal feedthrough during pixel readout operations are disclosed in various embodiments. More specifically, one or more feedthrough compensation signals are asserted in combination with readout-control signals in a number of embodiments to null (i.e., negate, cancel or substantially reduce) control-signal feedthrough to the floating diffusion node of a four-transistor (4T) pixel. By this operation, the substantial delay otherwise required for feedthrough settling is eliminated (or at least significantly reduced), permitting a dramatically shortened time between successive samples of the floating diffusion in a correlated double-sampling (CDS) operation and thus provide reduction of pixel readout noise. In a number of embodiments, the time between “reset-state” sampling or readout and “signal-state” sampling or readout are brought close to overlap, yielding nanoseconds-order CDS time and sub 1-electron pixel read-out. In other embodiments, the compressed CDS time is leveraged to enable novel readout architectures and techniques, including correlated photon counting without the use of noisy (and slow to recover) avalanche sensors. To accommodate and exploit the different noise considerations and delay times that bear on low-light and brighter light pixel signals, two or more separate pixel readout paths are provided to speculatively readout accumulated photocharge (i.e., reading out via at least one path on the speculation that a low-signal level of photocharge has accumulated, and via the other path on the speculation that a higher-signal level of photocharge has been accumulated) with post-readout selection of a finalized pixel value. As discussed below, different amplification levels, ADC operation, pixel conversion gain, timing and so forth may be applied with respect to such “bifurcated” readout-path embodiments (though more than two readout paths may be provided), with varying degrees of parallelism between the two paths. In yet other embodiments, different conversion gains are applied with respect to low-signal and higher-signal readout paths, thus further reducing low-signal noise without compromising dynamic range. These and other embodiments, features and configurations are described in greater detail below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">Pixel Architectures/Readout Modes Enhanced by Feedthrough Compensation</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> illustrate exemplary embodiments of single-mode and dual-mode pixels (<b>90</b> and <b>100</b>, respectively) to which various feedthrough compensation and readout techniques and architectures may be applied. As shown, both pixels include a photodiode <b>110</b> (a pinned photodiode in this example) and floating diffusion node <b>112</b> switchably interconnected via transfer gate <b>101</b>. A reset transistor <b>109</b>, controlled by reset-gate line (RG) is coupled between the floating diffusion node and a supply voltage rail (Vdd or Vdd-pix, for example), and a source-follower transistor <b>105</b> and row-select transistor <b>107</b> are coupled as shown between the supply voltage rail and a pixel output line, a signal line referred to herein as “pixout” that extends column-wise across the pixel array (i.e., array of pixels <b>90</b> or <b>100</b>) to a readout circuit block. As shown, floating diffusion node <b>112</b> in both single-mode pixel <b>90</b> and dual-mode pixel <b>100</b> is coupled to the gate of the source-follower transistor <b>105</b> which is coupled in turn to the pixout line via the row-select transistor <b>107</b>. By this arrangement, when row-select transistor is turned on (RS is asserted), a constant load current flowing on the pixout line generates a voltage on the pixout line that follows (i.e., rises and falls according to) the voltage produced by the charge level of the floating diffusion node. Accordingly, the level of photocharge accumulated (or integrated) within the photodiode over a given interval may be ascertained by switching on the transfer gate to enable photocharge transfer from photodiode <b>110</b> to floating diffusion node <b>112</b> (which is generally reset or precharged to draw the accumulated photocharge off the photodiode when the transfer gate <b>101</b> is switched on) and asserting RS to yield a signal representative of the floating diffusion voltage produced by the charge level on the pixout line. Because of its capacitive/floating character, floating diffusion node <b>112</b> is susceptible to the many sources of noise in the pixel array and host image sensor. Accordingly, in a number of embodiments herein, photocharge readout is accomplished in a two-phase “correlated double-sampling” operation in which a noise signal and photocharge+noise signal are sampled one after the other and then differenced to cancel the noise component. More specifically, prior to photocharge transfer, the floating diffusion is reset (e.g., coupled to Vdd or Vdd-pix via reset-transistor <b>109</b> in response to RG assertion) and then the reset-state of the floating diffusion node (i.e., reset including kTC noise level) is captured in an analog or digital sampling (or conversion) operation. After the reset-state capture, photocharge is transferred by activation of transfer gate <b>101</b> to establish the “signal state” of the floating diffusion, which includes the reset-state/noise level plus the photocharge level floating diffusion. The signal-state is then captured so that, in either the analog or digital domain, the reset-state measurement may be subtracted from the signal-state measurement to cancel/negate the reset-state component and thus yield the desired photocharge signal level. As the readout of the floating diffusion level for both the reset and signal states is subject to various high-frequency and low-frequency noise sources, noise cancellation efficacy of the correlated double-sampling (CDS) operation is highly dependent on the temporal proximity of the reset-state and signal-state samples. As discussed in further detail below, this proximity or “CDS time,” is constrained by numerous factors relating to settling times for the floating diffusion node and/or pixout lines following floating diffusion reset and photocharge transfer events.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">In the case of single-mode pixel <b>90</b>, a row-based transfer-gate control signal (TG) is coupled directly to transfer gate <b>101</b> as shown. When TG is raised, transfer gate <b>101</b> is switched on and photocharge transfer is commenced. By contrast, dual-mode pixel <b>100</b> includes both row-based and column-based transfer-gate control signals, TGr and TGc, which act in combination to permit row and column control over the transfer gate (e.g., via transfer-enable transistor and alternatives as discussed below) and thus column-by-column selectivity regarding photocharge transfer from the photodiode to floating diffusion. As discussed below, this column-selectivity permits pixels within a selected row of a pixel array to be “conditionally” readout—that is, readout only if a threshold level of photocharge is determined to have accumulated within the pixel's photodiode over a given frame or subframe interval. By forcing the TGc signal on (or even holding it high), the dual-mode pixel may be readout “unconditionally,” in effect operating in the “unconditional” readout mode of the single-mode pixel. Thus, while single-mode pixel <b>90</b> is readout unconditionally in response to TG assertion, dual mode pixel <b>100</b> may be readout conditionally or unconditionally at any readout interval. The following sections describe the conditional-read operation in greater detail to provide insight into particular challenges that may apply as the various single-mode-pixel CDS compression techniques and bifurcated readout techniques and architectures disclosed herein are applied to dual mode pixels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates an exemplary column readout circuit and logic together with the dual mode pixel described above. As shown, column read-out circuit and logic <b>150</b> includes a sample-and-hold circuit block <b>153</b> (e.g., including switches and capacitive elements for sampling and temporarily holding analog signals output onto read-out line, pixout) and a comparator/ADC circuit block <b>155</b>. During an overthreshold detection operation, a phase of a conditional-read operation that may precede or be executed after reset-state sampling, a transfer-enable signal (TGcEn) is pulsed concurrently with application of partial-on potential (V<sub>TG-Partial</sub>) on transfer gate line TGr. The transfer-enable pulse passes through logic OR gate <b>159</b> to drive TGc high, thus switching on transfer-enable transistor <b>103</b> so that V<sub>TG-Partial </sub>is applied to transfer gate <b>101</b>, thereby enabling a partial charge transfer to floating diffusion <b>112</b> as discussed below. Signal levels representative of the charge state of floating diffusion <b>112</b> (and thus photodiode <b>110</b> following the partial charge-transfer operation) are captured within sample and hold block <b>153</b> and supplied to comparator <b>157</b> within comparator/ADC block <b>155</b>. The output of comparator <b>157</b> is supplied, via logic OR gate <b>159</b>, to the TGc control line so that, after TGcEn goes low, TGc either remains high or goes low according to whether the charge integration state within photodiode <b>110</b> exceeds or does not exceed a conditional-read threshold (“CR Threshold”).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">If an overthreshold condition is detected (i.e., output of comparator <b>157</b> is high so that TGc remains asserted after TGcEn goes low), a subsequent assertion of a full-transfer control potential, V<sub>TG-Full</sub>, on row control line TGr enables a full charge transfer from photodiode <b>110</b> to floating diffusion node <b>112</b> and thus a full read-out of the photodiode state. More specifically, pixout is driven according to floating diffusion charge level and an analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) operation is selectively enabled within an ADC circuit (not specifically shown) of comparator/ADC logic <b>155</b>. By contrast, if the partial-read result indicates an under-threshold condition (i.e., output of comparator <b>157</b> low), TGc will go low at deassertion of TGcEn, thereby switching off transfer-enable transistor <b>103</b> to prevent application of V<sub>TG-Full </sub>at transfer gate <b>101</b> and thus disabling/suppressing photocharge transfer (i.e., preventing/bypassing the full-read operation). Accordingly, photocharge integrated within an underthreshold pixel will remain in photodiode <b>110</b> until a subsequent read-out operation, effectively lengthening the exposure interval for that pixel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">Referring again to dual-mode pixel <b>100</b> (also referred to herein as a “conditional-read” pixel), a row-select transistor <b>107</b> is coupled between the source follower <b>105</b> and the read-out line (pixout) to enable multiplexed access to the column read-out line by respective rows of pixels within the larger pixel array. That is, row-select lines (“RS”) are coupled to the control inputs of row-select transistors <b>107</b> within respective rows of pixels and operated on a one-hot basis to select one row of pixels for sense/read-out operations at a time. A reset transistor <b>109</b> is also provided within the pixel to enable the floating diffusion to be switchably coupled to the supply rail (i.e., when a reset-gate line (RG) is activated) and thus reset. The photodiode itself may be reset along with the floating diffusion by fully switching on transfer gate <b>101</b> (e.g., by asserting TGc while TGr is high) and reset transistor <b>109</b> concurrently, or by connecting the photodiode to a reset-state floating diffusion. These reset and row-select operations also apply within the single-mode pixel of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">Still referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, various charge-transfer control arrangements may be used instead of transfer-enable gate <b>103</b>. In one embodiment, shown for example at <b>165</b>, transfer-enable transistor <b>103</b> is replaced by a second section of a split transfer gate in which part of the gate is controlled by TGc and the other part by TGr, requiring both signals to be at least partially asserted in order to lower the electrostatic barrier between the photodiode and floating diffusion. This “split-gate” arrangement enables application of a negative TGr voltage (and/or deassertion of TGc) during charge accumulation, for example, to more fully block the transfer path between photodiode <b>110</b> and floating diffusion <b>112</b>. Also, the split-gate embodiment permits TGc to be deasserted during photocharge integration without floating the transfer-gate (i.e., as would happen upon lowering TGc in an embodiment employing transfer-enable transistor <b>103</b>). In another embodiment, shown at <b>167</b>, the TGc potential may be directly coupled to a pinning layer of photodiode <b>110</b>, thus raising and lowering the potential of the photodiode relative to the electrostatic barrier formed by transfer gate <b>101</b>. In yet another embodiment, transfer-enable transistor <b>103</b> may be implemented by a P-type transistor (as opposed to the N-type transistor shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>), also enabling negative voltages to be applied via TGr. In that case, OR gate <b>159</b> may be replaced by a NOR gate to establish the desired active-low TGc assertion state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">To reduce pixel footprint (i.e., die consumption area), a single floating diffusion node and corresponding read-out/reset circuitry (i.e., transistors <b>105</b>, <b>107</b>, <b>109</b>) may be shared by two or more pixels in a “pixel unit cell,” thus reducing the per-pixel transistor count and enabling charge-binned (reduced spatial resolution) imaging modes. As shown in detail view <b>115</b>, for example, a single floating diffusion node <b>112</b> <i>s </i>is shared by a column of four pixels (denoted by respective photodiodes PD<b>1</b>-PD<b>4</b>), as is read-out circuitry formed by amplifier transistor <b>105</b> <i>s </i>and row-select transistor <b>107</b> <i>s </i>and reset transistor <b>109</b> <i>s</i>. In this four-row by one-column “4×1” pixel unit cell (various others are possible, including configurations that span two or more columns of pixels), four pixels are implemented by a total of eleven transistors (four of which are transfer gates <b>101</b>), thus effecting an average transistor count of 2.75 (i.e., “2.75T”) per pixel. Similar “shared floating diffusion” pixel unit cells may be implemented with respect to the single-mode pixel of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. Also, as discussed in greater detail below, the TG, TGr and TGc lines may be routed in both single-mode and dual-mode pixel arrays to achieve nominally uniform capacitive coupling between the respective TG control lines and gates to shared floating diffusion <b>112</b> <i>s </i>and thus enable controlled feedthrough nulling through assertion of nulling signals on one or more otherwise inactive row-based transfer-gate lines.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a timing diagram illustrating an exemplary pixel readout cycle within the dual mode (or “conditional-read”) pixel of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. As shown, the pixel readout cycle is split into five intervals or phases corresponding to distinct operations executed to conditionally read out or refrain from reading out the pixel state. In the first phase (phase 1), a reset operation is executed within the photodiode <b>110</b> and floating diffusion <b>112</b> by concurrently asserting the appropriate logic high signals on the TGr, TGc and RG lines to switch on transfer-enable transistor <b>103</b>, transfer gate <b>101</b> and reset transistor <b>109</b>, thereby switchably coupling photodiode <b>110</b> to the supply rail via transfer gate <b>101</b>, floating diffusion <b>112</b> and reset transistor <b>109</b> (the illustrated sequence can begin with an unconditional reset (e.g., at the start of a frame interval), and can also begin from a preceding conditional read-out/reset operation). To conclude the reset operation, the TGr and RG signals (i.e., signals applied on like-named signal lines) are lowered to appropriate “off” levels, thereby switching off transfer gate <b>101</b> (and reset transistor <b>109</b>) so that the photodiode is enabled to accumulate (or integrate) charge in response to incident light in the ensuing integration phase (phase 2). Lastly, although the row-select signal goes high during the reset operation shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, this is merely a consequence of an implementation-specific row decoder that raises the row-select signal whenever a given row address is decoded in connection with a row-specific operation (e.g., raising the TGr and RG signals during reset directed to a given row). In an alternative embodiment, the row decoder may include logic to suppress assertion of the row-select signal during reset as indicated by the dashed RS pulse in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Additionally, the reset transistor may be left on or partially on during the integration phase.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">At the conclusion of the integration phase, correlated double sampling is executed with respect to the floating diffusion to effect a conditional or unconditional read operation. Starting with the conditional-read case, the floating diffusion is reset (i.e., by pulsing the RG signal to couple the floating diffusion to the supply rail) and then sampled by a sample-and-hold element within the column read-out circuit. This “reset-state” sampling operation (shown as phase 3 in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), in effect, samples the reset-state of floating diffusion <b>110</b> and is executed in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 2</figref> by asserting the row-select signal (RS) for the pixel row of interest while pulsing a reset-state sample-and-hold signal (SHR) to convey the state of floating diffusion <b>110</b> to the sample-and-hold element (e.g., a switch-accessed capacitive element, not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) within the column read-out circuit via read-out line, pixout.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">After acquiring the reset-state sample in phase 3 of a conditional-read operation, an overthreshold detection operation is executed in phase 4 by raising the TGr line to the partially-on, “overthreshold-detection” potential, V<sub>TG-Partial</sub>, concurrently with switching on transfer-enable transistor <b>103</b> (i.e., by asserting a logic high TGc signal as discussed above). By this operation, V<sub>TG-Partial </sub>is applied to transfer gate <b>101</b> to switch the transfer gate to a “partial on” state (“TG partial on”). Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, electrostatic potential diagrams for a photodiode (a pinned photodiode in this example), transfer gate and floating diffusion (corresponding to photodiode <b>110</b>, transfer gate <b>101</b> and floating diffusion <b>112</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) are shown at <b>181</b> and <b>183</b> to illustrate underthreshold (low-light) and overthreshold (brighter-light) read-out operations, respectively. Note that the depicted levels of electrostatic potential are not intended to be an accurate representation of the levels produced in an actual or simulated device, but rather a general (or conceptual) representation to illustrate the operation of the pixel read-out phases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">Starting with underthreshold/low-light example <b>181</b>, the level of charge accumulated within the photodiode at the time of the overthreshold detection operation (phase 4) does not rise to the threshold level required for charge to spill over (i.e., be transferred) to the floating diffusion via the shallow channel potential (<b>187</b>) of the partially-on transfer gate. Accordingly, because the accumulated charge level does not exceed the transfer threshold (or spillover threshold) established by application of V<sub>TG-Partial </sub>to the control node of transfer gate <b>101</b>, there is no charge transfer from the photodiode to the floating diffusion and the accumulated charge instead remains undisturbed within the photodiode. By contrast, in overthreshold/bright-light example <b>183</b>, the higher level of accumulated charge does exceed the transfer threshold so that a portion of the accumulated charge (i.e., that subset of charge carriers that are above the transfer gate partially-on electrostatic potential) spills over into floating diffusion node <b>112</b>, with the residual accumulated charge remaining within the photodiode as shown at <b>188</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">Still referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, prior to conclusion of overthreshold detection phase 4, the charge level of the floating diffusion is sampled and held within a signal-state sample-and-hold element (i.e., in response to assertion of signal SHS) to yield a threshold-test sample—the difference between the signal-state sample and the previously obtained reset-state sample and thus a correlated double sample—to be evaluated with respect to a conditional-reset threshold as described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">In one embodiment, the conditional-read threshold is an analog threshold (e.g., to be compared with the threshold-test sample in a sense amplifier in response to assertion of a compare/convert strobe signal) set or programmed to a setting above the sampling noise floor, but low enough to enable detection of minute charge spillover via the shallow transfer gate channel. Alternatively, the threshold-test sample may be digitized in response to assertion of the compare/convert signal (e.g., within an analog-to-digital converter that is also used to generate the finalized pixel sample value) and then compared with a digital conditional-reset threshold, again, set (or programmed to a setting) above the noise floor, but low enough to enable detection of trace charge spillover.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">However evaluated, if the threshold-test sample indicates that no detectable spillover occurred (i.e., threshold-test sample value is less than conditional-reset threshold), the photodiode is deemed to be in the underthreshold state shown in the low-light example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and the TGc line is held low in the ensuing conditional read-out phase (phase 5, the final phase) to disable transfer gate <b>101</b> for the remainder of the conditional read-out operation—in effect, disabling further read-out from photodiode <b>103</b> and thus enabling the photodiode to continue integrating charge without disruption for at least another sampling interval. By contrast, if the threshold-test sample indicates an overthreshold condition (i.e., threshold-test sample greater than conditional-reset/transfer threshold), then the TGc line is pulsed high, (or alternately is maintained high) during the conditional read-out phase concurrently with application of a fully-on, “remainder-transfer” potential, V<sub>TG-Full</sub>, to the TGr line, thereby enabling the remainder of the charge (i.e., charge <b>188</b> as shown in the bright-light example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) within photodiode <b>110</b> to be transferred to floating diffusion <b>112</b> via the full-depth transfer-gate channel (<b>189</b>). By this operation, between the overthreshold transfer in phase 4 and the remainder transfer in phase 5, the charge accumulated within the photodiode since the hard reset in phase 1 is fully transferred to the floating diffusion where it may be sensed in a pixel read-out operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">In the embodiment shown, the pixel-readout operation is effected by pulsing the SHS signal in read-out phase 5 to capture the post-charge-transfer signal-state of the floating diffusion and thus permit a correlated double sampling with respect to the floating diffusion reset-state sample acquired in phase 3. As shown, a compare/convert strobe is asserted at the conclusion of phase 5 to trigger an ADC operation with respect to the CDS pixel readout. As demonstrated by the dashed SHS and compare/convert pulses, SHS and/or compare/convert may optionally be suppressed in read-out phase 5 in absence of an overthreshold detection.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">Still referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the conditional read-out of the photodiode (i.e., effected by asserting TGc in conjunction with application of V<sub>TG-Full </sub>on TGr) effectively resets the photodiode (i.e., drawing off all charge to the floating diffusion), while suppression of the conditional read-out leaves the integration state of the photodiode undisturbed. Accordingly, execution of the conditional read-out operation in phase 5 conditionally resets the photodiode in preparation for integration anew in the succeeding sampling interval (i.e., the succeeding “subframe interval” or “subframe” for short) or refrains from resetting the photodiode to enable cumulative integration in the subsequent sampling interval. Thus, in either case, a new integration phase follows phase 5, with phases 2-5 being repeated for each subframe of the overall frame (or exposure) interval, before repeating the hard reset in a new frame. In other embodiments, where cumulative integration is permitted across frame boundaries, the hard reset operation shown at phase 1 may be executed to initialize the image sensor and omitted for an indeterminate period of time thereafter. Also, instead of the hard reset operation shown in phase 1, an unconditional read/reset may be effected following the final subframe of a frame interval or, if desired, in any non-final subframe by unconditionally asserting TGc during read-out phase 5.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">An unconditional readout of dual-mode pixel <b>100</b> may be carried out generally as described with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, except that the operations shown in readout phase 5 are executed without regard to the under/overthreshold evaluation in phase 4. More specifically, the phase-4 threshold evaluation may be carried out as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and then ignored (e.g., overridden by continued assertion of TGcEn during readout phase 5), or the threshold evaluation may be omitted altogether to yield a four-phase CDS pixel readout. In general, such four-phase readout sequences are illustrated below with respect to image sensor embodiments that may employ but do not require conditional-read capability and/or image sensors having single-mode pixel arrays. Thus, column-line control over transfer gate <b>101</b> may be provided but unused (e.g., during certain subframes and/or sensor operating modes) or may be omitted altogether. Also, the transfer-gate control signal is generally designated “TG<sub>n</sub>” (with ‘n’ denoting the n<sup>th </sup>row of an image sensor) in four-phase readout diagrams and may be representative of either exclusively row-based transfer-gate control (i.e., column-line omitted and thus a single-mode pixel array) or logical combination of row- and column-based transfer-gate control.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">Mitigating Floating Diffusion Disruption Due to Control Signal Feedthrough</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a capacitive feedthrough phenomenon that tends to prolong the CDS readout interval and, consequently, increase temporal noise and constrain pixel readout conversion gain within the single-mode and dual-mode pixels of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>. More specifically, control signal pulses, particularly on the reset-gate (RG) and transfer-gate (TG) control lines, tend to capacitively couple (i.e., feedthrough) to the floating diffusion node of the pixel, creating feedthrough transients on the floating diffusion node as shown at <b>75</b> <i>a </i>and <b>75</b> <i>b</i>. Accordingly, to provide sufficient time for the pixel output line (pixout) to settle to its correct value, a delay is generally imposed between the falling edge of the feedthrough-producing signal (i.e., the “feedthrough source”) and the falling edges of the reset-state and signal-state sample-and-hold pulses, SHR and SHS, respectively. More specifically, a first settling delay is imposed between the falling edge of the RG pulse and the falling edge of SHR (the reset-state sample-and-hold pulse) to provide time for the RG feedthrough to settle, and a second even longer settling delay is imposed between the falling edge of the TG pulse and SHS (the signal-state sample-and-hold pulse) to provide time for the TG feedthrough to settle. As shown, the TG-feedthrough-imposed settling delay falls directly within the CDS interval marked by the falling edges of SHR and SHS and, indeed, may constitute the dominant portion of the CDS time, particularly for low-light (small) signal levels. Unfortunately, capacitive feedthrough increases with the reduced process geometries required to build ever-smaller pixels. Making matters worse, full-well capacity and responsivity tends to decrease with pixel size, so that smaller pixels generally require higher conversion gain to maintain image readout signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The magnitude of the TG feedthrough will increase with higher conversion gain causing even longer settling time and correspondingly longer CDS time. This increase in CDS time will increase the read noise and thus counter the SNR improvement intended by the higher conversion gain. Thus, the TG feedthrough settling requirement limits the magnitude of conventional conversion gains that can be used and thus limits the ability to reduce input-referred noise.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">To appreciate the disruption/delay imposed by control-signal feedthrough, consider some exemplary component and timing values. For example, the minimum pulse width of control signals entering the pixel array, such as reset (RG) and transfer-gate control (TG), is constrained by the RC time constant of their respective control lines so that a row-line resistance of ˜1000 ohms and capacitance of ˜0.5 pF yields a 500 picosecond RC time constant. To achieve 2-sigma settling, the entire rise and fall of the respective control pulses can be accomplished in ˜2 ns and thus very rapidly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">By contrast, pixel output settling times are orders of magnitude longer. The source-follower bias current is typically on the order of 3 μA-10 μA (i.e., to avoid fixed pattern noise and shading caused by voltage drops across the source follower and pixout line) so that, even in the dark, a pixout settling time delay on the order of 1-3 μs is generally imposed during signal-state sampling to compensate for control-signal feedthrough. This can be understood from the slew-rate limitation dictated by V(t)=1/C∫i(t)dt, where i(t) is, for example, 3 μA, and C is the combined capacitance of pixout line and the sampling capacitors and other parasitic capacitance of the pixout line. A typical value might be 2 pF. Even though the sensor is in the dark, feedthrough-induced disturbance of the pixout line can be roughly 500 mV to 1000 mV (e.g., depending on the coupling capacitance of the TG to the floating diffusion and the total capacitance of the floating diffusion), so that an exemplary pixout settling time following TG pulse feedthrough can be calculated as t=(500 mV/3 μA)*2 pF=333 ns. Because of the large voltage jump, several times the slew settling time is required in practice in order to achieve matching between pixels and columns, yielding a 1 μs to 3 μs delay overall.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">As <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows, there is a large disruption on the floating diffusion and pixout because of TG pulse feedthrough. This leads to a number of undesirable effects including extended CDS times (i.e., to account for the substantial settling delays detailed above), high row-wise temporal noise and, unless settling time is made long enough to accommodate the worst-case columns in the array, fixed pattern noise due to mismatch in column and pixel settling. More generally, the CDS transfer function is a band-pass function that rejects noise at frequencies outside the bandpass, but passes in-band noise into the readout signal. The CDS time determines the lower/bottom frequency of the bandpass (the upper frequency being determined by the bandwidth of the source follower and other circuits in the CDS readout path) so that feedthrough-imposed extension of the CDS time widens the bandpass and thus increases readout noise.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">In an embodiment shown generally in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a feedthrough compensation pulse (or “nulling” pulse) is asserted on one or more row-based and/or column-based signal lines (shown collectively as “Null”) that extend in proximity to the floating diffusion nodes within a selected respective row or column of pixels, there being at least one such “nulling” line for each pixel row and/or each pixel column. The nulling pulse counteracts (i.e., cancels, negates, mitigates or otherwise compensates) capacitive feedthrough resulting from application of the TG pulse during the photocharge sampling phase, reducing floating diffusion and pixout settling times and thus reducing CDS time and corresponding temporal noise during pixel readout. Although not specifically shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a nulling pulse may additionally be generated in coordination with other control signal pulses (e.g., during partial-TG pulse during overthreshold detection in a conditional-read pixel, concurrently with the RG pulse that precedes reset-state sampling and so forth). Also, while the nulling pulse is shown as transitioning from Ov to a negative voltage, any low-going pulse (i.e., negative-polarity pulse) that transitions from a positive to a negative voltage, or from a positive voltage to a less positive voltage may alternatively be applied. More generally, nulling pulses may be generated at appropriate times and with appropriate amplitudes and polarities to counteract any control signal feedthrough including, for example and without limitation, feedthrough from the row-select signal assertion (RS), reset-gate signal assertion (RG) as well as various other row and column control signals discussed below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">In general, the nulling signal line is routed across or in proximity to one or more target rows or columns of pixels to effect parasitic capacitive coupling to the floating diffusions of the pixels, and may or may not be connected to pixel transistors within the pixel row being read-out (i.e., the “active” pixel row). In a number of embodiments, for example, the nulling signal line may be implemented by one or more row control lines for a pixel row (or rows) that neighbors the active row (e.g., is adjacent or proximal to the active row), while in other embodiments, the nulling signal line may be implemented by a dedicated nulling line (i.e., line provided solely to convey a null signal pulse), and in yet other embodiments the nulling signal line may be a control signal line for the active pixel row itself. In further embodiments, combinations of dedicated nulling lines and neighbor-row control lines, and/or active-row control lines may yield a desired feedthrough compensation, and in yet further embodiments, column control lines and or dedicated column nulling lines may be used in addition to or instead of row-based nulling lines. In all such cases the nulling signal conveyed on the nulling line(s) performs a counter coupling to eliminate or substantially mitigate any net control-signal feedthrough to the floating diffusion node—an effect referred to herein alternately as “feedthrough compensation,” “feedthrough nulling” and “floating-diffusion stabilization.”</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">Whether implemented by row-based and/or column-based signal lines, nulling lines can be placed near (or likely above) the vertical row-based floating diffusion trace (and thus near the floating diffusion regions for respective pixels), and the distance from pixout and the column-based transfer-gate control line (i.e., TGc) can also be controlled. There is significant freedom to adjust both or either of the width of the nulling line and proximity to other lines (such as TGr, pixout and TGc) to yield an ideal “counter-coupling” effect. Also, the amount of “counter-coupling” can be tuned from a voltage standpoint, for example, using run-time and/or production time calibration operations and on-chip or off-chip calibration circuitry. In practice, the TG-null pulse amplitude can be made quite large (without reliability risk), particularly where it is not driving a node or a gate. For example, an on-chip switched-capacitor “booster” can be used to achieve negative-polarity or positive-polarity feedthrough compensation pulses with amplitudes of 10v or more, though smaller pulse amplitudes may also suffice.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">Still referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, while feedthrough compensation enables arbitrarily small CDS periods approaching the time constant of pixout line, meaningful image production requires a CDS period long enough to read out non-negligible photocharge according to V(t)=1/C∫i(t)dt), where pixout signal following the TG pulse is now representative of photocharge, not parasitic voltage coupling. Observing that the unfettered pixout settling time is dependent on the level of photocharge transfer, it follows that low-light signals may be sampled with lower settling delay than brighter-light signals—an insight exploited in a number of embodiments detailed below. As an example, single photons may be counted without regard to a slew rate limitation. As another example, the CDS period can be arbitrarily shortened or extended based on the imaging condition (i.e. very short for known low-light and high-ISO scenes). Other techniques may be applied in alternative embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">Another consideration that arises with enablement of very short duration CDS (“compressed CDS”) and thus a very low noise pixel is how practically to achieve sub-electron read-noise performance in view of additional readout circuit noise from components in the readout path after the pixel source follower transistor. This added noise may arise from circuits such as the sample and holds, gain amplifiers and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Assuming that the read noise of a compressed-CDS pixel readout (e.g., 10 ns-100 ns CDS duration) will be much lower than typical readout circuit noise, then the capacitor size of the sample-and-holds may be chosen accordingly. That is, given a sub-electron-noise pixel (i.e., noise less than single electron), then capacitance of capacitive sample-and-hold elements may be increased to reduce the readout circuit noise addition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">Compressed-CDS (i.e., sub-electron) pixel readout also permits adoption of higher conversion-gain architectures to reduce post source-follower noise. For example and without limitation, an architecture that yields a 500 uV/e− conversion gain instead of 100 uV/e− will effectively reduce noise post-source follower by 5×. A number of such high-conversion-gain embodiments are discussed in greater detail below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">Various embodiments disclosed herein enable the CDS duration to be compressed to the theoretical RC constant of the pixout line itself, reducing CDS time by an order of magnitude or more (e.g., from 1 μs to 100 ns or less), greatly reducing temporal source-follower readout noise and pixel fixed pattern noise/column fixed pattern noise in the dark. The following sections detail pixel feedthrough compensation schemes (i.e., floating diffusion stabilization through TG-nulling and other active compensation techniques) that may be applied, for example and without limitation, in otherwise standard CMOS image-sensor pixels and sensor architectures as well as in specialized or otherwise non-standard pixel and sensor architectures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">Baseline Feedthrough Compensation</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">A baseline embodiment for floating-diffusion feedthrough compensation includes an added signal wire and attendant decoder/driver dedicated to feedthrough nulling. In a number of embodiments, this dedicated nulling signal line (or “coupling” or “compensation” signal line) extends row-wise across the pixel array to match skew and droop over the array of the row-control pulses and signals to be compensated. In alternative embodiments, column-based nulling lines may be used instead of or in addition to row-based lines, with column signal timing, waveform shaping and/or signal line routing designed to match skew and droop of the specified feedthrough signals to be compensated. In yet other embodiments, existing control signal lines may be leveraged to carry nulling signals. Also, transistors or other active components may be provided within individual pixels to provide feedthrough compensation instead of or as a supplement to signal-line-based compensation, though potentially at the cost of reduced fill factor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">With respect to the exemplary waveform diagrams and embodiments described herein, it should be noted that feedthrough compensation need not be “perfect” in order to achieve the advantageous effects. For example, the pulse edges of the compensation signals do not have align exactly with the signal pulse edges that produce the feedthrough disturbance, nor are matching voltage swings, coupling capacitances (or products of voltage swings and coupling capacitances) required between the feedthrough-compensation pulse and control signal that produces the feedthrough.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates exemplary coupling capacitances between TG and RG control signal lines and the floating diffusion node, FD, of the single-mode (4T) pixel of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. In a first-order analysis, which may apply equally to the dual mode pixel of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the coupling capacitances between TG and FD (i.e., “C<sub>tg-fd</sub>”) and between RG and FD (“C<sub>tg-rg</sub>”) will yield a feedthrough signal on the floating diffusion node that follows the pulses from TG and RG signals. With regard to the TG pulse, for example, the magnitude of the feedthrough signal (ΔV<sub>FT</sub>) is given by:
<br/>
Δ<i>V</i> <sub>FT</sub> <i>=ΔV</i> <sub>tg</sub>*(<i>C</i> <sub>tg-fd</sub> <i>/C</i> <sub>fd</sub>)  (1)
<br/>
Where ΔV<sub>tg </sub>is the voltage swing of the TG pulse and C<sub>fd </sub>is the total capacitance of the floating diffusion node.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">Note that the pixel conversion gain is generally adjusted by decreasing C<sub>fd </sub>(i.e., conversion gain=q/C<sub>fd</sub>) meaning that, if the feedthrough to the floating diffusion is not compensated, the ΔV of the feedthrough will increase as the conversion gain is increased. This larger feedthrough then imposes longer floating diffusion node and pixout settling delays and thus increases the CDS time. On the other hand, by compensating the floating-diffusion feedthrough, conversion gain may be increased without appreciably increasing settling time, and thus further reduce input-referred read noise.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">Leveraging Pixel Control Lines to Effect Feedthrough Compensation</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">An alternative to adding a dedicated feedthrough compensation signal line is to use existing control signal lines and structures in the subject pixel for feedthrough compensation—an approach that avoids added floating-diffusion capacitance (as may occur when a signal line or lines are added to accomplish feedthrough compensation) and thus avoids changing the pixel conversion gain. In a number of embodiments, row-based control signal lines for neighboring pixel rows within a row of four floating-diffusion-sharing pixel cells (e.g., individual 4×1 unit cells as shown at <b>115</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, though transfer-enable transistors <b>103</b> may be omitted in single-mode embodiments) are employed to convey feedthrough compensation pulses. These neighbor-row control lines may be routed to closely match the clock skew and droop of the feedthrough-sourcing signal line (i.e., the “source line”) and, in the case of a distributed or otherwise shared floating diffusion, may exhibit capacitive coupling to the floating diffusion that matches that of the source line. For example, a source TG line and three neighboring TG lines may be routed uniformly across a row of four-pixel unit cells and exhibit uniform capacitive coupling with respect to the shared floating diffusion within each unit cell so that capacitive feedthrough resulting from control signals conveyed on the source TG line may be nulled by compensation signals conveyed on any other of the unit-cell TG lines or combination of the other TG lines. The same techniques can be applied with respect to pixels having respective (unshared) floating diffusion nodes, though higher compensation voltage swings may be needed in some cases. Also, as discussed below, compensation pulses may also be conveyed via RG signal lines and RS (row-select) signal lines, as well as column signal lines, like the column transfer-gate control line, TGc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is an exemplary pixel readout timing diagram illustrating reset, exposure and readout with respect to pixel row ‘n’ (i.e., controlled by RG<sub>n </sub>and TG<sub>n</sub>) and feedthrough compensation conveyed via one or more neighboring TG control lines, designated TG<sub>n</sub>*, of a shared-FD unit cell. In one embodiment, compensation pulses are asserted simultaneously on multiple neighboring TG lines to limit the compensation pulse amplitude (voltage swing) required on any single line (i.e., as compared to the pulse amplitude if only one neighboring TG line was used to convey the compensation pulse). By this arrangement, relatively low compensation pulse voltages can be implemented and applied without affecting pixel performance, (e.g. GIDL (gain-induced drain leakage), Qsat, or blooming). Use of a single neighboring TG line to compensate feedthrough, while feasible, may require a larger voltage swing on the compensating line and may impose additional design considerations to ensure gate reliability and avoid GIDL during readout, driver implementation challenges, etc. As an example, if the TG<sub>n </sub>pulse exhibits a 2.5V swing, the negative pulse amplitude required on three neighboring TG<sub>n</sub>* lines of a 4×1 shared-FD pixel cell is 2.5V/3=0.83V, instead the full 2.5V needed if a single TG<sub>n</sub>* line was used for feedthrough compensation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the four TG lines in the unit cell have substantially the same FD coupling capacitance, C<sub>tg-fd</sub>. Consequently, because the transfer-control pulse conveyed on TG<sub>n </sub>will have a voltage swing of Vtg_vsf=Vtg_on−Vtg_mid1, Vtg_mid1 may be set such that Vtg_mid1−Vtg_off=(Vtg_vsf/3) to yield feedthrough compensation pulse amplitudes of Vtg_vsf/3 (and thus, collectively, the desired Vtg_vsf compensation level) on each of the three TGn* lines by pulsing those lines from Vtg_mid1 to Vtg_off and back. Note that all four of the TG lines in the quad pixel unit cell are initially transitioned from Vtg_off to Vtg_mid (a signal level chosen to avoid gate-induced drain leakage to the FD node) in preparation for the feedthrough-compensated CDS readout—a transition that may be safely (non-disruptively) effected at any time between end of the integration phase and the falling edge of the SHR pulse.</div>

For example, in an embodiment in which C<sub>rg-fd </sub>approximately matches C<sub>tg-fd </sub>and in which Vtg_mid1−Vtg_off=Vtg_vsf/4, each of lines TGn* may be negatively-pulsed from Vtg_mid1 to Vtg_off and back simultaneously with assertion of a same-amplitude compensation pulse on RG to yield the desired feedthrough compensation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the TG<sub>n</sub>* signal lines are used to compensate the RG<sub>n </sub>feedthrough to the floating diffusion, and then used in combination with the RG<sub>n </sub>pulse as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> to compensate for TG<sub>n </sub>feedthrough.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">While described in reference to a particular 4T pixel that forms part of a shared-floating diffusion node architecture, the feedthrough compensation techniques illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref> may also be employed with other 4T pixel architectures such as switched-supply row-select architectures, reset-through-output architectures or others. In all cases, the TG and RG signal lines in the pixel unit cell can be used to cancel, negate or otherwise compensate specific sources of feedthrough to the floating diffusion node.</div>

In a number of embodiments, the adjacent RG line, “RG<sub>adj</sub>,” is purposefully designed and laid out with respect to the floating diffusion node of the target pixel to yield the desired coupling capacitance, C<sub>rgadj-fd</sub>. As an example, in one implementation, a metal layer formation of the RG<sub>adj </sub>line is extended into the neighboring (target) pixel in a designed proximity to the target pixel's floating diffusion node. In another implementation, the RG<sub>adj </sub>line is disposed immediately adjacent the FD-to-source-follower connection for the neighboring (target) pixel and/or routed in proximity to the source-follower gate of the target pixel. As the exemplary embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates, the proximal routing of signal line RG<sub>adj </sub>to the source-follower gate (SF) of the target-pixel effects a capacitive coupling, C<sub>rg-sf</sub>, that is electrically equivalent to C<sub>rgadj-fd </sub>by virtue of the electrical interconnection between the source-follower gate and floating diffusion node.

In the example shown, pixel row ‘n’ is being readout, with RG<sub>n </sub>and TG<sub>n </sub>being pulsed at <b>201</b> and <b>203</b> to reset the floating diffusion node and enable photocharge transfer, respectively. The adjacent RG signal line, RGadj may be the RG line from a pixel row above or below the row containing the pixel being readout (i.e., the target pixel) or, in the case of a pixel unit cell in which a single RG line is shared among all the pixels in the unit cell, the RG line from an adjacent unit cell. Where RG<sub>adj </sub>corresponds to the previously-read out neighboring pixel row (i.e., RG<sub>n-1</sub>), RG<sub>adj </sub>would normally be in the “on-state” as that pixel row has been readout and is now integrating or waiting to integrate.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">While neighbor-row TG and local RG control lines are particularly effective for compensating feedthrough from a source line to the floating diffusion (i.e., in shared-FD unit cells, those neighboring lines tend to be physically adjacent the floating diffusion node and thus couple effectively to the FD, primarily through the gate to drain overlap capacitance), the RS signal line and row-select transistor gate may also be used for feedthrough compensation. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, for example, presents an exemplary pixel readout timing diagram in which a negative pulse on the RS line compensates for (i.e., negates in whole or part) the feedthrough from a TG or RG source line. As shown at <b>207</b> and <b>208</b>, the negative RS pulses ride upon an active (e.g., asserted to a logic high state in this example) RS signal. The voltage swing, ΔV, of the negative RS pulse required to cancel the feedthrough will depend on the coupling capacitance between the RS line and the floating diffusion node. Larger compensation voltage swings may be implemented in embodiments where the RS gate and/or signal line are not physically adjacent (or otherwise do not sufficiently capacitively-couple to) the floating diffusion, so long as the negative-going compensation pulse does not disrupt the row-select function of the RS line. To achieve a sufficient compensation voltage swing on RS that is compatible with allowable pixel and drive circuit voltages, the RS to FD coupling capacitance may be purposefully increased (e.g., by routing part of the RS gate poly close to the source-follower (SF) gate, routing the RS signal-line interconnect over the FD-to-SF gate interconnect, etc.) Alternatively (or additionally), RS compensation pulses may be applied in combination with the above-described TG<sub>n</sub>* and RG compensation pulses.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref> illustrates an alternative TG null timing approach, applicable at least to 4T pixel architectures, including, without limitation, the single-mode and dual-mode 4T pixels shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>. This TG feedthrough cancellation or compensation method can be applied in conjunction with various feedthrough-compensated readout techniques, including the bifurcated read-path and/or variable conversion gain techniques described below. The specific example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref> is particularly applicable to readout of low-light signals to achieve fast CDS times and low read noise.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">A generalized single-mode pixel <b>90</b> and readout circuit block diagram is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>, with corresponding timing diagram shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref>, initially the photodiode <b>110</b> (PD) is reset by pulsing the transfer gate line (TG) and raising the reset gate line (RG) as shown. After TG goes low, photocharge integration commences and RG is left on or partially on to provide blooming protection. At the start of a CDS readout, the row select (RS) signal for desired row is asserted and the source follower <b>105</b> (SF) is connected to the column output line, pixout. Next the reset-state sample-and-hold control signal (SHR) signal and signal-state sample-and-hold-signal control signal (SHS) are raised (e.g., concurrently or one after the other as shown) to switchably couple capacitors Cr and Cs of sample-and-hold circuit <b>224</b> to the pixout line (i.e., via access transistors <b>225</b>, <b>227</b>) and thus charge to the reset-state potential thereon. Shortly thereafter SHR goes low, switching off transistor <b>225</b> to store (or capture) the reset-state of the floating diffusion node <b>112</b> (FD) on reset-state sample-and-hold capacitor, Cr. Note that while SHR is shown as falling shortly before RG, SHR may alternatively be lowered between the RG falling edge and the subsequent TG rising edge.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">At this point, feedthrough-compensated photocharge transfer is enabled by lowering RG and raising TG in a manner that enables the negative RG feedthrough to cancel or substantially reduce (i.e., compensate for) positive TG feedthrough. To avoid lost photocharge, the RG signal starts to go low prior to (and, in one embodiment, as close as possible to) the TG signal going high. The proximity of the RG falling edge and TG rising edge are constrained by timing control and charge transfer, (see inset <b>219</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>). The TG rising edge does not occur prior to the RG falling edge since this will cause at least some portion of the charge transferred from the PD to the FD to be swept out to the supply Vdd via reset transistor <b>109</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">Alternately the RG signal can go partially lower, (see inset <b>221</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>), prior to the rising edge of TG and the full falling edge of RG. This provides two benefits; (1) the RG feedthrough can be matched to the TG feedthrough since RG and TG may have inherently different coupling capacitances to the FD, and (2) this produces a barrier from the FD to the RG region to prevent charge loss of the initial small amount of signal transferred from the PD as TG is turned on. The RG and TG edges cancel each other's feedthrough to the FD and the column output line can settle quickly for small signals, (as previously described). Next, the SHS signal falls to sample the signal+reset level onto capacitor Cs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">Referring to inset <b>223</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>, the TG and RG edges can also be designed to fall more slowly to provide more timing margin for placement of edges to avoid charge loss.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0141">While feedthrough compensation has thus far been discussed primarily with respect to single-mode 4T pixels (i.e., pixels that lack column-line transfer-gate control and thus without column-controlled conditional-read capability), the approaches and techniques disclosed may readily be extended to dual-mode (conditional-read) pixels in which a column control/feedback line (or lines) is used to enable or disable photocharge readout (i.e., photocharge transfer to floating diffusion and ensuing readout generation) according to an over/under threshold determination. For example, feedthrough compensation pulses may be generated on local RG or RS signal lines (i.e., on the instances of those lines that control reset and row-select operations within the pixel row or unit cell row for which feedthrough is being compensated) and/or neighboring RG/RS lines generally as discussed above.</div>

The diagram shown assumes a “stacked-gate” conditional-read pixel architecture (i.e., the pixel includes a transfer-enable transistor interconnected between TGr, TGc and the pixel transfer gate as shown at <b>103</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>), so that the TGr<sub>n </sub>potential (i.e., a primary source of otherwise disruptive feedthrough) is maintained at or above a level that avoids forward biasing the drain-to-body junction of the transfer-enable transistor, and TGc is generally held high during photocharge integration (i.e., phase 2). As <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> shows, negatively-directed feedthrough compensation pulses are generated in a manner analogous to generation of feedthrough compensation pulses on the neighboring TG lines shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. As with the TG<sub>n </sub>and TG<sub>n</sub>* lines shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, TGr<sub>n </sub>and TGr<sub>n</sub>* may be routed to respective pixels within a shared-FD unit cell. Also, as with TG<sub>n</sub>*, by using conveying multiple feedthrough compensation pulses on respective neighboring TGr lines in the same shared unit cell, the compensation pulse amplitude required on any single neighboring TGr line can be reduced, thus enabling generation of relatively low compensation voltages that will not disrupt pixel performance (e.g. GIDL, Qsat, blooming).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0144" num="0143">In contrast to the various unconditional read operations discussed above, the conditional-read operation involves two TGr<sub>n </sub>pulses at different amplitudes—a first TGr<sub>n </sub>pulse for partial charge transfer (during overthreshold-detection phase 4) having a voltage swing Vtgr_vsp=Vtgr_part−Vtgr_mid1, and second TGr<sub>n </sub>pulse for full charge transfer (during conditional readout phase 5) having a voltage swing Vtgr_vsf=Vtgr_on−Vtgr_mid1.

In one embodiment, the different partial-transfer and full-transfer feedthrough-compensation levels are achieved by varying the number of compensation pulse contributors between those two operations and thus avoiding generation of an additional TGr<sub>n</sub>* voltage level. That is, compensation pulses are applied on N neighboring TGr lines to compensate for full-transfer TGr<sub>n </sub>feedthrough, and on M neighboring TGr lines to compensate for partial-transfer TGr<sub>n </sub>feedthrough, where M is less than N in accordance with the difference between Vtgr_vsf and Vtgr_vsp. In another embodiment, an additional Vtgr_off level is provided for the partial TG pulse feedthrough compensation. This is indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> by the dotted line for the partial feedthrough compensation pulse and signal name Vtgr_off*. In a further embodiment not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the partial transfer TGr pulse is implemented as a pulse with a substantially shorter width than the full transfer pulse.

Also, to avoid disruption of the pixel cycle, any negative-polarity compensation pulses on the TGc line are implemented such that the logic-level signal applied on TGc remains undisturbed. Accordingly, in embodiments where TGc is maintained predominantly at a high logic level (e.g., Vdd) throughout the integration, reset-state sampling, overthreshold detection and conditional-readout phases of the pixel cycle, TGc is elevated to voltage level (Vtgc_on) above the high logic level during the reset-state sampling, overthreshold detection and conditional readout phases to permit negative-pulse amplitudes that will not cause the TGc signal to fall below the logic-high voltage level. Thus, TGc is pulsed negatively from Vtgc_on to Vdd and back at <b>351</b> to compensate for RG<sub>n </sub>feedthrough, is pulsed somewhat less negatively from Vtgc_on to Vtgc_on2 and back at <b>353</b> to compensate feedthrough from the lower-amplitude TGr<sub>n </sub>pulse applied to effect partial transfer, and is then conditionally (i.e., according to the over/under threshold determination) pulsed again from Vtgc_on to Vdd and back at <b>355</b> to compensate feedthrough from the higher-amplitude full-transfer TGr<sub>n </sub>pulse.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0148" num="0147">Although TGr<sub>n</sub>* signals may be applied to compensate control-signal feedthrough in split gate conditional-read pixels in generally the same way as described for stacked gate embodiments, the direct connection of the TGc signal to the transfer gate (i.e., portion thereof) brings additional considerations. For one, the capacitive coupling between the TGc line and floating diffusion tends to be significantly increased (i.e., in a split-gate vs. stacked gate embodiment) by virtue of FD-adjacent layout, reducing the requisite compensation pulse amplitudes. An exemplary pixel readout timing diagram for use of TGc for TGr<sub>n </sub>feedthrough is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. As shown, TGc is raised to Vtgc_on2 at the conclusion of integration phase 2, then pulsed negatively to Vdd and back to compensate RGn feedthrough prior to reset-state sampling.

It is only necessary to have an SHS time and pixout settling time that is long enough to charge Cs to the specified threshold level, (which is a very small signal for the partial transfer threshold detection method). With this method the pixel read noise for the partial transfer and threshold assessment can be made to be very low and thus increase the detection sensitivity, (reduce the number of electrons required to trip the comparator), of the threshold assessment.</li> <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0151">For conditional sub-frame readouts, the full-conditional transfer readout can be done with an SHS time and pixout settling time that is long enough to charge Cs to a high light or saturated pixel level. Since the threshold level is typically set to half of full well for example, the conditional full transfer readouts will be signals higher than half of full well and it is not necessary to have the lowest read noise due to the signal being photon shot noise limited. The CDS time and read noise cannot be short and low respectively since the partial transfer and threshold assessment time has elapsed between the falling edge of SHR and the falling edge of the conditional SHS. Note that this time and read noise may be reduced by having a very short partial transfer and threshold assessment readout enabled by the feedthrough compensation.</li> <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0152">Because the CDS time is reduced for the partial transfer readout, the read time and row time can be diminished.

With this approach, described in greater detail below, a bifurcated (dual) readout or dual SHS technique can be utilized to optimize the readout for both low and high light signal levels.

As shown, now that control-signal feedthrough disturbances to the floating diffusion and pixout have been compensated, SHS (the signal-state sample-and-hold control signal) can rise at the same time as SHR (the reset-state sample-and-hold control signal) in order to pre-charge the signal-state storage capacitor to the reset level prior to photocharge transfer from photodiode to floating diffusion. Also, for low-light (small) signal readout, the CDS time is now constrained primarily by the TG<sub>n </sub>pulse width and thus may be on the order of 30-50 nanoseconds, or possibly less. In the case of a medium to bright-light (“large”) signal readout, however, additional time may be required after the falling edge of the TG<sub>n </sub>pulse to fully charge the sample-and-hold capacitance to the correspondingly higher level—a circumstance accommodated by extending the SHS pulse width at penalty of increased pixel read noise. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> illustrates this timewise-SHS extension within shaded region <b>471</b>, contrasting the highly compressed (and thus low-noise) CDS time possible for low-light signals with the longer, higher-noise CDS time needed for medium and bright-light signals, reaching a maximum duration at the full-well potential of the photodiode.</div>

As shown, RG<sub>n </sub>is pulsed to reset the floating diffusion, while TG<sub>n</sub>* are simultaneously pulsed negatively (i.e., pulsing from Vtg_mid1 to Vtg_off and back in this example) to negate feedthrough from RG<sub>n </sub>to the floating diffusion. SHR<b>1</b> and SHR<b>2</b> are raised with RG<sub>n </sub>to enable the signal-state capacitors Cs<b>1</b> and Cs<b>2</b> to charge to the baseline reset-level in preparation for eventual signal-state sampling.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0156" num="0159">After capturing reset-state samples on Cr<b>1</b> and Cr<b>2</b>, the TG<sub>n </sub>and TG<sub>n</sub>* signals are pulsed to transfer photocharge from the photodiode to the floating diffusion (i.e., TG<sub>n </sub>is pulsed to enable the charge transfer and one or more TGn* lines are pulsed negatively to negate TG<sub>n </sub>feedthrough). As shown, SHS<b>1</b> may be lowered very shortly after the falling edge of the TG<sub>n </sub>at a design-selected timing point that permits the Cs<b>1</b> capacitor to be charged to signal level at least up to the intermediate threshold (i.e., capturing a signal-state sample on Cs<b>1</b> corresponding to a luminance range from dark to the intermediate threshold between low-light and brighter-light signals) while maintaining low pixel read noise (i.e., due to the CDS compression); an operation made possible by the TG<sub>n </sub>feedthrough compensation. To account for the possibility that a given pixel will yield a brighter-light (above intermediate threshold) signal that will not stabilize on pixout within the compressed low-light CDS time, SHS<b>2</b> goes low at a substantially later time corresponding to the pixel full-well point (i.e., pixel saturation level), thus capturing a possible bright-light signal-state sample (“large signal sample”) on sample-and-hold element Cs<b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0157" num="0160">At this point, with low-light and bright-light signal-state samples captured within Cs<b>1</b> and Cs<b>2</b>, and with reset-state samples captured within Cr<b>1</b> and Cr<b>2</b>, the “bright-light” CDS value, SIGhigh=VCs<b>2</b>−VCr<b>2</b>, is compared to the intermediate threshold (Vref) within, for example, a comparator circuit within the column readout circuitry. As explained, the intermediate threshold is designed (and may be programmed and/or calibrated) to be slightly above a selected low-light signal level, but not above a signal level that would yield a specified pixout settling time outside the low-light CDS time. Depending on whether SIGhigh exceeds or does not exceed the intermediate threshold, Vref, either SIGhigh or SIGlow (i.e., VCs<b>1</b>−Vcr<b>1</b>) is selected, respectively, as the finalized (true) CDS representative of the pixel state (i.e., level of integrated photocharge) and is converted to a digital pixel value. By this operation, low-light pixels will retain a low read noise so that the image sensor as a whole will yield a higher low-light SNR. Also, by evaluating only SIGhigh to select between the low-light and bright light CDS captures, the low-light analog CDS signals on Cs<b>2</b> and Cr<b>2</b> remain undisturbed until needed for conversion and readout, thus preserving SNR of the low-light signal. Also, the SNR impact of increased brighter-light read noise resulting from the SIGhigh evaluation (i.e., for the over/under threshold determination) is negligible in view of the dominance of photon shot noise in brighter light conditions. Despite these benefits, the low-light CDS result may be used for over/under threshold determination in alternative embodiments. Similarly, despite the power savings of analog-domain selection between the low-light and brighter-light CDS values (i.e., only one CDS value need be digitized), both the low-light and brighter-light CDS values could be digitized in alternative embodiments, with the final pixel value being selected in the digital domain (e.g., comparing either or both digital samples to one or more digital threshold values). Additionally, the following alternative approaches may be implemented to evaluate the low-light or brighter-light CDS results with respect to the intermediate threshold:

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0166">Further CDS Compression Through TG-Asserted Signal-State Capture</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0167">In the compressed-CDS timing arrangements described thus far, the falling edge of SHS<b>1</b> (i.e., sample-and-hold control signal for capturing low-light signal-state samples) does not occur until sometime after the falling edge of TG. Under this approach, emphasized in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the brevity of the low-light CDS time is constrained by the TG pulse width, which, for large and/or high resolution arrays, is generally more than 30 nanoseconds. And, while generating TG pulse widths on the order of 30 nanoseconds or less may be feasible in some applications, such tight pulse width demands higher power and larger area for TG decoders and drivers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0168">When TG feedthrough to the floating diffusion is compensated by an existing pixel signal or separate compensation signal, residual feedthrough from the rising TG edge can be made extremely small. In a number of embodiments, this circumstance is exploited by completing a low-light signal-state sample before the falling edge of the TG pulse, freeing the low-light CDS operation from the TG pulse width constraint to enable more tightly compressed CDS times. More specifically, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29A</figref>, the SHS<b>1</b> pulse width is set to yield a falling edge a predetermined time, t<sub>LTX</sub>, after the TG rising edge (and prior to the TG falling edge), with t<sub>LTX </sub>representing the time needed for a specified level of photocharge, corresponding to an upper end of the low-light signal range, to be transferred from the photodiode to the floating diffusion (e.g., 20e<sup>−</sup>, though higher or lower charge levels may be selected by design or configuration programming), and for the time needed for the pixout line to settle to the voltage representative of an upper end of the low-light signal range, including any residual feedthrough signal. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29B</figref> illustrates an expanded view of the low-light CDS operation in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29A</figref>, showing that the SHS<b>1</b> falling edge occurs the predetermined t<sub>LTX </sub>time (designated ‘c’) after the TGn rising edge and thus after the floating diffusion node receives the design-specified (and/or programmatically specified) amount of charge from the photodiode. This time can be as short as 5-10 nanoseconds, thus effecting an extremely brief low-light CDS time (i.e., interval ‘b’ from the falling SHR edge to the rising TGn edge plus interval ‘c’ from the rising TGn edge to the falling SHS<b>1</b> edge) on the order of 10 to 20 nanoseconds. The minimum CDS time may be limited by the time needed for the pixout line to settle to the voltage representative of an upper end of the low-light signal range, including any residual feedthrough signal. The total low-signal read time, t<sub>RD-L</sub>, which includes the CDS time (b+c) plus the reset-state sampling time ‘a’ (the time between conclusion of the reset operation at the falling edge of RG and the falling edge of SHR), is also shortened. interval a+b+c (which begins from the falling RG edge) is also reduced relative to the low-signal read time required for post-TG-pulse signal-state sampling, as the TG pulse delay is avoided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0169">In addition to reducing the CDS time (and thus improving noise rejection), enabling low-light signal-state capture while TG remains asserted may also reduce the pixel or row read time and thus improve the sensor frame rate and/or oversampling capability. For example, for conditional-read operation, the pipelining required to achieve a desired temporal oversampling rate may be reduced. That is, the shortened low-light CDS time and read time may hasten availability of downstream readout resources (e.g., ADC converter and/or other resource shared by both low-signal and high-signal readout paths), enabling the bright-light signal-state sample to be captured at an earlier point in time (i.e., advancing the falling edge of SHS<b>2</b>) so that the high-signal CDS time (tCDS-H) and read time (tRD-H) to be correspondingly reduced, and thus shortening the overall dual-path readout operation.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0173">Dual Readout Path Residual TG Feedthrough Correction</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0167" num="0174">Continuing with TG-asserted signal-state capture (i.e., SHS falling before TG), because the TG rising edge and the nulling signal(s) falling edge occur substantially simultaneously or close temporally, the TG feedthrough to the floating diffusion is substantially eliminated. Consequently, the column output signal line (pixout) will remain at or very close to the reset signal level as charge begins to transfer from the photodiode and thus settle very quickly. Despite this rapid pixout settling, there may be some residual feedthough voltage due to non-uniformity between the TG/FD coupling capacitance and the nulling-line/FD coupling capacitance, TG and nulling signal levels, etc. Any such residual feedthrough will generally yield a systemic spatial fixed pattern offset noise (FPN) that may be corrected in a number of different ways.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0175">In one embodiment, an additional FPN correction (i.e., to account for spatial FPN from residual feedthrough of the rising edge of TG) is effected by capturing and storing of a dark frame (i.e., in the dark capture) containing the residual feedthrough. Thereafter, this dark frame digital data is subtracted from each newly readout image frame to cancel the residual feedthrough. No other added analog circuits are required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0169" num="0176">In another embodiment, instead of storing a dark frame to subtract, analog samples of the settled signal level are captured both before and after the TG falling edge using sample and hold circuitry. By sample and holding the signal value both before and after the falling edge of TG, (and rising edge of TG null signal), the difference between the TG-asserted sample and the TG-deasserted is measured to yield, as a correction value, the amount of the residual TG feedthrough. This residual feedthrough analog voltage is then subtracted in the analog domain from the CDS's signal value. In one implementation, this correction value is applied to TG-asserted CDS values on a row-by-row basis to cancel the residual TG feed-through component of those values. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31A and 31B</figref> illustrate an exemplary high-level block diagram and corresponding timing diagram for this analog-domain residual feedthrough correction technique.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0170" num="0177">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31A</figref>, the pixel comprises a photodiode, transfer gate (TG), reset transistor with a reset gate (RG), a floating diffusion (FD), source follower input transistor (SF) and row select transistor with a row select gate (RS). The pixel also has a TGnull signal with a coupling capacitance (C<b>1</b>) to the FD. The TGnull signal can be implemented in many embodiments as has disclosed earlier. The per column sample and hold readout circuitry comprises a source follower constant current load (Ibias), sample and hold capacitors for storage of reset and signal voltages (Cr and Cs respectively). Sample and hold reset and sample and hold signal switches are controlled by SHR and SHS signals respectively. Two differential amplifiers (Diff Amp<b>1</b> and Diff Amp<b>2</b>) are used to perform analog correlated double sampling (CDS) and residual TG feedthrough (Δ<sub>vtgf</sub>) FPN correction.

Voltages on these nodes representative of a small signal on pixout are shown as a solid line, whereas voltages on these nodes representative of a large signal on pixout are shown as a dashed line.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0174" num="0181">Ultra low noise readout architectures having bifurcated low-light and bright light (low signal/high signal) readout paths with respective short and longer CDS times are presented in a number of embodiments below. In general, the low-signal and high-signal ranges overlap at a boundary signal level where photon shot noise does not completely dominate the total temporal readout noise. That is, the high signal range extends from just below the boundary to a full-well signal level (i.e., saturated photodiode) and the low signal range extends from dark (no photocharge) to just above the boundary. As generally discussed above, CDS values are captured/generated speculatively via both the low- and high-signal paths, with either the low-signal CDS value or the high-signal CDS value being selected based on the signal level indicated by either or both of the CDS values themselves. The dual readout paths can share some or all circuit components leading up to the final selection point (e.g., amplifier, S/H bank, ADC) and thus do not, in all cases, have physically different circuit paths but rather different temporal intervals, conditions and controls.</div>

In the embodiment shown, readout circuitry <b>637</b> includes a column-line multiplexer bank <b>641</b>, per-column fixed-gain amplifier (FGA) bank <b>643</b>, low-light (low-signal) and brighter-light (high signal) sample-and-hold (S/H) banks <b>645</b>, <b>647</b>, ADC input multiplexer bank <b>649</b>, ADC circuitry <b>650</b>, decision/write logic <b>655</b> and digital output buffer <b>657</b>.</div>

In the embodiments shown, multiplexer control signals Cmux<b>1</b> and Cmux<b>2</b> (which are delivered to each per-column multiplexer within the larger column multiplexer bank) are used to select between a low-signal pixout routing to per-column FGA (Cmux=1, Cmux<b>2</b>=0), high-signal pixout routing to high-signal S/H bank (Cmux<b>1</b>=0, Cmux<b>2</b>=1) and simultaneous low-signal/high-signal pixout routing to the per-column FGA and high-signal S/H bank (Cmux<b>1</b>=Cmux<b>2</b>=1). As shown, the low-signal and high-signal S/H banks include respective reset-state capacitive elements (Cr<b>1</b>, Cr<b>2</b>) coupled to the corresponding read-out signal path (i.e., FGA output for low-signal readout path and column mux output for high-signal readout path) by a respective SHR-controlled access-transistor.

By this operation, the reset-state sample may be captured simultaneously within the low-signal and high-signal S/H banks (i.e., on Cr<b>1</b> and Cr<b>2</b>, respectively) in response to an SHR pulse, while SHS<b>1</b> and SHS<b>2</b> may be pulsed separately, at appropriate times, to capture low-signal and high-signal samples of the floating-diffusion signal-state, all as conveyed in the pixout signal line. Note that, in alternative embodiments, column line multiplexer may have only one switch, Cmux<b>1</b>, to selectively connect and disconnect the input of the FGA. Alternatively, column line multiplexer may be omitted altogether, and the FGA is disabled or powered down (and thus switchably disconnect from the pixout line) during the SHS<b>2</b> phase. Also, differential amplifiers or other analog-differencing circuits may be provided to generate, as single-ended low-signal and high-signal CDS outputs, differences between the reset-state and signal-state samples captured within the low-signal and high-signal S/H banks (i.e., Vcs<b>1</b>−Vcr<b>1</b> and Vcs<b>2</b>−Vcr<b>2</b>). In alternative embodiments, the reset-state and signal-state samples from each of the low-signal and high-signal S/H banks are supplied to respective differential inputs of the downstream circuit block and thus constitute respective differential CDS outputs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0178" num="0185">In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, the CDS outputs from the S/H banks are provided to respective input ports of 2:1 ADC input mux (i.e., per column components of multiplexer bank <b>649</b>) which, in turn, sequentially delivers the low-signal and high-signal CDS outputs to the ADC circuitry <b>650</b>. In the embodiment shown, ADC circuitry <b>650</b> comprises a single-slope ADC (“SSADC”) formed by SSADC controller <b>651</b> and a bank of per-column SSADC capture blocks <b>653</b>. The SSADC controller includes a counter <b>654</b> that advances incrementally through a sequence of digital numbers (DNs) and a ramp generator <b>656</b> that generates a corresponding voltage ramp to be compared within respective SSADC capture blocks to column CDS values supplied by ADC input multiplexer <b>649</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0179" num="0186">An exemplary embodiment of an SSADC capture block <b>653</b> is shown in detail view <b>660</b> and includes a comparator <b>661</b> (the “SSADC comparator”), DN latch or register <b>665</b>, and trip bit latch or register <b>667</b>. As shown, the Vout signal (i.e., instance of pixout signal, with or without gain from FGA <b>643</b>, stored within a S/H bank <b>645</b> or <b>647</b> and then delivered via ADC input mux <b>649</b>) is supplied to one input of comparator <b>661</b> for comparison with the ADC voltage ramp (“ADC Ramp”) generated by ramp generator <b>656</b> within SSADC controller <b>651</b>. The output of the comparator <b>661</b>, which is reset to a logic low state prior to comparison (e.g., by an auto-zero signal or by virtue of lowering ADC ramp to a near-zero or below-zero level) remains low until the ADC ramp voltage rises above (or at least reaches) the Vout signal level, at which point the comparator “trips,” transitioning its output from low to high. Although a respective SSADC capture block <b>653</b> is provided per pixel column in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> and other embodiments below, in all cases, a single SSADC capture block may be shared (e.g., via time multiplexing) among two or more pixel columns.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0180" num="0187">In a number of embodiments, the ADC ramp voltage at any step in the ramp is correlated to the value within counter <b>654</b> (e.g., ramp generator <b>656</b> may be implemented by a digital-to-analog (DAC) circuit which receives the count value and thus generates a monotonically increasing (single-slope) ADC ramp voltage as counter <b>654</b> is incremented/sequenced from initial to final count value) so that the ADC count value at the comparator trip point represents the digital value corresponding to the ramp voltage that yielded the trip event, and thus an ADC conversion result. Accordingly, when the comparator trips, the high-going comparator output triggers storage of the current ADC count value within DN latch <b>665</b> (thus capturing the ADC conversion result) and setting of the trip bit latch <b>667</b> (e.g., implemented by an SR flip-flop or other bi-stable circuit capable of recording the trip event). In the embodiment shown, the trip bit and latched DN/conversion result are output from the per-column SSADC capture block <b>653</b> to decision and write logic <b>655</b>, which in turn, applies/evaluates the trip bit to determine whether to store the accompanying ADC conversion result within digital output buffer <b>657</b>. For example, in one embodiment, decision/write logic <b>655</b> selectively stores the latched DN value (conversion result) within digital output buffer <b>657</b> if the trip bit is set. In embodiments that perform sequential ADC conversion with respect to low-signal and high-signal readout, the digital decision/write logic may also include memory to record the low-signal trip bit for each pixel column to signal, for subsequent signal-path selection decision, whether a valid ADC result was generated for the low-signal readout. In alternative embodiments, the low-signal trip bit (i.e., trip bit generated for low-signal ADC operation) may be stored within the digital output buffer itself (e.g., within a bit field that indicates which of the low-signal and high-signal readout paths sourced the corresponding ADC result) instead of within digital decision/write logic <b>655</b>. Note also, that the trip bit storage element <b>667</b> within the SSADC capture may be omitted in alternative embodiments and provided instead within the digital decision/write logic and/or digital output buffer. In further bifurcated-read-path embodiments disclosed below, the digital decision/write logic and digital output buffer are depicted as a unified “output logic/buffer” element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0181" num="0188">Still referring to the bifurcated read path embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, readout controller <b>633</b> issues control signals to the row decoder/driver <b>635</b> and readout circuitry <b>637</b> as necessary to appropriately time readout events including, without limitation, operation of the column line multiplexer bank <b>641</b>, resetting/enabling/disabling per-column FGA <b>643</b>, enabling reset-state capture within the low-signal and high-signal S/H banks <b>645</b>, <b>647</b> (i.e., generating SHR pulse), enabling signal-state capture within the low-signal S/H bank (SHS<b>1</b> pulse), enabling signal-state capture within the high-signal S/H bank (SHS<b>2</b> pulse), operation of ADC input multiplexer <b>649</b> (control signal to select, as ADC input source, either low-signal S/H bank or high-signal S/H bank and possibly between reset-state and signal-state samples stored within either bank). With respect to SSADC controller <b>651</b> and SSADC capture blocks <b>653</b>, readout controller <b>633</b> outputs one or more control signals to reset the SSADC and/or initiate ADC operation and may also output control signals that select between different profiles for low-signal and high-signal ADC ramps (e.g., as programmed within a ramp profile memory, not shown). For example, as explained in embodiments presented below, the low-signal ADC ramp may have a significantly smaller voltage step per count (DN) increment (i.e., a higher ADC gain) than the high-signal ADC ramp in view of the smaller low-signal pixout/Vout range, and/or non-uniform step duration and/or size. Conversely, the high-signal ADC ramp may have a higher voltage step per DN than the low-signal ramp, and may also have a non-uniform step duration and/or size.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0182" num="0189">Continuing with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, readout controller <b>633</b> also outputs signals to decision/write logic <b>655</b> and digital output buffer <b>657</b> (e.g., to reset and/or arm trip bit storage elements, time/trigger decision operations, and time/enable write operations within digital output buffer <b>657</b>). Note that, in addition to the operational control signals, readout controller <b>633</b> may also include voltage generators to generate threshold voltages (e.g., for single-level comparison and/or ADC voltage ramp generation) and/or multiplexer elements to select between such voltages (e.g., as supplied by other on-chip or off-chip voltage generators) at appropriate times. Row decoder/driver <b>635</b>, in addition to including logic for sequencing between row addresses (e.g., to perform row-sequential readout) and timing generation of row-select (RS), reset gate (RG), transfer gate (TG or TGr) and feedthrough compensation signals (TG*/Comp, etc.) applied to effect reset and feedthrough-compensated CDS readout operations within a given pixel row, may also include voltage generators and/or selection multiplexers to enable selection/generation of pulse amplitudes and widths as described in various embodiments herein. Also, wherever practicable, effects of different pulse amplitudes may alternatively be implemented within row decoder/driver by generation of pulse sequences (including control pulse variations effected by both amplitude and pulse width and/or pulse sequence modulation).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0183" num="0190">As with all embodiments disclosed herein, the pixel array <b>631</b> itself may be composed of single-mode pixels (e.g., 4T or other types of pixels that lack column-line control over PD-to-FD photocharge transfer and thus support only unconditional readout) and/or dual mode pixels (i.e., 4T or other types of pixels having circuitry/input-point-connection that enables joint column-line (TGc)/row-line (TGr) control over PD-to-FD photocharge transfer and thus support both conditional readout and unconditional readout modes), with such pixels having shared floating diffusion nodes (e.g., pixel unit cells formed by a collection of photodiodes coupled by respective transfer gates to a shared floating diffusion, such as the four-row-by-one-column (4×1) pixel unit cell discussed in reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, 2×2 pixel unit cells, etc.) or unshared floating diffusion nodes. Any of the pixels may additionally include in-pixel feedthrough compensation structures as discussed above and the pixel array may be crossed by signal lines dedicated to feedthrough compensation (e.g., lines coupled to in-pixel compensation structures and/or disposed to yield a desired capacitive coupling without wired connection to other pixel components). Accordingly, though column-based transfer-gate control lines (TGc) and/or dedicated row- and/or column-based feedthrough compensation lines may not be explicitly shown in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> or others presented herein, in all such cases such signal lines may be provided together with corresponding logic circuitry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0184" num="0191">In one embodiment, the gain value within per-column FGA bank <b>643</b> is set in conjunction with SSADC reference ramp generator <b>656</b> to provide less than or equal to 0.25 electrons per digital number (DN) increment.

Also, because the gain amplifier is a FGA and not a PGA, fewer capacitors are required, enabling more compact implementation than a PGA. In addition, the bandwidth, noise and power of the FGA can be reduced compared to that of an inter-row switchable PGA. The FGA value is also chosen to reduce the input referred noise of the ADC and S/H block to a level where the total sensor temporal readout noise approaches the pixel source follower read noise.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0185" num="0192">The higher signal bank does not need to be processed by the FGA since the signal will be photon shot noise limited. The gain applied to the higher signal can be provided by the ADC references and/or SSADC ramp. In alternative embodiments, the gain applied to the higher signal path could be effected by a separate FGA or PGA. Further, if a PGA is employed, the PGA may be used to supply the gain required for both the low signal and higher signal readout paths.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0186" num="0193"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> presents an exemplary timing diagram for a row readout operation within the image sensor architecture of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>. As shown, the SHR and SHS<b>1</b> pulses go high prior to the falling edge of the reset signal RG, (note that only the falling edge of RG is shown as the details of the prior rising edge timing may vary in different embodiments). The SHS<b>2</b> signal is held low until after the falling SHS<b>1</b> edge, to reduce the total capacitance during the SHS<b>1</b> sampling phase in order to improve settling time of SHS<b>1</b>. Both Cmux<b>1</b> and Cmux<b>2</b> (i.e., column multiplexer control signals as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3<i>b</i> </figref>) are asserted to connect the column output line to Cr<b>1</b> (via the FGA) and Cr<b>2</b>. After the falling edge of RG, the SHR signal goes low, switching off the access transistors shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> to store the reset signal level on capacitors Cr<b>1</b> and Cr<b>2</b> in the low and high signal S/H banks respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0187" num="0194">A predetermined time after SHR falls, the TG and TGnull signals are pulsed to effect feedthrough-compensated photocharge transfer from the photodiode to the floating diffusion. In one embodiment, the predetermined time between the SHR falling edge and TG rising edge is just long enough to ensure that, under all conditions, the RG falling edge is complete prior to the TG rising edge. Because the TG rising edge and the TGnull falling edge occur substantially simultaneously or close temporally, the TG feedthrough to the floating diffusion is completely or nearly completely eliminated. Accordingly, the column output signal line will remain at or very close to the reset signal level as charge begins to transfer from the photodiode, making it possible to lower SHS<b>1</b> very shortly after the TG rising edge and prior to the TG falling edge as discussed above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0188" num="0195">In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, the time between the rising edge of TG and the falling edge of SHS<b>1</b> is long enough to: (i) allow photodiode-to-FD transfer of a predetermined amount of photocharge corresponding to the upper end of a “low signal” and (ii) allow the Cs<b>1</b> capacitor to charge (according to the FGA-amplified pixout line voltage) and the column output line to settle for a range of pixout signal levels that extends to a signal level that is slightly above the upper end of a low signal. For example, the predetermined amount of charge may be 50 electrons (a charge level at which photon shot noise will be considerably higher than the low signal path read noise), and the settling limit (i.e., time between rising TG edge and falling SHS<b>1</b> edge) may be set for pixout signal that results from a charge slightly more than 50 electrons. The Cs<b>1</b> capacitor can be made small to improve the setting time since the FGA will reduce the input referred noise of sample-and-hold capacitors within low-signal S/H bank <b>645</b>. This settling time can be, for example and without limitation, in the 20-40 ns range, thus providing an extremely brief low-signal CDS time in the 30-50 ns range.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0189" num="0196">After the falling edge of SHS<b>1</b>, SHS<b>2</b> signal goes high to connect the column output signal to the Cs<b>2</b> capacitor. At this time the FGA is disconnected from the column output line by de-asserting signal Cmux<b>1</b>, (the FGA may also be powered down at this time to save power). The S/H phase for the low signal S/H bank is complete and the ADC mux is set to connect S/H bank <b>1</b> to the SSADCs. Accordingly, the low-signal ADC conversion process proceeds by ramping the ADC ramp voltage (also referred to herein as Vramp or “the reference ramp”—the output of ramp generator <b>656</b>) over a voltage range corresponding a low-light CDS signal range. In one embodiment, the reference ramp terminates prior to reaching the maximum signal value. As described, this ramp range and attendant FGA gain value will provide sub-electron per digital quantization step (i.e., per DN). In one embodiment, for example, a 0.25 electron per low-light signal count for low signal level is used to account for FPN corrections. Given a predetermined signal of 40-50 electrons, 160-200 ramp steps are sufficient cover the low signal range conversion. Consequently, with an exemplary ramp clock period of 4 ns (i.e., 4 ns per ramp step, though faster or slower ramp clocks may be used), the conversion time for the low signal banks is achieved in 0.64-0.80 μs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0190" num="0197">The ADC conversion with respect to outputs of low-signal S/H bank <b>645</b> terminates with two possible outcomes. In one case, referred to herein as “low-signal” confirmation (or “valid low-signal ADC result” or “trip” result), the reference ramp eventually rises to a level that exceeds the low-signal CDS level, causing comparator <b>661</b> within the SSADC capture block to trip (i.e., output transition from one logic state to another) and thereby latch the corresponding ramp count value (i.e., ADC count generated by counter <b>654</b> within ADC controller) within latch or register <b>665</b> of the SSADC capture block. In the other case, referred to herein as a “large-signal confirmation,” the SSADC capture comparator does not trip, meaning that the low-signal CDS value exceeds the low-light signal range. A single “trip” bit may be used to record the low-signal trip/no-trip result to indicate whether the low-signal readout path yielded a valid conversion for a given pixel column and thus either a low-signal confirmation (low-trip bit=1) or high-signal confirmation (low-trip bit=0). In general, this trip/no-trip operation is assumed/described below with respect to other readout architectures that employ an SSADC, though in all cases alternative circuit arrangements may be used to effect SSADC capture and/or confirm validity of either a low-signal or high-signal CDS output.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0191" num="0198">After the low-signal ADC ramp has completed (i.e., ramped to the maximum Vramp level), the contents of the SSADC capture latches (i.e., digital values and thus ADC conversion results for columns that yielded low-signal confirmations) are transferred into digital output buffer <b>657</b>. For columns in which the SSADC capture comparator has not tripped, (i.e. low-trip bit=0), a value of zero may be transferred into the digital line buffer, or alternatively transfer into the digital line buffer write (i.e., the “line buffer write operation”) may be inhibited to save power.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0192" num="0199">In one embodiment, sample capture within high-signal S/H bank <b>647</b> begins substantially concurrently with the ADC conversion of the low signal S/H bank (i.e., low-signal Vramp generation). Given that the high-signal S/H bank may need to settle for a full-well signal, exemplary SHS<b>2</b> pulse widths may be, for example and without limitation, in the 0.5 us to 1.0 us range. As a result, the low-signal ramp profile can be designed to finish just prior to the SHS<b>2</b> falling edge, meaning that the entire low-signal ADC operation may be hidden under the high-signal CDS time. If a valid low-light signal is converted (i.e., low-signal confirmation as indicated by the trip/no-trip bit), the two sample and hold banks will have stored nominally the same signal value, scaled to account for the FGA in the low-signal readout path. By contrast, if the actual pixel signal is larger than the upper threshold for the low-signal output range, the high-signal CDS output will exceed the low-signal CDS output (i.e., after accounting for the FGA)—a consequence exploited in parallel-low/high-signal conversion embodiments discussed below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0193" num="0200">At this point ADC input mux <b>649</b> is switched to supply ADC <b>650</b> with signals from high-signal S/H bank <b>647</b> with each such signal being converted for the full signal range, (e.g. 4096 counts for a linear ramp 12-bit converter, or 512 counts for a VLL-encoded (nonlinear) ramp profile that effects a 3-bit compression and thus a 9-bit converter). Note that the high-signal S/H bank outputs can be converted with an accelerated-ramp SSADC without compromising image quality. In the specific example mentioned above with a VLL-encoded high-signal SSADC ramp, the entire readout will take 712 clocks, a more than 5× reduction in conversion time compared to a 4096-clock linear ramp readout from single S/H bank. Further, because the low-signal ADC conversion is hidden inside the CDS time of the high-signal readout, the effective readout rate increase over a same-output bit-depth conventional sensor is approximately 8×. Further, because the VLL-encoding SSADC is now much faster than a standard or linear ramp SSADC, the VLL SSADC may be multiplexed to more than one column (i.e., shared by two or more columns, performing ADC conversions for each column in sequence) to reduce power and die-area consumption.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0194" num="0201">At the end of the ADC conversion for high-signal S/H bank <b>647</b>, decision/write logic <b>655</b> transfers the latched high-signal ADC conversion result for a given column to digital output buffer <b>657</b> if the trip bit for that column indicates lack of low-signal conversion (i.e., no low-signal confirmation). Otherwise, if the trip bit confirms a low-signal ADC result, no high-signal ADC value is transferred so that the low signal digital value remains in the digital line buffer for the subject column. In a number of embodiments, the trip bit may also be stored within the digital line buffer to indicate to post-ADC correction logic (e.g. logic that performs FPN correction) the low-signal or high-signal source of the ADC output. Alternatively (or additionally), the finalized ADC result may be scaled or otherwise modified/encoded to identify which of the low-signal and high-signal S/H banks sourced the ADC-converted CDS output for a respective pixel. Note also that, for power reduction, high-signal ADC conversion and decision processing may be bypassed altogether for columns in which the low-trip bit indicates a valid low-signal ADC result. Overall, the SSADC is able to encode a maximum value equal to or greater than the full-well capacity of the pixel (e.g., either linearly or as a VLL-encoded value) with, for example and without limitation, accuracy and/or resolution to 0.25 electrons per DN step to enable post-process correction of fixed pattern noise (FPN), row temporal noise (RTN), dark current, etc. The per column FGA can also be used to sufficiently reduce the input referred noise of alternative ADC architectures, including without limitation column-shared ADC architectures such as successive-approximation registration (SAR) ADCs, and alternate per column ADC architectures such as cyclic or sigma-delta converters. For example, a VLL-encoding SAR ADC may be employed to reduce die and capacitor matching requirements and/or to provide higher bit-depth conversion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0195" num="0202">Referring again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, readout of digital values (i.e., ADC results) stored within the digital output buffer <b>657</b> commences after completion of the large-signal ADC conversion (i.e., after any large-signal confirmed ADC results have been captured within the digital output buffer). In the embodiment shown, the digitized CDS results (i.e., ADC outputs or digital pixel values) may be shifted out of the digital output buffer for transmission to a memory IC and/or image-processing IC via a physical signaling interface (PHY) of the image sensor. In alternative embodiments, multiple digital pixel values may be output in parallel. Also, the digital line buffer may include separate “write-in” and “read-out” buffers (or an alternating buffer pair) to enable pixel data for a given pixel row to be output from the image sensor concurrently with storage of pixel data for the subsequent pixel row. With respect to image reconstruction, because the same ADC is used to digitize the low-light and brighter-light CDS outputs, less correction and calibration may be needed to match the output responses of low-signal and high-signal ADC results within the signal band between low-light and brighter-light signals (i.e., near the signal level corresponding to the predetermined charge limit for the low-signal S/H bank).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0196" num="0203">The image sensor architecture of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> permits a number of other improvements/modifications that may further improve performance. For example, the CDS signal range may be split into three or more regions (instead of just two), with the S/H bank count and ADC operation count being correspondingly increased. As another example, capacitive storage elements in both the low-signal and high-signal S/H banks can be made smaller than in more conventional designs to further improve settling time and reduce circuit area. More specifically, the input-referred noise of the S/H capacitors of the low signal bank is reduced by the FGA gain so that smaller-sized capacitors do not impose a noise penalty. The size of the S/H capacitors for the larger signal bank is selected so that kTC noise will not be discernable in view of the photon shot noise of the higher signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0197" num="0204">Note also, that neither of the low-signal or high-signal readout paths in the architecture of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> requires a gain stage for analog ISO gain, (either from a gain amplifier or via the SSADC ramp or references). If the low-signal ADC is designed as an accurate electron counter, there may be little or no advantage to performing ISO gain on the analog signal. Any inaccuracy in counting electrons with respect to high-signal S/H may be disregarded because the read noise is still well below the photon shot noise. Consequently, analog automatic gain control (AGC) may be eliminated (or at least disabled in selected operating modes), thus simplifying the image sensor and host camera system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0198" num="0205">Conditional Read Sensor with Mixed SAR and SSADC Readout Architecture</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0199" num="0206">As discussed above, pixels within a conditional-read image sensors may be selectively (conditionally) readout depending on whether integrated photocharge has reached/exceeded a conditional-read threshold. One of the benefits of conditional readout in oversampled readout approaches for high dynamic range is to reduce the data rate and power consumption due to oversampling, as no readout is performed for underthreshold pixels. For an oversampled conditional-read sensor, much of the power saving is achieved by power-down of the analog CDS readout and ADC conversion circuits once the valid pixels have been readout and converted. A sub-electron read noise is generally desired for the threshold detection and low light signal value readout. In general, the SSADC is good for low readout noise, but has less benefit for power reduction when a below-threshold decision is made.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0200" num="0207"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> illustrates an embodiment of an image sensor <b>690</b> having both a per-column SSADC (formed by controller <b>651</b> and capture blocks <b>653</b>) and a bank of column-shared SAR ADCs <b>695</b> and thus that provides both sub-electron read noise and low power for oversampled conditional readouts. With this sensor readout architecture, the per col SSADC is used to provide low power, low noise readout for threshold assessment and for readout of the low signal values. Bifurcated low-signal and high-signal readout paths are provided as generally discussed in reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> (i.e., FGA and S/H bank <b>645</b> in low-signal readout path, and S/H bank <b>647</b> in high-signal readout path), with the low-signal S/H bank <b>645</b> storing both the reset and signal level for the threshold assessment and for the low-light signal level for above-threshold pixels. A SAR input multiplexer bank is provided in the high-signal readout path (to receive analog CDS values from S/H bank <b>647</b>) to deliver a sequence of N analog CDS values (one for each of N columns of pixel array <b>631</b>) to a corresponding column-shared SAR ADC <b>695</b>. The per-N-column SAR ADC (successive approximation readout ADC) <b>695</b> converts/digitizes each of N incoming high-signal analog CDS values, one after another within the time interval allotted to the SSADC conversion of the low-signal CDS values across the pixel array, thus parallelizing the low-signal and high-signal ADC operations. Low ADC noise is not critical with respect to the photon-shot-noise-dominated high signal, so a higher-noise SAR ADC is acceptable. Each of the per-N-column SAR ADCs can be completely powered down after the valid pixels in the N-column block have been converted. Note also that the ramp comparator within per-column SSADC capture circuit <b>653</b> may serve as the per-column sense amp/comparator for conditional-read overthreshold detection. Also, readout controller <b>691</b> and digital output logic/buffer <b>697</b> operate as generally described above in reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, with modification to control time-multiplexed operations within SAR ADCs <b>695</b> (including sequencing of the SAR input multiplexers <b>692</b>) and to support selective transfer into digital output logic/buffer from either SSADC or SAR ADC according to the SSADC result and/or analog CDS results. Additionally, a second sample and hold bank and attendant set of SHR and SHS control signals can be added in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> to enable pipelined storage and readout of the high-signal values. The high-signal readout can then have pipelined storage of values for a given pixel row within the first sample and hold bank while the SAR ADC is converting signal values from a different pixel row that was previously stored in the second sample and hold bank.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0201" num="0208">Direct-Conversion Readout Architectures</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0202" num="0209">In a number of embodiments described below, analog sample-and-hold circuitry is omitted for either low-signal readout path, the high-signal readout path or both, with the pixout signal instead being delivered to (and thus digitized by) the analog-to digital converter directly—an architecture and operation referred to herein as direct conversion. Said another way, the in-pixel signal driving element (e.g., source-follower transistor in the single-mode and dual-mode pixel architectures discussed above) drives the analog pixout signal to the input of the analog-to-digital converter for digitization, instead of a sample-and-hold element in which a sample of the pixout signal is stored. Direct conversion provides a number of advantages and challenges. For example, elimination of the sample-and-hold capacitor and access transistor saves die area, and simultaneously reduces KTC noise and pixout settling time (i.e., by removing a switch element and capacitive load from the signal output path). By contrast, the ADC conversion interval may exceed the sample-capture time of a sample-and-hold element and thus present noise rejection challenges. These and other considerations are accounted for in various different direct conversion architectures, a number of which may have advantages specific to particular applications.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0210" num="0230"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a dual direct conversion image sensor <b>705</b> having separate (respective) ADCs for bifurcated low-signal and high-signal readout paths.

Also, both the low-signal and high-signal ADCs are implemented by single-slope ADCs (SSADCs) in the example shown, with the low-signal SSADC <b>710</b>-L being formed by a column-shared low-signal (LS) SSADC controller <b>651</b>-L (having a counter and ramp generator) and per-column LS ADC capture blocks <b>653</b>-L, which operate as discussed in reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> above.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0211" num="0231">Still referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, the separate low-signal and high-signal ADC arrangement tends to be particularly effective in applications that require fast row-readout times (i.e., when row time is a critical factor) as the dedicated ADC per readout path enables the different SSADC voltage ramps that may be required for high and low signal readout to be generated concurrently (i.e., at least partly overlapping in time) instead of sequentially. In a number of embodiments, for example, the low signal readout ramp is designed to provide a higher gain than the high signal readout ramp so that, without separate ADC ramp generators and SSADC capture circuits, more time consuming serial ramp generation would be needed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0212" num="0232"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref> illustrates more detailed embodiments of low-signal ADC capture and high-signal ADC capture circuits that may be used to implement the low-signal and high-signal capture blocks <b>653</b>-L and <b>653</b>-H in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>. As shown, each ADC capture circuit includes an auto-zeroing comparator having a first input capacitively coupled (i.e., via C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>, respectively) to the pixout line and a second input coupled to receive a respective one of the ramp voltages (i.e., Vramp_low, Vramp_hi) generated by the low-signal SSADC controller and high-signal SSADC controller.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0213" num="0233">Still referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, which includes a simplified model of the pixout generation (i.e., row-select and other elements of a pixel are omitted for simplicity), a source-follower load-bias transistor <b>725</b> is biased to effect a source-follower operation within the pixel source-follower transistor (“Pixel SF”). That is, Vbias is set to establish, during a given readout operation, a constant load bias current flowing through the source follower transistor and load-bias transistor from Vdd-pix to ground (or Vss). This constant load current causes the voltage on pixout line to follow the voltage (VFD) on floating diffusion node (FD) by virtue of the relationship between the constant current through the source-follower transistor and its gate-to-source voltage. That is, source-terminal voltage (Vs) of the source-follower transistor follows (i.e., rises and falls with) the gate voltage as needed to maintain the constant load-bias current and thus, a higher or lower FD voltage will yield a correspondingly higher or lower pixout voltage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0214" num="0234">As <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref> shows, the pixout line is capacitively coupled (i.e., via capacitive elements C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>) to the inputs of the comparators <b>727</b>-L and <b>727</b>-H within the low-signal and high-signal ADC capture blocks <b>653</b>-L and <b>653</b>-H, respectively (note that latch and trip bit storage elements of the capture blocks are not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>). This arrangement enables each comparator to be “zeroed” or auto-zeroed at the FD reset-state level and thus effects a correlated double-sample of the reset-state and signal state of the FD. More specifically, as shown in the exemplary timing diagram of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, after the floating diffusion node (FD) has been reset and thus readied for photocharge transfer (i.e., after RG falls), the reset-state of the floating diffusion node is driven onto the pixout line (i.e., by virtue of a row select signal which enables a selected pixel within the pixel column to drive that shared column line). Referring first to the low-signal ADC capture block <b>653</b>-L (both capture blocks operate identically in the embodiment shown, though the low- and high-signal voltage ramps may be different), because the capacitive coupling formed by C<b>1</b> isolates (and thus floats) the signal input to comparator <b>727</b>-L, that floating input rises to a potential corresponding to the reset-state signal on the pixout line. Consequently, when auto-zeroed by switchably coupling the comparator output node to the comparator signal input and then decoupling the comparator output from the signal input (i.e., illustrated conceptually by “az” switch), the signal input is driven to a starting level that accounts for the reset-state potential on the pixout line. Shortly after the auto-zero event, which effectively establishes a reset-state offset at the comparator's signal input, TG is raised to enable photocharge transfer from the photodiode to floating diffusion, thereby driving pixout according to the floating diffusion signal-state. As shown, feedthrough compensation (illustrated generically by “TGN<sub>ULL</sub>”, which may include any one or combination of the various feedthrough compensation signals/techniques described above) is provided to cancel (or negate, mitigate or otherwise compensate for) TG feedthrough so that, at least in the case of a low-signal, the pixout line will quickly settle to the signal-state potential. Accordingly, the signal input of the comparator will transition according to the FD signal-state (as conveyed on pixout), offset by the autozero operation to reflect the prior reset-state potential—in effect presenting a reset-state-adjusted signal-state level at the comparator input and thus a correlated double sample of the FD reset-state and signal-state. While pixout is actively driven by the source follower signal (i.e., to establish the CDS signal level at the comparator input), the ramp input to the low-signal comparator is ramped through the low-signal voltage range as shown by the “Vramp_low” waveform, thus triggering a comparator trip at a ramp voltage point corresponding to the CDS signal level at the comparator input if the CDS signal level does in fact fall within the low signal range. Accordingly, as <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref> shows, CDS time is proportional to signal amplitude (i.e., trip point may occur anywhere along low-signal and high-signal ramp) and commences with the falling edge of the autozero pulse (az). Note that trip bit and DN capture circuitry is not shown within the low-signal and high-signal ADC capture blocks in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, but may generally operate as discussed above in reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0215" num="0235">Still referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37 and 38</figref>, because separate SSADC controllers and capture blocks are provided for the low-signal and high-signal readout paths, the high-signal ADC operation may be performed in parallel with the low-signal ADC operation, a circumstance illustrated by the parallel commencement of the high-signal and low-signal ramps in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>. Because the pixout settling time will generally be longer for a larger (brighter-light) signal and the large-signal range may generally span a wider voltage range, the high-signal ramp voltage may proceed at a different ramp rate and span a broader voltage range than the low-signal voltage ramp and thus continue after the low-signal ramp has concluded. Note also that positive voltage ramps are shown for purposes of explanation only. Without inversion in the read signal path, readout signal polarity will be negative (i.e., more negative to indicate more photocharge) so that the voltage ramps may also have a negative polarity, monotonically decreasing from a higher starting voltage to a lower ending voltage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0216" num="0236">In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, Vramp_low is ramped as rapidly as possible with the desired voltage step size in order to achieve a short CDS time. Vramp_low ends at voltage level that is designed to cover the low signal swing only (i.e., anticipated range of a low signal). Additionally, when designing for a below-single-electron read noise system, it may be desirable to quantize the low signal readout to less than 1 electron per data number (DN) increment. For example, a quantization of 0.25 electrons per DN step is implemented in a number of embodiments to yield a ramp step less than a single-electron signal produced at the SF output. Larger or smaller quantization steps may be applied in other embodiments. Conversion time will vary according to the amplitude of the low signal—that is, a valid conversion will occur sooner for a lower-amplitude signal and later for a larger-amplitude signal so that the CDS time and attendant noise reduction factor is a function of signal level. Next, after a desired amount of time to allow for a larger signal to transfer and settle, Vramp_hi begins for the high signal readout (i.e., despite the simultaneity shown, large-signal ramp commencement may occur later than low-signal ramp commencement). Vramp_hi ramps at a desired rate and count for the targeted row time and gain, and ends at a voltage level that is designed to cover the full-well signal of the pixel. TG then goes low to conclude the row readout.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0217" num="0237">Returning briefly to the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, it can be seen that no gain amplifier is disposed within either of the low-signal or high-signal readout paths. This may be acceptable in cases where the low-signal and high-signal ADCs yield the desired gain (i.e., in terms of step per photocharge carrier). In other embodiments, some of which are discussed below, separate or shared fixed-gain or programmable-gain amplifiers can be added to the low-signal readout path and/or high-signal readout path.</div>

Readout controller <b>741</b> and digital output logic/buffer <b>745</b> are modified to reflect the alternative ADC configuration—a configuration that reduces die-area consumption and power consumption at the cost of somewhat increased row time (i.e., as sequential rather parallel ADC ramps are generated for the low-signal and high-signal ranges).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0219" num="0239">As can be seen in the exemplary low-signal and high-signal capture block embodiments <b>653</b>-L/<b>653</b>-H shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> (and in which DN latch and trip-bit storage are not specifically shown), capture block comparators <b>727</b>-L and <b>727</b>-H are capacitively coupled to the pixout line (i.e., via C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>, respectively) and thus enable auto-zero-based CDS conversion as discussed above in reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36-38</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref> illustrates an exemplary high-level timing diagram corresponding to operation within ADC capture blocks <b>653</b>-L and <b>653</b>-H of image sensor <b>740</b>. As shown, both capture-block comparators auto-zero during reset of the pixel (i.e., while RG is high). After RG goes low, TG is switched on (enabling photocharge transfer from photodiode to floating diffusion) and Vramp starts for low signal path after a brief, predetermined time interval long enough for a signal within the low-signal range to settle on the floating diffusion node and pixout line. In a number of embodiments, Vramp is ramped as rapidly as possible to achieve a short CDS time, but without compromising the desired voltage step size. As shown, Vramp for the low-signal range ends at a predetermined voltage level (i.e., yielding a ramp profile designed to cover the low-signal range) and is then restored to a starting point in preparation for a high-signal ramp. A valid low-signal conversion may occur at any point along the voltage ramp, depending on the low-signal readout level, and thus will occur sooner (and yield a correspondingly shorter CDS time) as signal level (and thus luminance) drops. Thus, CDS time and attendant noise rejection is a function of signal level and thus integrated photocharge.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0220" num="0240">Still referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>, after a predetermined time designed to ensure full-well large-signal settling prior to high-signal ADC capture, Vramp starts again for the high signal readout. Note that, though not specifically shown, the high-signal Vramp may start above the “zero” level to avoid re-spanning the low-signal range and thus reduce the number of high-signal ramp steps. For example, in a number of embodiments (including those for other ADC arrangements), the high-signal Vramp begins at a level just below the upper level of the low-signal Vramp (i.e., to avoid any gaps in the overall span of the two ramp ranges). In any case, Vramp proceeds at a predetermined or programmable rate and count for the targeted row time and gain. As discussed below, the duration and amplitude of voltage steps may vary across the low-signal ramp range, high-signal ramp range or both (e.g., progressively shorter and/or larger voltage steps, including piecewise linear and/or curve-fit profiles). As in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, a separate fixed or programmable gain amplifier can be added to the low-signal or high-signal readout paths, and the low-signal readout may be quantized to less than 1 electron per DN step (e.g., 0.25 electrons per DN step).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0222" num="0242">In general, for the dual ADC embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> and other architectures where the low and high signal conversions occur in parallel, it is not necessary to complete both analog-to-digital conversions per pixel readout operation. For example, if a valid digital conversion is obtained via the low-signal readout path before the high-signal conversion is complete, the analog-to-digital conversion operation for the high signal readout can be aborted (i.e., stopped prior to completion). Similarly, for the shared-ADC-controller embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref> and other architectures that execute the low and high signal conversions serially (i.e., one after the other), the high signal conversion can be skipped/omitted altogether (i.e., inhibited from initiating) or aborted at an early stage of the conversion operation. Techniques for signaling or determining that high-signal conversion can or should be aborted/inhibited and/or effecting the abort/inhibit include for example and without limitation:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0243">Recording the status/result of the low signal readout in a per column latch (i.e., trip bit storage as discussed above).</li> <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0244">Writing a known value to the ADC output latch signifying that the high-signal conversion should be aborted or skipped (e.g., encoding the trip bit value within the ADC output value).</li> <li id="ul0008-0003" num="0245">Explicitly and selectively enabling the high signal conversion process to start (e.g., high-signal-conversion start signal is conditionally asserted)</li> <li id="ul0008-0004" num="0246">Inferring that high-signal conversion should be aborted or skipped based on contents of the ADC output latch (e.g., knowing that a DN value less than a specified value must have come from the low signal readout, high-signal conversion may be selectively enabled/disabled according to whether the DN value resulting from low-signal conversion is within or outside, respectively, a predetermined or programmed range of DN values)</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0223" num="0247">As explained above, analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion of the low-signal readout path terminates in a number of embodiments, with two possible outcomes: (i) a successful conversion in which the comparator trips and latches the attendant counter value as the conversion result, or (ii) no conversion—the comparator does not trip and no conversion result is captured. As discussed above, a single trip bit can be used to record the trip/no-trip result to indicate whether the low signal path had a valid conversion for a given pixel column. This bit can be used to control (i.e., enable or disable) the conversion process for the high signal readout. For example the high signal conversion process can be aborted or inhibited according to the state of the trip/no-trip bit resulting from the low-signal conversion, thus saving power and abbreviating the overall readout operation. After the low signal path is converted, the latched counter values are transferred into the digital line buffer from the SSADC latches. If the comparator has not tripped, (i.e. a non-valid conversion result), a value of zero is transferred into the digital line buffer, or alternately the write is inhibited to save power.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0224" num="0248">In the no-conversion case, where the comparator has not tripped, the high signal conversion process either continues or is initiated/enabled. At the end of the A/D conversion for the high signal readout, using the digital decision and write logic block (i.e., logic within the digital output logic/buffer components of the image sensors shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36 and 39</figref> and other embodiments described below), the latched count value in the A/D converter is transferred and stored in the digital line buffer. The same valid conversion bit for the low signal conversions may be used to indicate to the post ADC correction logic (e.g. FPN correction) which readout path sourced the digital data (i.e., low-signal conversion or high-signal conversion). Other techniques can also be employed to identify which readout path was used to generate the digital conversion data for a respective pixel, and, if necessary or desirable, scale the digital conversion data (e.g., to account for applied gain).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0225" num="0249">In one embodiment, readout of the digital values from the digital output logic/buffer (also referred to herein as the “line buffer”) initiates after A/D conversion of the second S/H bank is complete and the appropriate values are written into the digital line buffer. In embodiments in which both the low-signal and high-signal conversions are performed sequentially by a shared ADC, less correction and calibration may be required to match the output responses of the low-signal and high-signal readout paths for CDS results that fall within the signal band between the low-signal and high-signal output ranges (i.e., near the signal level corresponding to the upper photocharge threshold for the low-signal readout path).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0226" num="0250">In a number of embodiments, including those shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36 and 39</figref>, the image sensor will output, from digital output logic/buffer, one digital value per pixel that will be properly scaled and transmitted according to which of the low-signal and high-signal readout paths sourced the finalized data (and optionally including information that indicates the source readout path). For example a finalized digital CDS value sourced by a low-signal readout path that provides a higher-gain readout than the high-signal readout path, that digital value (DN) may be scaled for consistency with (e.g., to yield uniform gain with) high-signal readout path results. Column FPN correction values can also be collected and applied appropriately given knowledge of which readout the valid data was obtained from.</div>

In the implementation shown, bias multiplexer includes a bias-voltage multiplexer <b>771</b> (or other selection element) that selects between high and low load bias voltages (“vbh” and “vbl”), applying one or the other to load-bias transistor <b>725</b> (i.e., as “Vbias”) in accordance with a high/low bandwidth select signal (H/L Sel) from readout controller <b>761</b>. By this arrangement, a relatively high current or a relatively low current may be selectively established on the pixout line (i.e., “high” or “low” source follower current according to the bandwidth select signal), thus effecting selection between relatively fast-settling (high-bandwidth), higher-noise pixout signal generation and relatively slow-settling (low-bandwidth), lower-noise pixout signal generation. Comparator <b>661</b>, capacitive coupling through C<b>1</b> and auto-zero switch element (i.e., responsive to auto-zero signal, “az”) operate generally as discussed above. As further explained below, the high/low bandwidth selection may be leveraged in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref> and others to yield low-noise, low-bandwidth pixout readout in combination with linear or nonlinear low-signal readout voltage ramp (note that analog gain may be implemented in whole or part via the SSADC voltage ramp), with pixout conversion occurring before or after the falling edge of the TG pulse.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0230" num="0254">As discussed, capturing (or converting) a CDS value for the low-signal readout path prior to the falling edge of TG may enable a very brief CDS time (i.e., by not requiring the elapsed time of a full TG pulse—especially for large arrays where the rise and fall time of TG pulses are longer). The residual TG feedthrough, however, will more likely be a FPN component in the low signal readout path as discussed, for example, with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31A and 31B</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0231" num="0255">The selectable load-bias image sensor of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref> enables alternative readout strategies in which post-TG-pulse (i.e., after TG falling edge) CDS capture or direct CDS conversion are executed in both or either of the low-signal and high-signal readout paths, while retaining brief (low-noise) low-signal CDS times. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 44 and 45</figref> illustrate an exemplary timing diagram and flow diagram for such a switched-bias readout approach that leverages the image sensor and bias multiplexer embodiments shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42 and 43</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0232" num="0256">Starting with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>, the low signal path CDS and ADC conversion begins after the falling edge of a first TG pulse. The length of this TG pulse is designed to transfer, from photodiode to floating diffusion node, any amount of photocharge up to a predetermined maximum level of the low-signal range. After completion of the first TG pulse, low-signal conversion starts and completes. During this time the Vbias voltage is set to the relatively low level, “vbl,” so that the source follower (SF) current (or bias current or load-bias current) is set to a desired lower value. After completion of the low-signal conversion, TG is pulsed a second, potentially longer time to enable any accumulated photocharge above the predetermined maximum for the low-signal range to be transferred to the floating diffusion node. At substantially the same time, Vbias is raised to “vbh” (i.e., by transitioning multiplexer control signal, H/L Sel) to raise the bandwidth of the source-follower output and thus enable more rapid pixout settling for any high-signal level that may be present on the floating diffusion node. After a predetermined high-signal settling time delay, Vramp is sequenced through the high-signal range to complete a high-signal A/D conversion. In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>, Vbias goes low a predetermined time before the high-signal Vramp commences to avoid a DC offset between the low-signal and high-signal outputs.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0234" num="0266"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref> illustrates an exemplary readout operation with respect to the architecture shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42 and 43</figref> and timing diagram of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref> (note that the timing diagram of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref> is a high level diagram illustrating the timing and operation and is not a detailed to-scale timing diagram and also that bandwidth switching may be achieved using various techniques other than or in combination with the source-follower bias current approach shown). Starting at <b>781</b>, the SF bias current is set to a first desired high value, providing a higher readout bandwidth (i.e., faster pixout settling). The pixel is reset at <b>782</b> (i.e., RG pulse applied) and then, a predetermined time after the falling edge of RG, the SF bias current is set to the lower value at <b>783</b>, establishing a lower, less noise-responsive readout circuit bandwidth in preparation for low-signal readout. In the direct conversion embodiments of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42 and 43</figref>, the auto-zero signal, az, may be raised concurrently with RG assertion, but in any case goes low at <b>784</b> (shortly after the falling RG edge) to autozero the SSADC comparator and thus enable direct CDS conversion. Note also that the falling edge of RG can optionally be compensated to reduce feedthrough and improve settling time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0235" num="0267">Continuing with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>, after the auto-zero signal goes low, TG and TGnull signals are pulsed with opposite polarity at <b>785</b> to effect feedthrough-compensated transfer charge from the photodiode to the floating diffusion node. In the embodiment shown, the length of this initial, “short” TG pulse is designed to enable transfer of a predetermined amount photocharge just above the maximum photocharge level for the signal range allocated to the low signal path, but significantly less than a full-well level of photocharge. After completion of the first TG pulse conversion of the low signal starts and completes as shown at <b>786</b> and by the low-signal Vramp profile in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>. During this time the Vbias remains at a low value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0236" num="0268">The SSADC low-signal ramp may be a linear or non-linear ramp designed in either case to span a predetermined low-signal range. An implementation of one of many possible non-linear low-signal voltage ramps is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref>, which illustrates an exemplary plot showing ramp voltage steps vs. time, with the time axis being marked in units of τ (i.e., the product of CDS time and source-follower corner frequency, ωc). For example, if ω<sub>c </sub>is 10 MHz, then a CDS time of 100 ns corresponds to a duration of 1.0 τ on the x-axis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0237" num="0269">The exemplary ramp shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</figref> is an accelerated ramp that starts at a ramp rate or ramp step time that is slower than a conventional ramp at the start and becomes progressively faster (i.e., progressively shorter time between successive voltage steps). This permits, for example, the shortest possible CDS time (or at least a progressively shortened time) at each signal level. The CDS time is the time from falling edge of SHR to the valid conversion of signal, wherever that may occur (if at all) along the low-signal ramp range.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0238" num="0270">The settling time for one electron (“1e”) of signal is less than that for two electrons, which is less than three, etc. By designing a ramp that follows the settling time of the signal, (i.e. the ramp reaches the desired specified target signal level just after the signal line can settle to that value), a CDS time proportional to signal level may be achieved that has the nominally shortest CDS time for each signal level, (i.e. there is no delay to wait for start of the ramp due to settling of a 20e<sup>−</sup> signal). Assuming, for example, that the conversion gain from floating diffusion node to source-follower output is 100 μV/e<sup>−</sup>, the nominal pixout settling time for a 1e<sup>−</sup> FD charge level and thus a 100 μV pixout signal is 0.693τ. The nominal settling time for a 2e<sup>−</sup> FD charge level (i.e. 200 μV output signal) is 1.386τ, the nominal setting time for a 3e<sup>−</sup> FD charge level (300 μV output signal) is 1.791τ, the nominal settling time for a 4e<sup>−</sup> FD charge level (400 μV output signal) is 2.079τ, and so forth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0239" num="0271">In embodiments or operating modes in which sub-electron quantization is desired, the low-signal readout ramp step can be set to sub-100 μV increments. For example, the four 25 μV steps at <b>801</b>, a ramp resolution which could be implemented across the entire low-signal range or in any portion thereof, could be implemented instead of the single 100 μV step to provide an approximate quantization of 0.25e<sup>−</sup>/DN.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0240" num="0272">As mentioned above, if the SSADC comparator trips during the low-signal readout for a particular column (affirmative result in decision <b>787</b>), ADC conversion of that pixel column is deemed complete and high-signal readout path conversion for that pixel column is unnecessary (and thus may be skipped). If the comparator does not trip during the low signal conversion attempt (negative decision at <b>787</b>), the counter and ramp generator are paused (held) as shown at <b>788</b>, the SF bias current is switched to a high value at <b>789</b> (i.e., shifting the DC value of the pixel output signal towards ground and away from Vdd and thus in a direction away from the ramp value so the comparator will not trip during the bias change) and, at approximately the same time as the bias current change, TG and TGnull are pulsed a second time at <b>790</b>, with pulse-widths long enough to transfer a full-well photocharge from the photodiode to floating diffusion node. At the high source-follower bias level, the column output line will settle more quickly to the signal value, thereby avoiding extended settling time that may otherwise be required for the high-signal photocharge range. After delaying at <b>791</b> for a time sufficient for pixout settling follow a photocharge transfer in an amount up to the photodiode full-well level (and for settling with respect to any residual feedthrough, which will be small compared to the signal level), the SF bias current is switched back to the low-bandwidth, low-noise setting at <b>792</b>, thus restoring the high signal DC level to a point where the conversion is valid with respect to the low SF bias reset level. A predetermined time after switching back to the low source-follower bias, the ramp and counter are restarted at <b>793</b> and ADC conversion of the high signal readout proceeds to completion, thus finishing A/D conversion of the pixel output. Note that the ramp for the high-signal conversion may start at a point just below the range of the low signal readout to avoid redundant ramp steps or, alternatively, may simply start at “zero.” As with the low-signal voltage ramp, the ADC ramp for the high signal conversion may be linear or non-linear in either step duration or step size (voltage per step) at all or any part of the large-signal ramp range. Also, the large-signal ADC ramp may also start sooner than shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref> and follow the signal settling as described for the low-signal readout. Further, a single TG pulse may be generated instead of the two shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref> if, for example, a full-well charge can be transferred in a TG pulse width that is consistent with achieving the desired short CDS time for the low signal readout.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0245" num="0277">Although high-signal A/D conversion has generally been described in terms of linear-ramp SSADC (e.g. 4096 counts and corresponding uniform ramp voltage steps for a linear ramp 12 bit converter), a virtually-lossless lookup (VLL) ramp having nonlinear voltage step increases across at least part of the ramp range may be employed in alternative embodiments or operating modes to reduce the number of high-signal ramp steps, thus saving time and compressing the output data size. In one embodiment, for example, a 9-bit (512-step) VLL ramp spans the same high-signal voltage range as a 12-bit (4096 step) linear ramp, thereby reducing the number of ramp steps by 8× and reducing output bit depth by three bits. Continuing the example, an SSADC that generates a 512-step VLL ramp (which may be applied with respect to direct or S/H high-signal conversion without loss of image quality) following a 200-step low-signal ramp, will require a mere 712 clocks in total to complete the bifurcated low-signal/high-signal conversions; a more than 5× conversion time reduction compared to a 12-bit linear ramp readout from a single readout path. When the low-signal bank conversion is hidden under the high-signal conversion (i.e., parallel low-signal and high-signal conversion operations), the effective conversion time reduction grows to 8× over a 12-bit linear ramp, single-readout approach.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0252" num="0284">In each of the embodiments shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 51A-51C</figref>, the low-signal path gain amplifier (<b>860</b>, <b>864</b>) is implemented by a fixed gain amplifier (FGA) with the gain value set in conjunction with the SSADC reference ramp generator to provide less than or equal to 0.25 electrons per digital number (DN) increment. The FGA is provided in the low-signal readout path only so that gain-switching between low-signal and high-signal readout paths is not required (in contrast to the alternating gains likely applied to low-signal and high-signal readout paths by a programmable gain amplifier (PGA) disposed in both readout paths). Since the gain amplifier is a FGA and not a PGA, fewer capacitors are required and the gain amplifier can be made smaller than that required for a PGA. In addition, since the FGA will generally be applied to a very small signal range, (e.g., pixout signal range corresponding to 0-to-30 electrons), a relatively simple, low bandwidth (and small footprint) FGA may be used (e.g., as shown at <b>868</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51C</figref>). In particular, non-switched-capacitor amplifier designs can be used with reduced component count in order to reduce die area consumption and so that, overall, the bandwidth, noise and power consumption of the FGA can be reduced compared to that of a row-rate switchable PGA. The FGA value is also chosen to reduce the input-referred noise of the ADC and other analog circuits in the readout path after the pixel source follower to a level where the total sensor temporal readout noise approaches the pixel source follower read noise.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0253" num="0285">In the embodiments of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 50 and 51A-51C</figref>, analog gain may be omitted from the high-signal readout path in view of the larger, photon-shot-noise-dominated signal, with any readout gain instead provided during A/D conversion (e.g., by ADC references, SSADC ramp, etc.). In alternative embodiments, programmable or fixed analog gain circuitry may be disposed in (e.g., via multiplexer or hardwiring) the high-signal readout path. For example, a single PGA could be used to supply the gain required for both the low signal and higher signal readout paths. In embodiments that support single-path readout modes that benefit from PGA operation, the single-path PGA may be leveraged in the bifurcated-read-path mode, thus limiting die area increase. Also, by providing sample-and-hold circuitry in the high-signal readout path, a single per-column SSADC capture block can be used for both the low-signal and high-signal readout paths.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0254" num="0286">In the embodiments of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 51A-51C</figref>, the SSADC capture block is operated in direct conversion mode for the low-signal path. That is, as discussed above, the pixel source-follower directly drives the input to the SSADC comparator during the conversion operation instead of sampling-and-holding the reset-state and signal-state pixout levels. The low-signal direct conversion may be carried out in at least two ways. In a number of embodiments, for example, the low signal level is determined using the SSADC and digital CDS techniques (e.g., as discussed above). In that case, the reset-state and signal-state of the floating diffusion node are digitized one after another in respective direct conversion operations, with the final digitized CDS value generated in the digital domain by subtracting the reset-state conversion result from the signal-state conversion result (i.e., yielding [photocharge signal+reset-state]−[reset-state]=photocharge signal).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0255" num="0287"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref> illustrates an exemplary digital CDS operation that may be carried out within the embodiments of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 50 and 51A-51C</figref>. In the example shown, the SHR and optionally the SHS pulse go high prior to the falling edge of the reset signal RG, (note that only the falling edge of RG is shown). After the falling edge of RG, the SHR signal goes low to store the reset signal level on capacitor Cr in the high signal S/H banks. At this time the Mux Sel signal is set to connect the low-signal FGA output to the input of the SSADC. The SSADC ramp and counters begin operation in order to produce a digital output representing the reset level of the pixel. After some predetermined number of counts and elapsed time, the reset level conversion completes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0256" num="0288">A predetermined time after the reset ramp completes, the TG and TG<sub>null </sub>signals are asserted to effect feedthrough-compensated photocharge transfer. Because the TG rising edge and the TG<sub>null </sub>falling edge occur substantially simultaneously or close temporally, TG feedthrough to the floating diffusion is canceled and the column output signal line will remain at or very close to the reset-state level. Accordingly, the column output line will settle very quickly following photocharge transfer from the photodiode to the floating diffusion node. Despite the feedthrough compensation, a small residual feedthrough may still result due to, for example, spatial variation between the TG-to-FD coupling capacitance and the TG<sub>null</sub>-to-FD coupling capacitance. In general, such residual feedthrough will produce a spatial fixed pattern offset noise (FPN) that may be corrected as discussed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0257" num="0289">A predetermined delay is imposed after TG goes high (e.g., sufficient settling time for a pixout signal corresponding to 1e<sup>−</sup> of photocharge plus residual feedthrough) after which the SSADC controller commences sequencing of the voltage ramp and counter to effect analog-to-digital conversion of the pixout signal level. For a low signal level, (e.g. 1e<sup>−</sup>), the SSADC will reach a valid conversion on the first ramp step and thus yield a very short CDS time. For larger signals within the low-signal range (e.g. 2, 3, 4 . . . 30 electrons), the SSADC will complete conversion at correspondingly later ramp steps/ramp voltages and thus yield correspondingly longer CDS times. That is, the direct conversion CDS time (and therefore noise rejection or immunity) is proportional to the pixout signal level and thus the integrated photocharge. Because low-signal readout is meaningful only over a relatively narrow photocharge range, it will generally require fewer ramp clocks than the high-signal range. For example, if the signal range of the low signal readout corresponds to 30 electrons, conversion will require a maximum of 120 clocks given a 0.25e<sup>−</sup> (i.e., four ramp steps/counts per electron) ADC quantization. As explained above, attempted conversion of the low-signal path terminates with two possible outcomes: valid conversion (the comparator trips and latches the attendant counter value), or invalid conversion (comparator does not trip). As discussed above, various different techniques may be employed to select between valid low-signal and high-signal conversions, selectively abort/inhibit high-signal conversion, correct fixed pattern noise, scale digital outputs, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0258" num="0290">Still referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref>, the TG signal goes low after low-signal path conversion completes and, a predetermined time after the TG falling edge, SHS signal goes low to store the pixout signal within the high-signal path sample-and-hold bank (i.e., on the Cs capacitive element shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51A</figref>. Thereafter, the ADC input mux is switched to select the S/H bank and the SSADC comparator is auto-zeroed again (timing not shown) using the stored reset level on the sample-and-hold reset-state capacitive element (Cr). Because the S/H bank may need to capture (and settle) for a signal as large as a full-well signal, typical SHS pulse widths may be, for example and without limitation, in the 0.5 μs to 1.0 μs range. Accordingly, in a number of embodiments, the low-signal direct-conversion time is designed to occur and finish during the SHS pulse.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0259" num="0291">At the end of the A/D conversion for the large-signal CDS value stored within the S/H bank, the digital output logic/buffer selects between the low-signal and high-signal conversion results as generally discussed above, passing one value or the other as the digital pixel output, together with optional information that indicates the source readout path (low-signal or high-signal) for purposes of downstream processing (i.e., post-ADC correction logic such as FPN correction, scaling logic, image reconstruction logic, etc.).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0273" num="0317">In feedthrough-compensated embodiments for which fast-CDS operation yields sub-electron read noise for the pixel source follower, the total read noise may be dominated by circuits after the pixel source follower. In order to realize sub-electron total read noise, the input-referred noise of the circuits after the pixel source follower (for example, sample and hold circuits, ADC, etc.) as well as the input-referred noise of the source follower itself is reduced in embodiments described below by increasing the pixel conversion gain. For example, by implementing a 500 μV/e− conversion gain instead of 100 μV/e− conversion gain for low-signal readout, post-source-follower noise may be reduced by 5×. As a more specific example, if noise-post source follower is 150 μV, then raising the conversion gain from 100 μV/e<sup>−</sup> to 500 μV/e<sup>−</sup> will reduce effective readout noise by a factor of 5 from 1.5e<sup>−</sup> to 0.3e<sup>−</sup>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0274" num="0318">While pixel conversion gain may be increased by reducing floating diffusion capacitance, charge storage capacity of the floating diffusion node will be correspondingly reduced and may fall below the capacity required to store the photocharge from a full-well photodiode (i.e., depending upon photodiode capacity, practical floating diffusion swing limitations, etc.) and thus compromising dynamic range at the upper limit of the large-signal range. In a number of embodiments, dynamic range is preserved by using a variable conversion gain pixel architecture that enables the floating diffusion capacitance to be changed dynamically between low-signal and high-signal readout operations. That is, by configuring the pixel in a low capacitance/high-conversion-gain readout mode (i.e., low noise mode) for the low-signal readout, and then switching to a higher-capacitance/lower-conversion-gain readout mode (i.e., larger charge storage capacity) during large-signal readout, the noise benefit of high conversion gain readout may be achieved without compromising the upper end of the large-signal range.</div>

After Cr has charged to the reset-state potential and prior to the falling edge of SHR, auto-zero signal, az, is raised to auto-zero per column comparator <b>903</b>, clamping the comparator signal input according to the pixout (and Cr) potential on the pixout-side of capacitive element C<b>1</b>. Feedthrough-compensated photocharge transfer from photodiode <b>110</b> to floating diffusion node <b>112</b> is then enabled by the opposite polarity pulses shown on TG and TGnull, with SHRS being pulsed as shown to store the resultant signal-state of the floating diffusion node on capacitor Cs. By this operation, the difference between the signal-state and reset-state samples (i.e., analog CDS value) develops and is present at the comparator input when compare-enable signal, CmpEn is pulsed. Accordingly, depending on whether the CDS value exceeds threshold voltage Vthr (e.g., corresponding to the upper limit of a low-signal pixout range), comparator <b>903</b> will either trip, driving Csel high, or not trip, maintaining the low Csel level. If the comparator does not trip, a low-signal readout is confirmed and the signal-state and reset-state samples stored on Cs and Cr are either supplied as analog CDS input to downstream ADC circuitry, or separately digitized and differenced in the digital domain to yield a digital CDS result. By contrast, if the comparator trips, a high-signal readout is confirmed, and the high-state of Csel enables a rapid transition to the reduced conversion gain/higher-capacity readout mode within VCG pixel <b>900</b>. In that case, TG may be pulsed again as shown at <b>921</b> to enable transfer of all remaining photocharge from photodiode <b>110</b> to floating diffusion node <b>112</b>. Thereafter, SHS is pulsed again at <b>923</b> to capture the large-signal pixout signal (signal-state of floating diffusion node <b>112</b>) within S/H bank <b>224</b> on capacitive element Cs. Thereafter, floating diffusion node <b>112</b> is reset by RG pulse <b>925</b> and the resulting reset-state pixout level is captured within S/H bank <b>224</b> on capacitive element Cr in response to SHR pulse <b>927</b>. The high-signal readout path signal-state and reset-state samples captured within S/H bank <b>224</b> may be separately digitized and then differenced to yield a digital double-sampled result, or differenced in the analog domain to yield an analog double-sampled result prior to digitization. In either case, the resulting high-signal readout value constitutes an uncorrelated double sample since the reset level is obtained after the signal level. In general, any potentially higher noise resulting from the lack of reset-state correlation in the two samples will be negligible in view of the more dominant photon shot noise of the larger signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0277" num="0321"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57C</figref> is a table of exemplary CDS times, readout noise levels, conversion gains and dynamic range that may be achieved by a variable-conversion-gain, feedthrough-compensated, bifurcated readout path image sensor embodiment, comparing those performance metrics with those of a more conventional image sensor lacking those features.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0278" num="0322">Reflecting on <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 57A and 57B</figref>, numerous alternative circuit arrangements/techniques may be employed for implementing variable conversion gain and for controlling variable-gain readout. For example, in a number of feedthrough-compensated bifurcated-readout-path embodiments, deterministic low-signal and high-signal readouts are separately performed as part of each pixel readout with high conversion gain being applied in the low-signal readout and low conversion gain applied in the high-signal readout. That is, instead of conditionally executing a low-conversion gain readout depending on the threshold comparison result in per-column comparator <b>903</b>, that comparator may be omitted (or bypassed in a selected operating mode) and Csel instead controlled by a row control signal (i.e., dedicated to a given pixel row, shared among all pixel rows, or asserted to override to the per-column comparator output) so that every high-conversion-gain output onto pixout is followed by a low-conversion-gain output onto pixout. In that case, the dashed pulses shown at <b>921</b>, <b>925</b>, <b>927</b> and <b>923</b>, and the dashed high-going Csel signal may be generated deterministically (i.e., without condition) as part of the readout operation shown. Also, instead of two TG pulses, a single TG pulse (and coincident TGnull pulse) may be applied, with low-signal readout captured in analog or digital samples (i.e., within S/H or converted by ADC) before or after the falling edge of the TG pulse. In that case, the high-signal readout may also be captured (in analog or digital samples) before or after the falling TG edge. Also, the SHR falling edge may be used to capture reset-state samples for both low-signal and high-signal readouts at the same time (and prior to corresponding signal-state captures) so that both the low-signal and high-signal readouts constitute correlated double samples.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0279" num="0323">Dark Pixel Emulation with Active Floating-Diffusion Stabilization</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0280" num="0324">In various embodiments disclosed herein, image sensors that implement control-signal feedthrough compensation as described above are operated in both full-resolution and reduced-resolution (enhanced low-light sensitivity) read-out modes during respective subframes of an exposure interval, and/or may include one or more columns and/or rows of pixels operated in dark emulation modes (e.g., leveraging the above-described floating-diffusion stabilization techniques), all of which are described below. Accordingly, spatial resolution of the image sensor may be preserved while also enhancing low-light sensitivity. In a number of embodiments, reduced-resolution image data is selectively applied in final image reconstruction according to a light-intensity determination based upon the subframe or frame-to-frame readouts themselves. In other embodiments, subframe intervals are programmably controlled to balance read-out circuitry utilization and limit on-board data storage needs while achieving desired imaging results effects. In yet other embodiments, a binary threshold used to trigger conditional read-out operations is calibrated according to read-out results and/or reference charge injection. These and other features and benefits are described in greater detail below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0281" num="0325">There a number of reasons to expect a much larger RC delay of signal lines in the pixel array in the near future. For one, 3D stacking technology will allow a large increase in the active pixel array area creating unique opportunities to use larger optical formats by pushing the analog and digital section beneath the footprint of the pixel array. Also, the pace of pixel pitch reduction is expected to slow, as the pixel pitch approaches the diffraction limit, putting greater pressure on increased optical formats to provide the generational improvements in image resolution. Further, continuing improvement in ISP processing power allows use of larger resolutions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0282" num="0326">At least one problem with increased RC delay in image sensors is that the propagation delay across the imaging array begins to enter the transfer function bandwidth of the high-signal correlated-double-sampling (CDS) period. Consider that an RC time constant of 33 ns could enter a high-signal CDS transfer function of 33 Mhz, with 3 sigma settling stressing a 10 Mhz transfer function. A high-signal CDS transfer function may be from 100 khz to 1 MHz (for example and without limitation to such range), so it is easy to expect a feasibility challenge of signal uniformity in the near future. In addition, because row-wise signals are approximate square waves, dispersion due to line inductances is a factor. In practical terms, it has been observed that an 18 Megapixel sensor with 1.25 micron pitch, if driven from one side of the array, achieves visible left to right row noise, due to the RC propagation delay. Even a measured row temporal noise ratio of, for example, 14× is unacceptable in many applications, with designers opting for a differential video mode requiring nearly twice the power consumption.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0283" num="0327">There are at least two fundamental problems with the conventional row noise correction (RNC) approaches. First, the pixels in dark correction blocks, covered with a light shield or other light block material (e.g., as shown by shaded regions in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref>), have different capacitive loads than the active pixels (i.e., pixels in the light sensitive portion of the array). This can cause a miscorrelation in dark signal performance between active and dark arrays. Second, the RC propagation delay across the array tends to produce a mismatch in both voltage and pulse shape that enters the pixel. As a result, the row noise correction reference pixels are fundamentally inadequate to represent the distribution of pixel behaviors across the array, and there are fundamental limits to the effectiveness of conventional RNC approaches.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0284" num="0328">Fortunately, the various conditional-read pixel architectures disclosed herein, and specifically the two-dimensional control of the transfer gate between photodiode and floating diffusion, allows for a practical distributed sampling of dark level behavior, solving the fundamental problem at its root source.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0285" num="0329"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref> illustrates an exemplary dark-emulation with respect to a full-resolution pixel array. In the example shown, each row of pixels is logically organized in groups of N pixels (e.g., 48 pixels sharing an ADC circuit as discussed above) and in which a random or pseudo-random or otherwise deterministic one (or more) of the pixels within each N-pixel group is “dark-sampled” each subframe or full-frame interval—read-out using a dark-column emulation protocol as discussed below. More specifically, a local “dark level” read is performed in the dark-sampled pixels to obtain an emulated dark-pixel value. Because these active pixels are not covered by metal or other shielding and are light-sensitive, a special control sequence is applied to discard charge from the pixels before executing a CDS read-out, thus emulating the dark read within conventional shielded pixels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0286" num="0330">In the particular arrangement shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref>, the pixel(s) selected for dark-emulation read-out is dynamically varied for each N-pixel group within a given row and subframe, and with the dynamic selection repeated for each successive row to disperse the dark-emulation read-out in a preferably invisible sequence, but with controlled density, throughout the pixel array. Note that, in one embodiment, a pixel used for dark-pixel emulation in one subframe of a frame may be used as a light-gathering pixel in one or more other subframes of the same frame. Also, in various embodiments, dark-emulation read-out is applied exclusively with respect to green pixels (i.e., pixels covered by or otherwise associated with a green color filter element) in view of the larger proportion of those pixels within the array (e.g., 2× in a Bayer-pattern CFA).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0287" num="0331"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</figref> illustrates exemplary timing diagrams for a number of pixel read-out modes within a conditional-read image sensor, including the conditional and unconditional read-out modes described above as well as a dark-emulation read-out mode. In the timing diagrams shown, the row and column transfer gate control signals (TGr and TGc) are shown in a combined, logically-ANDed form as “transfer-enable” signal, “TxEn”). As shown, both the conditional and unconditional read-out operations commence with a floating diffusion reset operation (pulsing the RG signal as discussed above), followed by a reset-state sampling operation at <b>951</b> (pulsing the SHR signal). In the conditional read operation, the partial read operation and threshold evaluation are omitted for ease of understanding, but are carried out as previously described. TxEn is raised only in columns for which an over-threshold pixel state is detected (i.e., conditionally asserting TGc as discussed above, thus enabling full transfer of integrated charge from photodiode to floating diffusion pursuant to pixel read-out), while TGc and thus TxEn is asserted unconditionally. SHS is asserted in both conditional and unconditional instances to trigger signal-state sampling.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0288" num="0332">Still referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</figref>, dark-emulation read-out begins with assertion of TxEn at <b>952</b> for selected columns on a row to transfer integrated charge from photodiode to floating diffusion and thus empty (reset) the photodiode. As discussed below, this operation is controlled through assertion of TGc within pattern-selected pixel columns, with the selection pattern being dynamically varied from row to row and/or from subframe to subframe. After the photodiode reset at <b>952</b>, the remaining operations are the same as unconditional read mode and thus include the floating diffusion reset (RG pulse, which may overlap the TxEn pulse), reset-state sample (SHR pulse), and signal-state read-out (TxEn pulse followed by SHS pulse), with the signal-state read-out capturing the empty state of the photodiode and thus an emulation of a dark pixel read-out. It is noted that such pixels are not truly “dark” in that they gather light between the two TxEn pulses. Generally, however, these two operations are only a few microseconds apart and vanishingly little to no light will be gathered, compared to the surrounding light-gathering operations that gather light for hundreds of microseconds to hundreds of milliseconds, depending on exposure. In a given embodiment, various techniques can be used to compensate for or reject a “dark” pixel that has received too much actual light or is faulty, including: rejecting a dark value based on eclipse detection; rejecting a dark value based on its variation from other dark values gathered for that row and subframe; rejecting a dark value based on the amount of light gathered by surrounding pixels; or compensating for light gathered by such a pixel by subtracting from its value a proportional fraction of light gathered by surrounding light-gathering pixels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0289" num="0333"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref> illustrates a more complete timing diagram for emulated dark-pixel read-out, showing the pipelined sequence of operations within the pixel array, sample-and-hold logic, comparator and ADC circuitry. As shown, additional TGc pulses are applied to reset the photodiode in columns selected for dark-emulation read-out in each row. As explained above, conditional-assertion of TGc during the signal-state read-out operation (i.e., TGc signal pulses denoted by ‘*’) applies during conditional-read/reset operations—TGc is asserted unconditionally during the same interval in an unconditional read operation. In either case, pixels that were designated as dark pixels for that row (i.e., operations denoted by ‘**’) are also read at the time of the conditional or unconditional read of the light-gathering pixels on the row for that subframe.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0290" num="0334"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</figref> illustrates an exemplary image sensor architecture <b>2170</b> that supports emulated-dark read-out operations discussed above. As shown, the image sensor includes row logic <b>961</b> (i.e., row decoder/driver) and readout controller <b>963</b>, both of which operate generally as discussed above, except that row logic <b>961</b> is modified to generate an additional TGr pulse shown to enable pre-read photodiode reset operations in selected dark-emulation pixels, and readout controller <b>963</b> is modified to provide one or more additional dark-emulation control signals as discussed below. As in the embodiments discussed above, the pixel array includes a number of m*n pixel blocks, only one of which is shown (i.e., pixel block ‘i’ <b>965</b>), and the column read-out circuitry includes a corresponding number of constituent read-out logic blocks, only one of which is shown (read-out block ‘i’ <b>967</b>). While the pixel array is implemented generally as described above, each of the read-out blocks <b>967</b> is modified to support dark-emulation read-out. More specifically, read-out block <b>967</b> includes multi-bank sample/hold circuitry <b>968</b>, multiplexers <b>969</b> and <b>970</b>, column-shared PGA <b>971</b> and column-shared ADC <b>972</b> (e.g., a SAR ADC, though an SSADC formed by column-shared SSADC controller and per-column SSADC capture blocks may alternatively be used), status bit buffers <b>973</b> and <b>974</b>, and output buffers <b>975</b> and <b>976</b>. Note that status flags stored with buffers <b>973</b> and <b>974</b> (e.g., indicating eclipsed, saturated, underthreshold status, and/or low-signal high-signal readout path source) may signify instances of dark-emulation read-out data as discussed below. Per-column comparator circuitry <b>977</b> may operate generally as discussed above, except that additional control logic is provided to accommodate dark-emulation read-out, including dark-column pattern controller <b>978</b> to control the pixel column or columns selected for dark-emulation read-out within a given row and/or subframe.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0291" num="0335"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a dark-column pattern controller <b>980</b> that may be used to implement pattern controller <b>978</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</figref>. In the implementation shown, pattern controller <b>980</b> includes a pseudo-random number generator <b>981</b> that outputs a pseudo-random M-bit number to M:n decoder <b>982</b>. Decoder <b>982</b> decodes the incoming pseudo-random number to assert one of n dark-emulation enable signals (EnDE), thus enabling a dark-emulation operation within the corresponding pixel column. As each successive pixel row is selected for conditional or unconditional read-out, the pseudo-random number generator produces a new pseudo-random number, thereby selecting a different pixel column for dark-emulation and randomizing the pattern of dark-emulation pixels within the pixel block. In one embodiment, pseudo-random number generator <b>981</b> may be designed to ensure a minimum pixel offset between pixels in successive rows and may also be seeded (or constructed) differently than the pseudo-random number generator for neighboring pixel blocks to randomize the dark-emulation pixel pattern from block to block. For example, a single generator may be used with different scramblings of M bitlines to each block—the pseudo-random number may be larger than M bits as well, with different subgroups of the bits supplied to each block Also, M:n decoder <b>982</b> and/or pseudo-random number generator <b>981</b> may include circuitry to ensure assertion of an adjacent green pixel in response to a pseudo-random number that would otherwise select a red or blue pixel column within a given column, thus effecting a green-pixel-only dark-emulation embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0292" num="0336">In other embodiments, the controller can comprise a circuit to feed a bit pattern into one end of a linear shift register, with one register element per column of the array. A pattern of ‘0’ and ‘1’ bits is fed into the shift register, along with calculated shift lengths between rows, to provide the EnDE[i] signals. For decimated modes, the register can be loaded with a fixed pattern that does not change between rows, subframes, and frames. In other embodiments, various other circuits may be employed to control which columns are designated for dark-emulation read-out within each row and subframe.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0293" num="0337"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a read-enable logic <b>985</b> (e.g., that may be implemented within logic block <b>977</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</figref>) having circuitry to support dark-emulation read-out. More specifically, eclipse and overthreshold flags are supplied, together with the EnDE bit for the subject pixel column (i.e., EnDE[i]), to a read/dark-emulation logic circuit <b>987</b> which asserts the TGc signal for that pixel column (i.e., TGc[i]) according to those inputs and a set of control inputs from the read-out control logic (i.e., element <b>967</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</figref>). In one embodiment, shown for example in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</figref>, read/dark-emulation logic <b>990</b> asserts TGc[i] in response to one of three circumstances: (i) a conditional read is to be carried out as indicated by either an eclipsed state (in which the conditional read is executed to clear the photodiode and floating diffusion) or an overthreshold determination; (ii) an unconditional read is to be executed as signaled by an all-column unconditional-read signal from the read-out control logic; or (iii) the dark-read enable bit, EnDE[i], is asserted for the subject pixel column. In the depicted implementation, the EnDE bit is logically ANDed with a dual-pulse dark-emulation timing signal from the read-out control logic (“Dark Read”) to generate a two-pulse TGc signal assertion; an initial pulse to enable the photodiode emptying operation discussed above, and a final pulse to enable the signal-state capture operation at the same time that signal-states are captured for light-gathering pixels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0294" num="0338">Returning to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</figref>, the EnDE[i] bit is also supplied to ADC-enable/dilation logic circuit <b>989</b> to enable generation of status flags, RE and MP. In the embodiment shown, an asserted RE bit signals an ADC-enable event as discussed above, and when RE is low, the MP bit (multi-purpose bit) is high or low to indicate the reason for the ADC suppression (i.e., MP=0 if pixel underthreshold, MP=1 if pixel eclipsed or saturated). In contrast to embodiments in which one of the status flags (e.g., the AB bit described above) is unused and reallocated to ADC bit conveyance in the event of a logic ‘1’ RE bit, the MP bit is retained in the ADC-enable case and used to indicate whether the read-out is a dark-emulation read-out (MP=1) or an image data read-out (MP=0). One consequence of this arrangement is that the net data stream size may be increased by one bit relative to the double-duty AB-bit/ADC-bit embodiments, though the status flags may be encoded within the ADC value itself (e.g. reserving upper and/or lower ADC values to signal the different status conditions shown), thus avoiding data bandwidth increase.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0295" num="0339"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 66 and 67</figref> relate to an image sensor architecture that enables simultaneous readout of two diagonal pixels within a four-pixel Bayer pattern—one that provides dark emulation and another that provides an active image signal (i.e., pixel value corresponding to a region of a scene). For conventional architecture, individual diagonal pixel readout is not readily feasible since there is no two-dimensional transfer-gate activation. Diagonal alternating is possible by staggering the tx and rs control signals diagonally (and it would be hardwired with no flexibility), and sensor companies have continuously been challenged with the task of trying diagonal metal routing jogging strategies with little to no luck (diagonal readout can give higher resolution binning) due to the challenges and asymmetries of the layout.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0296" num="0340">The pixel control schematic of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 66</figref> can achieve diagonal readout through the timing sequence shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</figref>. Note that in the example shown the tx pulse train is implemented to achieve high RNC correlation between two different rows by envelope matching. That is, pulse envelope approximation may be an effective technique that minimizes phase error between FD and pixout that is slew-rate limited by column-driven Vin. In the embodiment shown, transfer envelopes can be approximated from one column to the next and one row to the next without destroying active pixels by shifting as shown at <b>1031</b>.
