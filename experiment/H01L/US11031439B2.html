<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, an electroluminescent (also referred to as EL) display device has attracted attention as a display device with reduced thickness and weight (i.e., so-called flat panel display).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Light-emitting elements using light-emitting materials emitting light of different colors are provided as light-emitting elements used in pixels in an EL display device, so that full-color display can be performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">For such an EL display device, a method is used in which selective deposition of light-emitting materials in a minute pattern is performed for each pixel by an evaporation method using a metal mask.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">However, a shape defect or emission defect might be caused to a light-emitting element due to contact of a metal mask, and ways to prevent the defects have been explored (e.g., Patent Document 1).

In a light-emitting element, a plurality of light-emitting layers which emit light of different colors are stacked, and the closer the light-emitting layer is to an electrode having a reflective property, the shorter the wavelength of light emitted from the light-emitting layer is. Specifically, structures described below are employed, for example.</div>

In the first pixel, the optical path length between the first electrode having a reflective property and the first light-emitting layer is one-quarter of the central wavelength of a wavelength range of light passing through the first color filter layer.

In the structures to be given below, the same portions or portions having similar functions are denoted by the same reference numerals in different drawings, and explanation thereof will not be repeated.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">The display device illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> includes a first pixel <b>130</b> <i>a </i>and a second pixel <b>130</b> <i>b</i>. The first pixel <b>130</b> <i>a </i>includes a first light-emitting element <b>132</b> <i>a </i>provided over a substrate <b>100</b> and a first color filter layer <b>134</b> <i>a </i>provided for a counter substrate <b>128</b> in a region overlapping with the first light-emitting element <b>132</b> <i>a</i>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">In the display device illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the first color filter layer <b>134</b> <i>a </i>and the second color filter layer <b>134</b> <i>b </i>transmit light with different wavelengths. The central wavelength of the wavelength range of light passing through the first color filter layer <b>134</b> <i>a </i>and the central wavelength of the wavelength range of light passing through the second color filter layer <b>134</b> <i>b </i>are made to be different from each other, whereby a display device capable of multicolor display can be obtained. In this embodiment, the case where the central wavelength of the wavelength range of light passing through the first color filter layer <b>134</b> <i>a </i>(hereinafter, also referred to as λ1) is shorter than the central wavelength of the wavelength range of light passing through the second color filter layer <b>134</b> <i>b </i>(hereinafter, also referred to as λ2) will be described as an example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">Note that in this specification, the term “central wavelength” refers to the central wavelength of a wavelength range of light passing through a color filter layer (preferably, a wavelength range of a transmittance of 50% or more) in the visible light range (380 nm to 680 nm). For example, in the case where a blue color filter layer transmits light in the wavelength range of 380 nm to 520 nm, the central wavelength is 450 nm. In the case where a green color filter layer transmits light in the wavelength range of 510 nm to 590 nm, the central wavelength is 550 nm. In the case where a red color filter layer transmits light in the wavelength range of 600 nm to 680 nm, the central wavelength is 640 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">Note that a blue color filter layer and a green color filter layer each have an absorption spectrum in the long wavelength region around 700 nm in some cases. However, the absorption spectrum in the above long wavelength region does not affect the luminosity; therefore, the absorption spectrum in the region is excluded. Thus, the visible light region in this specification and the like is a region with a wavelength of 680 nm or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">The first light-emitting element <b>132</b> <i>a </i>and the second light-emitting element <b>132</b> <i>b </i>respectively include a first electrode <b>102</b> <i>a </i>having a reflective property and a second electrode <b>102</b> <i>b </i>having a reflective property which are placed with a distance therebetween over the substrate <b>100</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">The first light-emitting element <b>132</b> <i>a </i>includes a first conductive layer <b>104</b> <i>a </i>having a light-transmitting property, a first EL layer <b>106</b>, a charge generation layer <b>108</b>, a second EL layer <b>110</b>, and an electrode <b>112</b> having a light-transmitting property which are stacked in this order over the first electrode <b>102</b> <i>a </i>having a reflective property.

In this embodiment, light emitted from the first light-emitting element <b>132</b> <i>a </i>and the second light-emitting element <b>132</b> <i>b </i>is extracted from the electrode <b>112</b> side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">Note that the first EL layer <b>106</b>, the charge generation layer <b>108</b>, the second EL layer <b>110</b>, and the electrode <b>112</b> having a light-transmitting property are used in both the first light-emitting element <b>132</b> <i>a </i>and the second light-emitting element <b>132</b> <i>b </i>and are each formed as a continuous film.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">In FIGS. <b>1</b>B<b>1</b> and <b>1</b>B<b>2</b>, the first light-emitting element <b>132</b> <i>a </i>and the second light-emitting element <b>132</b> <i>b </i>each include the first EL layer <b>106</b> including at least a first light-emitting layer <b>120</b> and the second EL layer <b>110</b> including at least a second light-emitting layer <b>122</b>. Note that each of the first EL layer <b>106</b> and the second EL layer <b>110</b> can have a stacked-layer structure including functional layers such as a hole-injection layer, a hole-transport layer, an electron-transport layer, and an electron-injection layer, in addition to the light-emitting layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">The first conductive layer <b>104</b> <i>a </i>having a light-transmitting property and the second conductive layer <b>104</b> <i>b </i>having a light-transmitting property having a different thickness from the first conductive layer <b>104</b> <i>a </i>having a light-transmitting property are included in the first light-emitting element <b>132</b> <i>a </i>and the second light-emitting element <b>132</b> <i>b</i>, respectively; therefore, the total thickness of the first light-emitting element <b>132</b> <i>a </i>and the total thickness of the second light-emitting element <b>132</b> <i>b </i>are different.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">The first conductive layer <b>104</b> <i>a </i>having a light-transmitting property has a function of adjusting the optical path length of light which is emitted from the first light-emitting layer <b>120</b> and reflected back by the first electrode <b>102</b> <i>a </i>having a reflective property (the light is also referred to as first reflected light) by adjusting the thickness of the first conductive layer <b>104</b> <i>a </i>having a light-transmitting property. The first reflected light interferes with light entering the first color filter layer <b>134</b> <i>a </i>directly from the first light-emitting layer <b>120</b> (the light is also referred to as first entering light). Thus, the phases of the first entering light and the first reflected light are aligned by adjusting the thickness of the first conductive layer <b>104</b> <i>a </i>having a light-transmitting property, whereby light emitted from the first light-emitting layer <b>120</b> can be amplified. Thus, the luminance of the light-emitting element according to this embodiment is higher than the luminance of a light-emitting element in which the optical path length is not adjusted, in the case where the same current is applied to these light-emitting elements. In addition, the phases of the first entering light and the first reflected light are aligned with the central wavelength of the wavelength range of light passing through the first color filter layer <b>134</b> <i>a</i>, whereby the color purity of light extracted from the first pixel <b>130</b> <i>a </i>can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">The second conductive layer <b>104</b> <i>b </i>having a light-transmitting property has a function of adjusting the optical path length of light which is emitted from the second light-emitting layer <b>122</b> and reflected back by the second electrode <b>102</b> <i>b </i>having a reflective property (the light is also referred to as second reflected light) by adjusting the thickness of the second conductive layer <b>104</b> <i>b </i>having a light-transmitting property. The second reflected light interferes with light entering the second color filter layer <b>134</b> <i>b </i>directly from the second light-emitting layer <b>122</b> (the light is also referred to as second entering light). Thus, the phases of the second entering light and the second reflected light are aligned by adjusting the thickness of the second conductive layer <b>104</b> <i>b </i>having a light-transmitting property, whereby light emitted from the second light-emitting layer <b>122</b> can be amplified. Thus, the luminance of the light-emitting element according to this embodiment is higher than the luminance of a light-emitting element in which the optical path length is not adjusted, in the case where the same current is applied to these light-emitting elements. In addition, the phases of the second entering light and the second reflected light are aligned with the central wavelength of the wavelength range of light passing through the second color filter layer <b>134</b> <i>b</i>, whereby the color purity of light extracted from the second pixel <b>130</b> <i>b </i>can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">Specifically, it is preferable that the optical path length between the first electrode <b>102</b> <i>a </i>having a reflective property and the first light-emitting layer <b>120</b> in the first light-emitting element <b>132</b> <i>a </i>included in the first pixel <b>130</b> <i>a </i>be one-quarter of the central wavelength of the wavelength range of light passing through the first color filter layer <b>134</b> <i>a </i>(λ1). Moreover, it is preferable that the optical path length between the second electrode <b>102</b> <i>b </i>having a reflective property and the second light-emitting layer <b>122</b> in the second light-emitting element <b>132</b> <i>b </i>included in the second pixel <b>130</b> <i>b </i>be three-quarters of the central wavelength of the wavelength range of light passing through the second color filter layer <b>134</b> <i>b </i>(λ2).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">More strictly, the optical path length between the first electrode <b>102</b> <i>a </i>having a reflective property and the first light-emitting layer <b>120</b> can also be referred to as the optical path length between the first electrode <b>102</b> <i>a </i>having a reflective property and a light-emitting region in the first light-emitting layer <b>120</b>. Note that it is difficult to strictly determine the position of the light-emitting region in a light-emitting layer and that the effects described above can be sufficiently obtained by assuming any position in the light-emitting layer as the position of the light-emitting region. In other words, the optical path length between the first electrode <b>102</b> <i>a </i>having a reflective property and the first light-emitting layer <b>120</b> can be referred to as the optical path length between a surface of the first electrode <b>102</b> <i>a </i>having a reflective property and a lower surface of the first light-emitting layer <b>120</b> or more and the optical path length between the surface of the first electrode <b>102</b> <i>a </i>having a reflective property and an upper surface of the first light-emitting layer <b>120</b> or less. The same can be applied to the optical path length between the second electrode having a reflective property <b>102</b> <i>b </i>and the second light-emitting layer <b>122</b>, and the optical path length between the third electrode <b>102</b> <i>c </i>having a reflective property and the third light-emitting layer <b>124</b>, which will be described later.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">Further, the spectrum of light emitted from the first light-emitting layer <b>120</b> preferably has a peak in the wavelength region exhibiting the same color as the central wavelength of the wavelength range of light passing through the first color filter layer <b>134</b> <i>a</i>. For example, in the case where the first color filter layer <b>134</b> <i>a </i>has a central wavelength in the blue region (e.g., the case where the central wavelength is 450 nm), the spectrum of light emitted from the first light-emitting layer <b>120</b> preferably has a peak in the range of 430 nm to 470 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">In a similar manner, the spectrum of light emitted from the second light-emitting layer <b>122</b> preferably has a peak in the wavelength region exhibiting the same color as the central wavelength of the wavelength range of light passing through the second color filter layer <b>134</b> <i>b</i>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">The thickness of the color filter layer may be controlled to be optimal as appropriate in consideration of the relationship between the concentration of a coloring material to be contained and the transmittance of light. In the display device described in this embodiment, the half width of a spectrum of light emitted from the first light-emitting layer <b>120</b> can be reduced by adjusting the optical path length between the first electrode <b>102</b> <i>a </i>having a reflective property and the first light-emitting layer <b>120</b> and by utilizing light interference. In a similar manner, the half width of a spectrum of light emitted from the second light-emitting layer <b>122</b> can be reduced by adjusting the optical path length between the second electrode <b>102</b> <i>b </i>having a reflective property and the second light-emitting layer <b>122</b> and by utilizing light interference. Thus, the concentration of a coloring material of the first color filter layer <b>134</b> <i>a </i>and the concentration of a coloring material of the second color filter layer <b>134</b> <i>b </i>can be low. In addition, the thicknesses of the first color filter layer <b>134</b> <i>a </i>and the second color filter layer <b>134</b> <i>b </i>can be small. As a result, light absorption by the first color filter layer <b>134</b> <i>a </i>or the second color filter layer <b>134</b> <i>b </i>can be reduced; thus, the use efficiency of light can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">The example in which the first color filter layer <b>134</b> <i>a </i>and the second color filter layer <b>134</b> <i>b </i>are provided on the inner side of the counter substrate <b>128</b> is described in this embodiment. However, one embodiment of the present invention is not limited thereto. The first color filter layer <b>134</b> <i>a </i>and the second color filter layer <b>134</b> <i>b </i>can be provided on the outer side of the counter substrate <b>128</b> (i.e., on the opposite side to the light-emitting elements).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">Alternatively, a light-transmitting resin layer with a chromatic color which functions as a color filter layer may be formed over the first light-emitting element <b>132</b> <i>a </i>and the second light-emitting element <b>132</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">A light-blocking layer may be provided in a region between the first color filter layer <b>134</b> <i>a </i>and the second color filter layer <b>134</b> <i>b </i>(i.e., a region overlapping with the insulating layer <b>126</b>). The light-blocking layer is formed using a light-blocking material which reflects or absorbs light. For example, a black organic resin can be used, which can be formed by mixing a black resin of a pigment material, carbon black, titanium black, or the like into a resin material such as photosensitive or non-photosensitive polyimide. Alternatively, a light-blocking metal film can be used, which is made of chromium, molybdenum, nickel, titanium, cobalt, copper, tungsten, aluminum, or the like, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">There is no particular limitation on the formation method of the light-blocking layer, and a dry method such as an evaporation method, a sputtering method, or a CVD method, or a wet method such as a spin coating method, a dip coating method, a spray coating method, a droplet discharge method (e.g., ink jetting), a screen printing method, or an offset printing method may be used depending on the material. If needed, an etching method (dry etching or wet etching) may be employed to form a desired pattern.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">The light-blocking layer can prevent light from leaking to an adjacent pixel. Therefore, by providing the light-blocking layer, an image can be displayed with high contrast and high definition.</div>
