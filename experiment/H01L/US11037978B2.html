No. 15/651,402, filed Jul. 17, 2017, which is a divisional application of U.S. patent application Ser.

<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">It is an ongoing trend that mobile electronic devices offer image capture capability. Some mobile electronic devices, such as a cellular phone, can capture images from both a front and a back side of the device. Many solutions exist for such dual facing camera capability. Solutions typically use two image sensors on opposing sides of the device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Image sensors are integrated circuits (ICs) used to detect and measure radiation, such as light, received by the sensor device. A front-side illuminated (FSI) image sensor typically has pixel circuitry and metal stacks disposed on a front side of a substrate where a photosensitive or photodiode (“PD”) region resides. To form an image in the PD region, the radiation passes the metal stacks. A backside-illuminated (BSI) image sensor, on the other hand, is typically formed on a thin substrate that allows the radiation to reach the PD region by passing through the substrate. A BSI image sensor offers many advantages over an FSI image sensor, such as shorter optical paths, higher quantum efficiency (QE), higher image resolution, smaller die sizes, etc.</div>

<heading id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">The following disclosure provides many different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of the disclosure. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. In addition, the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals and/or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and/or configurations discussed. Moreover, the performance of a first process before a second process in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the second process is performed immediately after the first process, and may also include embodiments in which additional processes may be performed between the first and second processes. Various features may be arbitrarily drawn in different scales for the sake of simplicity and clarity. Furthermore, the formation of a first feature over or on a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the first and second features are formed in direct contact, and may also include embodiments in which additional features may be formed between the first and second features, such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">Further, spatially relative terms, such as “beneath,” “below,” “lower,” “above,” “upper” and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. The spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as being “below” or “beneath” other elements or features would then be oriented “above” the other elements or features. Thus, the exemplary term “below” can encompass both an orientation of above and below. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein may likewise be interpreted accordingly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">Various embodiments of the present disclosure relate generally to integration of two BSI image sensor wafers with a processor wafer to form a dual facing camera module using wafer level stacking methods. However, specific embodiments are provided as examples to teach the broader inventive concept, and one of ordinary skill in the art can easily apply the teaching of the present disclosure to other methods or device.</div>

A hybrid bond process refers to bonding of two surfaces where each surface includes at least two substantially different materials (a hybrid surface). In the present embodiment, the conductive pads, <b>426</b>, <b>428</b>, <b>416</b> <i>a, </i>and <b>418</b> <i>a, </i>contain a metal, such as copper, while the surfaces <b>444</b> and <b>404</b> <i>a </i>contain a layer of dielectric material such as oxide, silicon oxide, silicon nitride, or silicon oxynitride.

In another embodiment, the surfaces <b>444</b> and <b>404</b> <i>a </i>contain a layer of silicon nitride having a thickness of at least 5 nm so as to effectively block migration of copper if the two surfaces are misaligned.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">In the present embodiment, the hybrid bond process includes an initial bonding process at a lower temperature followed by an annealing process at an elevated temperature. The initial bonding process may use a technique such as a direct bonding or other bonding techniques. Generally, it takes longer, e.g. a few hours, for the initial bonds to form. Therefore, a lower temperature is used during the initial bonding process to avoid undesirable changes or decomposition in the wafers <b>420</b> and <b>410</b> <i>a. </i>In an embodiment, the initial bonding process may take place at room temperature or another temperature that is below 200 degrees Celsius. In an embodiment, pressure is applied to the wafers <b>420</b> and <b>410</b> <i>a </i>for the initial bonds to form. The annealing process is applied after the initial bonding process to strengthen the bonds between the two hybrid surfaces <b>404</b> <i>a </i>and <b>444</b>. In the present embodiment, the annealing process undergoes at least two stages of bond formation at temperatures higher than the initial bonding temperature. During a first stage, covalent bonds are formed between the dielectric materials, e.g. between two oxides, of the surfaces <b>420</b> and <b>410</b> <i>a </i>at a first temperature, such as about 200 degrees Celsius. In an embodiment, the first stage takes about one and half hours. During a second stage, metal bonding are formed, e.g. by copper inter-diffusion, at a second temperature that is higher than the first temperature, such as about 350 degrees Celsius. In an embodiment, the second stage takes about half an hour. The temperatures of the annealing process are generally under about 450 degrees Celsius, as higher temperature may lead to damages in the wafers <b>420</b> and <b>410</b> <i>a. </i>However, the specific temperatures and durations disclosed above are mere examples and do not limit the inventive scope of the present disclosure.

A substantial amount of substrate material may be first removed from the substrate <b>411</b> <i>a </i>during the mechanical grinding process.
