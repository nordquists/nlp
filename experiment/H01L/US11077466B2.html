<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a divisional of and claims the benefit of and priority, under 35 U.S.C. § 120, to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/386,799, filed on Dec. 21, 2016 and titled “Wafer Tray Sorter With Door Coupled To Detector”, which is a divisional of and claims the benefit of and priority, under 35 U.S.C. § 120, to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/830,692, filed on Mar. 14, 2013 and titled “Tray Engine With Slide Attached to an End Effector Base”, now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 9,545,724, both of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Trays are used to transport a number of devices and materials in fabrication facilities. For example, trays are used to transport a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sample, a semiconductor wafer die, a pharmaceutical drug, etc. The trays may be transported within a building or across buildings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Sometimes the trays are placed in tray stack supports to protect the trays from falling during transportation. Multiple such tray stack supports are used to transport the trays. Also, the trays are transferred between tray stack supports. For example, a tray stack support may be designated to be sent to an entity A and another tray stack support may be designated to be sent to an entity B. A tray that includes wafer die having specifications provided by the entity A is to be transferred in the tray stack support from a tray stack support to the tray stack support designated to be sent to entity A. Similarly, a tray that includes wafer die for the entity B is to be transferred in the tray stack support designated for the entity B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">However, such transfer of trays between tray stacks to send the trays to tray stacks designated for particular entities may not be available.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">In some embodiments, a sorter is provided to transfer trays between a cassette and an indexer. The sorter includes a tray engine that further includes a vertical drive mechanism. The vertical drive mechanism is rotatable using a motor. Also, the vertical drive mechanism is connected to an end effector. The end effector includes a grip assembly to grip a tray and to transfer the tray between the cassette and the indexer. The vertical drive mechanism is rotated to rotate the end effector to face the cassette or the indexer. For example, when a tray is to be retrieved or delivered to the indexer, the end effector is rotated to face the indexer and when a tray is to be retrieved or delivered to the cassette, the end effector is rotated to face the cassette. The grip assembly is linearly moved in a horizontal direction to grip a tray from the cassette or the indexer or to deliver the tray to the cassette or to the indexer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">In various embodiments, information identifying a tray is read when a tray is transferred between the indexer and the sorter or between the cassette and the sorter. The identification of information and the sorter allows sequencing, characterization, and sorting of trays for transfer of the tray to a cassette designated to be sent to a desired entity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In various embodiments, a sorter for transferring trays is described. The sorter includes a load port side for loading or unloading a tray from a cassette, an indexer side for loading or unloading a tray from an indexer, and a tray engine for transferring a tray, when present, between the load port side and the indexer side. The indexer side and the load port side are located on opposite sides of the tray engine. The tray engine includes a rotation mechanism, a vertical drive column attached to the rotation mechanism, and an end effector attached to vertical drive column. The end effector includes an end effector base and a slide attached to the end effector base. The end effector further includes a linear drive mechanism coupled to the end effector base and a grip assembly attached to the linear drive mechanism. The linear drive mechanism is used for moving horizontally along the slide to move the grip assembly in a horizontal direction. The grip assembly moves in the horizontal direction to load or unload one or more trays, when present, at the load port side or at the indexer side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, a tray engine is described. The tray engine may be part of the sorter, a tool, or an equipment front end module (EFEM). The tray engine includes a vertical drive column, a rotation mechanism for rotating the vertical drive column, and an end effector attached to the vertical drive column. The end effector includes an end effector base attached to the vertical drive column. The end effector further includes a slide attached to the end effector base to support a tray, when present. The slide enables the tray to slide along a length of the end effector base. The tray engine includes a drive mechanism attached to the end effector base for moving along the length of the end effector base to enable the tray, when present, to slide linearly along the length and load or unload the tray to or from the slide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">An end effector for transferring trays is described. The end effector may be a part of the tray engine. The end effector includes an end effector base, a slide base located within the end effector base, a linear drive mechanism slidable with respect to the end effector base via the slide base, and a slide attached to the end effector base to support a tray, when present. The linear drive mechanism is configured to move the tray on the slide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Other aspects will become apparent from the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0345" num="0344"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14G</figref> is a bottom isometric view of an embodiment of the grip body <b>602</b> and the arms <b>616</b> and <b>618</b>. The arms <b>616</b> and <b>618</b> grip the tray Tr<b>1</b> when the right extension <b>626</b> extends through the through hole Th<b>2</b> and the left extension <b>624</b> extends through the through hole Th<b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0346" num="0345">Although some of the above-described embodiments describe trays covered with tray lids, in some embodiments, a tray is used without a tray lid. For example, a tray is not covered with a tray lid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0347" num="0346">It is noted that although some of the above-described embodiments include the tray engine <b>102</b> within the sorter <b>106</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) or the EFEM <b>156</b>, in some embodiments, the tray engine <b>102</b> is located within a tool that is described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0348" num="0347">Moreover, in various embodiments, instead of using information identifying a tray, information identifying a tray lid may be used. For example, a tray lid has a tag or imprints that identifies the tray and the tag is captured by a camera or read by an RFID reader. In various embodiments, both a tray and a tray lid have tags that identify the tray and the tray lid, and information on the tags is captured with a camera or with an RFID reader.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0349" num="0348">Also, in some embodiments, the sorter <b>106</b> has storage devices to buffer trays and/or tray lids as the trays and/or tray lids are transferred between the cassette <b>102</b> and the indexer <b>104</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0350" num="0349">While the present disclosure in terms of several embodiments, it will be appreciated that those skilled in the art upon reading the preceding specifications and studying the drawings will realize various alterations, additions, permutations and equivalents thereof. Therefore, it is intended that the present disclosure includes all such alterations, additions, permutations, and equivalents as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.</div>
