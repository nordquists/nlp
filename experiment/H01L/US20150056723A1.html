</li> <heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">The manufacture of a variety of products now requires the cost-effective production of very small structures and features, e.g., structures and features having a characteristic dimension at the micrometer or nanometer size scale. Electronic components (e.g., integrated circuits (IC), semiconductor devices, optoelectronics devices, data storage devices, magnetoelectronic devices, magnetooptic devices, packaged devices, microprocessors, memory chips, etc.) for computers and other devices are well-known examples of such products. The never-ending pursuit of electronic components including smaller structures and features is leading increasingly to a need for cost-effective processing of semiconductor substrates with which such components are made to produce structures and features at the nanometer size scale. Other products too, such as flat panel displays, can benefit from substrate processing capability that enables cost-effective production of such small structures and features.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">Molecular self-assembly is a technique that can be used to produce very small structures and features, e.g., structures and features having a characteristic dimension at the nanometer size scale. Molecular self-assembly can be used to produce a variety of material formations, such as molecular monolayers (often referred to as self-assembled monolayers, or SAMs), molecular multilayers and nanostructures (e.g., nanotubes, Buckey balls, nanowires). However, to date, molecular self-assembly has not been introduced into commercial production processes used to create products as described above which require production of very small structures and features. Consequently there is a need for the use of molecular self-assembly in substrate processing to form material on a substrate leading to commercial product creation.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">The manufacturing of the products described above also entails the integration and sequencing of many unit processing steps. As an example, IC manufacturing typically includes a series of processing steps such as cleaning, surface preparation, deposition, lithography, patterning, etching, planarization, implantation, thermal annealing, and other related unit processing steps. The precise sequencing and integration of the unit processing steps enables the formation of functional devices meeting desired performance metrics such as speed, power consumption, and reliability.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">The drive towards ever increasing performance of devices or systems of devices such as in systems on a chip (SOCs) has led to a dramatic increase in the complexity of process sequence integration and device integration, or the means by which the collection of unit processing steps are performed individually and collectively in a particular sequence to yield devices with desired properties and performance. This increase in complexity of device integration has driven the need for, and the subsequent utilization of increasingly complex processing equipment with precisely sequenced process modules to collectively perform an effective unit processing step. The precise sequencing of the unit processing tools, in addition to the unit process modules within each tool, must be properly sequenced and integrated.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition to the increasingly challenging process sequence integration requirements, the tools and equipment employed in device manufacturing have been developed to enable the processing of ever increasing substrate sizes in order to fit more ICs per substrate per unit processing step for productivity and cost benefits. Other methods of increasing productivity and decreasing manufacturing costs have been to use batch reactors which provide for parallel processing of multiple monolithic substrates. A common theme has been to process the entire monolithic substrate or batch substrates uniformly, in the same fashion with the same resulting physical, chemical, electrical, and the like properties across the monolithic substrate.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">The ability to process uniformly across an entire monolithic substrate and/or across a series of monolithic substrates is advantageous for manufacturing cost effectiveness, repeatability and control when a desired process sequence flow for IC manufacturing has been qualified to provide devices meeting desired yield and performance specifications. However, processing the entire substrate can be disadvantageous since the entire substrate is nominally made the same using the same material(s), process(es), and process sequence integration scheme. Conventional full wafer uniform processing results in fewer data per substrate, longer times to accumulate a wide variety of data and higher costs associated with obtaining such data. Consequently, in order to increase productivity and decrease manufacturing cost there is a need to run more than one processing condition, more than one sequence of processing conditions, more than one process sequence integration flow, and/or combinations of the same, collectively referred to as “combinatorial process sequence integration”, on a single monolithic substrate.</div>

The use of molecular self-assembly and site-isolated processing enables production of very small structures and features on substrates (e.g., at the nanometer size scale) at very low cost, which can be useful in the commercial manufacturing of a variety of products, such as electronic components and flat panel displays to name a few. The various systems and methods described below are presented as examples only and are not intended to limit the systems and methods described and claimed herein to systems that only include molecular self-assembly and/or combinatorial process sequence integration using site-isolated processing. Furthermore, the systems and methods described below are not limited to any particular processes (e.g., wet processes, dry processes, etc.).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0026]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0027" num="0026">A system for molecular self-assembly is referred to herein as a “molecular self-assembly system” or “MSAS” and includes at least one interface configured to receive at least one substrate. The MSAS also includes a number of modules coupled to the interface. The modules, also referred to herein as components, include a pre-processing module, a molecular self-assembly processing module, and a post-processing module, but may include any number and/or type of other modules where any of the modules may include functions of the pre-processing, molecular self-assembly, and/or post-processing modules. The MSAS is not required to include at least one of each of the preceding module types; for example, a particular process flow may include only the molecular self-assembly processing module and means for moving a substrate into and out of the MSAS. Also, functions of all of the pre-processing, molecular self-assembly, and post-processing modules may be embedded within a single module. Each module of the multiple modules can contain at least one of a number of different processes as appropriate to processes contained in at least one other of the modules.

The forming of material on a substrate as used herein encompasses both forming the material directly on the substrate material as well as forming the material on another material previously formed on the substrate, but may not be so limited. The molecular self-assembly enables production of very small structures and features on substrates (e.g., at the nanometer size scale) at very low cost, which can be useful in the manufacture of a variety of products. Molecular self-assembly is also particularly suitable for forming material with good selectivity, a very useful characteristic in substrate processing that has previously been difficult to achieve. Additionally, the molecular self-assembly can take advantage of one or more capabilities enabled by commercial substrate processing apparatus and methods (e.g., commercial semiconductor processing equipment and methods) to facilitate and/or enhance the performance of molecular self-assembly to form material on a substrate.</div>

For example, the applications and/or products include but are not limited to the processing of a semiconductor substrate, processing one or more semiconductor wafers for use in production of electronic components, processing of a substrate for use in production of a flat panel display, producing anti-stiction layers for micro-electromechanical machines (MEMs), producing active molecular electronic components (such as capacitors and transistors) for bottom-up manufacturing of logic and memory integrated circuits, producing release layers for micro-contact printing or step-and-flash lithographic applications. As can be appreciated, there are many other applications of the molecular self-assembly.</div>

In general, the molecularly self-assembled material can be organic or inorganic. The molecular self-assembly can be used to produce one or more of a molecular monolayer and a molecular multilayer. The molecular self-assembly also produces a nanostructure (e.g., nanotube, Buckey ball, nanowire). The molecular self-assembly can make use of chemical self-assembly or directed self-assembly.</div>

For example, the molecularly self-assembled material can be formed on material previously formed on a substrate and can be formed on material (substrate or other material) that has been functionalized to have desired properties, such as desired adhesion characteristics. In particular, the molecular self-assembly can be used in processing semiconductor substrates as in the manufacture of components for use in the electronics industry. The molecular self-assembly can also be used in processing substrates like glass, silicon, and/or plastic for use in the production of flat panel displays, for example. The molecular self-assembly can be used in the processing of any type of semiconductor substrate, including but not limited to silicon substrates, silicon-on-insulator substrates, silicon carbide substrates, strained silicon substrates, silicon germanium substrates, and gallium arsenide substrates.</div>

In general, there is no limit to the size of substrates that can be processed. For example, the molecular self-assembly can be used to process each succeeding larger generation of semiconductor substrates used to produce electronic components. The molecular self-assembly can also be used to process the relatively large substrates that are used in the production of flat panel displays. Such substrates include rectangular substrates on the order of approximately one square meter, but larger substrates can be used. The molecular self-assembly can also be scaled for use in roll-to-roll processing applications for flexible substrates having a fixed width, but (theoretically) unlimited length (a manner of substrate processing that can be particularly useful in the production of flat panel displays); for example, such substrate rolls can be hundreds of feet long.</div>

For example, the substrate can be cleaned to remove contaminants and/or the substrate can be functionalized in a manner that facilitates formation of the material in the molecular self-assembly processing <b>102</b>. As used herein, functionalization of a material refers to modifying the characteristics of an exposed part of the material to achieve a desired interaction with another material subsequently formed on the exposed part of the material. For instance, the pre-processing <b>101</b> of an embodiment establishes the adhesion properties of a surface on which material is to be formed in the molecular self-assembly processing <b>102</b> to improve adhesion of the formed material on that surface. If, for instance, a molecule to be formed on a surface adheres only to a hydroxyl (OH) group, then the surface can be functionalized to expose hydroxyl groups on that surface. There are many other ways contemplated under the molecular self-assembly described herein in which surface(s) on which material(s) are to be formed in subsequent processes can be functionalized; functionalizing surface(s) to facilitate adhesion of subsequently formed material(s) is only one example of functionalization.</div>

In particular, one or more parameters of wet pre-processing can be controlled to facilitate or enhance performance of that processing to effect desired processing of a substrate material (e.g., functionalization of a substrate material) on which material will subsequently be formed using molecular self-assembly. The molecular self-assembly can make use of capabilities that are provided by existing commercial substrate processing apparatus (e.g., conventional semiconductor processing apparatus), or that can be provided with some modification of such apparatus, to effect control of one or more parameters associated with wet pre-processing to enhance performance of that processing.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0042]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0043" num="0042">For example, vibration can be imparted to a substrate during wet pre-processing (e.g., being immersed in a fluid bath or sprayed with a fluid). More generally, vibration can be imparted to a substrate during any wet processing processes. For example, vibration can be imparted to a substrate to facilitate a cleaning process. The frequency and/or amplitude of vibration imparted to a substrate while undergoing wet processing is chosen so as to be appropriate for the process. For example, the molecular self-assembly can include application of high frequency vibration, such as ultrasonic or megasonic vibration, to a substrate during wet processing to facilitate a desired functionalization and/or cleaning of a substrate material on which material will subsequently be formed using molecular self-assembly. The use of vibration of a substrate during wet pre-processing can enhance reaction kinetics and/or reaction efficiency so as to reduce the time required for the processing. The substrate can also be rotated to improve kinetics, reaction efficiency and/or uniformity of processing across the substrate.</div>

The temperature control includes control of the temperature of the fluid used during wet pre-processing (e.g., by controlling the temperature of one or more chemicals used) and/or the temperature of the substrate. In either case, the temperature can be controlled using closed or open loop control. Appropriate control of the fluid or substrate temperature during wet pre-processing can enable control over the temperature at which the processing occurs. For instance, some wet pre-processing produces an exothermic reaction that may cause the temperature of the process to elevate out of control. The molecular self-assembly can be used to monitor the process temperature and compensate accordingly (e.g., adjust temperature(s) used in the delivery of chemical(s) for use in the wet processing).

The latter can be desirable because such processing may be less damaging to the substrate. The plasma pressure and bias power can be controlled to produce desired processing. Plasma pre-processing in an embodiment can be performed using one or more of a variety of chemical constituents, such as, for example, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and ammonia. For example, plasma pre-processing can be used to oxidize a substrate surface by exposing the surface to oxygen plasma. Alternatively, for example, plasma pre-processing can be used to reduce or eliminate oxidation of a substrate surface by exposing the surface to hydrogen plasma. The latter can be useful, for example, to reduce or eliminate surface oxidation that may occur as a substrate is moved around a production facility during processing (e.g., as a semiconductor wafer is moved around a semiconductor fabrication facility).

Moreover, this can be ensured by providing an appropriate barrier between the various regions on the substrate during processing. In one approach, a mechanical device or physical structure defines the various regions on the substrate. A wall or other physical barrier, for example, can be used to prevent the materials in the individual regions from moving to adjacent regions.

In yet another embodiment, a physical barrier can be used to essentially screen and/or limit the processing to a desired region(s) and/or portion(s) of a region(s) wherein the physical barrier does not physically touch the substrate. For example, a physical barrier can be used to essentially block and/or restrict processing to certain region(s) and/or portion(s) or region(s). A screen, such as a mask or shutter, can be used to block vapor fluxes such as from PVD (i.e. sputtering) or evaporation sources for example. An opaque vs. transparent mask can be used to let certain radiation through the transparent regions to effect processing in specified regions on the substrate. In yet another embodiment, gas flows, of preferably an inert gas such as argon (Ar), can be used to screen out gaseous reagents and or limit the concentrations of such reagents so as to effectively screen out the effects of such reagents from certain regions. In this fashion, specific regions on a substrate can be processed differently without the need for a physical barrier in communication with the substrate.
