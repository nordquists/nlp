<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">This disclosure relates in general to the field of photovoltaics and solar cells, and more particularly to methods for manufacturing thin-film solar cells (TFSCs). More particularly, the present disclosure provides ion implantation applications for manufacturing Thin-Film Crystalline Silicon Solar Cells (TFSC).</div>
</li> <heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">Ion implantation involves implantation of ions of certain elements into a solid and is a standard technique used in the fabrication of semiconductor devices. The implantation of dopant atoms such as phosphorous (P), arsenic (As), and boron (B) may be used to form semiconductor junctions, while the implantation of oxygen may be used in silicon-on-oxide (SOI) devices. Additionally, it has been reported that crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells have been manufactured using ion implantation methods to form the p-n junctions. However, these efforts are directed towards planar crystalline silicon wafers. In current manufacturing methods for thin-film crystalline silicon solar cell (TFSC), either planar or three dimensional cells, the p-n junctions are often formed by either POCl3-based doping, or a phosphorous compound deposition or spray-on followed by annealing.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">Ion implantation of P and B for forming emitters in a p-type or n-type silicon substrate followed by a suitable annealing treatment have been shown to yield solar cells with high efficiency. However, current ion implantation efforts are limited to planar, thick c-Si wafers (typically ≧200 um).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">High efficiency c-Si solar cells have been made on very thin wafers, down to 45 um, by thinning down the conventional c-Si wafers from bulk silicon ingots or bricks, using integrated circuits (IC) packaging techniques. However, this approach is often not practical because of the high cost. C—Si Thin-Film Solar Cells (TFSC) may be advantageously made by depositing a thin layer of c-Si on a suitable substrate or by slicing a c-Si ingot into thin wafers using advanced wire sawing or other known techniques such as hydrogen implantation followed by annealing to cause thin wafer separation.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">Often, high performance thin-film silicon substrates (TFSS) are made by depositing an epitaxial crystalline silicon layer according to chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process. Solar cells created in this epitaxial silicon deposition method may be planar or have a well defined structure. Although, in principle, any three-dimensional surface structure is possible for 3-D cells, various performance limitations make certain 3-D structures more advantageous—such as pyramidal or prism based three-dimensional surface features.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">The current standard technique for the formation of selective emitters involves several steps. Usually, the full front surface of a p-type wafer is lightly doped using the POCl3 based process or a process involving spraying a phosphorous-compound followed by anneal. Then a passivating dielectric is deposited on the front surface of the silicon substrate. The regions that are desired to be metallization contacts are then selectively opened in this dielectric, usually by a laser ablation or an etch gel process. A second doping process is then carried out to selectively dope these localized regions with a high concentration of phosphorous. However, this process is often lengthy, costly, and inefficient.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0009">When forming homogeneous emitter layers on a TFSS, controlling the dopant profile may provide higher efficiency. To maximize current collection from the solar cell, a good ‘blue response’ is required. This requires the maximum phosphorous content near the surface to be less than 1E21 cm-3 from the surface and the depth of the emitter to be preferably in the range of 0.3 to 0.5 um thick. Because of this, there is a growing need in the solar industry for shallow emitters. However, the current industrial emitter formation processes, such as POCl3-based doping, phosphosilicate (PSG) deposition, or phosphoric acid spray-on followed by in-line anneal, do not provide control of the phosphorous concentration and depth independently. Thus, the emitter characteristics are solely determined by the temperature and time used for the doping anneal.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0010">Further, the lifetime of minority charge carriers is greatly reduced at concentrations above 1E18 cm-3. For maximum blue response this would appear to be the upper limit of the dopant concentration in the emitter. However, this would lead to very high emitter sheet resistance and high series resistance and low fill factor (FF) and low current density (Jsc). Therefore, a thin higher doped region near the surface is desired. However, current dopant profile controlling methodology is limited.</div>

To maximize current collection from the solar cell, a good ‘blue response’ is required. This requires the maximum phosphorous content near the surface to be less than 1E21 cm-3 and the depth of the emitter to be preferably in the range of 0.3 to 0.5 um. Hence, the solar industry is moving to shallow emitters. However, the current industrial emitter formation processes, such as POCl3-based doping or PSG deposition or phosphoric acid spray-on followed by in-line anneal, do not provide the control of the phosphorous concentration and depth independently. The emitter characteristics are solely determined by the temperature and time used for the doping anneal. On the other hand, ion implantation provides the ability to make shallow junctions of desired dopant concentrations by the control of ion dose and energy. The use of the disclosed ion implantation process thus makes it possible to obtain emitters with the desired surface dopant concentration, profile, and depth. Implanted emitters also eliminate the phosphorus dead layer and other complications commonly associated with POCl<sub>3</sub>-doped emitters.</div>

The current standard technique for the formation of selective emitters involves several steps. First, the full front surface of a p-type wafer is lightly doped using the POCl<sub>3 </sub>based process or a process involving spraying a phosphorous-compound followed by anneal. Then a passivating dielectric is deposited on the front surface. The regions that are desired to be contacted by metal are then selectively opened in this dielectric, either using laser ablation or etch gel. A second doping process is then carried out to selectively dope these localized regions with a high concentration of phosphorous. However, this process is often lengthy and costly.</div>

Shown, pyramidal three-dimensional TFSS <b>62</b> has inverted pyramidal cavity walls aligned along the (111) crystallographic plane—thus θ is about 54.7°. The relative angular orientation of the implanted surface with respect to the incoming ion beam makes it possible to obtain a desired, variable doping by using an ion implantation process for doping the pyramidal three-dimensional TFSS <b>62</b>. The regions on the 3-D TFSS which have surfaces perpendicular to the incident ion beam are heavily doped, such as Region A, thus, creating a lower sheet resistance junction. However, regions on the 3-D TFSS which receive ions at an angle, such as the (111) inverted pyramidal cavity wall surfaces, shown as Region B, are doped effectively at a lighter dose, thus, creating a higher sheet resistance junction. Since the (111) surface (or any oblique orientation surface) is inclined at angle θ (which is the angle with respect to the flat horizontal surfaces—shown these flat surfaces are aligned along the (100) crystallographic plane making θ about 54.7°), the dopant concentration is reduced to cos θ of the horizontal surface. After the deposition of a passivating dielectric such as SiN:H, only the selectively highly doped ledges of Region A on top of the 3D TFSS (or a fraction of them) are then contacted by metal for emitter contact metallization. This may be carried out by using one the several techniques such: as an Ag paste that etches through the passivating dielectric; by making openings using laser ablation of the passivating dielectric: by removal using etch paste, followed by plating-based and/or PVD metal deposition. Thus, the ion implantation process for variable doping to form selective emitters on the 3-D structure shown facilitates one step selective doping and the formation of dual-doped emitter junctions without a need for a more complex process flow using lithography or screen printing patterning.</div>

The starting wafer may be in circular or square shapes. Step <b>160</b> involves forming a thin hard masking layer (<b>144</b>) on the exposed wafer surfaces. The hard masking layer is used to mask the silicon surface areas that do not need to be etched in the later steps—the surface areas that will become the top surface of the template. The proper hard masking layer includes, but is not limited to, thermally grown silicon oxide and low-pressure vapor phase deposited (LPCVD) silicon nitride. Steps <b>162</b> and <b>164</b> involve a photolithography step, which consists of photoresist coating, baking, UV light exposure over a photomask, post baking, photoresist developing, wafer cleaning and drying. After this step, the pattern on the photomask (<b>146</b>) depicting an array or a staggered pattern of inverted pyramidal base openings, will be transferred to the photoresist layer. The patterned photoresist layer is used as a soft masking layer for the hard masking layer etching of step <b>166</b>. Step <b>166</b> involves further transferring the photoresist pattern to the hard masking layer layered underneath by chemical etching, such as etching a thin silicon oxide layer with buffered HF solution. Other wet etching methods and dry etching methods as known in semiconductor and MEMS wafer processing may also be used. In step <b>168</b> the remaining soft masking layer, i.e. the photoresist layer (<b>150</b>), is removed and the wafer (<b>148</b>) is cleaned. Examples of photoresist removal process include wet methods, such as using acetone or piranha solution (a mixture of sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide), or dry methods such as oxygen plasma ashing. Also in step <b>168</b> the wafers are batch loaded in an anisotropic silicon wet etchant such as KOH solution. The typical etch temperature is in the range of 50° C. to 80° C. and etch rate is about 0.2 um/min to 1 um/min. TMAH (tetramethylammonium hydroxide) is an alternative anisotropic silicon etching chemical. The KOH or TMAH silicon etch rate depends upon the orientations to crystalline silicon planes. The (111) family of crystallographic planes are etched at a very slow rate and are normally “stop” planes for the anisotropic etching of a (100) silicon wafer with patterned hard mask. As a result, the intersection of two (111) planes or a (111) plane with a bottom (100) plane produce anisotropic etching structures for (100) silicon wafers after a time-controlled etch. Examples of these structures include V-grooves and pyramidal cavities with sharp tip cavity bottom (where (111) planes meet) or a small flat cavity bottom (a remaining (100) plane).

Importantly, the ranges disclosed are for exemplary purposes only. Together, the use of laser and ion implantation technologies provides for a simpler cell fabrication process flow that enables low-temperature passivation layer formation, minimizes electrical shading, and results in a high open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current (Jsc), thus leading to a higher solar cell efficiency. Herein, the formation of localized, isolated base regions for p/n junction and front surface field (FSF) to improve minority carrier lifetime, using ion implantation followed by laser annealing, is disclosed. These techniques are highly suited to forming high-efficiency back-contact back-junction solar cells using thin crystalline silicon films obtained using epitaxial silicon deposition, or other techniques known in the industry, that may have any thickness in the silicon thickness range of from a few microns up to 100 microns (and more preferably in the range of about 5 microns to 50 microns). Furthermore, these techniques are particularly suited to solar cells that for various reasons, including but not limited to the thin cell lamination with a reinforcement plate, cannot be heated to high temperatures during part of their fabrication process, particularly during the formation of a surface passivation and anti-reflection coating layer.</div>

As can be seen, the all back-contact back-junction solar cells have isolated emitter and base regions on the same side (non-sunnyside or backside) in the silicon substrate that are contacted separately to interdigitated metal lines using contact openings in the dielectric overlying the silicon substrate and underneath the metal. The efficiency of these cells is critically dependent on the dimensions of these features with smaller dimensions leading to higher efficiency. In traditional all back-contact/back-junction solar cells, the n and p regions form alternate stripes. The minority charge carriers, holes in case of n-type base, have to traverse across the base region where there can be heavy recombination, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, where h. denotes holes, the minority charge carriers. This phenomenon is termed electrical shading. Hence, reducing the width of the base region reduces the electrical shading, which reduces the recombination of these minority charge carriers and increases the solar cell efficiency. If areas of the base regions could be reduced to the bare minimum needed, the electrical shading will be reduced to the bare minimum and efficiency of the solar cell will be maximized. The use of pulsed laser processing enables formation of small features, in particular, isolated base regions. The application of laser processing in solar cell manufacturing has been disclosed, in U.S. Patent Pub. No. 2012/0028399 by Virendra V.

Ions of phosphorous (P), arsenic (As), and antimony (Sb), are implanted to form n-type silicon regions, while boron (B), aluminum (Al), Gallium (Ga), and Indium (In), are used to form p-type silicon regions. The most commonly used ions are P and As for n-type, and B for p-type doping of silicon. Advantages of using ion implantation are the ability to control the concentration and the depth of implanted ions by controlling the ion implantation dose and energy. Also, the implanted ions may be placed in silicon in any desired concentration profile (for instance, by a combination of multiple implants at different dose and energy levels). This technique is a non-contact, dry technique. Since the ion implantation is performed essentially at room temperature, this technique is suitable for solar cells that, for various reasons, cannot be heated to high temperatures after the ion implantation process step.</div>

Although, the typical technique used in the industry is furnace heating or rapid thermal heating, these techniques are not suitable for cases where the solar cell or the assembly cannot be heated to a high temperature (for instance to a temperature much above 200□C) after the ion implantation process. On the other hand, pulsed laser annealing may be highly localized (spatially selective on the laser-irradiated surface) and the irradiated surface may be heated to a relatively high temperature (sufficiently high to electrically activate the implanted dopant atoms, for instance, the irradiated surface temperature selectively raised to a temperature in the range of 750° C. to up to near silicon melt temperature) while keeping the cell back surface relatively cooler (for instance, limiting the back-surface temperature to no more than 200° C.). In addition, pulsed laser annealing using fast pulses, because of its extremely rapid heating and cooling rates and negligible heat diffusion into the substrate away from the irradiated surface, is ideally suited to producing the sharp dopant gradients where the dopant atoms are not moved (and the bulk substrate below the irradiated surface is not significantly heated) while being electrically activated.

Since most of the photo-generated charge carriers (electron-hole pairs) are closer to the front surface there is a greater chance for them to recombine at this surface. Hence, the passivation of the front surface (or the cell sunny side) has to be excellent to obtain high cell efficiency. The passivation of the front surface is characterized by the front surface recombination velocity (FSRV), with lower FSRV values (typically stated in units of cm/sec) representing better surface passivation. The FSRV is typically reduced to a very low value using PECVD SiN deposition followed by annealing to a relatively high temperature (e.g., up to 300° C. to 850° C.), or PECVD amorphous silicon deposition (typically deposited at a temperature of less than 200° C.). However, both these processes have limitations. Good surface passivation requires annealing to temperatures as high as 8500° C., while passivation with amorphous silicon requires good quality surface cleaning and optimized PECVD amorphous-silicon deposition at temperatures of around 180° C. or above, as well as possibly post-deposition annealing at temperatures in the range of 180° C. to as high as 450° C. Both of these processes may not be suitable for solar cell assemblies that cannot be heated to 200° C. or above, during or after their front surface passivation process (for instance, for thin-film monocrystalline solar cells with reinforcement plates or layers which cannot stand thermal treatments much above approximately 200° C.).</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0113]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0114" num="0113">An alternate scheme to lower the minority charge carrier recombination is to form a ‘high-low’ electrical field at the front surface. This field electrically repels the oppositely charged carriers so that they are not able to reach the front surface and recombine there. To repel holes, for n-type substrate or n-type base (such as in an n-type base back-contact/back-junction solar cell), this field is created by a zone of heavier doping of phosphorous (or another n-type dopant such as arsenic or antimony) to create an n+ doped surface. This high-low field at the front surface is called the front surface field (FSF). The results of a simulation based on PC1D are shown in the graphs in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, where increasing the concentration of front surface doping by P increases both the Voc and Jsc, and thereby increases the solar cell efficiency. It may be seen that an FSF as thin as 100 A (or 10 nm) or even a thinner FSF layer in the top surface of the semiconductor layer can lead to increases in both open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short circuit current density (Jsc), almost as much as a much thicker FSF layer. The thickness of FSF needs to be low, because as seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, for FSF thickness of 0.5 μm, both Voc and Jsc are observed to decrease at high doping concentration related to the blue response degradation by the thicker and more heavily doped FSF layer. For a back-junction/back-contact thin-film monocrystalline silicon solar cell with n-type base, using ion implantation of phosphorus (or arsenic or antimony or indium) followed by pulsed (pulse width preferably in the range of about 100 nanoseconds to a few microseconds) laser annealing (with the laser wavelength preferably in the blue, green, red, or near infrared region of the spectrum), the formation of FSF can be carried out by raising the effective surface temperature to a sufficiently high temperature (e.g., in the range of about 750□C up to below the silicon melting point) where the temperature rise of the bulk and the backside of the semiconductor layer is substantially suppressed and the assembly components on the backside (such as the reinforcement or backplane layer on the cell backside), in-particular, are not exposed to temperatures close to approximately the temperature limit of the backside reinforcement plate (for instance, 200° C. or higher).</div>

At this stage, the thin-film monocrystalline silicon substrate is supported by a backplane (either a permanently attached/laminated backplane or a temporary support carrier) that may not be heated to high temperatures due to backplane material temperature limits and/or coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch with silicon (typically, these constraints may place an upper temperature limit in the range of approximately 150° C. to 300° C., and more likely below 250° C.).</div>

Besides keeping the back surface of the solar cell assembly below the temperature limit of the solar cell backplane laminate (for instance below approximately 200° C.), an ion implantation process is a conformal process placing the implanted dopant species (e.g., phosphorus) at a uniformly constant depth conformal to the surface texture random pyramids, resulting in formation of dopant profile in silicon that is conformal to the textured solar cell surface. The ion implantation process can be performed either before or preferably after the formation of the front surface passivation/ARC coating using a relatively low-energy ion implantation process. If the ion implantation process is performed after the formation of the front surface passivation/ARC coating, the ion implantation energy is selected to place the peak concentration of the implanted profile approximately either at the interface between the silicon substrate and the passivation/ARC coating or within the passivation/ARC coating layer. The dose of the ion implantation process may be adjusted such that the resulting peak implanted dopant concentration is preferably in the range of about 5×1016 to 1×1019 cm-3. The front surface passivation may be SiN (composed of a single or at least two different refractive indices) or amorphous silicon/SiN stack, or oxide/SIN stack, or other layers and stacks such as silicon oxynitride, with or without an oxide underlayer, and silicon carbide, etc. The ion implantation process is tuned to provide dopant implantation, such as phosphorus (P) implantation for n-type base, such that the concentration peak is preferably at or near the silicon substrate/passivation layer interface. The surface concentration of dopant, P for n-type base, may be from 1E16 to 1E20 cm-3, while the preferred range is 5E16 to 1E19 cm-3. The dopant atoms may be implanted and laser annealed to form an FSF layer to a depth below silicon surface that may range from about 10 A to about 1 micron, while FSF layers in the thickness range of about 50 A to about 0.1 μm are preferred to prevent blue response degradation.</div>

This makes possible the formation of relatively sharp step function profiles of dopant atoms that help to amplify the repulsion field, and FSF field-assisted improvement of the front surface passivation properties.

This passivation also serves as an anti reflection coating and has a positive fixed charge which helps create a field effect by reflecting the minority carriers (holes in this case) away from the surface. The typical good quality passivation deposition temperature for the PECVD SIN is about 400° C. In certain cases, the maximum tolerable temperature can be much less than 400° C., as dictated by the integration scheme. For example, in the case of very thin film crystalline silicon solar cells, which are supported by carriers which are not capable of going higher than a maximum temperature less than 400° C.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0124]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0125" num="0124">In a particular instance, this temperature can be as low as 200° C. With the constraint of 200° C. maximum temperature, the issue is to get a passivation quality as good as a 400° C. typical passivation. A possible solution is to deposit very thin amorphous silicon (can be between 30 A to 100 A) range such that it is non-absorptive. The idea is that amorphous silicon contains significant hydrogen, which can passivate the dangling bonds, thereby improving the passivation quality. However, the problem is that at 200° C. temperature, the Hydrogen atoms may not have enough mobility to migrate from amorphous silicon to the silicon interface.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0125]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0126" num="0125">To aid the mobility of the Hydrogen atoms, laser anneal is deployed, which in its pulsed form lasts for a very short duration. This should be enough to cause the migration of H2 atoms for short distance, without disturbing the integrity of the other parts of the structure. The laser process must be such that the front surface is selectively heated, while ensuring that back surface, which may consist of temperature sensitive metal structures, is not affected.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0126]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0127" num="0126">In one embodiment this can be achieved using short wavelength laser, which is absorbed near the sunny side surface of the solar cell. Short wavelength laser (such as green) will be absorbed readily within a distance of 1 um or less, thus minimizing the chance of hitting the temperature sensitive back structure of a back contacted cell.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0127]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0128" num="0127">In another embodiment, longer wavelengths such as 1 μm range may be used. A longer wavelength will travel longer distance into silicon and may reach the backside without getting absorbed in the bulk. Thus, a process must be designed such that front, sunny side, is heated, while the laser is stopped from hitting the backside. This can be achieved, either by absorbing the laser power in the silicon or by reflecting is before it reaches the backside. The absorption can be done in the bulk after the laser has already passed through the critical front side. This can be achieved using the aforementioned technique of flooding the bulk with carrier excited by potentially a different wavelength laser in a CW mode and relying on plasma dispersion effect to get it absorbed. Amongst several ways of reflecting the annealing laser, two specific embodiments are described below.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0128]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0129" num="0128">In one instance, the fact that annealing laser is monochromatic is exploited. A mirror is created on the backside using different refractive index. The thicknesses are tuned in accordance with the refractive index such that laser at 1 um (or the relevant wavelength in use) is selectively reflective by the dielectric mirror stack. In one example, the dielectric mirror stack can be made using SiO2 and SIN. The SiO2 can either by deposited using myriad techniques such as thermal oxidation or APCVD. While, SiN can be deposited using PECVD. In many instances, at least a part of the dielectric stack might already be part of the back surface passivation. Since the metal is behind the dielectric mirror, thus formed, the laser is reflected back toward the front surface before it touches the back metal.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0129]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0130" num="0129">In another instance of reflecting the annealing long wavelength laser, the angle of incidence of the laser may be varied in conjunction with the topography of the front typically textured surface. In most back contacted solar cells, the frontside consists of a passivation on top of silicon. Thus, the light enters typically from a high refractive index to a lower refractive index. Thus, the angle of incidence of the annealing laser can be varied in a manner such that when light falls on the back Silicon/dielectric (typically SiO2) interface, its angle of incidence at this surface is greater than the critical angle for total internal reflection (henceforth, TIR). Thus, TIR causes the laser beam to be reflected back toward the front side well before it has a chance to touch the backside metal stack.</div>
