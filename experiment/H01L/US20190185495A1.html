<li> <para-num num="[0001]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention is related to a method for the preparation of halide perovskite or perovskite-related materials on a substrate and to optoelectronic devices and photovoltaic cells comprising the perovskites prepared by the methods of this invention. The method for the preparation of the perovskite includes a direct conversion of elemental metal or metal alloy to halide perovskite or perovskite-related materials.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0002]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0003" num="0002">Halide perovskite semiconductors have demonstrated unusual rapid progress in photovoltaic performance, now surpassing 20% conversion efficiency. While these materials have been known for a long time, it is only in the past ˜25 years that they have been seriously considered as electronic materials, in particular as light-emitting devices and transistors [1] while their entry into photovoltaic research occurred only a few years ago (2012) [2-5].</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">The most studied material is MAPbI<sub>3 </sub>since this material has a bandgap (˜1.6 eV) close to that needed for an optimal single junction solar (photovoltaic) cell. (MA refers to methylammonium, CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub> <sup>+</sup> abbreviated to MA). The higher bandgap MAPbBr<sub>3 </sub>(˜2.3 eV) has also attracted much attention as a high bandgap semiconductor for use in spectrally-split photovoltaic cells (e.g. tandem cells) or for production of chemicals by photoelectrochemical processes.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">The high photovoltaic and optoelectronic performance of these materials arises from a combination of properties such as large diffusion lengths of photogenerated electrons and holes (due to a combination of long charge lifetimes and good charge mobilities); high optical absorption coefficients and low trap densities.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">There are several general methods used to make layers of these semiconductors:</div>
</li> <li> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0000">1. spin-coating from organic solutions of the semiconductors or precursors;
<br/>
2. vacuum evaporation; or
<br/>
3. spray-coating.
</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0006">The spin-coating from organic solutions is particularly popular since it requires relatively simple equipment and low temperature (energy) input (important for future manufacturing processes). The solution method is a one-step method or a two-step method.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0007">The one-step method for the preparation MAPbI<sub>3 </sub>includes for example: a solution containing MAI and PbI<sub>2 </sub>in polar solvents spin-coated onto the desired substrate. [6]</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0010" num="0008">The two-step method for the preparation of MAPbI<sub>3 </sub>includes for example: a solution of PbI<sub>2 </sub>is first spin-coated onto the substrate. This PbI<sub>2 </sub>layer is then converted to MAPbI<sub>3 </sub>by treatment with MAI, either in solution or by MAI vapor. [4,7]</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0009]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0011" num="0009">In both spin-coating methods, the final layer is most often given a heat treatment at typically 100-130° C. The spin-coating method further may include different treatments, for example, adding a non-solvent during the spin-coating [8] and annealing in the presence of solvent vapor [9].</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0010]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0012" num="0010">The organic solvents used in these depositions are mostly toxic: dimethyl formamide (DMF) is the most commonly used one; dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which, while not toxic by itself, becomes very much so when it contains dissolved Pb salts; gamma butyrolactone (GBL)). Therefore toxicity would be an important consideration at the manufacturing stage, which could increase considerably the manufacturing costs.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0011]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0013" num="0011">The vacuum evaporation may include multiple sources with a high level of control over the evaporation rate of each precursor. This method is, though, less popular mainly due to its higher level of complexity and high-energy input.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0012]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0014" num="0012">The spray coating usually includes a single source with high level of control over the spraying rate and substrate temperature. Very often the sprayed liquid is very toxic, which is the case with spray coating of perovskites. Usually such systems require high level of isolation from the environment.</div>
