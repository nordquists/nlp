<div class="abstract" id="p-0001" num="0000">A factory interface for an electronic device processing system includes a factory interface chamber, an inert gas supply conduit, an exhaust conduit and an inert gas recirculation system. The inert gas supply conduit supplies an inert gas into the factory interface chamber. The exhaust conduit exhausts the inert gas from the factory interface chamber. The inert gas recirculation system recirculates the inert gas exhausted from the factory interface chamber back into the factory interface chamber.</div>
