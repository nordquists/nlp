<li> <para-num num="[0003]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0004" num="0003">With development of fingerprint identification technology, the fingerprint identification technology is widely applied in various fields, for example, electronic terminals such as a mobile phone, a tablet personal computer, a television and the like, and safety protection system such as an entrance guard, a safety box and the like. Fingerprint identification modes of the fingerprint identification technology mainly include an optical fingerprint identification mode, a capacitive fingerprint identification mode, an ultrasonic imaging fingerprint identification mode and the like. The optical fingerprint identification technology has a relatively large identification range and relatively low cost, and thus, the optical fingerprint identification technology has a relatively wide application range.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0004]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, as for a liquid crystal display of a mobile terminal such as a mobile phone, a working principle of the optical fingerprint identification technology being adopted is that: after a light from a backlight of the liquid crystal display reaches a finger, the light is diffused at the finger, and a portion of diffused light is received by a photosensor. In the diffused light that is received by the photosensor, there is a difference between light energy of light diffused by a wave trough (referred to as a valley hereinafter) of fingerprint and light energy of light diffused by a wave peak (referred to as a ridge hereinafter) of the fingerprint, the light energy of the light diffused by the valley is lower than the light energy of the light diffused by the ridge, and the fingerprint identification is carried out based on such difference.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0005]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0006" num="0005">However, in the above-mentioned fingerprint identification process, on one hand, due to relatively low transmittance of a liquid crystal layer of the liquid crystal display, the light energy reaching the photosensor is very low after the light from the backlight of the liquid crystal display passes through the liquid crystal layer twice; on the other hand, the photosensor only receives a very small part of beam diffused by the finger; and thus, the difference between the light energy of the light diffused by the valley of the fingerprint and the light energy of the light diffused by the ridge of the fingerprint is very small. Furhtermore, there is also interference from ambient light between the valley and the ridge of the fingerprint. Thus, the above-mentioned liquid crystal display is very difficult to carry out accurate identification on the fingerprint.</div>
