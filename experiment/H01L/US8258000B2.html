<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The present invention relates generally to photovoltaic materials and manufacturing method. More particularly, the present invention provides a method and structure for manufacture of high efficiency thin film photovoltaic cells. Merely by way of example, the present method and materials include absorber materials made of copper indium disulfide species, copper tin sulfide, iron disulfide, or others for single junction cells or multi junction cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">From the beginning of time, mankind has been challenged to find way of harnessing energy. Energy comes in the forms such as petrochemical, hydroelectric, nuclear, wind, biomass, solar, and more primitive forms such as wood and coal. Over the past century, modern civilization has relied upon petrochemical energy as an important energy source. Petrochemical energy includes gas and oil. Gas includes lighter forms such as butane and propane, commonly used to heat homes and serve as fuel for cooking Gas also includes gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel, commonly used for transportation purposes. Heavier forms of petrochemicals can also be used to heat homes in some places. Unfortunately, the supply of petrochemical fuel is limited and essentially fixed based upon the amount available on the planet Earth. Additionally, as more people use petroleum products in growing amounts, it is rapidly becoming a scarce resource, which will eventually become depleted over time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">More recently, environmentally clean and renewable sources of energy have been desired. An example of a clean source of energy is hydroelectric power. Hydroelectric power is derived from electric generators driven by the flow of water produced by dams such as the Hoover Dam in Nevada. The electric power generated is used to power a large portion of the city of Los Angeles in California. Clean and renewable sources of energy also include wind, waves, biomass, and the like. That is, windmills convert wind energy into more useful forms of energy such as electricity. Still other types of clean energy include solar energy. Specific details of solar energy can be found throughout the present background and more particularly below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Solar energy technology generally converts electromagnetic radiation from the sun to other useful forms of energy. These other forms of energy include thermal energy and electrical power. For electrical power applications, solar cells are often used. Although solar energy is environmentally clean and has been successful to a point, many limitations remain to be resolved before it becomes widely used throughout the world. As an example, one type of solar cell uses crystalline materials, which are derived from semiconductor material ingots. These crystalline materials can be used to fabricate optoelectronic devices that include photovoltaic and photodiode devices that convert electromagnetic radiation into electrical power. However, crystalline materials are often costly and difficult to make on a large scale. Additionally, devices made from such crystalline materials often have low energy conversion efficiencies. Other types of solar cells use “thin film” technology to form a thin film of photosensitive material to be used to convert electromagnetic radiation into electrical power. Similar limitations exist with the use of thin film technology in making solar cells. That is, efficiencies are often poor. Additionally, film reliability is often poor and cannot be used for extensive periods of time in conventional environmental applications. Often, thin films are difficult to mechanically integrate with each other. These and other limitations of these conventional technologies can be found throughout the present specification and more particularly below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">From the above, it is seen that improved techniques for manufacturing photovoltaic materials and resulting devices are desired.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">According to embodiments of the present invention, a method and a structure for forming semiconductor materials for photovoltaic applications are provided. More particularly, the present invention provides a method for manufacturing thin film photovoltaic devices. Merely by way of example, the method has been used to provide a copper indium disulfide thin film material for high efficiency solar cell application. But it would be recognized that the present invention has a much broader range of applicability, for example, embodiments of the present invention may be used to form other semiconducting thin films or multilayers comprising iron sulfide, cadmium sulfide, zinc selenide, and others, and metal oxides such as zinc oxide, iron oxide, copper oxide, and others.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-8</figref> are simplified schematic diagrams illustrating a method for forming a thin film photovoltaic device according to an embodiment of the present invention. These diagrams are merely examples, which should not unduly limit the claims herein. One skilled in the art would recognize other variations, modifications, and alternatives. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a substrate <b>110</b> is provided. In an embodiment, the substrate <b>110</b> includes a surface region <b>112</b> and is held in a process stage within a process chamber (not shown). In another embodiment, the substrate <b>110</b> is an optically transparent solid material. For example, substrate <b>110</b> can use material such as glass, quartz, fused silica, or plastic, or metal, or foil, or semiconductor, or composite materials. Depending upon the embodiment, the substrate can be a single material, multiple materials, which are layered, composites, or stacked, including combinations of these, and the like. Of course there can be other variations, modifications, and alternatives.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the present method forms an electrode layer <b>120</b> overlying a surface region <b>112</b> of substrate <b>110</b>. The electrode layer can be a suitable metal material, a semiconductor material or a transparent conducting oxide material, or a combination. Electrode layer <b>120</b> can be formed using techniques such as sputtering, evaporation (e.g., using electron beam), electro-plating, or a combination of these, and the like, according to a specific embodiment. Preferably, the electrode layer is characterized by a resistivity of about 10 Ohm/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 100 Ohm/cm<sup>2 </sup>and less according to a specific embodiment. In a specific embodiment, the electrode layer can be made of molybdenum or tungsten. The electrode layer can have a thickness ranging from about 100 nm to 2 micron in a specific embodiment, but can also be others depending on the application. Other suitable materials such as copper, chromium, aluminum, nickel, or platinum, and the like may also be used. Of course, there can be other variations, modifications, and alternatives.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a copper layer <b>130</b> is formed overlying the electrode layer. In particular, copper (Cu) layer <b>130</b> is formed overlying the electrode layer <b>120</b>. For example, the copper layer can be formed using a sputtering process using a suitable copper target. In one example, a DC magnetron sputtering process can be used to deposit Cu layer <b>130</b> onto the electrode layer <b>120</b>. The sputtering process is performed under a suitable pressure and temperature. In a specific embodiment, the sputtering process can be performed under a deposition pressure of about 6.2 mTorr. In a specific embodiment, the deposition pressure may be controlled using Ar gas. In a specific embodiment, an Ar gas flow rate of about 32 sccm is used to achieve the desired deposition pressure. Deposition can be provided at room temperature without heating the substrate. Of course, minor heating may result due to plasma generated during deposition. Additionally, a DC power supply of about 115 W may be used for the sputtering process. Depending on the embodiment, DC power ranging from 100 W to 150 W may be used depending on the specific materials used. A deposition time for a Cu layer of 330 nm thickness is about 6 minutes or more under the described deposition condition. Of course, the deposition condition can be varied and modified according to a specific embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">In a preferred embodiment, the method includes forming a barrier layer <b>125</b> overlying the electrode layer to form an interface region between the electrode layer and the copper layer. In a specific embodiment, the interface region is maintained substantially free from a metal disulfide layer having a semiconductor characteristic that is different from a copper indium disulfide material formed during later processing steps. Depending upon the embodiment, the barrier layer has suitable conductive characteristics and can be reflective to allow electromagnetic radiation to reflect back into a photovoltaic cell or can also be transparent or the like. In a specific embodiment, the barrier layer is selected from platinum, titanium, chromium, or silver. Of course, there can be other variations, modifications, and alternatives.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The method forms an indium layer <b>140</b> overlying copper layer <b>130</b>. The indium layer is deposited over the copper layer using a sputtering process in a specific embodiment. In a specific embodiment, the indium layer can be deposited using a DC magnetron sputtering process under a similar condition for depositing the Cu layer. The deposition time for the indium layer may be shorter than that for Cu layer. As merely an example, 2 minutes and 45 seconds may be enough for depositing an In layer of about 410 nm in thickness according to a specific embodiment. In another example, the indium layer can be deposited overlying the copper layer using an electro-plating process, or others dependent on specific embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4</figref> illustrate a method of forming a multilayered structure <b>150</b> comprising copper and indium on a substrate for a thin film photovoltaic device according to an embodiment of the present invention. In a specific embodiment, copper layer <b>130</b> and indium layer <b>140</b> are provided in a certain stoichiometry to allow for a Cu-rich material with an atomic ratio of Cu:In greater than 1 for the multilayered structure <b>150</b>. For example, the atomic ratio Cu:In can be in a range from about 1.2:1 to about 2.0:1 or larger depending upon the specific embodiment. In an implementation, the atomic ratio of Cu:In is between 1.35:1 and 1.60:1. In another implementation, the atomic ratio of Cu:In is selected to be about 1.55:1. In a preferred embodiment, the atomic ratio Cu:In is provided such that Cu is limiting, which consumes essentially all of the indium species, in the resulting structure. In a specific embodiment, indium layer <b>140</b> is provided to cause substantially no change in the copper layer <b>130</b> formed until further processing. In another embodiment, indium layer <b>140</b> can be first deposited overlying the electrode layer followed by deposition of the copper layer <b>130</b> overlying the indium layer. Of course there can be other variations, modifications, and alternatives.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, multilayered structure <b>150</b> is subjected to a thermal treatment process <b>200</b>. In a specific embodiment, the thermal treatment process is provided in an environment containing at least a sulfur bearing species <b>210</b>. The thermal treatment process is performed at an adequate pressure and temperature. In a specific embodiment, the thermal treatment process is provided at a temperature ranging from about 400 Degrees Celsius to about 600 Degrees Celsius. In certain embodiment, the thermal treatment process can be a rapid thermal process provided at the temperature range for about three to fifteen minutes. In one example, the sulfur bearing species is in a fluid phase. As an example, the sulfur bearing species can be provided in a solution, which has dissolved Na<sub>2</sub>S, CS<sub>2</sub>, (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S, thiosulfate, among others. In another example, the sulfur bearing species <b>210</b> is gas phase hydrogen sulfide. In other embodiments, the sulfur bearing species can be provided in a solid phase. As merely an example, elemental sulfur can be heated and allowed to vaporize into a gas phase, e.g., as S<sub>n</sub>. In a specific embodiment, the gas phase sulfur is allowed to react to the indium/copper layers. In other embodiments, combinations of sulfur species can be used. Of course, the thermal treatment process <b>200</b> includes certain predetermined ramp-up and ramp down time and ramp-up and ramp-down rate. For example, the thermal treatment process is a rapid thermal annealing process. In a specific embodiment, the hydrogen sulfide gas is provided through one or more entry valves with flow rate controls into the process chamber. The hydrogen sulfide gas pressure in the chamber may be controlled by one or more pumping systems or others, depending on the embodiment. Of course, there can be other variations, modifications, and alternatives.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">In a specific embodiment, the sulfur bearing species can be provided as a layer material overlying the indium and copper layers or copper and indium layers. In a specific embodiment, the sulfur bearing species is provided as a thin layer or as a patterned layer. Depending upon the embodiment, the sulfur bearing species can be provided as a slurry, a powder, a solid material, a gas, a paste, or other suitable form. Of course, there can be other variations, modifications, and alternatives.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">Referring to the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the thermal treatment process <b>200</b> causes a reaction between copper indium material within the multilayered structure <b>150</b> and the sulfur bearing species <b>210</b>, thereby forming a layer of copper indium disulfide material (or a copper indium disulfide thin film) <b>220</b>. In one example, the copper indium disulfide material or copper indium disulfide thin film <b>220</b> is formed by incorporating sulfur ions/atoms stripped or decomposed from the sulfur bearing species into the multilayered structure <b>150</b> with indium atoms and copper atoms mutually diffused therein. In an embodiment, the thermal treatment process <b>200</b> results in a formation of a cap layer <b>221</b> overlying the transformed copper indium disulfide material <b>220</b>. The cap layer contains a thickness of substantially copper sulfide material but substantially free of indium atoms. The cap layer includes a surface region <b>225</b>. In a specific embodiment, the formation of this cap layer is under a Cu-rich conditions for the Cu—In bearing multilayered structure <b>150</b>. Depending on the embodiment, the thickness of the copper sulfide material <b>221</b> is on an order of about five to ten nanometers and greater based on original multilayered structure <b>150</b> with indium layer <b>140</b> overlying copper layer <b>130</b>. Of course, there can be other variations, modifications, and alternatives.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a process of the method for forming a thin film photovoltaic device according to an embodiment of the present invention. The diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the claims herein. One skilled in the art would recognize other variations, modifications, and alternatives. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a dip process <b>300</b> is performed to the copper sulfide material <b>221</b> that covers the copper indium disulfide thin film <b>220</b>. In particular, the dip process is performed by exposing the surface region <b>225</b> to a solution of potassium cyanide <b>310</b> in a specific embodiment. In a specific embodiment, the solution of potassium cyanide has a concentration of about 1 weight % to about 10 weight % according to a specific embodiment. The solution of potassium cyanide acts as an etchant that is capable of selectively removing copper sulfide material <b>221</b> from the surface region of the copper indium disulfide material. The etching process starts from the exposed surface region <b>225</b> and down to the thickness of the copper sulfide material <b>221</b> and substantially stopped at the interface between the copper sulfide material <b>221</b> and copper indium disulfide material <b>220</b>. As a result the copper sulfide cap layer <b>221</b> is selectively removed by the etching process to expose surface region <b>228</b> of the copper indium disulfide thin film material according to a specific embodiment. In a preferred embodiment, the etch selectivity is about 1:100 or more between copper sulfide and copper indium disulfide material. In other embodiments, other selective etching species can be used. In a specific embodiment, the etching species can be hydrogen peroxide. In certain embodiments, techniques including electro-chemical etching, plasma etching, sputter-etching, or any combination of these may be used. In a specific embodiment, the copper sulfide material can be mechanically removed, chemically removed, electrically removed, or any combination of these, and others. In a specific embodiment, an absorber layer made of copper indium disulfide can have a thickness of about 1 to 10 microns, but can be others. Of course, there can be other variations, modifications, and alternatives.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the method further process the copper indium disulfide material to form a p-type copper indium disulfide film <b>320</b> in a specific embodiment. In certain embodiments, the as-formed copper indium disulfide material may have a desirable p-type semiconducting characteristic. In a specific embodiment, copper indium disulfide material <b>220</b> is subjected to a doping process to adjust p-type impurity concentration therein for the purpose of optimizing I-V characteristic of the high efficiency thin film photovoltaic devices. In an example, aluminum species are allowed to mix into the copper indium disulfide material <b>220</b>. In another example, the copper indium disulfide material <b>220</b> is mixed with a copper indium aluminum disulfide material. Of course, there can be other variations, modifications, and alternatives.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">Subsequently, a window layer <b>310</b> is formed overlying the p-type copper indium disulfide material <b>320</b>. The window layer can be selected from a group consisting of a cadmium sulfide (CdS), a zinc sulfide (ZnS), zinc selenium (ZnSe), zinc oxide (ZnO), zinc magnesium oxide (ZnMgO), or others. In certain embodiments, these materials may be doped with one or more suitable impurities to form an n′ type semiconductor material. The window layer and the absorber layer forms a PN junction associated with a photovoltaic cell. The window layer, is heavily doped to form a n<sup>+</sup>-type semiconductor layer in a preferred embodiment. In one example, indium species are used as the doping material to cause formation of the n<sup>+</sup>-type characteristic associated with the window layer <b>310</b>. In another example, the doping process is performed under suitable conditions. In a specific embodiment, the window layer can use an aluminum doped ZnO material. The aluminum doped ZnO material can range from about 200 nm to about 500 nanometers in a specific embodiment. Of course, there can be other variations, modifications, and alternative</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the method forms a conductive layer <b>330</b> overlying a portion of a first surface region of the window layer <b>310</b>. The conductive layer forms a top electrode layer for the photovoltaic device. In one embodiment, the conductive layer <b>330</b> is a transparent conductive oxide (TCO). For example, the TCO can be selected from a group consisting of In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:Sn (ITO), ZnO:Al (AZO), SnO<sub>2</sub>:F (TFO), and the like, but can be others. In another embodiment, the TCO layer is provided in a certain predetermined pattern to maximize the fill factor and conversion efficiency of the photovoltaic device. In a specific embodiment, the TCO can also function as a window layer, which essentially eliminates a separate window layer. Of course there can be other variations, modifications, and alternatives.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">In a preferred embodiment, the present method maintains an interface region between the electrode layer and the copper indium disulfide material substantially free from a metal disulfide layer having different semiconductor characteristics from the copper indium disulfide material. Depending upon the type of electrode material, the metal disulfide layer is selected from molybdenum disulfide layer or the like. In a specific embodiment, the interface region is characterized by a surface morphology substantially capable of preventing any formation of the metal disulfide layer, which is characterized by a thickness of about 5 nanometers to about 10 nanometers. In a preferred embodiment, the present method includes a thermal process during at least the maintaining process or a portion of the maintaining process of at least 300 Degrees Celsius and greater to prevent any formation of the metal disulfide layer, which can be a molybdenum disulfide or like layer.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">The above sequence of steps provides a method according to an embodiment of the present invention. In a specific embodiment, the present invention provides a method and resulting photovoltaic structure free from parasitic junction regions in the absorber layer, which impair performance of the resulting device. Other alternatives can also be provided where steps are added, one or more steps are removed, or one or more steps are provided in a different sequence without departing from the scope of the claims herein. Details of the present method and structure can be found throughout the present specification and more particularly below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-11</figref> are simplified diagrams illustrating a method and structure for forming a thin film photovoltaic device including sodium species treatment according to an embodiment of the present invention. These diagrams are merely examples, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims herein. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize other variations, modifications, and alternatives. In a specific embodiment, the present method begins with partially completed photovoltaic device <b>900</b>. As shown, the device includes a transparent substrate <b>901</b> comprising a surface region, although other substrates can be used. The device also includes a first electrode layer <b>903</b> overlying the surface region. In a specific embodiment, the first electrode layer can be any conductive material including conductive metals, oxides, and semiconductor or combinations of these, as well as any material described herein and outside of the present specification.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">In a specific embodiment, the photovoltaic device includes a chalcopyrite material, which acts as an absorber for the photovoltaic device. As shown, the chalcopyrite material can include, among others, copper indium disulfide material, copper indium aluminum disulfide, copper indium gallium disulfide, combinations of these, and others. In a specific embodiment, the chalcopyrite is copper rich, or alternatively copper poor and characterized by one or more portions having a copper to indium atomic ratio of 0.99:1 and less or 0.95:1 and less. In a preferred embodiment, the copper indium disulfide material has one or more copper poor regions, which are preferably compensated using an ionic species. Of course, there can be other variations, modifications, and alternatives. In a specific embodiment, the chalcopyrite has a thin layer of copper sulfide <b>907</b>, which has been previously described, as may remain as a residue or fixed material when the bulk material is copper rich. Of course, there can be other variations, modifications, and alternatives.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the method selectively removes the thin layer of copper sulfide. In a specific embodiment, the thin layer of copper sulfide is removed <b>909</b> using a solution of potassium cyanide (KCN) or other suitable technique, e.g., dry etching, plasma etching, sputtering. In a specific embodiment, the method may cause formation of a copper poor surface region <b>1001</b>. In a specific embodiment, the copper poor surface is characterized by a copper to indium atomic ratio of less than about 0.95:1 or 0.99:1. In a specific embodiment, the copper poor surface region is characterized as an n-type material, which forms a parasitic junction with the p-type copper indium disulfide material, which can be rich in copper. The parasitic junction leads to poor or inefficient device performance. Of course, there can be other variations, modifications, and alternatives.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">In a preferred embodiment, the present method subjects the copper poor surface to an ionic species to convert the copper poor surface from an n-type characteristic to a p-type characteristic, which behaves like a normal copper indium disulfide surface <b>1101</b> now, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. In a preferred embodiment, the method subjects at least one or more portions of the bulk copper indium disulfide material to one or more ionic species to convert the copper poor region from an n-type characteristic to a p-type characteristic. In a preferred embodiment, the ionic species is sodium, which can be derived from NaCl, Na<sub>2</sub>S, NaF, or other suitable sodium salts and the like. In a specific embodiment, the subjecting the copper poor surface and/or bulk material includes a thermal treatment process during a time period associated with the subjecting of at least the copper poor surface with the ionic species. In a specific embodiment, the thermal treatment process can range in temperature from about 100 Degrees Celsius to about 500 Degrees Celsius, but can be others. Additionally, the thermal treatment process occurs for a time period ranging from a few minutes to about ten minutes to an hour or so. Of course, there can be other variations, modifications, and alternatives.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">In a specific embodiment, the ionic species can be applied using one or more techniques. These techniques include deposition, sputtering, spin coating, spraying, spray pyrolysis, dipping, electro deposition, painting, ink jet coating, sprinkling, any combination of these, and others. In some embodiments, the sodium can be diffused from an overlying material, which can be an electrode layer or molybdenum or other suitable material. Alternatively, sodium can be diffused from a piece of sodium material or the like via a vapor phase. In a specific embodiment, the ionic species such as sodium can be diffused in vapor phase as in the “Siemens” process, but can be others, for short periods of time. In a specific embodiment, the treatment process passivates the surface at the heterojunction or the like, which facilitates carrier separation and transport. Additionally, the present treatment process can also generate desired conduction band offset, commonly called CBO. Of course, there can be other variations, modifications, and alternatives.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">In a specific embodiment, the method includes forming a window layer overlying the copper indium disulfide material. The method also forms an electrode layer overlying the window layer. Depending upon the embodiment, the photovoltaic cell can be coupled to a glass or transparent plate or other suitable member. Alternatively, the photovoltaic cell can be coupled to another cell, e.g., bottom cell, to form a tandem or multi junction cell. Again, there can be other variations, modifications, and alternatives.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a simplified diagram of an copper indium disulfide material having one or more copper poor regions according to an embodiment of the present invention. This diagram is merely an example, which should not unduly limit the scope of the claims herein. One of ordinary skill in the art would recognize other variations, modifications, and alternatives.
