<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The present invention relates to a photovoltaic module, and particularly relates to a thin film solar cell module of see-through type.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">2. Description of Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Solar energy is a renewable energy, which causes no pollution. It has been the focus in the development of environmental-friendly energy as an attempt to counter the problems such as pollution and shortage of fossil fuels. Herein, solar cells can be used to directly convert solar energy into electrical energy, which becomes a very important research topic now.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Currently, mono-silicon and poly-silicon cells account for more than 90% of the solar cell market. However, manufacturing these types of solar cells requires silicon chips with thickness of 150˜350 micrometers, which increases the production costs. Furthermore, the raw material of solar cells is high-purity silicon ingot. Due to the significant increase in the consumption of silicon ingot, it is being depleted by day. Hence, thin film solar cells have become the new direction in the research and development of solar energy. Thin film solar cells are suitable for mass production and have the advantages of lower production costs and simpler module fabricating process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically illustrates a conventional thin film solar cell module. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a thin film solar cell module <b>150</b> comprises a glass substrate <b>152</b>, a transparent electrode <b>154</b>, a photoelectric conversion layer <b>156</b>, and a metal electrode <b>158</b>. Herein, the transparent electrode <b>154</b> is disposed on the glass substrate <b>152</b>. The photoelectric conversion layer <b>156</b> is disposed on the transparent electrode <b>154</b> by position displacement. In addition, the metal electrode <b>158</b> is disposed on the photoelectric conversion layer <b>156</b> by position displacement and is in contact with the transparent electrode <b>154</b> underneath. In the thin film solar cell module <b>150</b>, the photoelectric conversion layer <b>156</b> usually includes a p-i-n structure composed of a p-type semiconductor, an intrinsic semiconductor, and an n-type semiconductor. Light is transmitted through the bottom of the glass substrate <b>152</b> and is absorbed by the photoelectric conversion layer <b>156</b> to generate electron-hole pairs. The electron-hole pairs are then separated by an electric field established across the device to form a voltage and an electric current, which are transmitted by a conductive wire for loading. To enhance the efficiency of the cells, in the conventional thin film solar cell module <b>150</b>, pyramid-like structures or textured structures (not shown) are formed on the surface of the transparent electrode <b>154</b> to reduce the reflection of light. The photoelectric conversion layer <b>156</b> is usually formed by using an amorphous silicon thin film. However, the band gap of the amorphous silicon thin film is usually between 1.7 eV and 1.8 eV, which merely absorbs sunlight of wavelength less than 800 nm. To increase the utility of light, usually a layer of micro-crystalline (or nano-crystalline) thin film is stacked on the amorphous silicon thin film to form a p-i-n/p-i-n tandem solar cell. The band gap of micro-crystalline (or nano-crystalline) is usually between 1.1 eV and 1.2 eV, which absorbs sunlight of wavelength less than 1100 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">In the early times, it was costly and difficult to manufacture solar cells, and solar cells were only used in special fields such as astronautics. Now solar cells, which feature converting solar energy into electric energy, have become more widely used and applied. The applications of solar cells range from the use in apartments and high-rise buildings to that in camper vans and portable refrigerators. However, silicon wafer solar cells are not suitable for certain applications such as transparent glass curtains and buildings integrated with photovoltaic (BIPV). Thin film solar cells of see-through type are used in the aforesaid applications because they are energy-efficient and pleasing to the eye. Further, they accommodate more readily with our living demands.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">Currently, techniques related to the thin film solar cells of see-through type and the methods for fabricating the same have been disclosed in some U.S. patents.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,858,461 (6,858,461 B2) provides a partially transparent photovoltaic module. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a photovoltaic module <b>110</b> includes a transparent substrate <b>114</b>, a transparent conductive layer <b>118</b>, a metal electrode <b>122</b>, and a photoelectric conversion layer disposed between the transparent conductive layer <b>118</b> and the metal electrode <b>122</b>. Similarly, light is transmitted through the bottom of the transparent substrate <b>114</b>. In the photovoltaic module <b>110</b>, a laser scribing process is performed to remove a portion of the metal electrode <b>122</b> and a portion of the photoelectric conversion layer to form at least one groove <b>140</b> so as to achieve partial transparency of the photovoltaic module <b>110</b>. However, the laser scribing process is performed at a high temperature. Due to such a high temperature, the metal electrode <b>122</b> easily forms metal residues or melts down and accumulates in the grooves, resulting in short circuits of the top and bottom electrodes. On the other hand, an amorphous silicon photoelectric conversion layer recrystallizes at such a high temperature and forms low resistant micro-crystalline (or nano-crystalline) silicon on the sidewalls of the grooves. Consequently, current leakage is increased, and the process yield and the efficiency of the solar cells are affected. In addition, pyramid-like structures or textured structures are usually formed on the surface of the transparent conductive layer <b>118</b> to enhance the efficiency of the cells. However, light transmittance is not effectively enhanced because the light transmitted through the bottom of the transparent substrate <b>114</b> would be scattered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">In view of the above, to achieve a certain level of light transmittance, larger portions of the metal electrode and the photoelectric conversion layer in a solar cell need to be removed. Please refer to Table 1, which lists the technical specifications of various thin film cells of see-through type manufactured by MakMax Taiyo Kogyo (Japan). According to Table 1, to increase light transmittance, larger portions of the metal electrode and the photoelectric conversion layer need to be removed to decrease the maximum output, efficiency, and fill factor (FF).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">The present invention provides a thin film solar cell module of see-through type, which has a plurality of cells connected in series and disposed on an opaque substrate. Among the cells, a plurality of holes passing through the opaque substrate is formed. The thin film solar cell module of see-through type comprises a first electrode, a second electrode, and a photoelectric conversion layer. Herein, the first electrode is disposed on the opaque substrate and is composed of a first comb electrode and a two-dimensional array composed of a plurality of block-like first electrodes.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">According to the thin film solar cell module of see-through type and the method for fabricating the same of the present invention, bi-directional scribe lines of scribe window are formed during the formation of the first electrode. Consequently, the thin film solar cell module of see-through type of the present invention overcomes the problems of short circuit and current leakage caused by a high-temperature laser scribing process, and further improves the process yield and the efficiency of the solar cells. In addition, compared with a conventional thin film solar cell module of see-through type, the thin film solar cell module of see-through type according to the present invention has a plurality of holes in the opaque substrate, which avoids the scattering of light caused by the pyramid-like structures or textured structures on the surface of a transparent oxide electrode. Hence, the light transmittance is greatly increased.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">First, referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9(</figref> <i>a</i>), <b>9</b>(<i>b</i>), <b>9</b>(<i>b</i>′), and <b>9</b>(<i>c</i>), a thin film solar cell module of see-through type <b>400</b> according to the embodiment is composed of a plurality of cells <b>401</b> connected in series. The cells <b>401</b> are composed of a first electrode <b>470</b>, a photoelectric conversion layer <b>414</b>, and a second electrode <b>480</b>. The cells <b>401</b> are arranged in an array. Rows of the cells <b>401</b> are separated by X-directional scribe lines <b>422</b> and <b>408</b>; and columns of the cells <b>401</b> are separated by Y-directional scribe lines <b>420</b> and <b>406</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">In other words, the X-directional scribe lines <b>408</b> and <b>422</b> divide the first electrode <b>470</b> and the second electrode <b>480</b> into a plurality of rows and expose an opaque substrate <b>402</b>. The Y-directional scribe lines <b>420</b> divide the second electrode <b>480</b> into a plurality of columns and expose a portion of the first electrode <b>470</b> and a portion of the opaque substrate <b>402</b>. The Y-directional scribe lines <b>406</b> divide the first electrode <b>407</b> into a plurality of columns and expose the opaque substrate <b>402</b>. Moreover, the opaque substrate <b>402</b>, which is exposed by the X-directional scribe lines <b>422</b> and the Y-directional scribe lines <b>420</b>, has a plurality of holes <b>450</b> passing through a surface <b>402</b> <i>a </i>and a surface <b>402</b> <i>b </i>of the opaque substrate <b>402</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">More specifically, the thin film solar cell module of see-through type <b>400</b> comprises the opaque substrate <b>402</b>, on which the first electrode <b>470</b>, the photoelectric conversion layer <b>414</b>, and the second electrode <b>480</b> are disposed. Herein, the first electrode <b>470</b> is directly disposed on the opaque substrate <b>402</b> and is composed of a comb electrode <b>412</b> and a two-dimensional array composed of a plurality of block-like electrodes <b>410</b>, which are formed by the X-directional scribe lines <b>408</b> and the Y-directional scribe lines <b>406</b>. A material of the first electrode <b>470</b> is, for example, a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layer or a metal layer. A material of TCO is, for example, zinc oxide (ZnO), tin oxide (SnO<sub>2</sub>), indium-tin oxide (ITO), or indium oxide (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). A material of the metal layer is, for example, Al, Ag, Mo, Cu, or other suitable metals or alloys.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">The second electrode <b>480</b> is disposed above the first electrode <b>470</b> and is composed of a comb electrode <b>426</b> and a two-dimensional array composed of a plurality of block-like electrodes <b>424</b>, which are formed by the X-directional scribe lines <b>422</b> and the Y-directional scribe lines <b>422</b>. The comb electrodes <b>412</b> and <b>426</b> are disposed symmetrically, and the block-like electrodes <b>410</b> and <b>424</b> are disposed by parallel displacement. A material of the second electrode <b>480</b> is, for example, a TCO layer. A material of TCO is, for example, ZnO, ITO, or In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">Moreover, the photoelectric conversion layer <b>414</b> is disposed between the first electrode <b>470</b> and the second electrode <b>480</b>, and the photoelectric conversion layer <b>414</b> is composed of a two-dimensional array composed of a plurality of photoelectric conversion material layers. The photoelectric conversion layer <b>414</b> is a single-layered structure or a multi-layered structure. A material of the photoelectric conversion layer <b>414</b> is, for example, amorphous silicon and amorphous silicon alloy, CdS, CuInGaSe<sub>2 </sub>(CIGS), CuInSe<sub>2 </sub>(CIS), CdTe, an organic material, or a multi-layered structure comprising the aforesaid materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">In aforementioned scribe lines, the Y-directional scribe lines <b>406</b>, which divide the first electrode <b>470</b>, are covered by the photoelectric conversion layer <b>414</b> and the second electrode <b>480</b>. The Y-directional scribe lines <b>420</b>, which divide the second electrode <b>480</b>, expose a portion of the first electrode <b>470</b> and the opaque substrate <b>402</b>. The X-directional scribe lines <b>408</b>, which divide the first electrode <b>470</b>, and the Y-directional scribe lines <b>422</b>, which divide the second electrode <b>480</b>, correspond to each other and expose the opaque substrate <b>402</b>. In the present invention, it is noted that the opaque substrate <b>402</b>, which is exposed by the X-directional scribe lines <b>422</b>, the X-directional scribe lines <b>406</b>, and the Y-directional scribe lines <b>420</b>, has a plurality of holes <b>450</b> passing through the opaque substrate <b>402</b> from the surface <b>402</b> <i>a </i>to the surface <b>402</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">The sizes of the holes <b>440</b> on the surface <b>402</b> <i>a </i>may be the same or different from the sizes of the holes <b>440</b> on the surface <b>402</b> <i>b</i>. For instance, the sizes of the holes <b>440</b> may gradually increase or decrease when passing through the opaque substrate <b>402</b> from the surface <b>402</b> <i>a </i>to the surface <b>402</b> <i>b</i>. Moreover, the holes <b>440</b> passing through the opaque substrate <b>402</b> do not have a specific pattern, and the holes <b>440</b> may be circular, square, rectangular, triangular, polygonal, or in an irregular shape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">In this embodiment, the thin film solar cell module of see-through type <b>400</b> comprises the X-directional scribe lines <b>422</b>, the X-directional scribe lines <b>406</b>, and the Y-directional scribe lines <b>420</b> which expose the opaque substrate <b>402</b>. Further, the opaque substrate <b>402</b> has a plurality of holes <b>450</b>. Consequently, light (sunlight) passes through the X-directional scribe lines <b>422</b>, the Y-directional scribe lines <b>420</b>, and the holes <b>450</b> in the opaque substrate <b>402</b> when transmitted through the second electrode <b>480</b> above the surface <b>402</b> <i>a </i>of the opaque substrate <b>402</b>. The light transmittance of the thin film solar cell module of see-through type <b>400</b> is therefore enhanced. Compared with the conventional thin film solar cell module of see-through type, the thin film solar cell module of see-through type according to this embodiment has a much better light transmittance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">On the other hand, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(</figref> <i>c</i>), the first electrode is covered by the photoelectric conversion layer <b>414</b>. As a consequence, the high-temperature laser scribing process does not cause the metal residues or melt of the second electrode, which would come into direct contact with the first electrode during the formation of the X-direction scribe lines <b>422</b>. Hence, the problems, which affect the process yield and the efficiency of the solar cell, such as short circuit or current leakage resulted from recrystallization of the amorphous silicon photoelectric conversion layer on the sidewalls of the grooves to produce low resistant micro-crystalline (nano-crystalline) silicon are avoided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">In the following paragraphs, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> through <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrate a method for fabricating the thin film solar cell module of see-through type <b>400</b> according to the embodiment of the present invention.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">Certainly, a surface of the electrode material may be textured to reduce the reflection of light so as to improve the efficiency of the solar cells.
