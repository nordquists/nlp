<heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">An embodiment of the present invention relates to a semiconductor device and a manufacturing method thereof, in particular, a semiconductor device capable of storing data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">A semiconductor device refers to a device provided with at least one semiconductor element such as a transistor. Thus, a storage device is included in the semiconductor device. Note that the storage device refers to a device which includes a plurality of storage elements.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Storage devices using semiconductor elements are broadly classified into two categories: a volatile storage device that loses stored data when power supply stops, and a nonvolatile storage device that holds stored data even when power is not supplied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Examples of a volatile storage device include a dynamic random access memory (hereinafter referred to as a DRAM) and a static random access memory (hereinafter referred to as an SRAM).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">When a DRAM is formed using a conventional transistor, a data retention period is short because leakage current is generated between a source and a drain even when a transistor is off. For that reason, another writing operation (a refresh operation) is necessary at predetermined intervals, and this increases power consumption. In addition, when power supply stops, the above refresh operation cannot be performed; thus, data is lost.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">On the other hand, although an SRAM retains stored data with the use of a circuit such as a flip-flop circuit and thus does not need refresh operation, unit price of the storage capacity is expensive. Note that when power supply stops, stored data is lost as in the case of the DRAM.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">Typical examples of a nonvolatile storage device include a flash memory. A flash memory includes a floating gate between a gate electrode and a channel formation region in a transistor and retains data by injecting and retaining charge in the floating gate. Therefore, in a flash memory, the data retention period is long semi-permanently and refresh operation is not needed (e.g., Patent Document 1).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">However, an insulating layer between the channel formation region and the floating gate deteriorates by tunneling current generated at the time of writing; therefore, there is a limitation on the number of writing operations. Therefore, for example, a method in which the number of writing operations into each storage element is equalized is employed by providing a complicated peripheral circuit. However, even when the method for equalizing the number of writing operations is employed, the fundamental problem of lifetime is not solved; therefore, it can be said that a flash memory is not suitable for usage where data is rewritten frequently.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">Moreover, high voltages are needed to inject charge into the floating gate and removing charge from the floating gate; therefore, it is necessary to provide a step-up circuit or the like. Further, it takes a relatively long time to inject charge into the floating gate and remove charge from the floating gate; thus, it is difficult to perform a data writing operation and a data erasing operation at high speed.</div>

<heading>DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">An object of an embodiment of the present invention is to provide a storage device or a semiconductor device where data can be retained even if power is not supplied, the number of data writing operations is not limited, and further the storage capacity per unit area is large, in a manner similar to that of a nonvolatile storage device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">An embodiment of the present invention is a semiconductor device including a storage circuit capable of retaining data in a capacitor even if power is not supplied in such a manner that a transistor with high operation speed and a transistor with low off-state current are combined. As the transistor with high operation speed, an insulated gate field-effect transistor including a silicon semiconductor can be applied as used in a number of integrated circuits. In contrast, as the transistor with low off-state current, an insulated gate field-effect transistor including a semiconductor whose band gap is wider than that of a silicon semiconductor, which is formed with an oxide semiconductor including, for example, metal oxide, can be applied. In the case where a storage circuit is formed with the use of these two kinds of transistor in combination, the storage circuit is unsuitable to increase the storage capacity per unit area when the two transistors are juxtaposed. Therefore, according to an embodiment of the present invention, the storage capacity per unit area is increased in such a manner that these two transistors are provided so that at least part thereof overlap with each other. Further, in order that the connection structure of the two transistors is simplified and also the two transistors can be arranged with high density, one of features of an embodiment of the present invention is that a gate electrode of one of the transistors and a drain electrode (or a source electrode) of the other of the transistors are in direct contact and are provided to overlap with each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">Note that all of the transistors included in the storage circuit do not need to be provided with oxide semiconductors. It is preferable to provide a place where high-speed operation is required with a transistor including a semiconductor material other than an oxide semiconductor. Examples of such a semiconductor material include single crystal silicon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">One embodiment of the present invention is a semiconductor device comprising a first transistor and a second transistor. The first transistor includes a first channel formation region which includes a first semiconductor material, impurity regions provided with the first channel formation region interposed therebetween, a first gate insulating layer provided over the first channel formation region, a first gate electrode which at least overlaps with the first channel formation region and is provided over the first gate insulating layer, and a first source or drain electrode electrically connected to the impurity region. The second transistor includes second source and drain electrodes, a second channel formation region which includes a second semiconductor material and is electrically connected to the second source and drain electrodes, a second gate insulating layer provided over the second channel formation region, and a second gate electrode which at least overlaps with the second channel formation region and is provided over the second gate insulating layer. In the semiconductor device, the first transistor and the second transistor are provided so that at least part thereof overlap with each other, one of the second source and drain electrodes is electrically connected to the first gate electrode, and the other of the second source and drain electrodes is separated from the first gate electrode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">Another embodiment of the present invention is a semiconductor device comprising a first transistor, a second transistor, and a capacitor. The first transistor includes a first channel formation region which includes a first semiconductor material, impurity regions provided with the first channel formation region interposed therebetween, a first gate insulating layer provided over the first channel formation region, a first gate electrode which at least overlaps with the first channel formation region and is provided over the first gate insulating layer, and a first source or drain electrode electrically connected to the impurity region. The second transistor includes second source and drain electrodes, a second channel formation region which includes a second semiconductor material and is electrically connected to the second source and drain electrodes, a second gate insulating layer provided over the second channel formation region, and a second gate electrode which at least overlaps with the second channel formation region and is provided over the second gate insulating layer. The capacitor includes one of the second source and drain electrodes, the second gate insulating layer, and an electrode for the capacitor provided over the second gate insulating layer. In the semiconductor device, the first transistor and the second transistor are provided so that at least part thereof overlap with each other, one of the second source and drain electrodes is electrically connected to the first gate electrode, and the other of the second source a drain electrodes is separated from the first gate electrode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">Another embodiment of the present invention is a semiconductor device comprising a first transistor, a second transistor, and a capacitor. The first transistor includes a first channel formation region which includes a first semiconductor material, impurity regions provided with the first channel formation region interposed therebetween, a first gate insulating layer provided over the first channel formation region, a first gate electrode which at least overlaps with the first channel formation region and is provided over the first gate insulating layer, and a first source or drain electrode electrically connected to the impurity region.

In the semiconductor device, the first transistor and the second transistor are provided so that at least part thereof overlap with each other, one of the second source and drain electrodes is electrically connected to the first gate electrode, and the other of the second source and drain electrodes is separated from the first gate electrode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">In the semiconductor device of the above structure, the first semiconductor material and the second semiconductor material are preferably different.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">In the semiconductor device of the above structure, the second semiconductor material is preferably an oxide semiconductor.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">In the semiconductor device of the above structure, an energy gap of the second semiconductor material is preferably higher than 3 eV. For example, a wide band gap material typified by silicon carbide (more specifically, for example, a semiconductor material whose energy gap E<sub>g </sub>is higher than 3 eV) may be employed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">In the semiconductor device of the above structure, the first transistor is preferably capable of operating at higher speed than the second transistor.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">In the semiconductor device of the above structure, where the off-state current of the second transistor is lower than the off-state current of the first transistor, the off-state current of the second transistor at room temperature is preferably lower than or equal to 10 zA.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">Note that in this specification, the term such as “over” or “below” does not necessarily mean that a component is placed “directly on” or “directly under” another component. For example, the expression “a gate electrode over a gate insulating layer” does not exclude the case where a component is placed between the gate insulating layer and the gate electrode. Moreover, the terms such as “over” and “below” are only used for convenience of description and can include the case where the relation of components is reversed, unless otherwise specified.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">In addition, in this specification, the term such as “electrode” or “wiring” does not limit a function of a component. For example, an “electrode” is sometimes used as part of a “wiring”, and vice versa. Furthermore, the term such as “electrode” or wiring” can include the case where a plurality of “electrodes” or “wirings” is formed in an integrated manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">Note that in this specification, a “film” refers to a film which is formed over the entire surface of an object with a CVD method (including a plasma CVD method and the like), a sputtering method, or the like. On the other hand, a “layer” refers to a layer which is formed by processing a film or a layer which is formed over the entire surface of an object and which does not need to be subjected to processing. However, a “film” and a “layer” are used without particular distinction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">Note that functions of the “source” or “drain” may be switched in the case where transistors of different polarities are employed or in the case where the direction of a current flow changes in a circuit operation, for example. Therefore, the terms such as “source” and “drain” can be used to denote the drain and the source, respectively, in this specification.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">Note that in this specification, the term “electrically connected” includes the case where components are connected through an object having any electric function. There is no particular limitation on an “object having any electric function” as long as electric signals can be transmitted and received between components that are connected through the object. Examples of an “object having any electric function” are a switching element such as a transistor, a resistor, an inductor, a capacitor, and an element with a variety of functions as well as an electrode and a wiring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">A storage device or a semiconductor device where data can be retained even if power is not supplied, the number of data writing operations is not limited, and further the storage capacity per unit area is large can be obtained in a manner similar to that of a nonvolatile storage device.</div>

<heading>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">Examples of an embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to the drawings. Note that the present invention is not limited to the following description, and it will be easily understood by those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Therefore, the present invention should not be construed as being limited to the following description of the embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">Note that the position, size, range, and the like of each component illustrated in the drawings which are referred in the following description are not actual ones in some cases to make them simple and make features stand out. Therefore, the present invention is not limited to the position, size, range, and the like disclosed in the drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">Note that in the following description, ordinal numbers such as “first”, “second”, and “third” are used for convenience in order to avoid confusion among components, and the terms do not limit the components numerically.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">An example of a storage device according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">Note that in each of circuit diagrams, in some cases, “OS” (abbreviation of an oxide semiconductor) is written besides a transistor in order to indicate that the transistor includes an oxide semiconductor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a circuit diagram illustrating a configuration of a storage element according to an embodiment of the present invention. The storage element illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> includes a transistor <b>160</b>, a transistor <b>162</b>, and a capacitor <b>164</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, one of source and drain electrodes of the transistor <b>160</b> is electrically connected to a first wiring (also referred to as a 1<sup>st </sup>Line), and the other of the source and drain electrodes of the transistor <b>160</b> is electrically connected to a second wiring (also referred to as a 2<sup>nd </sup>Line). One of source and drain electrodes of the transistor <b>162</b> is electrically connected to a third wiring (also referred to as a 3<sup>rd </sup>Line), and a gate electrode of the transistor <b>162</b> is electrically connected to a fourth wiring (also referred to as a 4<sup>th </sup>Line). In addition, a gate electrode of the transistor <b>160</b> and the other of the source and drain electrodes of the transistor <b>162</b> are electrically connected to one of electrodes of the capacitor <b>164</b>. The other of the electrodes of the capacitor <b>164</b> is electrically connected to a fifth line (also referred to as a 5<sup>th </sup>Line).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">A transistor including an oxide semiconductor is used as the transistor <b>162</b>. The amount of off-state current of the transistor including an oxide semiconductor can be significantly reduced by high purification of the oxide semiconductor and removal of hydrogen and water. Therefore, charge supplied to the gate electrode of the transistor <b>160</b> can be retained for an extremely long time by turning off the transistor <b>162</b>. Provision of the capacitor <b>164</b> facilitates retaining of charge supplied to the gate electrode of the transistor <b>160</b> and also reading of retained data. Note that the channel length of the transistor <b>162</b> is preferably 10 nm to 1000 nm inclusive. The channel length is set to 10 nm and 1000 nm inclusive, so that high-speed operation can be performed and power consumption can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">The data writing operation, data retaining operation, and data reading operation in the storage element illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> will be described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">First, the charge supplied from the third wiring is supplied to the gate electrode of the transistor <b>160</b> and one of the electrodes of the capacitor <b>164</b> by turning on the transistor <b>162</b> by the fourth wiring. In other words, the charge is supplied to a portion FG of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> (the writing operation). Here, any of charges giving two different potential levels (hereinafter referred to as a “low-level charge” and a “high-level charge”) is supplied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">After that, the charge in the portion FG of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is retained by turning off the transistor <b>162</b> by the fourth wiring (the retaining operation).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">The off-state current of the transistor <b>162</b> is extremely low; thus, the charge in the portion FG is retained for a long time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">Next, the data reading operation will be described. When an appropriate potential (a reading potential) is supplied to the fifth wiring while a predetermined potential (a constant potential) is supplied to the first wiring, the potential of the second wiring varies depending on the amount of charge retained in the portion FG (the potential of the gate electrode of the transistor <b>160</b>). This is because in general, when the transistor <b>160</b> is an n-channel transistor, an “apparent threshold voltage” V<sub>th</sub> <sub> <sub2>—</sub2> </sub> <sub>H </sub>in the case where a high-level charge is supplied to the gate electrode of the transistor <b>160</b> is lower than an “apparent threshold voltage” V<sub>th</sub> <sub> <sub2>—</sub2> </sub> <sub>L </sub>in the case where a low-level charge is supplied to the gate electrode of the transistor <b>160</b>. Here, an “apparent threshold voltage” of the transistor <b>160</b> refers to the potential of the fifth wiring, which is needed to turn on the transistor <b>160</b> when the potential of the first wiring is set to a constant potential. Thus, the potential of the fifth wiring is set to a potential V<sub>0 </sub>intermediate between V<sub>th</sub> <sub> <sub2>—</sub2> </sub> <sub>H </sub>and V<sub>th</sub> <sub> <sub2>—</sub2> </sub> <sub>L</sub>, whereby the charge supplied to the gate electrode of the transistor <b>160</b> can be determined whether it is a high-level charge or a low-level charge. For example, in the case where high-level charge is retained, when the potential of the fifth wiring is set to V<sub>0 </sub>(&gt;V<sub>th</sub> <sub> <sub2>—</sub2> </sub> <sub>H</sub>), the transistor <b>160</b> is turned on. In the case where low level charge is retained, even when the potential of the fifth wiring is set to V<sub>0 </sub>(&lt;V<sub>th</sub> <sub> <sub2>—</sub2> </sub> <sub>L</sub>), the transistor <b>160</b> remains in off. Therefore, the retained data can be determined and read by referring to the potential of the second wiring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">Note that in the case where storage elements are arrayed to be used, only data of the desired storage element is needed to be read. In the case where data is read in this manner, a potential at which the transistor <b>160</b> is turned off regardless of the state of the gate electrode (a potential lower than V<sub>th</sub> <sub> <sub2>—</sub2> </sub> <sub>H</sub>) may be supplied to the fifth wiring. Alternatively, a potential at which the transistor <b>160</b> is turned on regardless of the state of the gate electrode (a potential higher than V<sub>th</sub> <sub> <sub2>—</sub2> </sub> <sub>L</sub>) may be supplied to the fifth wiring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">Next, a data rewriting operation will be described. The data rewriting operation is performed in a manner similar to that of the above data writing operation and data retaining operation. That is, the transistor <b>162</b> is turned on by the potential of the fourth wiring. Accordingly, the potential of the third wiring (a potential related to new data) is supplied to the portion FG. After that, charge of the potential related to new data is supplied to the portion FG by turning off the transistor <b>162</b> by the potential of the fourth wiring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">In the storage element according to an embodiment of the present invention, data can be directly rewritten by another writing of data as described above. Therefore, a high voltage which has been needed at the time of extracting charge from a floating gate in a flash memory or the like is not necessary; thus, a reduction in operation speed due to injection of charge into the floating gate and removal of charge from the floating gate can be suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">Note that the other of the source and drain electrodes of the transistor <b>162</b> is electrically connected to the gate electrode of the transistor <b>160</b>, whereby the portion FG in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> has a function similar to a floating gate of a flash memory. In the case where the transistor <b>162</b> is off, the portion FG can be regarded as being embedded in an insulator; thus, charge is retained in the portion FG. The amount of off-state current of the transistor <b>162</b> which is provided for the storage element according to an embodiment of the present invention can be lower than or equal to one hundred thousandth of the amount of off-state current of a conventional transistor including silicon or the like. Therefore, the storage element according to an embodiment of the present invention can be regarded as a storage element where leakage of charge from the portion FG through the transistor <b>162</b> seldom occurs. That is, with the storage element according to an embodiment of the present invention, a nonvolatile storage device where data can be retained even if power is not supplied can be realized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">For example, in the case where the off-state current of the transistor <b>162</b> is lower than or equal to 10 zA at room temperature and the capacitance value of the capacitor <b>164</b> is approximately 10 fF, data can be retained for at least 10<sup>4 </sup>seconds. Note that the retention period varies depending on characteristics of the transistor and the capacitance value of the capacitor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">Further, as described above, in the storage element according to an embodiment of the present invention, which differs from a flash memory, tunneling current that deteriorates an insulating layer between a channel formation region and a floating gate is not used. Therefore, there is no limitation on the number of writing operations. Furthermore, a high voltage which has been needed at the time of writing or erasing in the conventional floating gate transistor is not necessary.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">The components such as the transistors in the storage element illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> can be regarded as being formed with a resistor and a capacitor as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, in each of the transistor <b>160</b> and the capacitor <b>164</b>, a resistor and a capacitor can be regarded as being connected to each other in parallel. R<b>1</b> and C<b>1</b> denote the resistance value and the capacitance value of the capacitor <b>164</b>, respectively. The resistance value R<b>1</b> corresponds to the resistance value which depends on an insulating layer included in the capacitor <b>164</b>. R<b>2</b> and C<b>2</b> denote the resistance value and the capacitance value of the transistor <b>160</b>, respectively. The resistance value R<b>2</b> corresponds to the resistance value which depends on a gate insulating layer at the time when the transistor <b>160</b> is on. The capacitance value C<b>2</b> corresponds to the capacitance value of a so-called gate capacitor (a capacitor formed between a gate electrode, and a source or drain electrode; and a capacitor formed between a gate electrode and a channel formation region).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">A charge retention period (also referred to as a data retention period) is determined mainly by off-state current of the transistor <b>162</b> under the conditions that gate leakage current of the transistor <b>162</b> is sufficiently low and that, when the resistance value (also referred to as effective resistance) between the source and drain electrodes when the transistor <b>162</b> is off is ROS, R<b>1</b> is larger than ROS and R<b>2</b> is smaller than ROS.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067">On the other hand, in the case where the conditions are not satisfied, it is difficult to secure the retention period sufficiently even if the off-state current of the transistor <b>162</b> is sufficiently low. This is because leakage current other than the off-state current of the transistor <b>162</b> (e.g., leakage current generated between the source and gate electrodes) is high. Accordingly, it is preferable that the storage element according to an embodiment of the present invention satisfy the above relation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068">On the other hand, C<b>1</b> is preferably greater than or equal to C<b>2</b>. If C<b>1</b> is large, variation in potential of the fifth wiring can be suppressed when the potential of the portion FG is controlled by the fifth wiring (e.g., at the time of reading).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">Note that R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b> are determined by the gate insulating layer of the transistor <b>160</b> and a gate insulating layer of the transistor <b>162</b>. The same relation is applied to C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>. Therefore, the materials, the thicknesses, and the like of the gate insulating layers are set as appropriate, so that a storage element satisfying the above relation can be realized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0070">In the storage element according to an embodiment of the present invention, the portion FG has a function similar to a floating gate of a floating gate transistor of a flash memory or the like, but the portion FG has a feature which is essentially different from that of the floating gate of the flash memory or the like. In the conventional flash memory, a tunneling current is generated by application of a high electric field to a control gate; therefore, it is necessary to keep a proper distance between storage elements in order to prevent the electric field from affecting the floating gate of the adjacent cell. Accordingly, integration of the storage device is inhibited.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">Further, because of the above principle of the flash memory, deterioration of an insulating layer proceeds and thus there is a limitation on the number of rewriting operations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0072">The storage element according to an embodiment of the present invention operates by switching of a transistor, and charge injection by tunneling current does not occur unlike the conventional flash memory. That is, a high electric field for charge injection is not necessary unlike a flash memory. Accordingly, it is not necessary to consider an influence of a high electric field from a control gate on an adjacent cell, which facilitates higher integration than the case of the conventional flash memory.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0073">Further, as will be described later, the transistor <b>160</b> and the transistor <b>162</b> are provided to overlap with each other, so that higher integration is also possible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0074">Furthermore, in the conventional floating gate transistor, charge travels in a gate insulating film (a tunnel insulating film) during a writing operation, whereby deterioration of the gate insulating film (tunnel insulating film) cannot be avoided. In contrast, in the storage element according to an embodiment of the present invention, data is written by a switching operation of a writing transistor; therefore, the deterioration of a gate insulating film, which has been recognized as a problem of the conventional floating gate transistor, can be solved. This means that there is no limitation on the number of writing operations in principle and writing durability is extremely high. For example, in the storage element according to an embodiment of the present invention, data can also be written 1×10<sup>9 </sup>or more times (one billion or more times).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0075">Further, since charge injection by tunneling current is not utilized, there is no cause for deterioration of a storage element. In other words, the storage element according to an embodiment of the present invention has higher durability and reliability than a flash memory.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0076">Moreover, since a high electric field is unnecessary, a step-up circuit is unnecessary at least for the storage element. Therefore, a large-sized peripheral circuit is not necessary, and the frame of a storage device can be narrowed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0077">In the case where the dielectric constant εr<b>1</b> of the insulating layer included in C<b>1</b> is different from the dielectric constant εr<b>2</b> of the insulating layer included in C<b>2</b>, it is preferable that an area S<b>1</b> of C<b>1</b> be twice or less an area S<b>2</b> of C<b>2</b> (more preferably, the area S<b>1</b> is smaller than or equal to the area S<b>2</b>) and that C<b>2</b> be smaller than C<b>1</b>. Specifically, for example, as materials of the insulating layers, a stack of a layer formed with a high-k material such as hafnium oxide and a layer formed with an oxide semiconductor may be used for C<b>1</b> so that εr<b>1</b> is set to 10 or more (preferably, 15 or more), and a silicon oxide layer may be used for C<b>2</b> so that εr<b>2</b> is set to 3 to 4. Combination of such structures enables higher integration of the storage element according to an embodiment of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0078">Note that although an n-channel transistor in which electrons are majority carriers is used in the above description, a p-channel transistor in which holes are majority carriers can also be used instead of the n-channel transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0079">As described above, the storage element according to an embodiment of the present invention includes a nonvolatile storage element including a writing transistor where leakage current (off-state current) between a source and a drain is low in an off state; a reading transistor formed using a semiconductor material which is different from that of the writing transistor; and a capacitor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0080">The off-state current of the writing transistor is 100 zA or lower, preferably 10 zA or lower, or more preferably 1 zA or lower at a temperature in use (e.g., 25° C.). In the case of a transistor including silicon, it is difficult to achieve low off-state current as described above. However, with a transistor including an oxide semiconductor, low off-state current can be achieved. Therefore, a transistor including an oxide semiconductor is preferably used as the writing transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0081">Further, a transistor including an oxide semiconductor has a small subthreshold swing (S value), so that the switching rate can be sufficiently increased even if mobility is comparatively low. Therefore, with the use of the transistor as the writing transistor, rising of a writing pulse supplied to the portion FG can be extremely sharp.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0082">Note that since the off-state current of the writing transistor is low, the amount of charge retained in the portion FG can be reduced. Further, the data writing operation and the data erasing operation can be performed at high speed; therefore, rewriting of data can be performed at high speed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0083">As for the reading transistor, it is preferable to use a transistor which operates at high speed in order to increase the reading rate. For example, a transistor with a switching rate of 1 nano second or lower is preferably used as the reading transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0084">Data is written in such a manner that the writing transistor is turned on so that a voltage is applied to the portion FG, where the other of the source and drain electrodes of the writing transistor, one of the electrodes of the capacitor, and the gate electrode of the reading transistor are electrically connected to each other, and then the writing transistor is turned off so that the predetermined amount of charge is retained in the portion FG. Here, since the off-state current of the writing transistor is extremely low, the charge supplied to the portion FG is retained for a long time. When the off-state current is, for example, substantially 0, a refresh operation is not needed or, even in the case where a refresh operation is performed, the frequency of the refresh operation can be extremely low (for example, about once a month or a year). Accordingly, power consumption of a storage element can be reduced sufficiently.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0085">Note that in the storage element according to an embodiment of the present invention, data can be directly rewritten by another writing of data into the storage element. Therefore, an erasing operation which is necessary for a flash memory or the like is not needed, so that a reduction in operation speed due to the erasing operation can be prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0086">Note that the highest voltage applied to the storage element according to an embodiment of the present invention (the difference between the highest potential and the lowest potential applied to respective terminals of the storage element at the same time) can be 5 V or lower, preferably 3 V or lower in each storage element in the case where data of two stages (one bit) is written.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0087">The storage element according to an embodiment of the present invention may include at least a writing transistor, a reading transistor, and a capacitor, and the storage element can operate even when the area of the capacitor is small. Therefore, the storage capacity per unit area can be increased as compared to, for example, an SRAM which requires six transistors in each storage element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0088">Further, in the oxide semiconductor used for the storage element according to an embodiment of the present invention, the current-voltage characteristics of the storage element is not degraded even at, for example, a high temperature of 150° C. because the oxide semiconductor has a high energy gap of 3.0 eV to 3.5 eV and extremely few thermally excited carriers. In the transistor used for the storage element according to an embodiment of the present invention, there is no characteristic deterioration even at a high temperature of 150° C. and the off-state current is as extremely low as 100 zA or lower.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0095">Next, a writing operation and a reading operation of the storage device illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> will be described with reference to a timing chart illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0096">Although the operation of the storage device of two rows by two columns will be described for simplification, the present invention is not limited thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0097">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, S<b>1</b>(<b>1</b>) and S<b>1</b>(<b>2</b>) are potentials of the first signal line S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>(<b>1</b>) and S<b>2</b>(<b>2</b>) are potentials of the second signal line S<b>2</b>, BL(<b>1</b>) and BL(<b>2</b>) are potentials of the bit line BL, WL(<b>1</b>) and WL(<b>2</b>) are potentials of the word line WL, and SL(<b>1</b>) and SL(<b>2</b>) are potentials of the source line SL.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0098">First, the case in which data is written into the storage element <b>1100</b> (<b>1</b>,<b>1</b>) and the storage element <b>1100</b> (<b>1</b>,<b>2</b>) which are in the first row and data is read from the storage element <b>1100</b> (<b>1</b>,<b>1</b>) and the storage element <b>1100</b> (<b>1</b>,<b>2</b>) which are in the first row will be described. Note that in the following description, it is assumed that data to be written into the storage element <b>1100</b> (<b>1</b>,<b>1</b>) is “1” and data to be written into the storage element <b>1100</b> (<b>1</b>,<b>2</b>) is “0”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0099">First, the writing operation will be described. In a writing period of the first row, a potential VH is supplied to the second signal line S<b>2</b>(<b>1</b>) in the first row so that the second transistors in the first row are turned on. Further, a potential 0 V is supplied to the second signal line S<b>2</b>(<b>2</b>) in the second row so that the second transistors in the second row are turned off.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0100">Next, a potential V<b>2</b> and a potential 0 V are applied to the first signal line S<b>1</b>(<b>1</b>) in the first column and the first signal line S<b>1</b>(<b>2</b>) in the second column, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0101">As a result, the potential V<b>2</b> and the potential 0 V are applied to a portion FG of the storage element <b>1100</b> (<b>1</b>,<b>1</b>) and a portion FG of the storage element <b>1100</b> (<b>1</b>,<b>2</b>), respectively. Here, the potential V<b>2</b> is set higher than the threshold voltage of the first transistors. Then, the potential of the signal line S<b>2</b>(<b>1</b>) in the first row is set to 0 V so that the second transistors in the first row are turned off. Thus, the writing is terminated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0102">Note that the potentials of the word lines WL(<b>1</b>) and WL(<b>2</b>) are set to 0 V. Further, before the potential of the first signal line S<b>1</b>(<b>1</b>) in the first row is changed, the potential of the second signal line S<b>2</b>(<b>1</b>) in the first row is set to 0 V. The threshold voltage of a storage element into which data has been written is Vw<b>0</b> in the case of data “0” and Vw<b>1</b> in the case of data “1”, assuming that a terminal connected to the word line WL is a control gate electrode, the source electrode of the first transistor is a source electrode, and the drain electrode of the second transistor is a drain electrode, in the storage element.

Note that Vw<b>0</b>&gt;0&gt;Vw<b>1</b> is satisfied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0103">Next, the reading operation will be described. In a reading period in the first row, a potential 0 V and a potential VL are supplied to the word line WL(<b>1</b>) in the first row and the word line WL(<b>2</b>) in the second row, respectively. The potential VL is set lower than the threshold voltage of Vw<b>1</b>. When the potential WL(<b>1</b>) is set to 0 V, in the first row, the first transistor of the storage element <b>1100</b> (<b>1</b>,<b>2</b>) in which data “0” is stored is turned off, and the first transistor of the storage element <b>1100</b> (<b>1</b>,<b>1</b>) in which data “1” is stored is turned on. When the potential WL(<b>2</b>) is set to VL, in the second row, the second transistor is turned off even in the case of the storage elements <b>1100</b> in which either data “0” or data “1” is stored.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0104">Next, a potential 0 V is supplied to the source line SL(<b>1</b>) in the first column and the source line SL(<b>2</b>) in the second column.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0105">As a result, the first transistor of the storage element <b>1100</b> (<b>1</b>,<b>1</b>) between the bit line BL(<b>1</b>) and the source line SL(<b>1</b>) is on, thereby having a low resistance state, and the first transistor of the storage element <b>1100</b> (<b>1</b>,<b>2</b>) between the bit line BL(<b>2</b>) and the source line SL(<b>2</b>) is off, thereby having a high resistance state. A reading circuit connected to the bit line BL(<b>1</b>) and the bit line BL(<b>2</b>) can read data based on a difference in a resistance state between the bit lines.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0106">Further, a potential 0 V and a potential VL are supplied to the second signal line S<b>2</b>(<b>1</b>) and the second signal line S<b>2</b>(<b>2</b>), respectively, so that all the second transistors are turned off. The potential of the portion FG in the first row is 0 V or V<b>2</b>; thus, the potential of the second signal line S<b>2</b>(<b>1</b>) is set to 0 V, whereby all the second transistors in the first row can be turned off. On the other hand, the potential of the portion FG in the second row is lower than the potential at the time directly after data writing if the potential VL is supplied to the word line WL(<b>2</b>). Accordingly, in order to prevent the second transistor from being turned on, the potential of the second signal line S<b>2</b>(<b>2</b>) is set to a low potential similarly to the potential of the word line WL(<b>2</b>). Thus, all the second transistors can be turned off.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0107">As described above, a reading circuit is used for the reading operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0108"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates an example of the reading circuit.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0110"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> illustrates another example of the reading circuit.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0111">An output potential in the case where the reading circuit in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is used will be described. When the first transistor of the storage element <b>1100</b> (<b>1</b>, <b>1</b>) is on, the resistance between the bit line BL(<b>1</b>) and the source line SL(<b>1</b>) is low. Therefore, the input of a clocked inverter has a low potential, and an output D(<b>1</b>) is a signal High. On the other hand, since the resistance between the bit line BL(<b>2</b>) and the source line SL(<b>2</b>) is high, a high potential is supplied to the clocked inverter and an output D(<b>2</b>) is a signal Low.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0172">At the time of forming the oxide semiconductor layer <b>144</b>, for example, an object is held in a treatment chamber kept under reduced pressure and the object is heated to a temperature higher than or equal to 100° C. and lower than 550° C., preferably 200° C. to 400° C. inclusive. Alternatively, the temperature of the object at the time of forming the oxide semiconductor layer <b>144</b> may be room temperature. Then, a sputtering gas from which hydrogen, water, or the like is removed is introduced into the treatment chamber while moisture in the treatment chamber is removed, whereby the oxide semiconductor layer <b>144</b> is formed using the target described above. By forming the oxide semiconductor layer <b>144</b> while the object is heated, an impurity included in the oxide semiconductor layer <b>144</b> can be reduced. Moreover, damage due to sputtering can be reduced. In order to remove moisture in the treatment chamber, an entrapment vacuum pump is preferably used. For example, a cryopump, an ion pump, or a titanium sublimation pump can be used. A turbo pump provided with a cold trap may also be used. By evacuation with the cryopump or the like, hydrogen, water, or the like can be removed from the treatment chamber, so that the impurity concentration in the oxide semiconductor layer <b>144</b> can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0173">For example, the conditions for forming the oxide semiconductor layer <b>144</b> can be set as follows: the distance between the object and the target is 170 mm, the pressure is 0.4 Pa, the direct current (DC) power is 0.5 kW, and the atmosphere is an oxygen (oxygen: 100%) atmosphere, an argon (Ar) (argon (Ar): 100%) atmosphere, or a mixed atmosphere of oxygen and argon (Ar). Note that it is preferable to use a pulsed direct-current (DC) power source because generation of dust (such as powder substances formed at the time of the film formation) can be suppressed and the thickness distribution is uniform. The thickness of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>144</b> is 1 nm to 50 nm inclusive, preferably 1 nm to 30 nm inclusive, or more preferably 1 nm to 10 nm inclusive. Using the oxide semiconductor layer <b>144</b> with such a thickness can suppress a short-channel effect due to miniaturization. Note that the appropriate thickness of the oxide semiconductor layer differs depending on the oxide semiconductor material to be used, the intended purpose of a storage device, or the like; therefore, the thickness can also be determined in accordance with the material, the intended purpose, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0174">Note that before the oxide semiconductor layer <b>144</b> is formed with a sputtering method, a material attached to a surface on which the oxide semiconductor layer <b>144</b> is formed (e.g., a surface of the interlayer insulating layer <b>128</b>) is preferably removed by reverse sputtering in which an argon (Ar) gas is introduced and plasma is generated. Here, the reverse sputtering is a method with which ions collide with a surface to be processed so that the surface is modified, in contrast to a normal sputtering method with which ions collide with a sputtering target. A method for making ions collide to a surface to be treated includes a method in which high-frequency voltage is applied on the surface in an argon (Ar) atmosphere and plasma is generated in the vicinity of the object. Note that a nitrogen atmosphere, a helium atmosphere, or an oxygen atmosphere may be used instead of an argon (Ar) atmosphere.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0175">After that, heat treatment (first heat treatment) is preferably performed on the oxide semiconductor layer <b>144</b>. Excess hydrogen (including water and hydroxyl) in the oxide semiconductor layer <b>144</b> can be removed by the first heat treatment; thus, the structure of the oxide semiconductor layer can be improved and a defect level in an energy gap can be reduced. The first heat treatment is performed at a temperature higher than or equal to 300° C. and lower than 550° C., or a temperature at 400° C. to 500° C. inclusive, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0176">Note that the heat treatment can be performed in such a manner that, for example, an object is introduced into an electric furnace in which a resistance heating element or the like is used, and heated at 450° C. in a nitrogen atmosphere for 1 hour. The oxide semiconductor layer <b>144</b> is not exposed to the air during the heat treatment so that entry of water or hydrogen can be prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0177">The heat treatment apparatus is not limited to an electric furnace and the heat treatment apparatus can be an apparatus that heats an object with thermal conduction or thermal radiation given by a medium such as a heated gas. For example, an RTA (rapid thermal anneal) apparatus such as a GRTA (gas rapid thermal anneal) apparatus or an LRTA (lamp rapid thermal anneal) apparatus can be used as the heat treatment apparatus. An LRTA apparatus is an apparatus for heating an object by radiation of light (an electromagnetic wave) emitted from a lamp such as a halogen lamp, a metal halide lamp, a xenon arc lamp, a carbon arc lamp, a high-pressure sodium lamp, or a high-pressure mercury lamp. A GRTA apparatus is an apparatus for performing heat treatment using a high-temperature gas. An inert gas that does not react with an object by heat treatment, for example, nitrogen or a rare gas such as argon (Ar) is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0178">For example, as the first heat treatment, a GRTA process may be performed as follows. The object is put in an inert gas atmosphere which is heated, heated for several minutes, and taken out of the inert gas atmosphere. The GRTA process enables high-temperature heat treatment for a short time. Moreover, the GRTA process can be employed even when the temperature exceeds the upper temperature limit of the object. Note that the inert gas may be switched to a gas including oxygen during the process. This is because defect level in energy gap due to oxygen deficiency can be reduced by performing the first heat treatment in an atmosphere including oxygen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0179">Note that the inert gas atmosphere is preferably an atmosphere which contains nitrogen or a rare gas (such as helium (He), neon (Ne), or argon (Ar)) as its main component and does not contain water, hydrogen or the like. For example, the purity of nitrogen or a rare gas such as helium (He), neon (Ne), or argon (Ar) introduced into the heat treatment apparatus is set to 6N (99.9999%) or more, preferably 7N (99.99999%) or more (i.e., the impurity concentration is 1 ppm or less, preferably 0.1 ppm or less).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0180">In any case, the i-type (intrinsic) or substantially i-type oxide semiconductor layer <b>144</b> in which an impurity is reduced by the first heat treatment is formed, whereby a transistor having extremely excellent characteristics can be realized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0181">The above heat treatment (first heat treatment) has an effect of removing hydrogen, water, and the like and can be referred to as dehydration treatment, dehydrogenation treatment, or the like. The dehydration treatment or dehydrogenation treatment can be performed, for example, after the oxide semiconductor layer is formed, after the gate insulating layer is formed, or after the gate electrode is formed. Note that such dehydration treatment or dehydrogenation treatment may be performed once or plural times.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0182">The gate insulating layer <b>146</b> is preferably formed with a CVD method, a sputtering method, or the like as a single layer or stacked layers using a film containing any of silicon oxide, silicon oxynitride, silicon nitride oxide, silicon nitride, hafnium oxide, aluminum oxide, tantalum oxide, yttrium oxide, hafnium silicate, hafnium silicate to which nitrogen is added, hafnium aluminate to which nitrogen is added, and the like. In this step, the thickness of the insulating film is preferably 1 nm to 100 nm inclusive, more preferably 10 nm to 50 nm inclusive. Note that after the gate insulating layer <b>146</b> is formed, it is preferable to perform heat treatment (second heat treatment) in an inert gas atmosphere or an oxygen atmosphere.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0183">Note that the gate insulating layer <b>146</b> is preferably formed with a sputtering method. The gate insulating layer <b>146</b> is formed with a sputtering method, so that an impurity such as water or hydrogen can be prevented from being mixed into the oxide semiconductor layer <b>144</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0184">Next, over the gate insulating layer <b>146</b>, the gate electrode <b>148</b> <i>a </i>is formed in a region overlapping with a region of the transistor <b>162</b>, which serves as a channel formation region, and the electrode <b>148</b> <i>b </i>is formed in a region overlapping with the source or drain electrode <b>142</b> <i>a </i>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0185">The gate electrode <b>148</b> <i>a </i>and the electrode <b>148</b> <i>b </i>can be formed in such a manner that a conductive film is formed over the gate insulating layer <b>146</b> and then etched selectively.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0187">Note that the interlayer insulating layer <b>152</b> is preferably formed so as to have a planarized surface. This is because the formation of the interlayer insulating layer <b>152</b> which is performed to have a planarized surface makes it possible to form an electrode, a wiring, or the like preferably over the interlayer insulating layer <b>152</b> even in the case where, for example, the storage element is miniaturized. Note that the interlayer insulating layer <b>152</b> can be planarized with a method such as CMP (chemical mechanical polishing).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0188">Next, the interlayer insulating layer <b>125</b>, the interlayer insulating layer <b>126</b>, the interlayer insulating layer <b>128</b>, the oxide semiconductor layer <b>144</b>, the gate insulating layer <b>146</b>, the interlayer insulating layer <b>150</b>, and the interlayer insulating layer <b>152</b> are selectively etched so that an opening <b>151</b> that reaches the metal compound region <b>124</b> of the transistor <b>160</b> is formed (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>). As the etching, either dry etching or wet etching may be used, but dry etching is preferably employed in terms of microfabrication.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0189">Then, a conductive film is formed so as to fill the opening <b>151</b> and etched, so that the source or drain electrode <b>154</b> can be formed and thus the storage element illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> is completed. At the time of forming the conductive film, for example, a titanium film is formed to have a small thickness with a PVD method in a region including the opening and a titanium nitride film is then formed to have a small thickness with a CVD method; and then, a tungsten film is formed so as to be embedded in the opening. The titanium film formed with a PVD method has a function of reducing a surface of an oxide film (e.g., a native oxide film), on which the titanium film is formed, to decrease the contact resistance with the lower electrodes (e.g., the metal compound regions <b>124</b> in this step). The titanium nitride film formed after the formation of the titanium film has a barrier function of preventing diffusion of the conductive film. After the barrier film is formed using titanium, titanium nitride, or the like, a copper film may be formed by plating.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0190">Note that the storage elements illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> can also be formed through the above process in a manner similar to that of the storage elements illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0191">As described above, the storage device including the transistor <b>160</b>, the transistor <b>162</b>, and the capacitor <b>164</b> can be manufactured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0192">Note that an electrode, a wiring, an insulating layer, or the like may be formed as well after the above process. When the wiring has a multi-layer structure of a stacked structure including an interlayer insulating layer and a conductive layer, a highly integrated storage device can be provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0193">Note that the manufacturing method of the transistor <b>162</b> is not limited to the above process in an embodiment of the present invention.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0194">Next, a manufacturing method of an SOI substrate where a single crystal semiconductor layer is provided over a base substrate will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A to 13H</figref>; then, a manufacturing method of a transistor using the SOI substrate will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A to 14H</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0195">First, a base substrate <b>500</b> is prepared (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>). As the base substrate <b>500</b>, a substrate made of an insulator can be used. Specific examples thereof include a variety of glass substrates used in the electronics industry, such as substrates of aluminosilicate glass, aluminoborosilicate glass, and barium borosilicate glass; a quartz substrate; a ceramic substrate; and a sapphire substrate. Alternatively, a ceramic substrate which contains silicon nitride and aluminum oxide as its main components and whose thermal expansion coefficient is close to that of silicon may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0196">Note that a semiconductor substrate such as a single crystal silicon substrate or a single crystal germanium substrate may be used as the base substrate <b>500</b>. In the case where a semiconductor substrate is used as the base substrate <b>500</b>, an SOI substrate with high quality can be easily obtained because the temperature condition for heat treatment is eased as compared to the case where a glass substrate or the like is used. As a semiconductor substrate, a solar grade silicon (SOG-Si) substrate or the like may be used. Alternatively, a polycrystalline semiconductor substrate may be used. In the case where a SOG-Si substrate, a polycrystalline semiconductor substrate, or the like is used, manufacturing cost can be reduced as compared to the case where a single crystal silicon substrate or the like is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0197">Here, the case where a glass substrate is used as the base substrate <b>500</b> is described. When a glass substrate that can be manufactured in large sizes and is inexpensive is used as the base substrate <b>500</b>, cost reduction can be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0198">The surface of the base substrate <b>500</b> is preferably cleaned in advance. Specifically, the base substrate <b>500</b> may be subjected to ultrasonic cleaning with a hydrochloric acid/hydrogen peroxide mixture (HPM), a sulfuric acid/hydrogen peroxide mixture (SPM), an ammonium hydrogen peroxide mixture (APM), diluted hydrofluoric acid (DHF), FPM (a mixed solution of hydrofluoric acid, hydrogen peroxide water, and pure water), or the like. Through such cleaning treatment, the planarity of the surface of the base substrate <b>500</b> can be improved and abrasive particles remaining on the surface of the base substrate <b>500</b> can be removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0199">Next, a nitrogen-containing layer <b>502</b> (e.g., a layer including an insulating film containing nitrogen, such as a silicon nitride film) is formed on the surface of the base substrate <b>500</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>). The nitrogen-containing layer <b>502</b> can be formed with a CVD method, a sputtering method, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0200">The nitrogen-containing layer <b>502</b> formed in this step serves as a layer for bonding a single crystal semiconductor layer (as a bonding layer) in a later step. The nitrogen-containing layer <b>502</b> also functions as a barrier layer for preventing an impurity included in the base substrate, such as sodium (Na), from diffusing into the single crystal semiconductor layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0201">Since the nitrogen-containing layer <b>502</b> is used as the bonding layer, it is preferable that the nitrogen-containing layer <b>502</b> be formed to have a certain level of surface planarity. Specifically, the nitrogen-containing layer <b>502</b> is formed such that it has an average surface roughness (R<sub>a</sub>, which is also referred to as arithmetic mean deviation) of 0.5 nm or less and a root-mean-square surface roughness (R<sub>ms</sub>) of 0.60 nm or less, preferably an average surface roughness of 0.35 nm or less and a root-mean-square surface roughness of 0.45 nm or less. Note that for the above average surface roughness or root-mean-square roughness, for example, a value obtained by the measurement performed on a region of 10 μm×10 μm can be used. The thickness is in the range of 10 nm to 200 nm inclusive, preferably 50 nm to 100 nm inclusive. With the surface flatness improved as described above, the bonding defect of the single crystal semiconductor layer can be prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0202">Next, a bond substrate is prepared. In this step, a single crystal semiconductor substrate <b>510</b> is used as the bond substrate (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</figref>). Note that although a single crystal semiconductor substrate is used as the bond substrate, the bond substrate is not limited thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0203">For example, as the single crystal semiconductor substrate <b>510</b>, a single crystal semiconductor substrate formed using an element of Group 14, such as a single crystal silicon substrate, a single crystal germanium substrate, or a single crystal silicon germanium substrate, can be used. Alternatively, a compound semiconductor of gallium arsenide, indium phosphide, or the like may be used. Note that the single crystal semiconductor substrate <b>510</b> is not limited to a circular substrate and may be a substrate which has been processed into, for example, a rectangular shape. Further, the single crystal semiconductor substrate <b>510</b> can be formed with a Czochralski (CZ) method or a Floating Zone (FZ) method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0204">An oxide film <b>512</b> is formed on a surface of the single crystal semiconductor substrate <b>510</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13D</figref>). In view of removal of contamination, it is preferable that the surface of the single crystal semiconductor substrate <b>510</b> be cleaned with a hydrochloric acid/hydrogen peroxide mixture (HPM), a sulfuric acid/hydrogen peroxide mixture (SPM), an ammonium hydrogen peroxide mixture (APM), diluted hydrofluoric acid (DHF), FPM (a mixed solution of hydrofluoric acid, hydrogen peroxide water, and pure water), or the like before the oxide film <b>512</b> is formed. Dilute hydrofluoric acid and ozone water may be discharged alternately for cleaning.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0205">The oxide film <b>512</b> can be formed as a single layer or stacked layers using, for example, a silicon oxide film, a silicon oxynitride film, or the like. Examples of a formation method of the oxide film <b>512</b> include a thermal oxidation method, a CVD method, or a sputtering method. Note that in the case where the oxide film <b>512</b> is formed with a CVD method or the like, a silicon oxide film is preferably formed using organosilane such as tetraethoxysilane (abbreviation: TEOS) (chemical formula: Si(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>), so that favorable bonding can be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0206">In this step, the oxide film <b>512</b> (here, a silicon oxide film) is formed by performing thermal oxidation treatment on the single crystal semiconductor substrate <b>510</b>. The thermal oxidation treatment is preferably performed in an oxidizing atmosphere to which a halogen is added.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0207">For example, thermal oxidation treatment is subjected to the single crystal semiconductor substrate <b>510</b> in an oxidizing atmosphere to which chlorine is added, whereby the oxide film <b>512</b> which is oxidized by chlorine can be formed. In this case, the oxide film <b>512</b> is a film containing chlorine atoms. By such chlorine oxidation, heavy metal (e.g., iron (Fe), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), or molybdenum (Mo)) that is an extrinsic impurity is trapped and chloride of the metal is formed and then removed; thus, contamination of the single crystal semiconductor substrate <b>510</b> can be reduced. Moreover, after the bonding to the base substrate <b>500</b>, impurity from the base substrate, such as sodium (Na), can be fixed so that contamination of the single crystal semiconductor substrate <b>510</b> can be prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0208">Further, halogen atoms contained in the oxide film <b>512</b> are not limited to chlorine atoms. Fluorine atoms may be contained in the oxide film <b>512</b>. Examples of a method for fluorine oxidation of the surface of the single crystal semiconductor substrate <b>510</b> include a method in which the single crystal semiconductor substrate <b>510</b> is soaked in an HF solution and then subjected to thermal oxidation treatment in an oxidizing atmosphere and a method in which thermal oxidation treatment is performed in an oxidizing atmosphere to which NF<sub>3 </sub>is added.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0209">Next, ions are accelerated by an electric field, the single crystal semiconductor substrate <b>510</b> is irradiated with the ions, and the ions are added thereto, whereby an embrittlement region <b>514</b> where the crystal structure is damaged is formed at a predetermined depth of the single crystal semiconductor substrate <b>510</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13E</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0210">The depth at which the embrittlement region <b>514</b> is formed can be controlled by the kinetic energy, mass, charge, or incidence angle of the ions, or the like. The embrittlement region <b>514</b> is formed at approximately the same depth as the average penetration depth of the ions. Therefore, the thickness of a single crystal semiconductor layer to be separated from the single crystal semiconductor substrate <b>510</b> can be controlled by the depth at which the ions are added. For example, the average penetration depth of the ions may be adjusted such that the thickness of the single crystal semiconductor layer is 10 nm to 500 nm inclusive, preferably 50 nm to 200 nm inclusive.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0211">The ion irradiation treatment can be performed with an ion-doping apparatus or an ion-implantation apparatus. Examples of the ion-doping apparatus include a non-mass-separation type apparatus in which plasma excitation of a process gas is performed and an object to be processed is irradiated with all kinds of ion species generated. In this apparatus, the object to be processed is irradiated with ion species of plasma without mass separation. In contrast, the ion-implantation apparatus is a mass-separation type apparatus. In the ion-implantation apparatus, mass separation of ion species of plasma is performed and the object to be processed is irradiated with ion species having predetermined masses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0212">Next, an example is described in which an ion-doping apparatus is used to add hydrogen to the single crystal semiconductor substrate <b>510</b>. A gas containing hydrogen is used as a source gas. As for ions used for the irradiation, the proportion of H<sub>3</sub> <sup>+</sup> is preferably set high. Specifically, it is preferable that the proportion of H<sub>3</sub> <sup>+</sup> be set to 50% or higher (more preferably, 80% or higher) with respect to the total amount of H<sup>+</sup>, H<sub>2</sub> <sup>+</sup>, and H<sub>3</sub> <sup>+</sup>. With a high proportion of H<sub>3</sub> <sup>+</sup>, the efficiency of ion irradiation can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0213">Note that ions to be added are not limited to ions of hydrogen. Ions of helium (He) or the like may be added. Further, ions to be added are not limited to one kind of ions, and plural kinds of ions may be added. For example, in the case where irradiation with hydrogen and helium (He) is performed at the same time using an ion-doping apparatus, the number of steps can be reduced as compared to the case where irradiation of hydrogen and helium is performed in separate steps, and surface roughness of a single crystal semiconductor layer to be formed later can be suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0214">Note that there is a possibility that a heavy metal might be added to the single crystal semiconductor substrate <b>510</b> at the same time when the embrittlement region <b>514</b> is formed using the ion-doping apparatus; however, the ion irradiation is performed through the oxide film <b>512</b> containing halogen atoms, so that contamination of the single crystal semiconductor substrate <b>510</b> due to the heavy metal can be prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0215">Next, the base substrate <b>500</b> and the single crystal semiconductor substrate <b>510</b> are disposed to face each other and the surface of the nitrogen-containing layer <b>502</b> and the surface of the oxide film <b>512</b> are disposed in close contact with each other. The base substrate <b>500</b> and the single crystal semiconductor substrate <b>510</b> are bonded to each other in such a manner that the surface of the nitrogen-containing layer <b>502</b> and the surface of the oxide film <b>512</b> are disposed in close contact with each other as described above (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13F</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0216">When the base substrate <b>500</b> and the single crystal semiconductor substrate <b>510</b> are bonded to each other, it is preferable that a pressure of 0.001 N/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 100 N/cm<sup>2 </sup>inclusive, more preferably a pressure of 1 N/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 20 N/cm<sup>2 </sup>inclusive be applied to one part of the base substrate <b>500</b> or one part of the single crystal semiconductor substrate <b>510</b>. When the bonding surfaces are made close to each other and disposed in close contact with each other by applying a pressure in such a manner, a bonding between the nitrogen-containing layer <b>502</b> and the oxide film <b>512</b> is generated at the part where the close contact is made, and the bonding spontaneously spreads to almost the entire area. This bonding is performed under the action of the Van der Waals force or hydrogen bonding and can be performed at room temperature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0217">Note that before the single crystal semiconductor substrate <b>510</b> and the base substrate <b>500</b> are bonded to each other, surfaces to be bonded to each other are preferably subjected to surface treatment.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0218">As the surface treatment, wet treatment, dry treatment, or a combination of wet treatment and dry treatment can be used.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0219">Note that after the single crystal semiconductor substrate <b>510</b> and the base substrate <b>500</b> are bonded to each other, it is preferable to perform heat treatment for further strengthening a bond.

Alternatively, the nitrogen-containing layer <b>502</b> and the oxide film <b>512</b> may be bonded to each other while being heated at a temperature within this range. The thermal treatment can be performed using a heating furnace such as a diffusion furnace or a resistance heating furnace, a RTA (rapid thermal annealing) apparatus, a microwave heating apparatus, or the like.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0220">Next, heat treatment is performed for separation of the single crystal semiconductor substrate <b>510</b> at the embrittlement region, whereby a single crystal semiconductor layer <b>516</b> is formed over the base substrate <b>500</b> with the nitrogen-containing layer <b>502</b> and the oxide film <b>512</b> interposed therebetween (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13G</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0221">Note that the temperature for heat treatment at the time of the separation described above is preferably as low as possible.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0223">Next, a surface of the single crystal semiconductor layer <b>516</b> is irradiated with laser light, whereby a single crystal semiconductor layer <b>518</b> where the flatness of the surface planarity is improved and which has fewer defects is formed. Note that instead of the laser light irradiation treatment, heat treatment may be performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0224">Although the irradiation treatment with the laser light is performed in this step just after the heat treatment at the time of the separation of the single crystal semiconductor layer <b>516</b>, the present invention is not limited thereto. Etching treatment may be performed after the heat treatment at the time of the separation of the single crystal semiconductor layer <b>516</b> to remove a region where there are many defects on the surface of the single crystal semiconductor layer <b>516</b>, and then the laser light irradiation treatment may be performed. Alternatively, after the surface planarity of the single crystal semiconductor layer <b>516</b> is improved, the laser light irradiation treatment may be performed. Note that the etching treatment may be either wet etching or dry etching. Alternatively, a step of reducing the thickness of the single crystal semiconductor layer <b>516</b> may be performed after the laser light irradiation as described above. In order to reduce the thickness of the single crystal semiconductor layer <b>516</b>, any one of dry etching and wet etching or both of them may be employed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0225">Through the above steps, an SOI substrate having the single crystal semiconductor layer <b>518</b> with favorable characteristics can be obtained (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13H</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0226">Next, the manufacturing method of a transistor <b>570</b> including the SOI substrate described above will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A to 14H</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0227"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating part of an SOI substrate manufactured with the method which is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A to 13H</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0228">First, the single crystal semiconductor layer <b>518</b> is processed into an island shape so that a semiconductor layer <b>520</b> is formed (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>). Note that before or after this step, an impurity element imparting n-type conductivity or an impurity element imparting p-type conductivity may be added to the semiconductor layer in order to control the threshold voltage of the transistor. In the case where the semiconductor is silicon, phosphorus (P), arsenic (As), or the like can be used as the impurity element imparting n-type conductivity. Boron (B), aluminum (Al), gallium (Ga), or the like can be used as the impurity element imparting p-type conductivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0229">Next, an insulating layer <b>522</b> is formed to cover the semiconductor layer <b>520</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref>). The insulating layer <b>522</b> is to be a gate insulating layer later. In this step, a single layer of a silicon oxide film is formed with a plasma CVD method. The material and the formation method of the insulating layer <b>522</b> are not particularly limited.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0230">Next, after a conductive film is formed over the insulating layer <b>522</b>, the conductive layer is selectively etched so that a gate electrode <b>524</b> is formed above the semiconductor layer <b>520</b> so as to overlap with each other (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14D</figref>). The material and the formation method of the gate electrode <b>524</b> are not particularly limited.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0231">Next, impurity regions <b>526</b> are formed by adding an impurity element imparting one conductivity type to the semiconductor layer <b>520</b>, using the gate electrode <b>524</b> as a mask (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14E</figref>). Note that although phosphorus or arsenic is added in this step in order to form an n-channel transistor, another impurity element such as boron or aluminum may be added in the case where a p-channel transistor is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0232">Next, sidewall insulating layers <b>528</b> are formed on side surfaces of the gate electrode <b>524</b>. The sidewall insulating layers <b>528</b> can be formed in a self-aligned manner in such a manner that an insulating layer is formed to cover the insulating layer <b>522</b> and the gate electrode <b>524</b> and then highly anisotropic etching is performed on the insulating layer. Note that at this time, it is preferable to expose the impurity regions <b>526</b> together with the formation of the gate insulating layer <b>522</b> <i>a </i>by partly etching the insulating layer <b>522</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0233">Next, an impurity element imparting one conductivity type is added to the impurity regions <b>526</b>, using the gate electrode <b>524</b> and the sidewall insulating layers <b>528</b> as masks. Note that the impurity element added to the impurity regions <b>526</b> is an impurity element imparting the same conductivity type as the impurity element added in the previous step (i.e., the impurity element already contained in the impurity regions <b>526</b>). In addition, the concentration of the impurity element added to the impurity regions <b>526</b> is higher than that of the impurity element in the previous step. By the addition of the impurity element, a pair of high-concentration impurity regions <b>530</b>, a pair of low-concentration impurity regions <b>532</b>, and a channel formation region <b>534</b> are formed in the semiconductor layer <b>520</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14G</figref>). The high-concentration impurity regions <b>530</b> each function as a source or drain region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0234">Note that in the case where the semiconductor layer <b>520</b> is formed using a material containing silicon, a silicide region may be formed by forming silicide in part of the semiconductor layer <b>520</b> in order to further reduce the resistance of the source region and the drain region. The siliciding is performed in such a manner that metal is brought into contact with the semiconductor layer, and silicon in the semiconductor layer is made to react with the metal by heat treatment (e.g., a GRTA method or an LRTA method). For the silicide region, a cobalt silicide region or a nickel silicide region may be formed. In the case where the semiconductor layer <b>520</b> is thin, silicide reaction may proceed to a bottom of the semiconductor layer <b>520</b>. Examples of a metal material used for forming silicide include titanium (Ti), nickel (Ni), tungsten (W), molybdenum (Mo), cobalt (Co), zirconium (Zr), hafnium (Hf), tantalum (Ta), vanadium (V), neodymium (Nd), chromium (Cr), platinum (Pt), and palladium (Pd). Note that a silicide region can also be formed by laser light irradiation as the heat treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0235">Next, an interlayer insulating layer <b>536</b> and an interlayer insulating layer <b>538</b> are formed so as to cover the components formed in the above steps (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14H</figref>). The interlayer insulating layer <b>536</b> and the interlayer insulating layer <b>538</b> can be formed using a material containing an inorganic insulating material such as silicon oxide, silicon oxynitride, silicon nitride oxide, silicon nitride, hafnium oxide, aluminum oxide, or tantalum oxide. Alternatively, an organic insulating material such as polyimide or acrylic can be used. Note that although a stacked structure of the interlayer insulating layer <b>536</b> and the interlayer insulating layer <b>538</b> is employed in this step, the present invention is not limited thereto. Either the interlayer insulating layer <b>536</b> or the interlayer insulating layer <b>538</b> is not necessarily formed, or a plurality of another layers may be further stacked. Note that after the interlayer insulating layer <b>538</b> is formed, a surface of the interlayer insulating layer <b>538</b> is preferably planarized by CMP, etching treatment, or the like. By the CMP or etching treatment, a surface of the gate electrode <b>524</b> is exposed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0236">Alternatively, an electrode electrically connected to the gate electrode <b>524</b> may be formed in such a manner that part of the interlayer insulating layer <b>536</b> and the interlayer insulating layer <b>538</b> are etched so that the gate electrode <b>524</b> is exposed and then a conductive film is formed in the opening.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0237">As described above, the transistor <b>570</b> including the SOI substrate is formed (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14H</figref>). The transistor <b>570</b> can operate at high speed; therefore, a logic circuit (also referred to as an arithmetic circuit) or the like can be formed using the transistor. In other words, the transistor can be used for a driver circuit of a storage device or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0238">Note that an electrode, a wiring, an insulating layer, or the like may be formed as well after the above process. When the wirings has a multi-layer structure of a stacked structure including an interlayer insulating layer and a conductive layer, a highly integrated storage device can be provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0239">With the SOI substrate provided with the transistor <b>570</b>, a storage element can be formed as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> as well as <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> or the like.</div>
