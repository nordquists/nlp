<heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">The present invention relates to light-emitting devices, backlight units, liquid crystal display apparatuses, and lighting apparatuses, and particularly relates to a light-emitting device and the like that use a semiconductor light-emitting element.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">Semiconductor light-emitting elements such as a Light Emitting Diode (LED) have been widely used in recent years as a highly efficient and space saving light source, and are, for example, used as a backlight source in liquid crystal display apparatuses such as a liquid crystal display television or an illumination light source in lighting apparatuses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The LED used in backlight sources and illumination light sources are configured as a light-emitting device (light-emitting module). The light-emitting device is configured by sealing with a resin an LED that is disposed on a board. For example, an edge-lit backlight unit employs a light-emitting device that includes a plurality of LEDs that are arranged on a board in a one-dimensional row.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Such light-emitting device is often used as a white light source. For example, Patent Literature (PTL) 1 discloses a light-emitting device that emits white light by exciting yellow phosphors using a blue LED.</div>

<heading>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<heading>Technical Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Here, in recent years, a light-emitting device using an LED has been mounted on a board in an attempt to develop LED light sources that replace conventional light sources such as a linear fluorescent lamp and a backlight.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">The light-emitting devices that are incorporated into such light sources use Surface Mount Device (SMD) type LED, Chip On Board (COB) type LED, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">An SMD type light-emitting device is a package type light-emitting device. Namely, an LED chip is mounted in a cavity formed by a resin or the like, and the inside of the cavity is sealed with a phosphor-containing resin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">On the other hand, in a COB type light-emitting device, an LED itself (bare chip) is directly mounted on a board. The bare chip and a line pattern on the board are wire-bonded, and the bare chip is sealed with the phosphor-containing resin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">Compared with the SMD type light-emitting device, the COB type light-emitting device is superior in terms of cost and luminous efficacy. Thus, development of alternative light source using the COB type light-emitting device is much anticipated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">An example of the COB type light-emitting device is described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> is an external perspective view of the example of the COB type light-emitting device. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> is a partial enlarged plan view of the example of the light-emitting device shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref> is a partial enlarged cross-sectional view of the example of the light-emitting device taken along a line X-Xâ€² in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, a light-emitting device <b>700</b> includes a board <b>710</b> and a plurality of light-emitting parts <b>720</b> that are arranged linearly on the board <b>710</b>. Furthermore, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>, each of the light-emitting parts <b>720</b> of the light-emitting device <b>700</b> includes: a LED chip <b>721</b> mounted on the board <b>710</b>; and a dome-shaped phosphor-containing resin <b>722</b> (phosphor layer) which is for sealing the LED chip <b>721</b>. Further, the light-emitting device <b>700</b> includes: a metal line <b>740</b> patterned on the board <b>710</b>; and a wire <b>760</b> which connects the metal line <b>740</b> and electrodes of the LED chip <b>721</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">In the phosphor-containing resin <b>722</b>, predetermined phosphor particles are dispersed. The phosphor particles convert the color of light emitted by the LED chip <b>721</b> and thus light of a desired color is emitted from the light-emitting device. For example, when a blue LED chip that emits blue light is used as the LED chip <b>721</b> with yellow phosphor particles as the phosphor particles, the yellow phosphor particles are excited by the blue light of the blue LED chip and thus emit yellow light. The combination of the yellow light and the blue light of the blue LED chip results in an emission of white light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">However, the light-emitting device <b>700</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref> includes the light-emitting parts <b>720</b> and non-light-emitting parts that are other than the light-emitting parts. This results in problems such as giving a grainy texture (less attractive appearance) and an occurrence of color unevenness and luminance unevenness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">The present invention has been conceived to solve the aforementioned problems and has as an object to provide the light-emitting device and the like which can reduce grainy texture and suppress color unevenness and luminance unevenness.</div>
<heading>Solution to Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">In order to solve the problems described above, a light-emitting device according to an aspect of the present invention includes a board; a plurality of light-emitting parts each of which includes (i) a semiconductor light-emitting element mounted on the board and (ii) a wavelength conversion layer including a light wavelength converter and covering the semiconductor light-emitting element; and a light-guiding member provided on the board, between the light-emitting parts which are adjacent to each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">As described, the light-guiding member is provided between the light-emitting parts which are adjacent to each other. Thus, the light from the light-emitting part can be guided to the light-guiding member. This allows the light-guiding member that is provided between the light-emitting parts to emit light, in addition to the light emitted from the light-emitting part. A light emitting region can be thus expanded in appearance. Therefore, it is possible to reduce grainy texture, suppress color unevenness and luminance unevenness, and improve luminance uniformity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">Further, in the light-emitting device according to an aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that the light-guiding member be adjacent to the wavelength conversion layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">With this, the light from the light-emitting part can be guided to the light-guiding member easily</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">Further, in the light-emitting device according to an aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that the light-guiding member be formed to cover part of the wavelength conversion layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">With this, light is guided, from the portion of the wavelength conversion layer covered by the light-guiding member, to the light-guiding member. This increases the light emitting region. From the portion of the wavelength conversion layer not covered by the light-guiding member, light is directly emitted from the wavelength conversion layer without passing through the light-guiding member. Therefore, the light emitting region can be expanded without decreasing the amount of light extracted in the light-emitting part. Further, side portions of the wavelength conversion layer are covered by the light-guiding member. In this way, it is possible to form the light-guiding member on a portion having a long optical path length, and thus the color unevenness (color separation) can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">Further, in the light-emitting device according to an aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that at least an end portion of the light-guiding member on a side of the semiconductor light-emitting element be on a side of the semiconductor light-emitting element with respect to a normal that extends from an intersection between the board and one of (i) an outline of the light-emitting part and (ii) an extension of the outline.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">With this, an appropriate balance in an amount of light is achieved between the light directly emitted from the light-emitting part and the light emitted through the light-guiding member, and thus luminance uniformity can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">Further, in the light-emitting device according to an aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that the light-guiding member connect the light-emitting parts which are adjacent to each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">With this, a continuous light emitting region can be formed without a gap between the light-emitting parts. Therefore, it is possible to further reduce grainy texture, suppress color unevenness and luminance unevenness, making it possible to further improve luminance uniformity in the elongated direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">Further, in the light-emitting device according to an aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that the light-guiding member have a function of diffusing light that is guided in the light-guiding member.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">With this, the light which is emitted from the light-emitting part and propagates through the light-guiding member is redirected such that the light travels toward a light extraction surface. Therefore, it is possible to improve the light extraction efficiency in the light-guiding member.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">Further, in the light-emitting device according to an aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that the light-guiding member include a diffusion material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">With this, the light can be redirected easily with the diffusion material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">Further, in the light-emitting device according to an aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that density of the diffusion material in the light-guiding member be higher as a distance from the semiconductor light-emitting element is greater.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">With this, it is possible to improve the luminance uniformity in the light-guiding member.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">Further, in the light-emitting device according to an aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that n<b>1</b>â‰¦n<b>2</b> be satisfied, when a refractive index of the wavelength conversion layer is denoted by n<b>1</b> and a refractive index of the light-guiding member is denoted by n<b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">This allows the light of the light-emitting part to enter the light-guiding member easily.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">Further, in the light-emitting device according to an aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that the light-guiding member be a transparent resin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">With this, the light from the light-emitting part can be propagated in the light-guiding member, without decreasing the light extraction efficiency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">Further, in the light-emitting device according to an aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that the wavelength conversion layer be a phosphor layer including a phosphor which is excited by light of the semiconductor light-emitting element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">With this, the phosphor in the phosphor layer can be excited by the light of the semiconductor light-emitting element. Thus, it is possible to emit light of which wavelength is converted by the phosphor and light of which wavelength is not converted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">Further, in the light-emitting device according to an aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that the wavelength conversion layer be dome-shaped.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">With this, it is possible to configure the light-emitting part having a superior light distribution property.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">Further, in the light-emitting device according to an aspect of the present invention, it is preferable that the board be elongated, and the light-emitting parts and the light-guiding member be arranged linearly in a row along a longer direction of the board.</div>

A YAG (yttrium, aluminum, garnet) based phosphor material can be used as the yellow phosphor particles. Furthermore, the binder of the phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b> is not limited to a resin. For example, a transparent member such as glass, which is known to be used to seal a chip, may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0086">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, it is preferable that the shape of the phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b> be a substantially hemispherical dome shape that is upwardly convex. The dome-shaped phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b> described above does not regulate the light emitted from the LED chip <b>21</b>. Thus, superior light distribution property of 90 degrees can be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0087">Furthermore, when the substantially hemispherical dome shape is adopted as the shape of the phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b>, it is preferable that a radius of curvature R (mm) of the outermost surface of the phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b> satisfy the relation of 0.2 [1/mm]â‰¦1/Râ‰¦2.0 [1/mm] so that the light distribution property can be improved. In this embodiment, the radius of curvature R is a value defined by the cross-section in the short direction of the board <b>10</b> on which the LED chip <b>21</b> is mounted. However, the shape of the phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b> is not particularly restricted in the present invention. The shape of the outermost surface may be parabolic. Note that the phosphor-containing resin (phosphor layer) of an SMD type light-emitting device has a planer surface, and thus the light distribution property is not so high and is, for example, about 80 degrees.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0088">The method for forming the phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b> is not particularly restricted. Any methods that can cover the LED chip <b>21</b> with a sealing material such as a resin or glass may be used. Specific examples for the forming include: potting; dispensing; and molding by injecting the sealing material into a predetermined mold. Here, when the potting is adopted to form the phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b>, it is preferable that the phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b> be made up of a material having high thixotropy. This makes it easy to form the dome-shaped phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b> upwardly (on a side of upper surface of the board) by the potting utilizing surface tension.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0089">&lt;Light-Emitting Member&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0090">The light emitted from the light-emitting part <b>20</b> propagates through a light-guiding member <b>30</b>. The light-guiding member <b>30</b> guides the light to another light-emitting part <b>20</b> in proximity so that light is connected, and thus works as a bypass of light. The light-guiding member <b>30</b> in this embodiment is in a substantially hemispherical dome shape that is upwardly convex. The light-guiding members <b>30</b> are arranged linearly in a row (one-dimensionally) along the longer direction of the board <b>10</b> in non-light-emitting parts between the light-emitting parts <b>20</b> which are adjacent to each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0091">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the light-guiding members <b>30</b> cover the both sides of the phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b> in the longer direction of the board <b>10</b>. The light-guiding member <b>30</b> is formed from a part of the side portion of the phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b> to cover a portion of a metal line <b>40</b> and a portion of a resist <b>80</b>. It is preferable that the light-guiding member <b>30</b> be configured not to cover the vicinity of the top of the phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b>. Covering the top of the phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b> by the light-guiding member <b>30</b> can result in reduced light extraction efficiency due to loss of light emitted from the top side. In this regard, when the light-guiding member <b>30</b> is formed from a part of the side portion of the phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b> to cover a portion of the metal line <b>40</b> and a portion of the resist <b>80</b>, the light-guiding member <b>30</b> works as a bypass for the light emitted through the phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b>. Thus, light is guided to the light-guiding member <b>30</b> from the region of the phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b> covered by the light-guiding member <b>30</b>, and thus the light emitting region can be expanded.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0092">Furthermore, when a region not covered by the light-guiding member <b>30</b> is provided on the top of the phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b> as described above, light can be directly emitted from the light-emitting part <b>20</b> through the non-covered region without passing through the light-guiding member <b>30</b>. Therefore, the light emitting region can be expanded without decreasing the amount of light extracted in the light-emitting part <b>20</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0093">Methods for forming the light-guiding member <b>30</b> are not particularly restricted. The same methods as the method for forming the phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b> described above may be adopted. With an object to improve the light extraction efficiency by the light-guiding member <b>30</b>, it is preferable that the potting be adopted. In this way, it is possible to easily form the light-guiding member <b>30</b> having an overall shape that is upwardly convex, substantially hemispherical dome shape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0094">A transparent resin that is a translucent material made of silicone resin and the like can be used as the light-guiding member <b>30</b>. Note that a material other than the transparent resin can be used as a material of the light-guiding member <b>30</b>. For example, glass, which is known to be used to seal a chip, can be used. Furthermore, considering the combination with the sealing material which is for covering the LED chip <b>21</b>, the light-guiding member <b>30</b> may be formed of a material different from the material of the sealing material. However, with an object to reduce the grainy texture, it is preferable that the light-guiding member <b>30</b> be made of a material that is of the same type as the material of the sealing material. In this way, an interface where materials overlap is not clearly created and light reflection on the interface can be suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0095">&lt;Non-Light-Emitting Part&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0096">In the present invention, non-light-emitting parts in the light-emitting device <b>100</b> are a non-light emitting region other than the light-emitting parts <b>20</b>. Each of the non-light-emitting part includes the metal line <b>40</b> and the like. The metal line <b>40</b> is a line pattern that is patterned such that a plurality of the LED chips <b>21</b> can be connected in series on insulating film <b>11</b> formed on the board <b>10</b>. The metal line <b>40</b> and the LED chip <b>21</b> are electrically connected through a wire <b>60</b>. Thus, the LED chips <b>21</b> are connected in series.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0097">&lt;LED Chip&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0098">The LED chip <b>21</b> is mounted on an end portion of the metal line <b>40</b> on the board <b>10</b>. The LED chip <b>21</b> is a semiconductor light-emitting element according to the present invention and is a bare chip that emits monochromatic visible light in this embodiment. The LED chip <b>21</b> is die bonded by a die attach material <b>70</b> (die bond material) formed on the metal line <b>40</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0099">In this embodiment, a blue LED chip that emits blue light is used as the LED chip <b>21</b>. For example, a gallium nitride-based semiconductor light-emitting element having a center wavelength from 450 nm to 470 nm which is made of an InGaN-based material can be used as the blue LED chip. Note that the LED chip <b>21</b> in this embodiment is a chip that emits light in all directions, that is, to the sides, up, and down. For example, 20% of the total amount of light is emitted to the sides, 60% of the total amount of light is emitted upward, and 20% of the total amount of light is emitted downward.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0100">&lt;Others&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0101">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, both a p-side electrode <b>21</b> <i>a </i>and an n-side electrode <b>21</b> <i>b </i>of the LED chip <b>21</b> are formed on the upper side of the LED chip <b>21</b> in this embodiment. The p-side electrode <b>21</b> <i>a </i>and the n-side electrode <b>21</b> <i>b </i>are electrically connected to the wire <b>60</b> by the metal line <b>40</b> and wire bonding. For example, a gold wire can be used as the wire <b>60</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0102">Furthermore, although not illustrated, power terminals are provided on the board <b>10</b> to supply power to the metal line <b>40</b>. The LED chip <b>21</b> is powered through the metal line <b>40</b> and the wire <b>60</b> as power is supplied from an external power source to the power terminal. With this, an active layer of the LED chip <b>21</b> emits light and desired light is emitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0103">Next, the light-emitting device <b>100</b> according to this embodiment is further described in detail with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0104">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in this embodiment, it is preferable that 0&lt;h<b>2</b>/h<b>1</b>â‰¦1 be satisfied, when the height of the phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b> (light-emitting part) is denoted by h<b>1</b> and the height of the light-guiding member <b>30</b> is denoted by h<b>2</b>. With this, the light which exits the light-emitting part <b>20</b> incidents on the light-guiding member <b>30</b>, and a light-emitting area in appearance increases. Thus, contrast with an adjacent light-emitting part <b>20</b> decreases. As a result, grainy texture in the longer direction is suppressed and luminance uniformity is improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0105">Furthermore, it is preferable that at least an end portion of the light-guiding member <b>30</b> on the side of the LED chip <b>21</b> be on the side of the LED chip <b>21</b> with respect to a normal VL that extends from (i) an intersection between the board <b>10</b> and the outline of the light-emitting part <b>20</b> or (ii) an intersection between the board <b>10</b> and an extension of the outline. The phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b> is not in contact with the board <b>10</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Thus, the normal VL is a vertical line with respect to the board <b>10</b> on the intersection between the board <b>10</b> and a curve line that is obtained by extending an outline of the phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b> toward the board <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0106">With this configuration, an appropriate balance in an amount of light is achieved between the light directly emitted from the light-emitting part <b>20</b> and the light emitted through the light-guiding member <b>30</b>, and thus luminance uniformity can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0107">Furthermore, the phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b> is scaled down to reduce optical losses in the phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b> in this embodiment. With this, the wire <b>60</b> is exposed from the phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In this embodiment, the wire <b>60</b> exposed from the phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b> is covered by the light-guiding member <b>30</b> and is buried in the light-guiding member <b>30</b>. Therefore, the wire <b>60</b> can be protected by the light-guiding member <b>30</b>. In other words, this embodiment provides a configuration which allows for high light extraction efficiency and the protection of the wire. Note that cost-cutting can be achieved because the amount of the phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b> used can be reduced by scaling down the phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0108">The thus described light-guiding member <b>30</b> can be formed by sealing the LED chip <b>21</b> with the phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b> and then potting a material of the light-guiding member <b>30</b> from above the side portion of the phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0109">Note that a metal base board made of aluminum is used as the board <b>10</b> in this embodiment. Furthermore, an insulating film made of an organic material such as polyimide is used as the insulating film <b>11</b>. The resist <b>80</b> is formed on the board <b>10</b> to allow light to be reflected toward the upper surface (light extraction surface) and is made of a white resin. The metal line <b>40</b> is made of thin film copper (Cu). The surface of the metal line <b>40</b> is plated. In this embodiment, the surface of the metal line <b>40</b> is covered by plating <b>41</b> including silver (Ag) or gold (Au).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0110">As described, the light-emitting device <b>100</b> according to this embodiment includes the light-guiding member <b>30</b>. Thus, it is possible to guide the light from the light-emitting part <b>20</b> to the light-guiding member <b>30</b> and allow the light to propagate in the light-guiding member <b>30</b>. Thus, the white light emitted to the outside from the light-emitting device <b>100</b> consists of the white light that the light-emitting part <b>20</b> emits to the outside directly and the white light that the light-emitting part <b>20</b> emits to the outside via the light-guiding member <b>30</b>. Therefore, the light emitting region in appearance in the light-emitting device can be expended to include the light-guiding member <b>30</b> in addition to the light-emitting part <b>20</b>. As a result, it is possible to reduce the grainy texture and suppress the color unevenness and the luminance unevenness. Particularly, when the light-emitting part <b>20</b> and the light-guiding member <b>30</b> are formed along the elongated direction of the board <b>10</b>, the color unevenness and the luminance unevenness in the elongated direction can be suppressed and the luminance uniformity in the elongated direction can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0111">Here, suppression of the grainy texture on the light-emitting device <b>100</b> according to this embodiment is described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is a photograph of an external appearance of the light-emitting device, which is emitting light, according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> is a photograph of an external appearance of a light-emitting device <b>700</b>, which is emitting light, according to a comparative example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0112"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows that the light-emitting device <b>100</b> according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention emits white light from the light-emitting part <b>20</b> and the light-guiding member <b>30</b>. In contrast, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the light-emitting device <b>700</b> according to the comparative example emits white light only from the light-emitting part <b>720</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0113">Comparison between <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows that the light emitting region of the light-emitting device <b>100</b> according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is larger than the light emitting region of the light-emitting device <b>700</b> according to the comparative example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. Furthermore, it is shown that the non-light emitting region, which is the non-light-emitting part (other than the light-emitting part <b>720</b>) of the light-emitting device <b>700</b> according to the comparative example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, is turned into the light emitting region in the light-emitting device <b>100</b> according to Embodiment 1 of the present invention shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. With this, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> according to the comparative example, the light-emitting part <b>20</b> and the non-light-emitting part are alternated in the longer direction of the board, giving the grainy texture. In contrast, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> according to the present invention, the region between the light-emitting parts <b>20</b> which are adjacent to each other, which was the non-light-emitting part, is turned into the light emitting region. Since the light emitting regions are continuously present in the longer direction of the board, the grainy texture is suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0114">Note that, referring back to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, it is preferable that 0â‰¦D<b>1</b>/L<b>1</b>â‰¦L<b>1</b>/2n be satisfied, when the distance between the light-guiding members <b>30</b> which are adjacent to each other in the non-light-emitting part is denoted by D<b>1</b>, the number of the LED chips <b>21</b> mounted on the board <b>10</b> is denoted by n, and the longer direction of the board is denoted by L<b>1</b>. With this, grainy texture can be further reduced. On the other hand, when it is assumed that n LED chips are mounted at even intervals on the mounting board (length L<b>1</b> in the longer direction), the distance D<b>1</b> between the adjacent light-guiding members <b>30</b> is greater than the light-emitting part <b>20</b>, when D<b>1</b>/L<b>1</b> exceeds L<b>1</b>/2n. As a result, an effect in reducing the grainy texture is small. Further, a trouble may occur, that is, white light incidents on the adjacent phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b> and re-excite the phosphor to cause a color shift from the desired luminescent color.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0115">Furthermore, according to the configuration in this embodiment, the light-guiding member <b>30</b> covers part of the phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b> and is in contact with the light-emitting part <b>20</b> (the phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b>). However, the present invention is not limited to this. For example, the light-guiding member <b>30</b> may be provided in the non-light-emitting part between the adjacent light-emitting parts <b>20</b> so as not to be in contact with the light-emitting part <b>20</b>. For example, the light-emitting parts <b>20</b> and the light-guiding members <b>30</b> may be alternately provided along the longer direction of the board <b>10</b> with a space apart from one another. Such arrangement of the light-guiding member <b>30</b> also allows the light emitted from the light-emitting part <b>20</b> to be guided to the light-guiding member <b>30</b>. With this, the region other than the light-emitting part <b>20</b> can be turned into the light emitting region, and the grainy texture can be reduced. Note that it is preferable in this case that both end surfaces of the light-guiding member <b>30</b> on the side of the light-emitting part <b>20</b> be arranged to face the light-emitting part <b>20</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0116">However, when the light-guiding member <b>30</b> is configured according to this embodiment, that is, the light-guiding member <b>30</b> covers part of the phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b> and is in contact with the light-emitting part <b>20</b> (the phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b>), it is easier for the light that exits the light-emitting part <b>20</b> to incident on the light-guiding member <b>30</b>. As the light-emitting area in appearance is expanded, the contrast with the adjacent light-emitting part <b>20</b> can be decreased. As a result, the grainy texture can be reduced effectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0117">Furthermore, according to the configuration of this embodiment, the light-emitting part <b>20</b> and the light-guiding member <b>30</b> are alternately arranged along the longer direction of the board <b>10</b> in a manner such that the portions opposing each other is in contact with each other. Compared with the arrangement where the light-emitting part <b>20</b> and the light-guiding member <b>30</b> are arranged with a space apart from each other, this configuration allows the light from the light-emitting part <b>20</b> to be guided to the light-guiding member <b>30</b> easily. Thus, optical losses between the light-emitting part <b>20</b> and the light-guiding member <b>30</b> can be suppressed. Furthermore, the light which exits the light-emitting part <b>20</b> is guided into the light-guiding member <b>30</b> to be connected in the longer direction of the board <b>10</b> through the portion where the light-emitting part <b>20</b> and the light-guiding member <b>30</b> are in contact with each other. As a result, the light emitting region can be expanded and light-emission luminance can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0118">In the light-emitting device <b>100</b> according to this embodiment, the light-emitting part <b>20</b> and the light-guiding member <b>30</b> are not simply in contact with each other. Only side portions of the phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b>, which is formed to have a dome shape, are covered by the light-guiding member <b>30</b>. Thus, the light-guiding member <b>30</b> is formed on a portion where the optical path length is long in the phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b>. Thus, the color unevenness (color separation) can be reduced.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0122">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, a light-guiding member <b>230</b> in the light-emitting device <b>200</b> according to Embodiment 2 of the present invention is formed to connect the light-emitting parts <b>20</b> which are adjacent to each other. In this embodiment, the distance between the adjacent light-emitting parts <b>20</b> is greater than the length of each of the light-emitting parts <b>20</b> in the longer direction of the board.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0130">Thus, by adding the diffusion material to the light-guiding member <b>330</b>, white light from the light-emitting part <b>20</b> propagating in the light-guiding member <b>330</b> can be redirected by the diffusion material contained in the light-guiding member <b>330</b>. Thus, the white light propagating in the light-guiding member <b>330</b> can be diffused such that the white light travels toward the upper surface (light extraction surface).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0131">With this, it is possible to cause the white light of the light-emitting part <b>20</b> to travel (i) in the horizontal direction of the board <b>10</b> by the light guide effect of the light-guiding member <b>330</b> and (ii) radially toward the front surface (light extraction surface) by the diffusion effect of the light-guiding member <b>330</b>. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the grainy texture by expanding the light emitting region in appearance, and improve light extraction efficiency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0132">Furthermore, the basic configuration of the light-emitting device <b>300</b>A according to another example in Embodiment 3 of the present invention shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> is the same as the light-emitting device according to Embodiment 2 of the present invention. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> corresponds to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0134">A light-guiding member <b>330</b>A in the light-emitting device <b>300</b>A according to another example in Embodiment 3 of the present invention contains the diffusion material.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0135">Thus, by adding the diffusion material to the light-guiding member <b>330</b>A, the white light from the light-emitting part <b>20</b> propagating in the light-guiding member <b>330</b>A can be redirected by the diffusion material contained in the light-guiding member <b>330</b>A.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0136">With this, it is possible to cause the white light of the light-emitting part <b>20</b> to travel (i) in the horizontal direction of the board <b>10</b> by the light guide effect of the light-guiding member <b>330</b>A and (ii) radially toward the front surface (light extraction surface) by the diffusion effect of the light-guiding member <b>330</b>A.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0137">Further, the light-guiding member <b>330</b>A is provided to bury the non-light-emitting part between the adjacent light-emitting parts <b>20</b> in the longer direction of the board.

Thus, the light emitting region can be formed continuously without a gap in the longer direction of the board. With this, the light emitting region can be expanded without having the non-light-emitting part between the adjacent light-emitting parts <b>20</b>. Thus, the grainy texture can be further reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0138">Note that the light-guiding member <b>330</b>A covers only side portions of the dome-shaped phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b>, in the same manner as in Embodiment 2.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0139">Furthermore, regarding the diffusion material contained in the light-guiding members <b>330</b> and <b>330</b>A included in the light-emitting devices <b>300</b> and <b>300</b>A according to Embodiment 3 of the present invention shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, respectively, it is preferable that density of the diffusion material on the side near the LED chip <b>21</b> be low and density of the diffusion material on the side far from the LED chip <b>21</b> be high. In other words, it is preferable that the density of the diffusion material in the light-guiding members <b>330</b> and <b>330</b>A be higher as a distance from the LED chip <b>21</b> is greater.

<heading>Embodiment 4</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0140">Next, a light-emitting device <b>800</b> according to Embodiment 4 of the present invention is described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> is a plan view of a light-emitting device according to Embodiment 4 of the present invention. Furthermore, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref> is a cross-sectional view schematically showing manufacturing of the light-emitting device according to Embodiment 4 of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0141">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, the basic configuration of the light-emitting device <b>800</b> according to this embodiment is the same as the light-emitting device according to any one of Embodiment 1 to Embodiment 3, but is different in that the light-emitting device <b>800</b> includes an elongated light-emitting part <b>820</b> in which a plurality of the LED chips <b>21</b> are collectively sealed with phosphor-containing resin <b>822</b>. Note that the components in the light-emitting device <b>800</b> identical to the components in the aforementioned embodiments are denoted by the same reference signs, and the detailed descriptions thereof are omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0142">A plurality of the LED chips <b>21</b> is arranged regularly in a row to form an element row. Furthermore, the element rows are arranged on the board <b>10</b> along an axis, with a non-light emitting region formed between the element rows which are adjacent to each other. In this embodiment, five LED chips <b>21</b> are mounted to form a row. Note that the number of the LED chips <b>21</b> that form the element row is not particularly limited and may be set as appropriate based on the desired luminance and the like of the light-emitting device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0143">Each of the LED chips <b>21</b> is disposed linearly in the row direction (Y axis direction). The term linearly specifically refers to, for example, the state where the LED chips <b>21</b> are mounted with the center of each of the LED chips <b>21</b> within 30 Î¼m with respect to an alignment axis J<b>2</b> of the element row (an alignment axis defined by the center of each of the light-emitting devices in a plan view included in the element row).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0144">When the LED chips <b>21</b> are linearly arranged as described, the phosphor-containing resin <b>822</b> which seals each of the LED chips <b>21</b> is likely to be formed linearly. Furthermore, the linear phosphor-containing resin <b>822</b> is easy to form and thus highly integrated light-emitting device <b>800</b> can be produced with high productivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0145">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, it is preferable that the distance D<b>1</b> between each of the LED chips <b>21</b> included in the element row be in a range from 0.8 mm to 3.0 mm, inclusive. With the distance smaller than this range, heat from the LED chip <b>21</b> may not be dissipated sufficiently. With the distance greater than this range, the adjacent LED chips <b>21</b> are spaced apart too far from each other and luminance unevenness may occur.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0146">A central axis <b>31</b> along the longer direction of the phosphor-containing resin <b>822</b> coincides with the alignment axis J<b>2</b> of the element row. In a state where the central axis <b>31</b> does not coincides with the alignment axis <b>32</b>, emitted light A<b>1</b> results in yellowish white light and emitted light A<b>2</b> results in bluish white light. Thus, color unevenness of the emitted light may occur in a unit of the light-emitting part <b>820</b>. In contrast, in a state where the central axis <b>31</b> coincides with the alignment axis <b>32</b> as this embodiment, both the emitted light A<b>1</b> and the emitted light A<b>2</b> likely to be white light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0147">Furthermore, when forming the elongated light-emitting part <b>820</b> including a plurality of the LED chips <b>21</b>, it is preferable that (i) end portions of the phosphor-containing resin <b>822</b> in the longer direction be round and have a curvature, and (ii) the shape of the cross section along the shorter direction of the phosphor-containing resin <b>822</b> be substantially semi-elliptical.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0148">When the end portions in the longer direction of the phosphor-containing resin <b>822</b> are round as described above, stress concentration is less likely to occur in the end portions. Furthermore, the distance from the LED chip <b>21</b> provided on the side of end portion of the element row to the end portion of the phosphor-containing resin <b>822</b> is substantially uniform in all directions. This makes it easy to extract the light emitted from the LED chip <b>21</b> to the outside of the phosphor-containing resin <b>822</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0149">Note that, although not illustrated, a land is provided in each of end portions of the surface of the board <b>10</b>, and the lands form a pair. A pair of lead wires of a lighting circuit unit is connected to the pair of the lands. Power is supplied to each of the LED chips <b>21</b> from the lighting circuit unit through the lead wires and thus each of the LED chips <b>21</b> emits light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0150">As described above, in the light-emitting device <b>800</b>, a plurality of the LED chips <b>21</b> that form the element row are collectively sealed with the elongated phosphor-containing resin <b>822</b>. With this configuration, it is possible to improve productivity compared to the case where all the LED chips <b>21</b> are individually sealed with the phosphor-containing resin (sealing material) <b>822</b>. On the other hand, when a plurality of the LED chips <b>21</b> are collectively sealed, heat builds up locally and color unevenness and the like may occur. However, by providing a curvature in end portion of the elongated phosphor-containing resin <b>822</b> as described above, heat is dissipated substantially uniformly even when heat is generated by the LED chips <b>21</b>. Thus, reduction in luminance of the LED chips <b>21</b> and decrease in excitation efficiency of the phosphors due to local over temperature are less likely to occur. As a result, the light-emitting device <b>800</b> is less likely to have luminance unevenness and color unevenness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0151">Furthermore, when localized high temperature is generated in the phosphor-containing resin <b>822</b>, amount of expansion varies from portion to portion. This increases internal stress causing a crack and the like, and results in a decreased sealing reliability. In this regard, in the light-emitting device <b>800</b> according to this embodiment, the phosphor-containing resin <b>822</b> is formed along the element row. Then, the phosphor-containing resin <b>822</b> mainly expands and contracts in the direction along the element row. Thus, internal stress is less likely to increase and the sealing reliability is less likely to decrease.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0152">With an object to further reduce the grainy texture and suppress color unevenness and the like of the light-emitting device <b>800</b>, when the width of the light-emitting part <b>820</b> along the longer direction of the board <b>10</b> is denoted by W<b>1</b>, the width of a light-guiding member <b>830</b> that covers the non-light emitting region is denoted by W<b>2</b>, the distance between each of the adjacent LED chips <b>21</b> that form the element row is denoted by D<b>1</b>, and the number of the LED chips mounted in the light-emitting part <b>820</b> is denote by N (for example, in this embodiment, the number of LED chips are five and thus N=5), it is preferable that the following two expressions (a) and (b) be satisfied.
<br/>
(1/<i>N</i>)â‰¦<i>W</i>2<i>/W</i>1â‰¦(3<i>/N</i>)â€ƒâ€ƒ(a)
<br/>
<i>D</i>1<i>â‰¦W</i>2â€ƒâ€ƒ(b)
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0153">When both of the above-described two expressions (a) and (b) are satisfied simultaneously, sufficient light can be guided to the light-guiding member from the LED chips <b>21</b> disposed in both end portions in the phosphor-containing resin <b>822</b>. With this, the light emitting region can be expanded without having non-light-emitting part. As a result, it is possible to further suppress luminance unevenness between the adjacent light-emitting parts <b>820</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0154">On the other hand, when W<b>2</b>/W<b>1</b> in the above expression (a) exceeds the upper limit 3/N, a light-guiding distance of the light of the LED chip disposed on each end portion in the phosphor-containing resin <b>822</b> is large and thus the light is not sufficiently guided. Therefore, effect in suppressing luminance unevenness between adjacent light-emitting parts <b>820</b> is small and thus not desirable. On the other hand, when W<b>2</b>/W<b>1</b> is smaller than the lower limit 1/N, the space W<b>2</b> between the adjacent light-emitting parts <b>820</b> is small, and luminance unevenness is not likely to occur. As a result, it is unnecessary to dispose the light-guiding member and thus not desirable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0155">Furthermore, when it is D<b>1</b>&gt;W<b>2</b> in the above-described expression (b), luminance unevenness between the adjacent light-emitting parts <b>820</b> is not likely to occur, as with the case where the W<b>2</b>/W<b>1</b> is smaller than the lower limit 1/N. As a result, it is unnecessary to dispose the light-guiding member and thus not desirable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0156">&lt;Method for Forming Elongated Light-Emitting Part&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0157">The elongated phosphor-containing resin <b>822</b> for collectively sealing a plurality of the LED chips <b>21</b> can be formed easily by using a dispenser.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0158">In this embodiment, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, the board <b>10</b> on which the element row, which includes a plurality of the LED chips <b>21</b> that are arranged to form a row, is mounted is first prepared. A line pattern <b>840</b> is formed on the board <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0159">Next, resin paste <b>940</b> is applied from a dispenser nozzle along the element row to form a line so that each of the LED chips <b>21</b> which forms the element row is covered. After the application, the resin paste <b>940</b> is solidified. The method of solidification is not particularly limited. The solidification may be accomplished using an oven set at a temperature optimal for the solidification of the resin paste <b>940</b> to be used or through natural drying. The elongated light-emitting part that includes LED chips <b>21</b> is formed by solidifying the resin paste <b>940</b> as described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0160">When the amount of the resin paste <b>940</b> applied varies, the shape of the phosphor-containing resin also varies. This leads to variation in the amount of phosphors distributed in the vicinity of the LED chip <b>21</b> and, as a result, often cause the color unevenness and the like. Thus, it is preferable that the resin paste <b>940</b> be dispensed at high quantitative accuracy and be applied within the error range of 0.5 mg per single elongated phosphor-containing resin. Note that the elongated phosphor-containing resin may be formed using a mold. In this case, positional accuracy of the mold with respect to the board <b>10</b> is also important in addition to the quantitative accuracy, and a positioning within the error range of 80 Î¼m is preferable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0161">To stably form the phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b> without involving deformation and the like, it is preferable that the viscosity of the material of the phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b>, i.e. the resin paste <b>940</b>, be in the range of 20 to 60 [PaÂ·sec.]. With the viscosity within the optimal viscosity range, the round shape at each end of the phosphor-containing resin in the longer direction and the substantially semi-elliptical shaped cross section along the shorter direction can be easily achieved. Furthermore, with the resin paste <b>940</b> having high viscosity near 60 [PaÂ·sec.], it is hard for the phosphors contained in the resin paste <b>940</b> to settle and thus the light emitted from the light-emitting part <b>820</b> is less likely to have color unevenness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0162">In contrast, for example, when the viscosity is not within the above-described range and is less than 20 [PaÂ·sec.], it is highly likely that the shape of the resin paste <b>940</b> collapses immediately after the application of the resin paste <b>940</b>, making it difficult to form the phosphor-containing resin of a designed shape. When the phosphor-containing resin <b>22</b> is not in the designed shape, a problem in terms of performance occurs, such as color unevenness of the light emitted from the light-emitting part <b>820</b>. Besides this, a problem in terms of sealing reliability can occur, such as wire <b>921</b> and the like included in the elongated light-emitting part being exposed out of the phosphor-containing resin. Furthermore, when the viscosity is higher than the above-described range, application can be difficult as resistivity of the resin paste <b>940</b> inside the dispenser nozzle can be too high.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0163">To make the viscosity of the resin paste <b>940</b> suitable, it is preferable that the resin paste <b>940</b> contains filler or the phosphor at least 5 wt %. For example, white filler can be used as the filler. Furthermore, to maintain the phosphor-containing resin in a suitable shape, it is preferable that a Shore A hardness of the phosphor-containing resin be 20 or greater.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0184">(Variation)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0185">The following describes with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> a variation of the light-emitting device according to the above-described embodiments of the present invention. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> is a plan view of a light-emitting device according to a variation of the present invention. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the light-emitting device according to the variation of the present invention taken along the line Y-Yâ€² in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0186">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, the light-emitting device according to the variation of the present invention includes grooves <b>31</b> formed on the board. Each of the grooves <b>31</b> is formed to regulate the end portion position of the light-guiding member <b>30</b>. In this variation, each of the grooves <b>31</b> is formed by removing the insulating film <b>11</b> and a portion of the board <b>10</b>. Furthermore, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, the plan shape of the groove <b>31</b> is a rectangular shape with its long side that lies in the direction of the long side of the board is longer than the short side that lies in the short side direction of the board.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0187">With the groove <b>31</b> that is formed on the board <b>10</b> as described above, the end portion of the light-guiding member <b>30</b> is regulated by the edge of the groove <b>31</b> due to surface tension as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, when the light-guiding member <b>30</b> having high thixotropy is applied. Thus, it is possible to control the width of the light-guiding member <b>30</b>. Furthermore, as the end portion of the light-guiding member <b>30</b> is regulated by the surface tension, it is also possible to form the light-guiding member <b>30</b> into the desired dome shape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0188">Note that, in this variation, a pair of grooves <b>31</b> that face each other is formed so as to sandwich the region on which the light-guiding member <b>30</b> is formed. With this, positions of the light-guiding member <b>30</b> on each side facing the long sides of the board <b>10</b> are regulated. Thus, the light-guiding member <b>30</b> of the predetermined shape can be formed in the predetermined region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0189">As described above, the light-emitting device according to this variation includes the board <b>10</b> on which the grooves <b>31</b> are formed. Thus, the light-guiding member <b>30</b> can be formed easily in the predetermined region in the predetermined shape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0190">The light-emitting device, the backlight unit, the liquid crystal display apparatus, and the lighting apparatus according to the present invention have been described thus far based on the embodiments. However, the present invention is not limited to such embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0191">For example, in the above-described embodiments, it is preferable that filler be mixed in the light-guiding member. With this, the thixotropy of the light-guiding member can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0192">Furthermore, when the phosphor-containing resin and the light-guiding member are in contact with each other in the above-described embodiments, it is preferable that n<b>1</b>â‰¦n<b>2</b> be satisfied, when the refractive index of the phosphor-containing resin is denoted by n<b>1</b> and the refractive index of the light-guiding member is denoted by n<b>2</b>. With this, it is possible to allow the light from the LED chip to incident on the light-guiding member, without causing the total reflection on the interface between the phosphor-containing resin and the light-guiding member. Thus, the luminance in the light-guiding member can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0193">Furthermore, it is preferable that the diameter of the phosphor-containing resin be small so that the absorption of the light, which is emitted from the LED chip, by the phosphor-containing resin can be suppressed and the light extraction efficiency can be improved. Furthermore, when the light-emitting device is applied to the backlight unit, it is preferable that the diameter of the phosphor-containing resin be smaller than the thickness of the light-guiding plate. With this, light-incident efficiency from the light-emitting device to the light-guiding plate can be improved, and it is possible to suppress decrease in the light-incident efficiency accompanied by the thinner light-guiding plate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0194">Furthermore, the white light propagating in the light-guiding member is redirected by adding the diffusion material to the light-guiding member in Embodiment 3 described above. However, the present invention is not limited to this. For example, a reflective material and a bump that cause diffuse reflection may be formed on the surface of (i) the light-guiding member, (ii) on the board, or (iii) on the member between the light-guiding member and the board. With this, the white light propagating in the light-guiding member can be redirected such that the white light travels to the upper surface (light extraction surface). Further, in this case, it is preferable that density of the reflective material and the like on the side near the LED chip be low and density of the reflective material and the like on the side far from the LED chip be high. It is preferable that the density of the reflective material and the like be higher as the distance from the LED chip increases. With this, it is possible to improve the luminance uniformity in the light-guiding member.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0195">Furthermore, although the groove is formed to regulate the position of the light-guiding member in the variation described above, the present invention is not limited to this. For example, the groove may be formed to regulate the position of the phosphor-containing resin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0196">Furthermore, although the LED chip <b>21</b> used in the above embodiments is an upper-face double electrode type LED chip, i.e. both the p-side electrode <b>21</b> <i>a </i>and the n-side electrode <b>21</b> <i>b </i>are formed on the upper surface side, the present invention is not limited to this. For example, an upper and lower electrode-type LED chip, i.e. the p-side electrode (or the n-side electrode) is formed on the upper surface and the n-side electrode (or the p-side electrode) is formed on the lower surface, may be used. Further, a bump may be provided between the LED chip and the metal line to perform a flip-chip bonding so that the LED chip and the metal line are connected without using a wire. With the flip-chip bonding, reflection by the wire is eliminated and thus the light extraction efficiency can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0197">Furthermore, although the light-emitting device in the above embodiments is configured such that white light is emitted using the blue LED and the yellow phosphors, the present invention is not limited to this. The light-emitting device may be configured such that white light is emitted by using phosphor-containing resin which contains red phosphors and green phosphors in combination with the blue LED.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0198">Furthermore, although a metal base board is used as the board <b>10</b> in the above embodiments, the present invention is not limited to this. For example, a dielectric board such as a ceramic board and the like made of AlO<sub>3 </sub>may be used. In this case, since the ceramic board has insulative properties, the insulating film <b>11</b> does not have to be formed on the surface of the board.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0199">Furthermore, although a plurality of the bare chips <b>21</b> are arranged and mounted on the board <b>10</b> to form a row in the above embodiments, it may be configured such that the bare chips are arranged and mounted to form a plurality of rows of two rows (two dimensional) or more.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0200">Furthermore, although the backlight unit, the liquid crystal display apparatus, or the lighting apparatus are described in the above embodiments as examples of application of the light-emitting device, the present invention is not limited to such examples. Other than the above, for example, the light-emitting device can be applied to a lamp light source of a copying machine, a guide light, or a sign device. Further, the light-emitting device can be used as a light source in industrial use such as a line light source for inspection.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0201">Other than the above, various modifications to the above-described embodiments that may be conceived by a person of ordinary skill in the art which do not depart from the essence of the present invention are intended to be within the scope of the present invention. Furthermore, each component in a plurality of embodiments may be arbitrarily combined within a scope not departing from the essence of the present invention.</div>
<heading>INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0202">The present invention can be widely used, and the examples of application include: a light-emitting device using a semiconductor light-emitting element such as an LED as a light source, a backlight unit, a liquid crystal display apparatus; a lighting apparatus such as a linear fluorescent lamp; a guide light; a sign device; an electronic equipment such as a copying machine; or an industrial use such as a line light source for inspection.</div>
