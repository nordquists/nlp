<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This application is a Divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 11/654,666, filed on Jan. 18, 2007, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,053,320, which is a Divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 10/947,264, filed on Sep. 23, 2004, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,173,307, which in turn claims the benefit of Japanese Application Nos. 2003-331246 and 2003-331262, filed on Sep. 24, 2003 and 2004-065468 and 2004-065958, filed on Mar. 9, 2004, the entire contents of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device and a manufacturing method thereof, and particularly to a semiconductor which includes a heterojunction and a manufacturing method thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">It is known MOSFET which is made up of silicon carbide as a material as a related art of the invention. With regard to the MOSFET disclosed in Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No. Hei 10-233503, an nâˆ’ type drain region is formed on an n+ type silicon carbide substrate region. On the surface of the drain region, a P type well region (a base region) and an n+ type source region are formed. A gate electrode is arranged on the drain region with a gate insulating film placed in-between. A source electrode is formed in a way that the source electrode is arranged adjacent to the well region and the source region. Additionally, a drain electrode is formed on the rear of the silicon carbide substrate region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">The following discussion will provide an overview of operations of this MOSFET. For example, in a case that the gate electrode is grounded or applied with negative potential while the source electrode is grounded and the drain electrode is applied with positive potential, the drain region and the well region are put into a state of being reverse biased, and accordingly current is cut off in the device. Then, if the gate electrode is applied with adequate positive potential, an inversion type channel region is formed on an interface of the gate region which is opposite to the gate electrode. Hereby, since electrons flow into the drain region from the source region through the channel region, current runs from the drain electrode to the source electrode. In this manner, the MOSFET of the related art includes a switching function.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">In the case of the above described MOSFET which is made up of silicon carbide as a material, however, defective crystalline structure, i.e. a quantity of interface states, exist on the interface of the well region underneath a gate insulating film in which the inversion type channel region is formed, and accordingly those work as an electron trap. This makes it difficult to improve the channel mobility.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">In addition, when the drain electrode is applied with high voltage, electric field spreads not only in the drain region but also in the well region, and thus the electric field deletes. For this reason, the well region needs to have a prescribed thickness of its own in order to prevent the drain region and the source region from being punched through. In other words, the length of the well region underneath the gate insulating film in which the inversion type channel region is formed, i.e. the channel length, cannot be made shorter than a prescribed length.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">Against the background, conventional MOSFETs have embraced some restraint on reduction in resistance in the inversion type channel region, resultantly an on state resistance</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">The present invention has been made in order to solve the above described problems with the prior art. An object of the present invention is to provide a normally-off, voltage driven, high voltage withstanding field effect transistor which can reduce the resistance in the channel region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">An aspect of the present invention provides a semiconductor device that includes a first conductivity type semiconductor body, a source region in contact with the semiconductor body, whose bandgap is different from that of the semiconductor body, and which formed heterojunction with the semiconductor body, a gate insulating film in contact with a portion of junction between the source region and the semiconductor body, a gate electrode in contact with the gate insulating film, a source electrode, a low resistance region in contact with the source electrode and the source region, and connected ohmically with the source electrode, and a drain electrode connected ohmically with the semiconductor body.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">Another aspect of the present invention provides a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device that includes (1) growing a source region on a surface of a semiconductor body, (2) growing a low resistance region contacting with the source region, (3) etching the low resistance region and the source region with the same mask pattern in a selective manner, and (4) forming a gate insulating film contacting with the low resistance region, the source region and the semiconductor body.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">Various embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. It is to be noted that same or similar reference numerals are applied to the same or similar parts and elements throughout the drawings, and the description of the same or similar parts and elements will be omitted or simplified.</div>
<heading>First Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a semiconductor device of the first embodiment according to the present invention. The figure is a cross sectional view of two cells as structural units which face each other. A description will be provided for this embodiment, citing an example of a semiconductor device which uses silicon carbide as a material of the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">For example, an nâˆ’ type drain region <b>102</b> is formed on an n+ type substrate region <b>101</b> which is made up of silicon carbide whose polytype is 4H. In addition, a source region <b>103</b> which is made up of, for example, nâˆ’ type polycrystalline silicon is formed on a main interface that is situated on the opposite side of the drain region <b>102</b> in relation to a junction interface between the drain region <b>102</b> and the substrate region <b>101</b>. In other words, the contact between the drain region <b>102</b> and the source region <b>103</b> is formed of heterojunction which is made up of silicon carbide and polycrystalline silicon whose bandgaps are different from each other. Accordingly, an energy barrier exists in the junction interface. A low resistance region <b>104</b> which is made up of, for example, cobalt silicide is formed on the interface that is situated on the opposite side of the source region <b>103</b> in relation to the junction interface between the source region <b>103</b> and the drain region <b>102</b>. In addition, a gate insulating film <b>105</b> which is made up of, for example, a silicon oxide film is formed in contact with the junction interface between the low resistance region <b>104</b> and the source region <b>103</b> and concurrently with the junction interface between the source region <b>103</b> and the drain region <b>102</b>. Furthermore, a gate electrode <b>106</b> is formed on the gate insulating film <b>105</b> in a way that the gate electrode <b>106</b> is connected onto the gate insulating film <b>105</b>. A source electrode <b>107</b> is formed on the source region <b>103</b> in a way that the source electrode <b>107</b> is connected onto the source region <b>103</b> with the low resistance region <b>104</b> placed in-between. A drain electrode <b>108</b> is formed on the silicon carbide substrate region <b>101</b> in a way that the drain electrode <b>108</b> is connected onto the silicon carbide substrate region <b>101</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">Incidentally, this first embodiment is described, citing an example of what is called a trench type structure. In the trench type structure, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the trench <b>116</b> is formed in the surface of the drain region <b>102</b>, and the gate electrode <b>106</b> is formed in the trench <b>116</b> with the gate insulating film <b>105</b> placed in-between. This first embodiment, however, accepts what is called a planar type where, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, no trench is formed in the drain region <b>102</b>. Although a dent is provided in the middle of the surface of the gate electrode in the first embodiment, the surface may instead be planar.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">Next, a description will be provided for a method of manufacturing the semiconductor device, made up of silicon carbide, according to the first embodiment of the present invention, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">First, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, an n type semiconductor device made up of silicon carbide is formed by growing the n<sup>âˆ’ </sup>type drain region <b>102</b> epitaxially on the n<sup>+ </sup>type substrate region <b>101</b>. On the surface of the substrate region, polycrystalline silicon is laid up, for example, by an LP-CVD method. Hereafter, an n<sup>âˆ’ </sup>type source region <b>103</b> is formed, subjected to phosphoric doping, for example, in a POCl<sub>3 </sub>atmosphere. In this case, the concentration and thickness of impurities used for the drain region <b>102</b>, for example, are 1Ã—10<sup>16 </sup>cm<sup>âˆ’3</sup>, and 10 Î¼m (micro meter(s)) respectively. The concentration and thickness of impurities used for the source region <b>103</b> are 1Ã—10<sup>16 </sup>cm<sup>âˆ’3</sup>, and 0.5 Î¼m (micro meter(s)) respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, cobalt is deposited on the source region <b>103</b>. Processed thermally, chemical reaction is caused between polycrystalline silicon and cobalt, and makes polycrystalline silicon and cobalt into alloyed form. In this manner, a low resistance region <b>104</b> which is made up of cobalt silicide is formed thereon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">In addition, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, an oxide film is laid up on the low resistance region <b>104</b>, and is made into a mask material <b>115</b> which is made up of the oxide film through lithographic and etching processes. Subjected to a reactive ion etching process, the low resistance region <b>104</b> is etched with the mask material <b>115</b> used as a mask, and concurrently the surfaces of the source region <b>103</b> and the drain region <b>102</b> are etched so that the trench <b>116</b> with a prescribed depth is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">In the end, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, for example, the mask material <b>115</b> is washed off with Hydrofluoric acid solutions, and hereafter a gate insulating film <b>105</b> (a gate oxide film) is laid up on the upper surface of the low resistance region <b>104</b> and the inner wall of the trench <b>116</b>. After that, the drain electrode <b>108</b> which is made of, for example, titanium (Ti) and nickel (Ni) is formed on the substrate region <b>101</b> which is situated on a rear side of the drain region <b>102</b>. In addition, in the source region <b>103</b> which is situated on the front side of the drain region <b>102</b>, a contact hole is made in a prescribed portion on the gate insulating film <b>105</b> through reactive ion etching processes. The source electrode <b>107</b> is formed by laying up titanium (Ti) and aluminum (Al), in order, on the low resistance region <b>104</b>. Eventually, a semiconductor device made up of silicon carbide according to the first embodiment of the present invention is completed as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">Specifically, the method of manufacturing the semiconductor device according to the first embodiment includes at least: a step (1) of laying up the source region <b>103</b> on the main surface of the semiconductor substrate; a step (2) of laying up the low resistance region <b>104</b> in a way that the low resistance region <b>104</b> is in contact with the source region <b>103</b>; a step (3) of etching the low resistance region <b>104</b> and the source region <b>103</b> in a selective manner by use of the same mask pattern; and a step (4) of forming the gate oxide films <b>105</b> in a way that the gate oxide films <b>105</b> are in contact with the low resistance region <b>104</b>, the source region <b>103</b> and the semiconductor body. With such a structure, semiconductor devices according to the first embodiment can be manufactured by use of employing conventional manufacturing technologies.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">Next, a description will be given of operations of the semiconductor device. According to the first embodiment, the semiconductor device is used, for example by grounding the source electrode <b>107</b> and by applying positive potential to the drain electrode <b>108</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">First, in a case that the gate electrode <b>106</b> is applied, for example, with a grounding potential, a condition that current is cut off in the gate electrode <b>106</b> is maintained. In other words, this is because an energy barrier against conductive electrons is caused in the heterojunction interface between the source region <b>103</b> and the drain region <b>102</b>. Properties of the heterojunction between polycrystalline silicon and silicon carbide will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> are diagrams to show energy band profiles of the semiconductor device. In each figure, the left half of a diagram shows the energy band profile of an nâˆ’ type silicon which corresponds to the source region <b>103</b>, and the right half of the diagram shows the energy band profile of 4H type nâˆ’ type silicon carbide which corresponds to the drain region <b>102</b>. Incidentally, according to the first embodiment, although a description has been provided for the example of the source region <b>103</b> which is made of polycrystalline silicon, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> will describe the first embodiment with reference to energy band profiles of the silicon. In addition, in order to help understand properties of heterojunction, this description will cite an example of energy levels of the heterojunction in an ideal semiconductor device which does not include an interface state in the heterojunction interface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows energy band profiles which appears in a state that neither silicon nor silicon carbide is in contact with each other. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, with regard to silicon, electron affinity is denominated by Ï‡; work function (energy difference between vacuum level and Fermi level) by Ï†<b>1</b>; Fermi energy (energy difference between conduction band and Fermi level) by Î´<b>1</b>; and bandgap by EG<b>1</b>. Similarly, with regard to silicon carbide, electron affinity is denominated by Ï‡I<b>2</b>; work function (energy difference between vacuum level and Fermi level) by Ï†<b>2</b>; Fermi energy (energy difference between conduction band and Fermi level) by Î´<b>2</b>; and bandgap by EG<b>2</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an energy barrier Î”EC exists in a junction interface between silicon and silicon carbide due to the difference in electron affinity Ï‡ between silicon and silicon carbide, and the relationship between them can be expressed with a function (1):
<br/>
Î”<i>EC=Ï‡</i>1âˆ’Ï‡2â€ƒâ€ƒ(1)
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">In addition, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows energy band profiles which appear when silicon and silicon carbide are put in contact with each other so that heterojunction is formed of silicon and silicon carbide. An energy barrier Î”EC still exists after silicon and silicon carbide are put in contact with each other, as it is the case before silicon and silicon carbide are put in contact with each other. For this reason, it is assumed that an electron storage layer with a width W<b>1</b> is formed in the junction interface on the side of silicon, and that, on the other hand, a depletion layer with a width W<b>2</b> is formed in the junction interface on the side of silicon carbide. Here, diffusion potential which is caused in both junction interfaces is denominated by VD; an element of the diffusion potential on the side of silicon by V<b>1</b>; and an element of the diffusion potential on the side of silicon carbide by V<b>2</b>. Since VD is an equivalent to the energy difference between silicon and silicon carbide at Fermi levels, the relationship is expressed with functions (2) to (4):
<br/>
<i>VD</i>=(Î´1<i>+Î”Ecâˆ’</i>Î´2)/<i>q</i>â€ƒâ€ƒ(2)
<br/>
<i>VD=V</i>1<i>+V</i>2â€ƒâ€ƒ(3)
<br/>
<i>W</i>2=((2Â·âˆˆ0Â·âˆˆ2Â·<i>V</i>2)/(<i>qÂ·N</i>2))<sup>1/2</sup>â€ƒâ€ƒ(4)
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">Here, âˆˆ<b>0</b> represents permittivity with vacuum, and âˆˆ<b>2</b> represents dielectric constant of silicon carbide.

These functions represent an ideal state, and do not take an effect of electrostriction into consideration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> are diagrams to show energy band profiles in the junction interface between the drain region <b>102</b> and the source region <b>103</b> which is in contact with the gate electrode <b>106</b> with the gate insulating film <b>105</b> placed in-between according to this first embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as described above. It is assumed that, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an energy band profile appears in what is called equilibrium in which none of the gate electrode <b>106</b>, the source electrode <b>107</b> and the drain electrode <b>108</b> is applied with voltage. It is assumed that, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, an energy band profile appears when the gate electrode <b>106</b> and the source electrode <b>107</b> are applied with a grounding potential and the drain electrode <b>108</b> is applied with adequate positive potential. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a depletion layer expands in the heterojunction interface on the side of the drain field <b>102</b> in response to drain potential applied. By contrast, conductive electrons present in the side of the source region <b>103</b> can not bridge the energy barrier Î”EC, the conductive electrons accumulate in the junction interface. This accumulation ends an electric line of force which corresponds to the depletion layer which expands over the junction interface on the side of silicon carbide, and seals the drain field on the side of the source region <b>103</b>. For this reason, even if the thickness of the polycrystalline silicon of which the source region <b>103</b> is formed is, for example, as thin as approximately 20 nm, a state of cutting off current (withstanding voltage) can be maintained. If introduction of the conductivity type polycrystalline silicon or concentration of impurities decreases the electron density of the source region <b>103</b>, higher performance of cutting off current can be realized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067">Next, when the gate electrode <b>106</b> is applied with positive potential in order to convert from a cutoff state to a conduction state, the gate field expands up to the heterojunction interface in which the source region <b>103</b> and the drain region <b>102</b> is in contact with each other with the gate insulating film <b>105</b> placed in-between. For this reason, a layer which accumulates conductive electrons is formed in portions of the source region <b>103</b> and the drain region <b>102</b> in the vicinity of the gate electrode <b>106</b>. In other words, the energy band profile in the junction interface between the source region <b>103</b> and the drain region <b>102</b> in the vicinity of the gate electrode <b>106</b> changes as indicated with solid lines in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The potential on the side of the source region <b>103</b> is suppressed downwards, compared with an energy band profile which appears in a state of being off indicated by broken lines, and accordingly the energy barrier on the side of the drain region <b>102</b> becomes steep. This enables conductive electrons to flow through the energy barrier.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068">This time, according to this embodiment, since the source region <b>103</b> and the source electrode <b>107</b> are connected with each other in the low resistance region <b>104</b>, conductive electrons are supplied in low resistance from the source electrode <b>107</b> to the source region <b>103</b> in which conductive electrons accumulate by the gate field in the vicinity of the gate electrode <b>106</b>. By this, the conductive electrons which have been cut off by the energy barrier flow from the source electrode <b>107</b> to the drain region <b>102</b> through the source region <b>103</b> which is in contact with the low resistance region <b>104</b> and the gate insulating film <b>105</b>. In other words, a state of conduction is brought about.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">In this way, the nâˆ’ type source region <b>103</b>, whose electron density is low, and whose cutoff performance is relatively high, is used while in a cutoff state. While in a conduction state, however, even the source region <b>103</b> is connected with the source electrode <b>107</b> through the low resistance region <b>104</b> with low resistance, although conductive electrons accumulate in the source region <b>103</b> by the gate field in the vicinity of the gate electrode <b>106</b>. For this reason, conduction can be brought about in lower resistance in comparison with a case in which the source region <b>103</b> and the source electrode <b>107</b> are connected with each other directly without the low resistance region <b>104</b>. Particularly, this effect can function efficiently by making the specific resistance of the low resistance region <b>104</b> smaller than that of the drain region <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0070">In order to convert from a conduction state to a cutoff state, when the gate electrode <b>106</b> is applied with grounding potential again, the state that conductive electrons have accumulated in the heterojunction interface between the source region <b>103</b> and the drain region <b>102</b> is released, and concurrently tunneling in the energy barrier ceases. In addition, conductive electrons cease flowing from the source region <b>103</b> to the drain region <b>102</b>, and conductive electrons which have existed in the drain region <b>102</b> flows to the substrate region <b>101</b> so that the conductive electrons are depleted, and hereby a depletion layer expands on the side of the drain region <b>102</b> from a portion of the heterojunction so that a cutoff state is brought about.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">In addition, according to this embodiment, a conduction in the reverse direction (a return current operation) can be performed which, for example, grounds the source electrode <b>107</b> and applies negative potential onto the drain electrode <b>108</b>, as in the case of the above described conventional architecture.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0072">For example, when the source electrode <b>107</b> and the gate electrode <b>106</b> are applied with grounding potential and the drain electrode <b>108</b> is applied with positive potential which is higher than (qv, +qv<b>2</b>) shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the energy barrier against conductive electrons disappears. By this, conductive electrons flow from the drain region <b>102</b> to the source region <b>103</b>, and thus a state of conduction in the reverse direction is brought about. At this time, unlike the conventional structure, the structure according to this embodiment causes conduction by use of conductive electrons only, without injecting holes. For this reason, while converting from a conduction state to a cutoff state, loss caused by reverse recovering current can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0073">It should be noted that, when the above described gate electrode <b>106</b> is used as a controlling electrode without being grounded, reverse conduction can be brought about if the drain electrode <b>108</b> is simply applied with potential which is slower than (qV<b>1</b>+qV<b>2</b>), as in the case of the conventional structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0074">With the constitution shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, as described above, this embodiment can perform the same operations as the above described conventional structure does. In addition, this embodiment has the following features in comparison with the conventional structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0075">The semiconductor device according to this embodiment comprises: a first conductivity type semiconductor body which is formed of a substrate region <b>101</b> and a drain region <b>102</b>; a source region <b>103</b> which is a first hetero-semiconductor region, which is in contact with a main surface of the semiconductor body, and whose bandgap is different from that of the semiconductor body; the gate electrode <b>106</b> which is in contact with a portion of junction between the source region <b>103</b> and the semiconductor body with a gate insulating film <b>105</b> placed in-between; a source electrode <b>107</b> which is connected with the source region <b>103</b> with the low resistance region <b>104</b> placed in-between for ohmic contact; and a drain electrode <b>108</b> which is connected with the semiconductor body ohmically.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0076">As described above, while in a cutoff state, an energy barrier exists in a portion of heterojunction between the semiconductor body and the source region. For this reason, current does not flow between the drain electrode <b>108</b> and the source electrode <b>107</b>. In addition, while in a conduction state, an energy barrier in a portion of heterojunction between the semiconductor body which is opposite to the gate electrode <b>106</b> and the source region is caused to be lower, by the gate field, a number of carriers are caused to flow. In other words, current flows between the drain electrode <b>108</b> and the source electrode <b>107</b>. Since switching between current cutoff and current conduction is controlled in the portion of heterojunction between the drain region <b>102</b> and the source region <b>103</b> in such a way, the thickness of the interface region of the heterojunction which is needed for maintaining a cutoff state corresponding to what is called a channel length can be made small. Accordingly, a channel resistance, i.e. an on state resistance can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0077">In addition, control of conductivity over the semiconductor body is not required while manufacturing an element. For this reason, manufacturing processes can be simplified, and problems such as rough surfaces caused by a high temperature annealing process can be avoided. In addition, it is expected that an on state resistance can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0078">Furthermore, an nâˆ’ type source region <b>103</b> whose electron density is low, and whose cutoff performance is relatively high, is used while in a cutoff state. However, since a portion of the source region <b>103</b> which is opposite to the gate is connected ohmically with the source electrode <b>107</b> with the low resistance region <b>104</b> placed in-between, resistance between the source electrode <b>107</b> and the portion of the source region <b>103</b> which is opposite to the gate is caused to be lower while in a cutoff state, even though the nâˆ’ type source region <b>103</b> whose electron density is low, and whose cutoff performance is relatively high is used. For this reason, the on state resistance can be reduced further. At this time, if the resistance of the low resistance region <b>104</b> is lower than, at least, that of the drain region <b>102</b>, an effect of the reduced on state resistance can be brought about efficiently.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0079">Additionally, unlike a conventional elements, holes which are minority carriers are not injected into the drain region <b>102</b>, while in a reverse conduction state. This suppresses the cause of reverse recovery current while in the reverse recovery state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0080">Furthermore, according to this embodiment (exception for the construction shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), trenches <b>116</b> are arranged in prescribed intervals in a main surface of the semiconductor body. The semiconductor body, the source region and the gate electrode <b>106</b> which accompanies the gate insulating film <b>105</b> are in contact with one another in the vicinity of the surface of the side wall of the trenches <b>116</b>. This makes it easy to integrate the semiconductor device, and concurrently enables the gate field from the gate electrode <b>106</b> to expand in the portion of heterojunction between the semiconductor body and the source region efficiently while in a conduction state. For this reason, an energy barrier in the portion of heterojunction is caused to be further lower, and accordingly the on state resistance can be reduced.</div>
<heading>Second Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0081"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a semiconductor device according to a second embodiment of the present invention. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a cross sectional view corresponding to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> of the first embodiment. For this second embodiment, descriptions of operations which are the same as operations which are performed as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> will be omitted, and detailed descriptions will be provided for features which are different from those which have been described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0082">Features of the second embodiment are as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. A semiconductor device according to the second embodiment includes a withstanding voltage region <b>109</b> which is a second hetero-semiconductor region which is in contact with the semiconductor body and the source region <b>103</b> which is the first hetero-semiconductor region, and whose bandgap is different from that of the semiconductor body. Junction between the withstanding voltage region <b>109</b> and the semiconductor substrate is so formed that voltage withstanding in the portion of the junction is equal to, or higher than, at least that in the portion of junction between the source region <b>103</b> and the semiconductor body. In other words, part of the source region <b>103</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is replaced, for example, with the withstanding voltage region <b>109</b> which is formed of p+ type polycrystalline silicon. Specifically, the withstanding voltage region <b>109</b> which is formed of p+ type polycrystalline silicon is formed in a way that the withstanding voltage region <b>109</b> is in contact with the drain region <b>102</b> and the source region <b>103</b>. This means that, if a portion of heterojunction is formed between the drain region <b>102</b> and the p+ type withstanding voltage region <b>109</b> whose electron density is low, leakage current can be caused to be lower than that of a portion of heterojunction between the drain region <b>102</b> and the source region <b>103</b> while in a cutoff state. As a consequence, higher voltage withstanding can be available.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0083">For this reason, the second embodiment can obtain higher cutoff performance while maintaining the effect of the reduced on state resistance which has been shown in the description of the first embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0084">Furthermore, according to this embodiment, the source region <b>103</b> is formed of the first conductivity type, and the withstanding voltage region <b>109</b> is formed of the second conductivity type. These constructions enable effects according to the present invention to be realized with ease. It should be noted that the source region <b>103</b> and the withstanding voltage region <b>109</b> may be formed of the first conductivity type, and that concentration of impurities in the source region <b>103</b> may be caused to be equal to, or higher than, that of the withstanding voltage region <b>109</b>. This enables effects according to the present invention to be realized with ease. The second embodiment, however, produces higher effects of voltage withstanding than the first embodiment. In addition, since the withstanding voltage region <b>109</b> is formed of a semiconductor material equivalent to that of the source region <b>103</b>, manufacturing processes can be simplified.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0086">According to this third embodiment, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the source region <b>103</b> is formed of an n+ type whose properties include high conductivity, and the low resistance region <b>104</b> is formed of n+ type polycrystalline silicon which is the same material used for the source region <b>103</b> instead of, for example, cobalt silicide which has been used, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, for the low resistance region <b>104</b>. These constructions enable manufacturing processes to be simplified. In addition, an interlayer dielectric <b>110</b> is formed between the low resistance region <b>104</b> and the withstanding voltage region <b>109</b>. Incidentally, although <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows that the positions of the extremities of the interlayer dielectric <b>110</b> match the positions of the extremities of the withstanding voltage region <b>109</b>, it does not matter whether the interlayer dielectric <b>110</b> is larger or smaller than the withstanding voltage region <b>109</b>. In other word, if the interlayer dielectric <b>110</b> is formed at least between any two of the low resistance region <b>104</b>, the source region <b>103</b> and the withstanding voltage region <b>109</b>, it also serves for the object of the embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0087">A method for manufacturing semiconductor devices, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, according to a third embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to drawings. First, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, an n+ type silicon carbide semiconductor body is formed by growing an nâˆ’ type drain region <b>102</b> epitaxially on an n+ type substrate region <b>101</b>. Then, polycrystalline silicon is laid up on the n+ type silicon carbide semiconductor body, for example, through LP-CVD processes. Thence, the semiconductor body is doped with boron, for example, in a BBr<sub>3 </sub>atmosphere, and accordingly a p+ type withstanding voltage region <b>109</b> is formed. At this time, the concentration of impurities and thickness of the drain region <b>102</b> are 1Ã—10<sup>16 </sup>cm<sup>âˆ’3 </sup>and 10 Î¼m (micro meter(s)) respectively. The concentration of impurities and thickness of the withstanding voltage region <b>109</b> are 1Ã—10<sup>18 </sup>cm<sup>âˆ’3 </sup>and 0.2 Î¼m (micro meter(s)) respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0088">Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>, an oxide film is laid up on the withstanding voltage region <b>109</b>, and an interlayer dielectric <b>110</b> is formed through lithographic and etching processes on the oxide film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0089">Then, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref>, polycrystalline silicon to be a low resistance region <b>104</b> is laid up again on the withstanding voltage region <b>109</b> and the interlayer dielectric <b>110</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0090">Hereafter, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>, an oxide film is laid up on the low resistance region <b>104</b>, and a mask material (not illustrated) is formed through lithographic and etching processes on the oxide film. Then, a trench <b>116</b> with a prescribed depth is formed through reactive ion etching processes which etches the low resistance region <b>104</b> and concurrently the surfaces of the source region <b>103</b> and the drain region <b>102</b>. Then, the mask material is washed off with Hydrofluoric acid solutions, and hereafter an n+ type source region <b>104</b> and the low resistance region <b>104</b> are formed through being doped with phosphorus, for example, in a POCl<sub>3 </sub>atmosphere. At this time, the concentration of impurities and thickness of the low resistance region <b>104</b> are, for example, 5Ã—10<sup>19 </sup>cm<sup>âˆ’3 </sup>and 0.5 Î¼m (micro meter(s)) respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0091">Finally, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>, a gate insulating film <b>105</b> is laid up on the upper surface of the low resistance region <b>104</b> and the inner wall of the trench <b>116</b>. Hereafter, a drain electrode <b>108</b> which is made up, for example, of Titanium (Ti) and Nickel (Ni) is formed on the substrate region <b>101</b> which is situated on a rear side of the drain region <b>102</b>. In the source region <b>103</b> which is situated on the front side of the semiconductor device, a contact hole is made in a prescribed position on the gate insulating film <b>105</b> through reactive ion etching processes, and the source electrode <b>107</b> is formed by laying up Titanium (Ti) and Aluminum (AL) in order on the upper surface of the low resistance region <b>104</b>. The silicon carbide semiconductor substrate as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> according to the third embodiment of the present invention is completed in this way.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0092">In other words, a method for manufacturing the semiconductor device according to this embodiment comprises at least: a step (1) for laying up the source region <b>103</b> on the main surface of the semiconductor substrate; a step (2) for laying up the low resistance region <b>104</b> in a way that the low resistance region <b>104</b> is in contact with the source region <b>103</b>; a step (3) for etching the low resistance region <b>104</b> and the source region <b>103</b> with the same mask pattern in a selective manner; and a step (4) for constructing the gate insulating film <b>105</b> in a way that the gate insulating film <b>105</b> is in contact with the low resistance region <b>104</b>, the source region <b>103</b> and the semiconductor body. Between the step (1) and the step (2), the method for manufacturing the semiconductor device further comprises at least: a step for laying up the interlayer dielectric <b>110</b>; and a step for etching the interlayer dielectric <b>110</b> in a selective manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0093">Employing these constructions, the semiconductor device according to this embodiment can be realized by use of conventional manufacturing technologies with ease.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0094">This embodiment makes it easier than the second embodiment to cause the on state resistance and the voltage withstanding to be compatible with each other in this way. This is because, when an element is formed, the construction of the interlayer dielectric <b>110</b> between the withstanding voltage region <b>109</b> and the low resistance region <b>104</b> enables the device to be formed while avoiding mixture of the materials used for the low resistance region <b>104</b>, the source region <b>103</b> and the withstanding voltage region <b>109</b> as well as different conductivity types and concentrations of impurities thereof even in a case that the low resistance region is made up of polycrystalline silicon which is capable of being processed with relatively high temperature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0095">In addition, while in a cutoff state, leakage current which is generated between the drain region <b>102</b> and the withstanding voltage region <b>119</b> underneath the interlayer dielectric <b>110</b> can not flow into the low resistance region <b>104</b> directly, and accordingly this makes the passage for the conduction longer. As a consequence, generation of leakage current can be suppressed in the withstanding voltage region <b>109</b>.</div>
<heading>Fourth Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0096"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows a semiconductor device according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a cross sectional view corresponding to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> of the second embodiment. For this fourth embodiment, descriptions of operations which are the same as operations which are performed as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> will be omitted, and detailed descriptions will be provided for features which are different from those which have been described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0097">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the semiconductor device according to the embodiment includes a metallic region <b>112</b> which is in contact with a semiconductor body and a source region, and which makes Schottky junction with the semiconductor body. The semiconductor is configured so that voltage withstanding in the portion of the junction between the metallic region <b>112</b> and the semiconductor body is at least equal to, or larger than, that in the portion of the junction between the source region and the semiconductor body. In other words, the metallic region <b>112</b> which is made up, for example, of Nickel (Ni) is formed instead of the low resistance region <b>104</b> and the withstanding voltage region <b>109</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Specifically, the metallic region <b>112</b> makes Schottky junction in the portion of the junction between the metallic region <b>112</b> and the drain region <b>102</b>, and concurrently functions as a low resistance region which bridges between the source region <b>103</b> and the source electrode <b>107</b>. As a consequence, since the low resistance region is made up of the same material that constitutes the metallic region <b>112</b>, manufacturing processes can be simplified. The case that the metallic region <b>112</b> functions as the low resistance region has been described for this embodiment. It should be noted, however, that, if the portion in which the low resistance region is currently formed is assigned for a region other than the metallic region by use of a different material, it also serves for the object of this embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0098">These constructions cause a depletion layer to expand in the Schottky junction interface on the side of the drain region <b>102</b> in response to drain potential applied while in a cutoff state. For this reason, conductive electrons which exist on the side of the metallic region <b>112</b> can not clear the Schottky barrier, and conductive electrons accumulate in the junction interface. Accordingly, this ends an electric line of force which matches the depletion layer that expands on the side of the silicon carbide ends, as in the case of the heterojunction. In addition, the drain field is sealed on the side of the metallic region <b>112</b>. At this time, if a material used for the metallic region <b>112</b> is selected for the purpose of causing the energy barrier of the Schottky junction to be higher than that of the heterojunction made up of the withstanding voltage region <b>109</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, this enables a stronger cutoff property to be realized. Employing the constructions which are different from those of the second embodiment, this third embodiment can improve voltage withstanding while in a cutoff state, and concurrently can suppress leakage current while in a cutoff state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0099">The semiconductor device according to this embodiment includes a stronger conduction property, since the metallic region <b>112</b> does not have effect on the source region <b>103</b> which functions as a switch and concurrently operates as a low resistance region between the source region <b>103</b> and the source electrode <b>107</b>, while in a conduction state.</div>
<heading>Fifth Embodiment</heading>

For this fifth embodiment, descriptions of operations which are the same as operations that are performed as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> will be omitted, and detailed descriptions will be provided for features which are different from those that have been described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. According to this fifth embodiment, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, a second conductivity type, p type or p+ type field relaxation region <b>113</b> is formed in a way that the field relaxation region <b>113</b> is in contact with the surfaces of the source region <b>103</b> and the drain region <b>102</b> in a prescribed distance away from a portion in which the gate electrode <b>106</b> and the source region <b>103</b> are opposite to each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0101">While in a cutoff state, this construction causes a depletion layer to expand from the field relaxation region <b>113</b> between the field relaxation region <b>113</b> and the drain region <b>102</b> in response to drain potential, and hereby this construction causes the semiconductor body to be depleted. For this reason, leakage current can be reduced in comparison with the first embodiment, and consequently the cutoff property, i.e. voltage withstanding while in a cutoff state, is improved.

If the semiconductor device is configured so that the second conductivity type field relaxation region <b>113</b> is formed on the main surface of the semiconductor body in a way that the field relaxation region <b>113</b> is kept in a prescribed distance away from the portion in which the semiconductor body is in contact with the gate electrode <b>106</b> with the source region and the gate insulating film <b>105</b> placed in-between, and in a way that the field relaxation region <b>113</b> is in contact with at least one of the source region <b>103</b> (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>), the withstanding voltage region <b>109</b> (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>) and the metallic region <b>112</b> (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>), it serves for the object of this embodiment.</div>

<heading>Seventh Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0111">Next, a description will be provided for a seventh embodiment. The above described planar type MOSFET of silicon carbide is disclosed, for example, in V. V. Afanasev, M. Bassler, G. Pensl and M. Schulz, Phys. Stat, Sol(A) 162 (1997) 321. This disclosure has made it known that defective crystal structures, i.e. a quantity of interface states, are present in the interface between a gate insulating film and an inversion type channel region. By this, a quantity of interface states are present in the inversion type channel on the surface of a channel region, which has been formed by applying voltage onto a gate electrode, and these interface states function as electron traps. For this reason, channel mobility can not be increased, and consequently this causes a problem of increasing the on state resistance of the planar type MOSFET of silicon carbide. Against this background, with regard to this embodiment, a description will be provided for a semiconductor device which realizes low on state resistance with high voltage, and for a method for manufacturing the semiconductor device. Incidentally, all the embodiments have described the widegap semiconductors citing a case that polycrystalline silicon is a semiconductor material to be used for the widegap semiconductors whose bandgap is different from those of a silicon carbide semiconductor and a wide bandgap semiconductor.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0114">First, an n type semiconductor body <b>100</b> is prepared by forming an nâˆ’ type drain region <b>102</b> on an n+ type silicon carbide substrate <b>101</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</figref>. Concentration and thickness of the drain region <b>102</b> are, for example, 1Ã—10<sup>16 </sup>cm<sup>âˆ’3 </sup>and 10 Î¼m (micro meter(s)) respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0115">Next, a polycrystalline silicon layer is grown, for example, to a thickness of 5000 â„« (angstrom(s)) through a low pressure CVD process, and hereafter the polycrystalline silicon layer is doped with impurities by diffusing phosphorus in a POCl<sub>3 </sub>atmosphere at 800Â° C.

After the doping, the source region <b>103</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24B</figref> is formed by etching a prescribed portion of the polycrystalline silicon layer through reactive ion etching processes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0116">Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24C</figref>, a silicon oxide film is grown to a thickness of 500 â„« (angstrom(s)) through atmospheric CVD processes, and hereby a gate insulating film <b>105</b> of the grown film is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0117">Then, a polycrystalline silicon layer is grown, for example, to a thickness of 3,500 â„« (angstrom(s)) through a low pressure CVD process, and hereafter the polycrystalline silicon layer is doped with impurities by diffusing phosphorus in a POCl<sub>3 </sub>atmosphere at 950Â° C.

After the doping, a gate electrode <b>106</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25A</figref> is formed by etching a prescribed portion of the polycrystalline silicon layer through reactive ion etching processes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0118">Thence, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25B</figref>, an interlayer dielectric <b>110</b> is formed by growing a silicon oxide film to a thickness of 1.0 Î¼m (micro meter(s)) through a low pressure CVD process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0119">Finally, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25C</figref>, a drain electrode <b>108</b> is formed by growing a titanium nickel film in the rear surface of the n+ type silicon carbide substrate <b>101</b> through sputtering processes. Hereafter, a source electrode <b>107</b> is formed by making contact holes in prescribed portions of the interlayer dielectric <b>110</b> and the gate insulating film <b>105</b>, and subsequently by growing an aluminum film thereon through sputtering processes. In this way, the semiconductor device, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, according to the seventh embodiment of the present invention is completed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0120">Next, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> will provide a detailed description for operations of the semiconductor device thus completed according to the seventh embodiment of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0121"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> is a diagram to show an energy band profile of the semiconductor. In the figure, the left half of the diagram shows an energy band profile of n type silicon of which the source region <b>103</b> is made up, and the right half of the diagram shows an energy band profile of n type silicon carbide (4H-SiC) of which the drain region <b>102</b> is made up. Although polycrystalline silicon is used as a material of which the source region <b>103</b> is made up in the seventh embodiment, this figure will describe the energy band profile of the semiconductor citing an energy band profile of silicon. Incidentally, in order to avoid a complicated explanation, this description will take up energy levels accompanying ideal heterojunciton, because interface states do not exist in the heterojunction interface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0122"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> shows the energy band profile which appears while the n type silicon and the n type silicon carbide are not in contact with each other. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, with regard to silicon, electron affinity is denominated by Ï‡ <b>1</b>; work function (energy difference between vacuum level and Fermi level) by Ï†<b>1</b>; Fermi energy (energy difference between conduction band and Fermi level) by Î´<b>1</b>; and bandgap by E<sub>G1</sub>. Similarly, with regard to silicon carbide, electron affinity is denominated by Ï‡<b>2</b>; work function by Ï†<b>2</b>; Fermi energy by Î´<b>2</b>; and bandgap by E<sub>G2</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0123">When the silicon and the silicon carbide are brought into contact with each other and heterojunction is formed between the silicon and the silicon carbide, an energy band profile appears as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>. An energy barrier Î”EC exists in an junction interface between silicon and silicon carbide due to the difference in electron affinity Ï‡ between silicon and silicon carbide. This is expressed with
<br/>
Î”<i>EC=Ï‡</i>1âˆ’Ï‡2
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0124">In the semiconductor device according to the seventh embodiment of the present invention, if the drain electrode <b>108</b> is applied with positive voltage Vd while the gate electrode <b>106</b> is grounded, an energy band profile in the heterojunction interface between the drain region <b>102</b> and the source region <b>103</b> which is made up of n type polycrystalline silicon is indicated roughly with solid lines in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>. A depletion layer expands on the side of the drain region <b>102</b> in response to the drain voltage Vd. On the other hand, electrons on the side of the source region <b>103</b> which is made up of n type polycrystalline silicon can not clear the energy barrier Î”EC, and the electrons accumulate in the heterojunction interface between the drain region <b>102</b> and the source region <b>103</b> which is made up of n type polycrystalline silicon. Accordingly, no element current virtually flows. An electric line of force, which corresponds to the depletion layer that expands across the drain region <b>102</b>, ends in the layer in which the electrons accumulate. As a result, electric field does not virtually extend towards the source region <b>103</b> which is made up of n type polycrystalline silicon. Consequently, even if the drain electrode <b>108</b> is applied with high voltage, the source region <b>103</b> which is made up of n type polycrystalline silicon does not break down before the other regions break down, and accordingly the cutoff state is maintained. In other words, the semiconductor device according to the seventh embodiment of the present invention has high drain voltage withstanding.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0125">Next, if the gate electrode <b>106</b> is applied with positive voltage, electric field acts on the heterojunction interface between the drain region <b>102</b> and the source region <b>103</b> which is made up of n type polycrystalline silicon. This makes the energy barrier Î”EC in the heterojunction interface thinner as indicated with broken lines in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>. When this energy barrier Î”EC become sufficiently as thin as 100 â„« (angstrom(s)), electrons pass through the energy barrier Î”EC as tunnel phenomenon. As a result, the tunnel phenomenon occurs and current starts flowing, even if the drain voltage Vd is lower than a prescribed voltage Vb.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0126">Furthermore, if the gate electrode <b>106</b> is grounded and the application of the positive voltage is terminated, this makes the energy barrier Î”EC become as thick as it was before. Consequently, element current stops flowing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0127">The semiconductor device according to the seventh embodiment of the present invention performs switching operations as described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0128">In addition, the semiconductor according to the seventh embodiment does not have a channel region which MOSFETs have, and this enables on state resistance to be lowered. In other words, low on state resistance can be realized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0129">As described above, the semiconductor device according to this embodiment comprises: the first conductivity type widegap semiconductor body which is formed of the widegap semiconductor that is formed by growing the drain region <b>102</b> on the substrate region <b>101</b>; the source region <b>103</b> which forms heterojunciton with the widegap semiconductor body, and which is formed of a semiconductor material whose bandgap is different from that of the widegap semiconductor; the gate electrode <b>106</b> which is arranged with the gate insulating film <b>105</b> placed underneath in the portion of heterojunction between the widegap semiconductor body and the source region <b>103</b>; the source electrode <b>107</b> which is formed in a way that the source electrode <b>107</b> is in contact with the hetero-semiconductor region; and the drain electrode <b>108</b> which is formed in a way that the drain electrode <b>108</b> is in contact with the widegap semiconductor body <b>3</b>. In addition, the semiconductor according to this embodiment is configured in a way that the gate insulating film <b>105</b> is made up of the grown film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0130">If the gate electrode <b>106</b> is applied with positive voltage and the energy barrier Î”EC in the heterojunction is made thinner, carriers can pass through the thinner barrier (tunnel phenomenon). In other words, main current which flows in this semiconductor device can be managed if the thickness of the energy barrier Î”EC is controlled by the electric field from the gate electrode <b>106</b> while the drain electrode <b>108</b> is applied with positive voltage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0131">For the above described reason, the semiconductor device according to the present invention does have a channel region which MOSFETs have, and this enables on state resistance to be lowered. In addition, since the grown film is used for the gate insulating film <b>105</b>, the thickness of the gate insulating film <b>105</b> is virtually even. Accordingly, both the drain region <b>102</b> which forms heterojunction and the source region <b>103</b> which is made up of n type polycrystalline silicon can be applied evenly with electric field by the gate electrode <b>106</b>. As a result, the energy barrier Î”EC of the heterojunciton between the drain region <b>102</b> and the source region <b>103</b> which is made up of n type polycrystalline silicon can be made thinner effectively. In other words, main current which flows in the semiconductor device can be increased, and on state resistance can be further reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0132">In addition, the method for manufacturing the semiconductor device according to this embodiment comprises: a step for selectively forming the source region <b>103</b> which forms heterojunction with the widegap semiconductor body, which is made up of a semiconductor material whose bandgap is different from that of the widegap semiconductor, on the first conductivity type widegap semiconductor body which is made of the widegap semiconductor; a step for forming the gate insulating film <b>105</b> which is made of a grown film on the widegap semiconductor body and the source region <b>103</b>; a step for forming the gate electrode <b>106</b> on the gate insulating film <b>105</b>; a step for forming the source electrode <b>107</b> in a way that the source electrode <b>107</b> is in contact with the source region <b>103</b>; and a step for forming the drain electrode <b>108</b> in a way that the drain electrode <b>108</b> is in contact with the widegap semiconductor body. This constitution enables the semiconductor device according to this embodiment to be realized with ease.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0133">Furthermore, since silicon carbide whose dielectric breakdown field is high is used for the widegap semiconductor, a higher voltage semiconductor device can be realized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0134">Additionally, polycrystalline silicon is used for a semiconductor material whose bandgap is different from that of a widegap semiconductor, processing such as etching and control of conductivity becomes easier. Incidentally, the same effect can be brought about when polycrystalline silicon and amorphous silicon are used instead of monocrystalline silicon</div>

Hereafter, a source electrode <b>107</b> is formed by making contact holes in prescribed portions of the interlayer dielectric <b>110</b> and the gate insulating film <b>105</b>, and subsequently by growing an aluminum film thereon through sputtering processes. In this way, the semiconductor device, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, according to the eighth embodiment of the present invention is completed. The semiconductor device thus completed according to the eighth embodiment of the present invention comprises: the first conductivity type widegap semiconductor body which is formed of the widegap semiconductor that is formed by growing the drain region <b>102</b> on the substrate region <b>101</b>; the source region <b>103</b> which forms heterojunciton with the widegap semiconductor body, and which is formed of a semiconductor material whose bandgap is different from that of the widegap semiconductor; the trench <b>116</b> which is formed in an outer periphery of the source region <b>103</b> in a way that the trench <b>116</b> penetrates through the source region <b>103</b> in the depth direction and reaches the widegap semiconductor body; the gate electrode <b>106</b> which is arranged with the gate insulating film <b>105</b> placed underneath inside the trench <b>116</b> in the portion of the heterojunction between the widegap semiconductor body and the source region <b>103</b>; the source electrode <b>107</b> which is formed in a way that the source electrode <b>107</b> is in contact with the source region <b>103</b>; and the drain electrode <b>108</b> which is formed in a way that the drain electrode <b>108</b> is in contact with the widegap semiconductor body. In addition, the semiconductor according to this embodiment is configured in a way that the gate insulating film <b>105</b> is made up of the grown film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0143">The semiconductor device according to this embodiment includes the trench gate structure in addition to the effects brought about by the seventh embodiment. For this reason, the semiconductor enables elements to be micronized, and also enables the on state resistance to be reduced. In addition, the gate insulating film <b>105</b> is formed in a way that the gate insulating film <b>105</b> is orthogonal to the heterojunciton interface between the drain region <b>102</b> and the source region <b>103</b> which is made up of n type polycrystalline silicon. This makes it possible to shorten the length of the electric line of force from the gate electrode <b>106</b> to the heterojunction interface between the drain region <b>102</b> and the source region <b>103</b> which is made up of n type polycrystalline silicon. For this reason, it is made possible to improve capability of controlling the thickness of the energy barrier Î”EC by the electric field from the gate electrode <b>106</b>. In other words, application of lower gate voltage can make thinner the energy barrier Î”EC of the heterojunction between the drain region <b>102</b> and the source region <b>103</b> which is made up of n type polycrystalline silicon. Accordingly, main current can be controlled by the gate voltage with ease.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0144">In addition, the field relaxation region <b>113</b> which is a second conductivity type widegap semiconductor region is formed, in a prescribed portion of the drain region <b>102</b> which is a part of the first conductivity type widegap semiconductor body, in a way that the field relaxation region <b>113</b> is connected with the source region <b>103</b>. For this reason, while the gate electrode <b>106</b> and the source electrode <b>107</b> are grounded and the drain electrode <b>108</b> is applied with high voltage, electric field generated in the portion of the heterojunction between the drain region <b>102</b> and the source region <b>103</b> which is made up of n type polycrystalline silicon is relaxed by a depletion layer which extends from the PN junction interface between the drain region <b>102</b> and the field relaxation region <b>113</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0145">Furthermore, the conduction region <b>114</b> which is a first conductivity type widegap semiconductor region whose concentration of impurities is higher than that of the drain region <b>102</b> is formed, in a way that the conduction region <b>114</b> is connected (in contact) with the source region <b>103</b>, in a prescribed portion of the drain region <b>102</b> which is a part of the widegap semiconductor body that is opposite to the gate electrode <b>106</b> with the gate insulating film <b>105</b> of a silicon oxide film (TEOS film) placed in-between. This makes smaller an expansion of the depletion layer, which is formed by diffusion potential between the source region <b>103</b> which is made up of n type polycrystalline silicon and the conduction field <b>114</b> whose concentration of impurities is higher than that of the drain region <b>102</b>, to the conduction region <b>114</b> whose concentration of impurities is higher than that of the drain region <b>102</b>. This causes the energy barrier Î”EC to be thinner. Consequently, application of lower gate voltage can make thinner the energy barrier Î”EC of the heterojunction, and main current can be controlled by the gate voltage more easily.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0146">Moreover, a prescribed portion of the source region <b>103</b> which is made up of n type polycrystalline silicon includes a portion whose concentration of impurities is different.

In addition, according to this embodiment, the source contact region <b>120</b> which is made up of high concentration of n+ type polycrystalline silicon is formed in a prescribed portion of the source region <b>103</b>. This enables the contact resistance of the source electrode <b>107</b> to be reduced, and accordingly enables the on state resistance to be reduced further.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0147">Additionally, the silicon oxide film which is grown by chemical vapor deposition processes with TEOS used for a material gas is employed for the gate insulating film <b>105</b>. This makes less defects cause in the gate insulating film <b>105</b> while growing the gate insulating film <b>105</b>. Accordingly, reliability of the gate insulating film <b>105</b> is improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0148">A method for manufacturing the semiconductor device according to this embodiment comprises: a step for forming the source region <b>103</b> which forms heterojunction with the widegap semiconductor body, which is made up of a semiconductor material whose bandgap is different from that of the widegap semiconductor, on the first conductivity type widegap semiconductor body which is made of the widegap semiconductor; a step for forming the trench <b>116</b> which penetrates through the source region <b>103</b> in the depth direction and reaches the widegap semiconductor body; a step for forming the gate insulating film <b>105</b> of the grown film at least inside the trench <b>116</b>; a step for forming the gate electrode <b>106</b> at least on the gate insulating film <b>105</b> inside the trench <b>116</b>; a step for forming the source electrode <b>107</b> in a way that the source electrode <b>107</b> is in contact with the source region <b>103</b>; and a step for forming the drain electrode <b>108</b> in a way that the drain electrode <b>108</b> is in contact with the widegap semiconductor body.</div>

<heading>Ninth Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0155">Next, a description will be provided for ninth and tenth embodiments. For example, in a case that a field effect transistor is manufactured, damages are caused on a silicon carbide epitaxial layer of each of a hetero-semiconductor and a semiconductor body by a dry etching process for forming a trench structure. If damages are caused on those, this causes a problem of deteriorating properties of the transistor since this heterojunction interface corresponds to a channel region which MOSFETs and the like have. By contrast, in a case that a wet etching process is employed instead of the dry etching process, this brings an advantage that damage which would be caused by an ion etching process is not caused. However, stability of the etching process is restrained, and the yields are also restrained. In addition, in a case that the wet etching process is employed, the wet etching process causes a problem of hindering a trench from being easily formed in a silicon carbide epitaxial layer, since silicon carbide is chemically extremely stable element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0156">A description will be provided for a semiconductor device and a method for manufacturing the semiconductor device according to these embodiments.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0159">When the above described field effect transistor is manufactured, a layer of the aforementioned hetero-semiconductor material is formed on the drain region <b>102</b> of the semiconductor body <b>100</b>. Then, only specified portions in the layer of the hetero-semiconductor material are oxidized in a selective manner, and hereafter the oxide films which are formed by the oxidation process is removed. Thence, the gate insulating film <b>105</b> and gate electrode <b>106</b> are formed on the portions where the oxide films are removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0160">Next, a description will be provided for steps to be taken in the manufacturing of the field effect transistor shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> with reference to drawings. First, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34A</figref>, a silicon carbide body <b>100</b> is formed by growing a low concentration n type drain region <b>102</b> on a high concentration n type substrate region <b>101</b>. In other words, a semiconductor body of silicon carbide (semiconductor body <b>100</b>) is formed. Incidentally, concentration of impurities and thickness of the drain region <b>102</b> are, for example, 1Ã—10<sup>16 </sup>cm<sup>âˆ’3 </sup>and 10 Î¼m (micro meter(s)) respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0161">Next, shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34B</figref>, a layer of polycrystalline silicon <b>130</b> which is a hetero-semiconductor material is grown on the drain region <b>102</b> through a low pressure CVD process or the like. In this point, thickness of the polycrystalline silicon <b>130</b> is, for example, 500 nm. Instead of this, the polycrystalline silicon <b>130</b> may be polycrystalline silicon which is recrystallized by a laser anneal process or the like after being grown by an electron beam evaporation process, a sputtering process or the like. A monocrystalline silicon with preferable crystalline properties which is grown heteroepitaxially by a molecular beam epitaxial process may be used instead of the polycrystalline silicon <b>130</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0162">Then, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34C</figref>, the polycrystalline silicon <b>130</b> is doped with phosphorus through a solid phase diffusion process with POCl<sub>3</sub>.

Although the conductivity type of the polycrystalline silicon <b>130</b> has been described as n type, the type may be p type which is obtained by a solid phase diffusion process with boron. In addition, a combination of an ion implantation process with a thermal process for activation after the ion implantation process may be used for the doping.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0163">Thence, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34D</figref>, a silicon nitride film <b>131</b> to be an antioxidant film is grown on the surface of the layer of the polycrystalline silicon <b>130</b> which is a hetero-semiconductor material through a low pressure CVD process or the like. In this point, the thickness of the silicon nitride film <b>131</b> is, for example, 100 nm. Incidentally, although the antioxidant film has been described as the silicon nitride film <b>131</b>, whatever material may be used if the material has a property of barrier inhibiting oxidation and if a film made up of the material can be removed easily. Hereafter, lithographic and etching processes transfer patterns onto the silicon nitride film <b>131</b> which is an antioxidant film.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0164">Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34E</figref>, an oxidation film <b>132</b> is formed by thermally oxidizing the layer of the polycrystalline silicon <b>130</b> which is the hetero-semiconductor material that is not covered by the silicon nitride film <b>131</b> which is an antioxidant film. This thermal oxidation process is performed, for example, at a temperature of 1,000Â° C. (Celsius), in a mixed combustion atmosphere of H<sub>2</sub>O and O<sub>2</sub>, and with a mixing ratio of H<sub>2</sub>O to O<sub>2 </sub>standing at 3:7. In this point, although the thermal oxidation process has been described citing an example of what is called a wet oxidation process, a dry thermal oxidation process, a pyrogenic oxidation process, a stream oxidation process and the like may be used instead.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0169">As described above, according to the ninth embodiment of the present invention, the source region <b>103</b> is formed by selectively oxidizing the polycrystalline silicon <b>130</b> in specified portion and by removing the oxide film <b>132</b> produced.

Additionally, capability of controlling is higher and the yields do not decrease in comparison with the case of employing a wet etching process. Consequently, silicon carbide field effect transistors with low on state resistance can be manufactured stably. In addition, since a thermal oxidation process is employed for the oxidizing, the oxidizing can be performed with better capability of controlling and easily. Furthermore, since the oxidizing is performed while partially covering the hetero-semiconductor material by an antioxidant film, the oxide film <b>132</b> can be formed in a selective manner with ease. Additionally, since the polycrystalline silicon <b>130</b> is used as the hetero-semiconductor material, the oxidizing and the doping can be performed with ease.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0170">Furthermore, if the polycrystalline silicon <b>130</b> in a portion where the oxide film <b>132</b> is formed is oxidized after being ion-implanted by use of a method according to a tenth embodiment for which a detailed description will be provided later, the oxidizing can be accelerated in the depth direction, and a horizontal expansion of the oxidizing can be decreased.

At this time, the oxidizing has to be performed in a way that only a part of the ion-implanted region <b>136</b> which is located on the side of the drain region <b>102</b> is oxidized. This thermal oxidation process is performed, for example, at a temperature of 1,100Â° C. (Celsius) and in a steamed atmosphere, i.e. in a partial steam pressure of 1.0 atm. In this point, although the thermal oxidation process has been described citing an example of a steam oxidation process, a dry thermal oxidation process, a wet oxidation process, a pyrogenic oxidation process and the like may be used instead. Here, since the drain region <b>102</b> and the layer of the polycrystalline silicon <b>130</b> which is a hetero-semiconductor material of which the oxide film is formed are ion-implanted with boron <b>135</b>, crystalline properties and concentration of impurities are different between the ion-implanted region <b>136</b> and the region which has not been ion-implanted. For this reason, only a speed at which the oxidizing progresses in the depth direction is accelerated. As a consequence, an expansion of the oxidizing in the horizontal direction can be reduced. Although this embodiment has been described citing a case that an oxidation speed is accelerated by changing crystalline properties and concentration of impurities through an ion-implantation process with boron <b>135</b>, an element to be used for an ion-implantation process is not limited to this element. For example, if phosphorus is implanted, this can also accelerate an oxidation process since this implantation changes crystalline properties and concentration of impurities. Even if silicon or argon is ion-implanted in a way that only crystalline properties of the ion-implanted region is made different from those of the region which is not ion-implanted, an anisotropy of the oxidizing can be exhibited.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0180">Then, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38D</figref>, after the silicon nitride film <b>131</b> which is an antioxidant film is removed, for example, with phosphoric acid solutions, the oxidation film <b>132</b> which is formed, for example, of mixed solutions of ammonium fluoride and hydrofluoric acid is removed. In this way, the trench <b>116</b> is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0181">Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39A</figref>, a silicon oxide layer is grown as the gate insulating film <b>105</b> by a plasma CVD process or the like, and hereafter a polycrystalline silicon layer <b>133</b> to be the gate electrode <b>106</b> is grown through a low pressure CVD process or the like. Subsequently, the polycrystalline silicon layer <b>133</b> to be the gate electrode <b>106</b> is doped with phosphorus through a solid phase diffusion process with POCl<sub>3</sub>. Conditions for the diffusion are, for example, at a temperature of 950Â° C. (Celsius) and for 20 minutes. Although the doping has been described citing an example of the solid phase diffusion process, a combination of an ion implantation process with a thermal process for activation after the ion implantation process may be used for the doping.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0182">Then, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39B</figref>, the gate electrode <b>106</b> is formed by photolithographic and etching processes, and hereafter an interlayer dielectric <b>110</b> is grown. The interlayer dielectric <b>110</b> and the gate insulating film <b>105</b> are partially removed by lithographic and etching processes, and subsequently contact holes are made.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0183">Thence, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39C</figref>, aluminum is deposited by a sputtering process or the like in a way that the deposited aluminum is in contact with the source region <b>103</b> which is made up of the polycrystalline silicon <b>130</b>, and hereafter the source electrode <b>107</b> is formed by lithographic and etching processes. In addition, a titanium and aluminum layer is grown by a sputtering process or the like in a way that the grown layer is in contact with the substrate region <b>101</b>, and hereby the drain electrode <b>108</b> is formed. In this way, the silicon carbide field effect transistor shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> is completed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0184">In this manner, the tenth embodiment of the present invention brings about the following effect in addition to the effect which is caused by the ninth embodiment. Neither the drain region <b>102</b> nor the source region <b>103</b> which is located in the heterojunction interface which is adjacent to the gate insulating film <b>105</b> are damaged by an ion etching process as in a case of employing a dry etching process. Accordingly, this is because the trench <b>116</b> is formed by removing the oxide film <b>132</b> which has been formed by oxidizing, selectively in terms of locations, the drain region <b>102</b> and the source region <b>103</b> which is made up of a hetero-semiconductor material. This makes it possible to manufacture field effect transistors, with lower on state resistance, which is free from deterioration in transistor properties. Since silicon carbide is used as a semiconductor material of which a semiconductor body is formed, the oxidizing can be performed with ease. In addition, this makes it possible to manufacture high voltage field effect transistors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0185">If one of a portion in the source region <b>103</b> in which the oxide film <b>132</b> is formed and a portion in the drain region <b>102</b> which is a part of the semiconductor body where the oxide film <b>132</b> is formed is oxidized in the above described manner after being ion-implanted, or if both of the two portions is oxidized in the above described manner after being ion-implanted, the oxidizing in the depth direction is accelerated since crystalline properties and concentration of impurities exhibited by a region which is ion-implanted become different from those exhibited by a portion which is not ion-implanted. In other words, an ion implantation process can add anisotropy to an oxidation speed. For this reason, an expansion of the oxidizing in the horizontal direction can be reduced, and accordingly an oxidation process can be performed in a selective manner with precision. In addition, depth of the ion-implanting can be controlled by changing an amount of energy of ions while ion-implanting. This makes it possible to ion-implant any portion in the source region <b>103</b> and the drain region <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0186">According to this embodiment, if an ion implantation process and an oxidation process are performed while covering a hetero-semiconductor material with an antioxidant film selectively in terms of locations, this enables the selective oxidation process to be performed in self alignment with high precision.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0187">Although this embodiment has been described citing an example of a combination of an ion implantation process, an oxidation process and a process of removing an oxide film by which the trench <b>116</b> is formed, these processes may be repeated separately. For example, the following flow of processes is allowed. At first only polycrystalline silicon <b>130</b> is oxidized selectively, and the oxide film is removed. Hereafter, a drain region <b>102</b> is ion-implanted selectively, and an ion-implanted region <b>136</b> is formed. Then, the ion-implanted region <b>136</b> is oxidized, and subsequently the oxide film is removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0188">According to this embodiment, if a part of a surface of the hetero-semiconductor material is covered with an antioxidant film selectively in terms of locations before an ion implantation process and then is ion-implanted, and if subsequently an oxidation process is performed while being covered by the antioxidant film after the ion implantation process, this enables the selective oxidation process to be performed in self alignment with high precision. Accordingly, an oxidation process and an ion implantation process can be performed in a micronized manner, and furthermore this makes it possible to manufacture silicon carbide field effect transistor with low on state resistance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0189">It should be noted that, although the aforementioned ninth and tenth embodiments have been described citing a case that polycrystalline silicon <b>130</b> is used for a layer of a hetero-semiconductor material of which the source region <b>103</b> is formed, a hetero-semiconductor material of which the source region <b>103</b> is formed may be comprised of at least, for example, one of monocrystalline silicon, polycrystalline silicon, amorphous silicon and silicon germanium. Although 4H is typical of a silicon carbide crystal group which is used as a semiconductor material of which a semiconductor body is formed, other crystal groups such as 6H and 3C may be used. As a matter of course, a semiconductor material of which a semiconductor body is formed is not limited to silicon carbide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0190">In addition, although this embodiment has been described citing a case that a conductivity type of a semiconductor body is n type, p type also brings about the same effect.

<heading>Eleventh Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0191">Next, a description will be provided for an eleventh embodiment. According to conventional structures, in an nâˆ’ type polycrystalline silicon layer and a portion of heterojunction which is formed between an n+ type polycrystalline region and an nâˆ’ type epitaxial region, leakage current which is determined physically by the height of a hetero-barrier is caused. For this reason, reduction in leakage current is restrained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0192">This embodiment is to provide a semiconductor device (a high voltage field effect transistor) which can reduce leakage current with ease, which is caused in a hetero-interface, while maintaining the same operability as conventional semiconductor devices have. This embodiment causes current to flow in a portion of a heterojunction (hereinafter referred to as a first heterojunction), which constitutes a channel, between a first source region (a first hetero-semiconductor region) of a first conductivity type and a drain region, while in a conduction state. For this reason, this embodiment brings about an effect that an on state resistance which is equivalent to that of conventional semiconductor devices is obtained. In addition, this embodiment causes an effect that leakage current can be reduced in comparison with conventional semiconductor devices, since a portion of heterojunction (hereinafter referred to as a portion of second heterojunction) between a second source region (a second hetero-semiconductor region) and a drain region defines the second source region as a second conductivity type while in a cutoff state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0193"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> is a cross sectional view to show the semiconductor device according to the eleventh embodiment. The figure shows a structure in which two cells as structural units are opposite to each other. This embodiment will be described citing an example of a high voltage field effect transistor whose substrate material is silicon carbide. For example, an nâˆ’ type drain region <b>102</b> is formed on an n+ type substrate region <b>101</b> whose silicon carbide polytype is 4H type. For example, a first source region <b>103</b> (concentration source region) which is made up of n type polycrystalline silicon and a second source region <b>141</b> (a second hetero-semiconductor region) which is made up of p type polycrystalline silicon are formed in a way that the first source region <b>103</b> and the second source region <b>141</b> are in contact with the main surface (the upper surface of the drain region <b>102</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>) which is the opposite side of the drain region <b>102</b> relative to the junction surface between the drain region <b>102</b> and the substrate region <b>101</b>. In other words, a portion of junction between the drain region <b>102</b> and the first source region <b>103</b> as well as a portion of junction between the drain region <b>102</b> and the second source region <b>141</b> is formed of heterojunction which is made up of silicon carbide and polycrystalline silicon whose bandgaps are different from each other. In addition, energy barrier exists in the junction interface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0194">In addition, for example, a gate insulating film <b>105</b> which is formed of a silicon oxide film is formed in a way that the gate insulating film <b>105</b> is connected with the junction surface between the first source region <b>103</b> and the drain region <b>102</b>. Additionally, a gate electrode <b>106</b> which is insulated by the gate insulating film <b>105</b> is formed. In addition, a source electrode <b>107</b> is formed on the surface which is the opposite side of the first source region <b>103</b> and the second source region <b>141</b> relative to the junction surfaces between the first source region <b>103</b> and the drain region <b>102</b> and between the second source region <b>141</b> and the drain region <b>102</b> (the upper surfaces of the first source region <b>103</b> and the second source region <b>141</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>). Furthermore, a drain electrode <b>108</b> is formed on a substrate region <b>101</b> which is made up of silicon carbide in a way that the drain electrode <b>108</b> is connected with the substrate region <b>101</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0195">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>, this embodiment has been described citing an example of what is called a trench type structure, in which a trench is formed on the surface of the drain region <b>102</b> and the gate electrode <b>106</b> is formed in the trench with the gate insulating film <b>105</b> placed underneath. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>, however, what is called a planar type, in which no trench is formed in the drain region <b>102</b>, may be also used for the structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0196">Next, a description will be provided for a method for manufacturing the silicon carbide semiconductor device shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> according to the eleventh embodiment of the present invention with reference to drawings. First, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46A</figref>, an n type silicon carbide semiconductor body is formed by growing the nâˆ’ type drain region <b>102</b> on the n+ type substrate region <b>101</b> epitaxially. Then, polycrystalline silicon is deposited on the n type silicon carbide semiconductor substrate region <b>101</b>, for example, by an LP-CDV process. Hereafter, p type polycrystalline silicon layers (corresponding to portions indicated by reference numerals <b>103</b> and <b>141</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>) are formed by being doped with boron, for example, in a BBr<sup>3 </sup>atmosphere. Incidentally, the polycrystalline silicon layer may be formed through being recrystallized by a laser anneal process after depositing silicon by an electron beam evaporation process, a sputtering process, or the like. Or else, the polycrystalline silicon layer may be formed of monocrystalline silicon which has been grown epitaxially by a molecular beam epitaxy process. In addition, a combination of an ion implantation process with a thermal process for activation after the ion plantation process may be used for a doping. With regard to the drain region <b>102</b>, the concentration of impurities is 1Ã—10<sup>16 </sup>cm<sup>âˆ’3</sup>, and the thickness is 10 Î¼m (micro meter(s)) respectively. For example, the thickness of the polycrystalline silicon layer is 0.5 Î¼m (micro meter(s)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0197">Then, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46B</figref>, a silicon nitride film is grown on the polycrystalline silicon layers (<b>103</b> and <b>141</b>), for example, by an LP-CVD process or the like. Hereafter, a mask plate <b>145</b> is formed by lithographic and etching processes. It should be noted that, although the manufacturing method has been described citing a case that a material for the mask plate is a silicon nitride film, whatever material may be used if the material allows an etching process to be performed in a selective manner, and if a layer which is formed of the material can be removed easily.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0198">Thence, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46C</figref>, a trench with a prescribed depth is formed by etching the surfaces of the polycrystalline silicon layers (<b>103</b> and <b>141</b>) and the drain region <b>102</b> through a reactive ion etching process (a dry etching process). Incidentally, other etching processes such as a wet etching process) may be used as a process for etching the polycrystalline silicon layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0199">Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>, the n type polycrystalline silicon layer is formed only in a portion which is in contact with a surface that has been etched, if doped with phosphorus, for example, in a POCl<sub>3 </sub>atmosphere while covered by the mask plate <b>145</b>. This is because phosphorus is introduced in the polycrystalline silicon layer through a surface which has been treated by an ion etching process, but not through a portion which is covered by the mask plate <b>145</b>. In other words, the n type first source region <b>103</b> and the p type second source region <b>141</b> are formed in this way.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0200">Then, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47B</figref>, after the mask plate <b>145</b> is removed, for example, with phosphoric acid solutions, the gate insulating film <b>105</b> is grown on the upper surfaces of the first source region <b>103</b> and the second source region <b>141</b> and along the inner wall of the trench. Furthermore, a polycrystalline silicon layer to be the gate electrode <b>106</b> is grown. Hereafter, the polycrystalline silicon layer to be the gate electrode <b>106</b> is doped with phosphorus through a solid phase diffusion process with POCl<sub>3</sub>. Thence, after the gate electrode <b>106</b> is formed by lithographic and etching processes, an interlayer dielectric is laid up. Then, the interlayer dielectric and the gate insulating film <b>105</b> are removed by lithographic and etching processes. Next, contact holes are made.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0201">Finally, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47C</figref>, the drain electrode <b>108</b> which is made up, for example, of titanium (Ti) and nickel (Ni) is formed on the substrate region <b>101</b> on the rear side. The source electrode <b>107</b> is formed by depositing titanium (Ti) and aluminum (Al) in order on the upper surfaces of the first source region <b>103</b> and the second source region <b>141</b> which is the upper side of the semiconductor device. In this way, the silicon carbide semiconductor device shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> according to the eleventh embodiment of the present invention is completed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0202">As described above, semiconductor devices according to the eleventh embodiment can be manufactured easily by use of conventional manufacturing technologies.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0203">Next, a description will be provided for operations of the semiconductor device. According to this embodiment, the semiconductor device is used in a way that, for example, the source electrode <b>107</b> is grounded and the drain electrode <b>108</b> is applied with positive potential. First, if the gate electrode <b>106</b> is applied, for example, with ground state potential or negative potential, a cutoff state is maintained. This is because energy barrier against conductive electrons is formed in each of the heterojunction interfaces between the first source region <b>103</b> and the drain region <b>102</b> and between the second source region <b>141</b> and the drain region <b>102</b>. In this point, since both the first source region <b>103</b> and the second source region <b>141</b> are made up of silicon materials, the difference Î”EC of energy barrier between the first source region <b>103</b> and the drain region <b>102</b> is equal to the difference Î”EC of energy barrier between the second source region <b>141</b> and the drain region <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0204">However, since Fermi energy which is defined as the difference between conduction band and Fermi level is different between the first source region <b>103</b> which is n type and the second source region <b>141</b> which is p type, the width of the depletion layer expanding towards the junction interface between the first source region <b>103</b> and the drain region <b>102</b> is different from the width of the depletion layer expanding towards the junction interface between the second source region <b>141</b> and the drain region <b>102</b>. In other words, the width of a depletion layer expanding from the junction interface between the second source region <b>141</b> and the drain region <b>102</b> is larger than the width of a depletion layer expanding from the junction interface between the first source region <b>103</b> and the drain region <b>102</b>. For this reason, higher cutoff performance can be obtained, and hereby leakage current can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0205">Moreover, in a case that, for example, the concentration of impurities in the second source region <b>141</b> is made higher than that in the first source region <b>103</b>, a depletion layer which is caused by a built-in electric field of a PN diode that is formed of the second source region <b>141</b> and the first source region <b>103</b> expands towards the first source region. For this reason, leakage current in the portion of heterojunction between the first source region and the drain region can be also reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0206">The manufacturing method according to this embodiment enables the first source region <b>103</b> to be formed by easily controlling the width of the first source region <b>103</b> in a way that the width of the first source region <b>103</b> is such that electric field from the gate electrode <b>106</b> reaches the first source region <b>103</b>. For this reason, if, for example, the gate electrode <b>106</b> is applied with negative potential and an inversion region is formed throughout the first source region <b>103</b>, cutoff performance as the semiconductor device can be further improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0207">According to this embodiment, while the first source region <b>103</b> is formed, impurities are introduced by a self alignment process through a portion in which the gate electrode <b>106</b> is in contact with the first source region <b>103</b> with the gate insulating film <b>105</b> placed in-between. For this reason, even if, for example, a semiconductor element which integrates a plurality of cells is formed, the width of the source region <b>103</b> can be controlled with precision, and accordingly unevenness of the cutoff properties can be also inhibited.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0208">In this way, according to this embodiment, higher cutoff properties can be realized in comparison with conventional structures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0209">Next, in a case that the gate electrode <b>106</b> is applied with positive potential in order to switch from a cutoff state to a conduction state, a gate field reaches the heterojunction interface in which the first source region <b>103</b> and the drain region <b>102</b> is in contact with each other with the gate insulating film <b>105</b> in-between. For this reason, a layer in which conductive electrons accumulate is formed in a portion of the first source region <b>103</b> and a portion of the drain region <b>102</b>, which are located in the vicinity of the gate electrode <b>106</b>. In other words, potential is suppressed in a portion of the junction interface between the first source region <b>103</b> and the drain region <b>102</b>, which is located in the vicinity of the gate electrode <b>106</b>, and on the side of the first region <b>103</b>. In addition, energy barrier on the side of the drain region <b>102</b> becomes steep. Consequently, conductive electrons can pass through the energy barrier.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0210">In this point, according to this embodiment, while the first source region <b>103</b> is formed, impurities are introduced by a self alignment process through a portion in which the gate electrode <b>106</b> is in contact with the first source region <b>103</b> with the gate insulating film <b>105</b> placed in-between. For this reason, even if, for example, a semiconductor element which integrates a plurality of cells is formed, the width of the source region <b>103</b> can be controlled with precision, and accordingly unevenness of on state resistance of each cell can be also inhibited. In other words, concentration of current can be inhibited, and thus higher reliability can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0211">Next, if the gate electrode <b>106</b> is again applied with ground state potential in order to switch from a conduction state to a cutoff state, this terminates the state that conductive electrons accumulate in the heterojunction interface between the first source region <b>103</b> and the drain region <b>102</b>, and hereby the tunneling through the energy barrier ends. Then, conductive electrons stop flowing from the first source region <b>103</b> to the drain region <b>102</b>, and conductive electrons which exist in the drain region <b>102</b> are depleted by flowing out to the substrate region <b>101</b>. Consequently, a depletion layer expands in the drain region <b>102</b> from the portion of heterojunction, and this brings about a cutoff state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0212">In addition, this embodiment can realize conduction in the reverse direction (a return current operation) in which, for example, the source electrode <b>107</b> is grounded and the drain electrode <b>108</b> is applied with negative potential, as in the case of conventional structures. If, for example, the source electrode <b>107</b> and the gate electrode <b>106</b> are applied with ground state potential and the drain electrode <b>108</b> is applied with prescribed positive potential, the energy barrier against conductive electrons disappears, and accordingly conductive electrons flow from the drain region <b>102</b> to the first source region <b>103</b> and the second source region <b>141</b>. This brings about a conduction state. In this point, conduction is caused by conductive electrons only, and without holes injected. This makes smaller loss which is brought about by reverse recovery current that is to occur in a transition from a reverse conduction state to a cutoff state. Incidentally, the above described gate electrode <b>106</b> can be used as a control electrode instead of being grounded.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0213">As described above, according to this embodiment, the configuration shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> can realize the same operations as conventional structures do. In addition, this configuration has the following advantages in comparison with conventional structures. Since the second source region <b>141</b> is formed as a second conductivity type, the portion of heterojunction between the second source region <b>141</b> and the drain region <b>102</b> enables leakage current to be reduced in comparison with conventional structures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0214">Moreover, in a case that, for example, the concentration of impurities in the second source region <b>141</b> is made higher than that in the first source region <b>103</b>, a depletion layer which is caused by a built-in electric field of a PN diode that is formed of the second source region <b>141</b> and the first source region <b>103</b> expands towards the first source region <b>103</b>. For this reason, leakage current in the portion of heterojunction between the first source region <b>103</b> and the drain region <b>102</b> can be also further reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0215">In addition, expansion of the depletion layer in the first source region <b>103</b> in the horizontal direction can be inhibited. For this reason, if the width of a channel which electric field from the gate electrode <b>106</b> reaches is controlled to an extent of being sufficiently minimum, this makes it possible to easily reduce leakage current in the portion of the first heterojunction between the first source region <b>103</b> and the drain region <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0216">Moreover, the expansion of the depletion layer in the first source region <b>103</b> in the horizontal direction can be formed in self alignment. For this reason, even if a plurality of unit cells are integrated, the first source region <b>103</b> can be formed homogeneously. As a result, maldistribution of leakage current hardly occurs while in a cutoff state, and maldistribution of on state resistance hardly occurs while in a conduction state. Accordingly, reliability is improved.</div>
<heading>Twelfth Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0217"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref> is a cross sectional view of a semiconductor device according to a twelfth embodiment of the present invention, and corresponds to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> of the eleventh embodiment.

In addition, a first field relaxation region <b>143</b> is formed in the surface of the drain region <b>102</b>, in a prescribed distance away from a portion in which a gate electrode <b>106</b> and the source region <b>103</b> are opposite to each other, and in a way that the first field relaxation region <b>143</b> is in contact with the first source region <b>103</b> or a second source region <b>141</b>. In addition, a second field relaxation region <b>144</b> is formed underneath the bottom of a trench on which the gate electrode <b>106</b> is formed in a way that the second field relaxation region <b>144</b> is in contact with the gate electrode <b>106</b> with the gate insulating film <b>105</b> placed in-between.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0219">While in a conduction state, this construction relaxes energy barrier in a heterojunction interface between the first source region <b>103</b> and the conduction region <b>114</b>, and accordingly higher conduction properties can be obtained. In other words, on state resistance becomes further smaller, and accordingly conduction performance is improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0220">In addition, while in a cutoff state, a depletion layer which corresponds with drain potential expands between the first field relaxation region <b>143</b> and the drain region <b>102</b> and between the second field relaxation region <b>144</b> and the drain region <b>102</b>. In other words, although a drain field is applied to the heterojunction interface between the first source region <b>103</b> and the drain region <b>102</b> and between the second source region <b>141</b> and the drain region <b>102</b> according to the eleventh embodiment, the twelfth embodiment causes the drain field to be relaxed by the first field relaxation region <b>143</b>. For this reason, leakage current is further reduced, and accordingly cutoff performance is further improved. In addition, since drain field which is applied to the gate insulating film <b>105</b> is relaxed by the second field relaxation region <b>144</b>, this relaxation enables dielectric breakdown of the gate insulating film <b>105</b> to hardly occur. Accordingly, reliability of the gate insulating film <b>105</b> can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0221">Furthermore, the thickness of the above described semiconductor body (the drain region <b>102</b>) underneath the second field relaxation region <b>144</b> is equal to that of the semiconductor body underneath the first field relaxation region <b>143</b>. For this reason, steps of the manufacturing can be simplified.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0222">Incidentally, although this embodiment has been described citing a case that all of the conduction region <b>114</b>, the first field relaxation region <b>143</b> and the second field relaxation region <b>144</b> are formed, if one of the regions is formed, this serves for the object of this embodiment.</div>
<heading>Thirteenth Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0223"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref> is a cross sectional view of a semiconductor device according to a thirteenth embodiment of the present invention, and corresponds to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> of the eleventh embodiment. For this embodiment, descriptions of operations which are the same as operations which are performed as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> will be omitted, and detailed descriptions will be provided for features which are different from those which have been described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0224">According to this embodiment, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>, an n+ type conduction region <b>114</b> whose concentration is higher than that of a drain region <b>102</b> is formed in a prescribed portion of a drain region <b>102</b> which is in contact with a gate electrode <b>106</b> (with a gate insulating film <b>105</b> placed in-between) and which is in contact with a first source region <b>103</b>. Unlike the twelfth embodiment, the conduction region <b>114</b> is formed, also, underneath the bottom of a trench on which a gate electrode <b>106</b> is formed with the gate insulating film <b>105</b> placed in-between.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0225">An aspect of the manufacturing method will be described below with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>. Manufacturing steps to be taken up to a step shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48A</figref> is the same as steps up to a step shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46C</figref> of the eleventh embodiment. Next, if doped with phosphorus, for example, in a POCl<sub>3 </sub>atmosphere and at a higher temperature while covered by the mask plates <b>145</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48B</figref>, phosphorus is introduced in the polycrystalline silicon layer through a surface which has been treated by an ion etching process, and additionally phosphorus is introduced in the silicon carbide layer through a surface of silicon carbide which has been treated by an ion etching process. As in the case of the eleventh embodiment, however, phosphorus is not introduced through a surface which has been covered by the mask plate <b>145</b>. For this reason, the n type polycrystalline silicon layer and the n+ type conduction region <b>114</b> are formed, at the same time, in the portions which are in contact with the surfaces that have been treated by the ion etching process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0226">Incidentally, although this embodiment has been described citing a case that introduction of impurities is carried out through a solid phase diffusion, other methods for introducing impurities such as an ion implantation method may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0227">Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48C</figref>, the gate insulating film <b>105</b>, the gate electrode <b>106</b>, the source electrode <b>107</b> and the drain electrode <b>108</b> are formed as in the case of the eleventh embodiment, and hereby the silicon carbide semiconductor device shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref> according to the thirteenth embodiment of the present invention is completed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0228">As described above, the semiconductor device according to this embodiment can be realized by use of conventional technologies with ease.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0229">While in a conduction state, this construction relaxes energy barrier in a heterojunction interface between the first source region <b>103</b> and the conduction region <b>114</b>, which is the same effects as the conduction region <b>114</b> brings about as shown in the twelfth embodiment, and accordingly higher conduction properties can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0230">In addition, the construction method shown in this embodiment enables the width of a portion, where the conduction region <b>114</b> is in contact with the first source region <b>103</b>, to be formed so that the width is sufficiently minimum with precision by a self alignment process at the same time. This makes it possible to inhibit maldistribution of current between each two cells while in a conduction state and while in the cutoff state. In addition, leakage current in the heterojunction interface between the first source region <b>103</b> and the conduction region <b>114</b> can be reduced to the utmost while in a cutoff state. Consequently, on state resistance can be reduced without cutoff performance being impaired to a large extent.</div>
<heading>Fourteenth Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0231"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref> is a cross sectional view of a semiconductor device according to a fourteenth embodiment of the present invention, and corresponds to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref> of the twelfth embodiment.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0232">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>, the semiconductor device of this embodiment is configured to include a conduction region <b>114</b>, a first field relaxation region <b>143</b> and a second field relaxation region <b>144</b>, as in the case of the twelfth embodiment. The semiconductor device is characterized in that the conduction region <b>114</b> and the second field relaxation region <b>144</b> can be formed by a self alignment process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0233">Hereafter, a description will be provided for a method for manufacturing the semiconductor device according to this embodiment with reference to drawings. Before starting a manufacturing step shown in <b>49</b>A, the following processes need to be completed. Before, for example, the polycrystalline silicon layer is formed in the step shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46A</figref> of the eleventh embodiment, the first field relaxation region <b>143</b> has been formed. Hereafter, the same step as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46A</figref> of the eleventh embodiment is followed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0234">Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49B</figref>, a mask plate <b>145</b> is formed, and hereafter a trench is formed by an ion etching process, in the same manner as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46B</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46C</figref> of the eleventh embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0235">Then, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49C</figref>, a second field relaxation region <b>144</b> is formed, for example, by an ion implantation process with aluminum ions or boron ions while covered by the mask plate <b>145</b>.</div>

A polycrystalline silicon layer is doped with phosphorus, for example, in a POCl<sub>3 </sub>atmosphere at a high temperature while covered by the mask plate <b>145</b>, and hereby phosphorus is introduced through a silicon carbide surface of the polycrystalline silicon layer which has been ion-etched.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0237">It should be noted that, although this embodiment has been described citing a case that the second source region <b>141</b> and the conduction region <b>114</b> are formed after the second field relaxation region <b>144</b> is formed, it does not matter whether the second source region <b>141</b> and the conduction region <b>114</b> or the second field relaxation region <b>144</b> are formed first.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0238">Finally, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50B</figref>, the silicon carbide semiconductor device shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref> according to the fourteenth embodiment of the present invention is completed by forming the gate insulating film <b>105</b>, the gate electrode <b>106</b>, the source electrode <b>107</b> and the drain electrode <b>108</b>, as in the case of the eleventh embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0239">It should be noted that, if the conduction region <b>114</b> is formed in a way that the concentration of impurities exhibited by the conduction region <b>114</b> is lower than the concentration of impurities exhibited by the second field relaxation region <b>144</b> in the step shown by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50B</figref>, a structure shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref> is obtained.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0240">As described above, the semiconductor device according to this embodiment can be realized by use of conventional technologies with ease.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0241">While in a conduction state, this construction relaxes energy barrier in a heterojunction interface between the first source region <b>103</b> and the conduction region <b>114</b>, and accordingly higher conduction properties can be obtained, which is the same effect as the conduction region <b>114</b> brings about as shown in the twelfth embodiment. This construction also enables dielectric breakdown of the gate insulating film <b>105</b> to hardly occur, since drain field which has been applied onto the gate insulating film <b>105</b> is relaxed by the second field relaxation region <b>144</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0242">In addition, the construction method shown in this embodiment enables the width of a portion, where the conduction region <b>114</b> is in contact with the first source region <b>103</b>, to be formed so that the width is sufficiently minimum with precision by a self alignment process at the same time. This construction method also enables the second field relaxation field <b>144</b> to be formed by a self alignment process.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0243">Incidentally, although the eleventh to fourteenth embodiments have been described citing an example of a semiconductor device whose substrate material is silicon carbide, other semiconductor materials such as silicon, silicon germanium, gallium nitride and diamond may be used as substrate materials.</div>
