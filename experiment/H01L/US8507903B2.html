<heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">The present invention relates to a light-emitting element formed to have the structure in which a plurality of layers is sandwiched between a pair of electrodes. More specifically, the present invention relates to the structure of a layer, which can be used as at least one layer, within the plurality of layers.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">A light-emitting device utilizing light emission from an electroluminescent element (light-emitting element) has been attracted attention as a display device or a lighting device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">As a light-emitting element used for a light-emitting device, a light-emitting element including a layer containing light-emitting compounds interposed between a pair of electrodes is well known.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Within such a light-emitting element, either of the electrodes serves as an anode, and another serves as a cathode, holes injected from the anode and electrons injected from the cathode are recombined with each other to form molecular exciton, and the molecular exciton radiates energy as light while returning to the ground state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">The demand for low power consumption is especially increased in display devices to be installed in various information processing devices, which have been drastically developed in recent years. In order to achieve low power consumption, it has been attempted to reduce a voltage for driving a light-emitting element. In consideration with commercialization, it is important not only to reduce a voltage for driving a light-emitting element but also extend a lifetime of a light-emitting device. Therefore, a light-emitting device has been developed to achieve low power consumption and a long lifetime.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">For example, unexamined patent publication No. 9-63771 discloses that a voltage for driving a light-emitting element is reduced by forming an anode by a metal oxide having a large work function such as a molybdenum oxide. Moreover, a lifetime of the light-emitting element can be extended.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">The means for extending a lifetime of a light-emitting element disclosed in the unexamined patent publication No. 9-63771 is insufficient, and so it is required to develop the technique for achieving a further long lifetime.</div>

<heading>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">A light-emitting element according to the present invention includes a plurality of layers between a pair of electrodes. The plurality of layers is formed by stacking layers in combination with each other, which is formed respectively by a substance having high carrier injection properties or a substance having high carrier transportation properties, so that a light-emitting region is formed away from the electrodes, that is, carriers are recombined with each other in the region away from the electrodes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">One mode of a light-emitting element according to the present invention is explained with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">In this embodiment, a light-emitting element <b>210</b> is formed over a substrate <b>201</b> used for supporting the light-emitting element <b>210</b>, and is composed of sequentially a first electrode <b>202</b>, a first layer <b>203</b>, a second layer <b>204</b>, a third layer <b>205</b>, a fourth layer <b>206</b>, and a second electrode <b>207</b>. Further, the first electrode <b>202</b> serves as an anode, and the second electrode <b>207</b> serves as a cathode in this embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">As the substrate <b>201</b>, for example, glass or plastic can be used. Another material can be used for the substrate as long as it serves as a support medium for the light-emitting element during a manufacturing process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">The first electrode <b>202</b> is preferably formed by a metal having a large work function (at least 4.0 eV), an alloy, an electric conductive compound, or a mixture of the foregoing materials. Specifically, an indium tin oxide (ITO), an indium tin oxide containing silicon, an indium zinc oxide, that is, an indium oxide mixed with zinc oxide of from 2 to 20% (ZnO), aurum (Au), platinum (Pt), nickel (Ni), tungsten (W), chromium (Cu), molybdenum (Mo), ferrum (Fe), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), palladium (Pd), or a nitride of a metal material (UN), or the like can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">The first layer <b>203</b> is a layer containing a compound selected from the group consisting of oxide semiconductor and a metal oxide, and a compound having high hole transportation properties. As specific examples of the oxide semiconductor and the metal oxide, although not limited to the substances recited herein, a molybdenum oxide (MoOx), a vanadium oxide (VOx), a ruthenium oxide (RuOx), a tungsten oxide (WOx), and the like can be used. Other substances than the foregoing substances can be used. As a compound having high hole transportation properties, for example, an aromatic amine compound (that is, the one having a bond of a benzene ring and nitrogen) such as 4,4′-bis[N-(1-naphthyl) -N-phenyl-aminol-biphenyl (abbreviated α-NPD), 4,4′-bis[N-(3-methylphenyl)-N -phenyl-amino]-biphenyl (abbreviated TPD), 4,4′,4″-tris(N,N-diphenyl-amino)-triphenylamine (abbreviated TDATA), 4,4′,4″-tris[N-(3-methylphenyl)-N-phenyl-amino]-triphenylamine (abbreviated MTDATA) can be used. The foregoing substances are mainly the substances having hole mobility of <b>10</b> <sup>−6 </sup>cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs or more. Another substance can be used as long as it has higher hole transportation properties than electron transportation properties.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">The first layer <b>203</b> having the structure as mentioned above has high hole injection properties. In the first layer <b>203</b>, the aggregation of oxide semiconductor or a metal oxide is suppressed by a substance having high hole transportation properties contained in the layer. That is, crystallization of the first layer <b>203</b> is suppressed. In addition, the first layer <b>203</b> may be formed by, for example, at least two layers respectively containing semiconductor and a compound having high transportation properties with different mixture ratio from each other instead of being formed by one layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">Further, the first layer <b>203</b> may further includes a compound having a high steric hindrance (that is, the compound having spatiality contrary to a plane structure) in addition to a compound selected from oxide semiconductor and a metal oxide, and a steric hindrance, 5,6,11,12-tetraphenyltetracene (abbreviated rubrene) is preferably used. Besides hexaphenylbenzene, diphenylanthracene, t-butylperylene, 9,10-di(phenyl)antracene, coumarin 545T, and the like can be used. In addition, dendrimer or the like can be used. Thus, crystallization of a molybdenum oxide can be further suppressed by mixing a substance with a structure having a high steric hindrance, that is, having spatiality contrary to a plane structure, into the first layer <b>203</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">The second layer <b>204</b> is a layer formed by a substance having high hole transportation properties, for example, an aromatic amine compound (that is, the one having a bond of a benzene ring-nitrogen) such as α-NPD, TPD, TDATA, MTDATA, and the like. The foregoing substances are mainly the substances having hole mobility of 10<sup>−6 </sup>cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs or more. Another substance can be used as long as it has higher hole transportation properties than electron transportation properties. In addition, the second layer <b>204</b> may be formed by stacking at least two layers containing the foregoing substances instead of being formed by one layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">The third layer <b>205</b> is a layer containing a substance having high light-emitting properties. For example, a substance having high light-emitting properties such as N,N′-dimethylquinacridone (abbreviated DMQd), 2H-chromene-2-on (abbreviated coumarin), and a substance having high carrier transportation properties and a good film formation property, that is, a substance that is hard to be crystallized, such as tris(8-quinolinolato) aluminum (abbreviated Alq<sub>3</sub>) or 9,10-di(2-naphthyl) anthracene (abbreviated DNA) can be used by freely combining with each other. Alq<sub>3 </sub>and DNA have high light-emitting properties, consequently, the third layer <b>205</b> may be solely formed by Alq<sub>3 </sub>or DNA.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">The fourth layer <b>206</b> is a layer formed by a metal complex or the like having a quinoline skeleton or a benzoquinoline skeleton, for example, a substance having high electron transportation properties such as tris(8-quinolinolato)aluminum (abbreviated Alq<sub>3</sub>), tris(5-methyl-8-quinolinolato)aluminum (abbreviated Almq<sub>3</sub>), bis(10-hydroxybenz)[h]-quinolinato)beryllium (abbreviated BeBq<sub>2</sub>), and bis(2-methyl-8-quinolinolato)-4-phenylphenolato-aluminum (abbreviated BAlq). Further, a metal complex having a oxadiazole ligand or a thiazole ligand such as bis[2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-benzooxazolate]zinc (abbreviated Zn(BOX)<sub>2</sub>), and bis[2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-benzothiazolate]zinc (abbreviated Zn(BTZ)<sub>2</sub>). Besides the metal complexes, 2-(4-biphenyl)-5-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (abbreviated PBD), and 1,3-bis[5-(p-tert-butylphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole-2-yl]benzene (abbreviated OXD-7), 3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-4-phenyl-5-(4-biphenylyl)-1,2,4-triazole (abbreviated TAZ), and 3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-4-(4-ethylphenyl)-5-(4-biphenylyl)-1,2,4-triazole (abbreviated p-EtTAZ), bathophenanthroline (abbreviated BPhen), bathocuproin (abbreviated BCP), and the like can be used. The foregoing substances are the substances having hole mobility of 10<sup>−6 </sup>cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs or more. Another substance can be used as long as it has higher hole transportation properties than election transportation properties. In addition, the fourth layer <b>206</b> may be formed by at least two layers containing the foregoing substances instead of being formed by one layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">As a material for the second electrode <b>207</b>, metals having a small work function (at most 3.8 eV), alloys, electric conductive compounds, or a mixture of the above are preferably used. As a specific example of cathode materials, metals belonging to a 1 or 2 group of the periodic table of the elements, that is, alkali metals such as lithium (Li) or cesium (Cs); alkali earth metals such as magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr); and alloys including the above elements (Mg:Ag, Al:Li) can be used. In case that a layer promoting electron injection is stacked between the second electrode <b>207</b> and a light-emitting layer, various conductive materials such as Al, Ar, ITO containing silicon, and the like can be used regardless of their work function can be used for the second electrode <b>207</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">As the layer promoting electron injection, a compound of an alkali metal or an alkali earth metal such as lithium fluoride (LiF), cesium fluoride (CsF), calcium fluoride (CaF<sub>2</sub>), and the like. Besides, a layer formed by a substance having electron transportation properties containing an alkali metal or an alkali earth metal, for example, Alq<sub>3 </sub>containing magnesium (Mg), or the like can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">The first layer <b>203</b>, the second layer <b>204</b>, the third layer <b>205</b>, and the fourth layer <b>206</b> may be formed by the method other than vapor deposition. For example, ink jetting, spin coating, and the like can be used. Each electrode or each layer may be formed by different film formation methods, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">Within a light-emitting element according to the invention having the foregoing structure, a current is flowed due to electric potential differences generated between the first electrode <b>201</b> and the second electrode <b>207</b>, and holes and electrons are recombined with each other within the third layer <b>205</b>, which, is a layer containing high light-emitting properties, then, light is generated. Therefore, a light-emitting region is formed in the third layer <b>205</b>. However, the entire third layer <b>205</b> is not required to be served as a light emission region. For example, the light-emitting region may be formed either the side of the second layer <b>204</b> or the fourth layer <b>206</b> within the third layer <b>205</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">Light is emitted to the outside passing through either the first electrode <b>202</b> or the second electrode <b>207</b>, or both of them. Therefore, either the first electrode <b>202</b> or the second electrode <b>207</b>, or both of them are formed by a substance having light-transmitting properties. In the case that only the first electrode <b>202</b> is formed by a substance having light-transmitting properties, light is emitted from the substrate passing through the first electrode <b>202</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. In the case that only the second electrode <b>207</b> is formed by a substance having light-transmitting properties, light is emitted from the opposite side of the substrate passing through the second electrode <b>207</b>. In the case that the first electrode <b>202</b> and the second electrode <b>207</b> are formed by substances having light-transmitting properties, light is emitted from both of the substrate and the opposite side of the substrate passing through the first electrode <b>202</b> and the second electrode <b>207</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">The structure of a layer formed between the first electrode <b>202</b> and the second electrode <b>207</b> is not limited to the above described structure. The layer structure may have the other structure than the foregoing one as long as the structure is formed to have an area for the recombination of holes and electrons is located away from the first electrode <b>202</b> and the second electrode <b>207</b> to prevent quenching due to that a light-emitting region and a metal are close to one another; and a layer containing a compound selected from the group consisting of oxide semiconductor and a metal oxide, and a compound having high hole transportation properties (moreover, a compound having a high steric hindrance may be contained). The lamination structure of the layer is not restricted especially. A layer formed by a substance having high electron transportation properties or hole transportation properties, a substance having electron injection properties, a substance having hole injection properties, a substance having bipolar properties (high electron or hole transportation properties), or the like; and a layer formed by a compound selected from the group consisting of oxide semiconductor and a metal oxide, and a compound having high hole transportation properties may be freely combined with each other. Further, an area for recombination of carriers may be controlled by providing an ultra thin layer such as a silicon oxide layer. For example, the structure shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> may be formed. However, a layer structure is not limited thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">The light-emitting element shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is formed by stacking a first electrode <b>502</b> serving as a cathode; a first layer <b>503</b> formed by a substance having high electron transportation properties; a second layer <b>504</b> formed by a substance having high light-emitting properties; a third layer <b>505</b> formed by a substance having high hole transportation properties; a fourth layer <b>506</b> containing a compound selected from the group consisting of oxide semiconductor and a metal oxide, and a compound having high hole transportation properties; and a second electrode <b>507</b> serving as an anode. In addition, reference numeral <b>501</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> denotes a substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">According to this embodiment, a light-emitting element is manufactured over a glass or plastic substrate. A passive type light-emitting device can be manufactured by manufacturing a plurality of such light-emitting elements over one substrate. Instead of the glass or plastic substrate, a light-emitting element can be manufactured over a thin film transistor (TFT) array. Thus, an active matrix type light-emitting device that controls the drive of a light-emitting element by a TFT can be manufactured. The structure of the TFT is not especially restricted. The TFT may be either a staggered TFT or an inversely staggered TFT. A drive circuit formed over the TFT array substrate may be formed by both an N-type TFT and a P-type TFT. Alternatively, the drive circuit may be formed by either an N-type TFT or a P-type TFT.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">Accordingly, the crystallization of the layer can be suppressed in the light-emitting element including a layer containing a compound selected from the group consisting of oxide semiconductor and a metal oxide, and a substance having high hole transportation properties. Therefore, the generation of a leak current due to the crystallization of the layer can be suppressed, and a long-lived light-emitting element can be obtained. The crystallization of the layer can be further suppressed, and a further long-lived light-emitting element can be obtained in the light-emitting element including a layer containing a compound selected from the group consisting of oxide semiconductor and a metal oxide, a substance having high hole transportation properties, and a substance having a high steric hindrance.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0143">Each layer composing the light-emitting elements (21) to (29) is manufactured by the same material to have the same thickness as those of the light-emitting elements (11) to (19) except that the first layer of each the light-emitting elements (21) to (29) is formed by copper phthalocyanine A first electrode of the light-emitting element (21) is formed by aluminum containing several % silicon. A first electrode of the light-emitting element (22) is formed by aluminum containing several % titanium. A first electrode of the light-emitting element (23) is formed by titanium. A first electrode of the light-emitting element (24) is formed by titanium nitride. A first electrode of the light-emitting element (25) is formed by tantalum. A first electrode of the light-emitting element (26) is formed by tantalum nitride. A first electrode of the light-emitting element (27) is formed by tungsten.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0144">To measure an onset voltage for electroluminescence of 1 cd/m<sup>2 </sup>or more, voltage is applied to each of thus manufactured light-emitting element so that an electric potential of the first electrode is higher than that of the second electrode. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows the measurement results indicated by closed triangles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0145"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows that the onset voltages of the light-emitting elements (21) to (29) having first layers formed by copper phthalocyanine are different from each other, that is, the onset voltages depend on the material for forming the first electrode. On the other hand, the onset voltages of the light-emitting elements (11) to (21) practiced by the present invention are almost the same with each other despite a material for forming the first electrode. The light-emitting element according to the present invention is less subject to kinds of materials for forming an electrode or the like. Therefore, it becomes easy to select an electrode formed by a material having better reflectivity in the case that a light-emitting element in which an electrode is used to reflect light emission is manufactured according to the present invention.</div>
<heading>EXAMPLE 8</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0146">A method for manufacturing a light-emitting element according to the present invention and characteristics of the light-emitting element are explained hereinafter.

The current density-voltage characteristics of the light-emitting elements (1) to (4) are hardly different from each other despite the difference in the thicknesses of the first layers.

In the absorption spectra, the spectra of the film of a molybdenum oxide and the film of α-NPD have no characteristic peak in a visible light region. On the other hand, the absorption of the film formed by a mixture of a molybdenum oxide and α-NPD (OMOx) is less than that of the film formed by a molybdenum oxide. Hence, absorption loss of light can be reduced by using a layer formed by a mixture of a molybdenum oxide and α-NPD rather than using a layer formed by a molybdenum oxide.</div>

The molybdenum oxide is an acceptor, while the α-NPD is a donor. Further, it has been confirmed that not only α-NPD but also an amine-based compound such as DNTPD serves as a donor.</div>
