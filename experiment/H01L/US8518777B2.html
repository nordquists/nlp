<heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates in general to the semiconductor technology and more particularly to semiconductor accumulation-mode power devices with charge balance structures integrated therein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a cross section view of a conventional trenched-gate accumulation-mode vertical MOSFET <b>100</b>. MOSFET <b>100</b> is an n-channel transistor with a gate terminal formed inside each of trenches <b>102</b>, n-type regions <b>112</b> between trenches <b>102</b> (hereinafter referred to as the channel regions), a drift region <b>106</b>, and an n-type drain region <b>114</b>. Unlike enhancement-mode transistors, accumulation-mode transistor <b>100</b> does not include a blocking (p-type in this example) well or body region inside which the conduction channel is formed. Instead a conducting channel is formed when an accumulation layer is formed in channel regions <b>112</b>. Transistor <b>100</b> is normally on or off depending on doping concentration of channel regions <b>112</b> and doping type of the gate electrodes. It is turned off when channel regions <b>112</b> are entirely depleted and lightly inverted. Because no inversion channel is formed, the channel resistance is eliminated thus improving the transistor power handling capability and its efficiency. Further, with no pn body diode, the losses in synchronous rectification circuits attributable to the pn diode are eliminated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">A drawback of accumulation transistor <b>100</b> is that drift region <b>106</b> needs to be lightly doped to support a high enough reverse bias voltage. However, a lightly doped drift region results in a lower on-resistance and lower efficiency. Thus, there is a need for an accumulation-mode transistor with low on-resistance, high blocking capability, and improved efficiency.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">In accordance with the present invention, charge spreading techniques are advantageously integrated in vertical and lateral accumulation-mode power devices to achieve lower on-resistance, higher blocking capability and improved efficiency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a simplified cross section view of an exemplary accumulation-mode field effect transistor <b>200</b> with alternate conductivity regions <b>203</b>, <b>205</b> extending vertically parallel to the current flow. In this example, transistor <b>200</b> is an n-channel transistor with a gate terminal formed inside each of trenches <b>202</b>, n-type channel regions <b>212</b> between trenches <b>202</b>, a drift region <b>206</b> that includes opposite polarity columnar n-type and p-type sections <b>203</b> and <b>205</b>, and an n-type drain region <b>214</b>. Unlike enhancement-mode transistors, accumulation-mode transistor <b>200</b> does not include a blocking (p-type in this example) well or body region inside which the conduction channel is formed. Instead a conducting channel is formed when an accumulation layer is formed in channel regions <b>212</b>. Transistor <b>200</b> is normally on or off depending on doping concentration of channel regions <b>212</b> and doping type of the gate electrodes. It is turned off when channel regions <b>212</b> are entirely depleted and lightly inverted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">In the embodiments describe herein, those portions of the drift region through which current flows when the transistor is in an on state are referred to as the conduction regions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">The doping concentrations in opposite polarity regions <b>203</b> and <b>205</b> are adjusted to maximize charge spreading, which enables the transistor to support higher voltages and also results in more efficient use of the silicon. The use of columnar opposite polarity regions parallel to the current flow flattens the electric field distribution in the conduction regions by not allowing it to decrease linearly away from the junction formed between regions <b>212</b> and <b>206</b>. The charge spreading effect of this structure allows the use of a more highly doped drift region <b>206</b> which advantageously reduces transistor on-resistance. The doping concentration of the various regions may vary; for example, n-type regions <b>212</b> and <b>203</b> may have the same or different doping concentrations. The embodiment wherein n-type regions <b>212</b> and <b>203</b> have the same doping concentration is simpler to manufacture and thus less costly, and is attractive for use in low voltage applications. Those skilled in the art appreciate that an improved p-channel transistor can be obtained by reversing the polarities of the various regions of the transistor shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">An exemplary method of forming the accumulation-mode transistor in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is as follows. An n-type epitaxial layer is formed over substrate <b>214</b> in accordance with conventional methods. Using a masking layer, columns of silicon are removed from the epitaxial layer using conventional silicon etching techniques. Silicon material <b>205</b> of p-type conductivity is then formed in the removed columns of silicon using known techniques. An n-type epitaxial layer <b>212</b> is then formed over epitaxial layer <b>206</b> using conventional techniques. Trenched gate structures are then formed in epitaxial layer <b>212</b> using known methods.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a simplified cross section view of another accumulation-mode field effect transistor <b>300</b> with trenched electrodes for charge spreading purposes. Channel regions <b>312</b>, drift region <b>306</b> and drain region <b>314</b> are all of the same conductivity type which in this example is n-type. The doping concentration of channel regions <b>312</b> is adjusted to form a depleted blocking junction under no bias conditions. Inside each trench <b>302</b>, one or more buried electrodes <b>311</b> are formed under gate electrode <b>310</b>, all insulated from one another and from drift region <b>306</b> by dielectric material <b>308</b>. Buried electrodes <b>311</b> act as field plates and can be biased, if desired, to a potential that optimizes their charge spreading effect. Since charge spreading can be controlled by independently biasing buried electrodes <b>311</b>, the maximum electric field can be increased significantly. Different variations of this structure are possible. For example, the depth of trench <b>302</b> and the size and number of buried electrodes <b>311</b> can vary depending on the application. Charge spreading electrodes can be buried inside trenches that are separate from active trenches that house the transistor gate electrode. An example of such an embodiment is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">A method of forming the structure in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is as follows. An n-type epitaxial layer is formed over substrate <b>314</b>. An n-type layer <b>312</b> is formed along an upper portion of the epitaxial layer by implanting dopants into the epitaxial layer. Depending on the desired doping concentration, n-type dopants may be implanted into the epitaxial layer so that n-type layer <b>312</b> has a higher doping concentration than drift region <b>306</b> of the epitaxial layer, or alternatively, p-type counter-dopants may be implanted into the epitaxial layer so that n-type layer <b>312</b> has a lower doping concentration than drift region <b>306</b> of the epitaxial layer. In another embodiment, regions <b>306</b> and <b>312</b> are formed by growing two n-type epitaxial layers having different doping concentrations. An exemplary set of process steps for forming the trenched electrodes are described in the above-referenced commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/821,796 titled “Schottky Diode Using Charge Balance Structure,” filed Apr. 9, 2004, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The trenched-gate structures are formed using conventional techniques.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">Another embodiment for an improved accumulation-mode transistor employs dielectric-filled trenches with an opposite polarity exterior liner. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a simplified cross section view of an accumulation transistor <b>500</b> according to this embodiment. Dielectric-filled trenches <b>520</b> extend downward from the surface of the silicon well into drift region <b>506</b>. Trenches <b>520</b> are substantially filled with dielectric material such as silicon dioxide. In this exemplary embodiment, transistor <b>500</b> is an n-channel transistor with trenched-gate structure. A p-type region <b>526</b> lines the exterior sidewalls and bottom of dielectric-filled trenches <b>520</b> as shown. Dielectric-filled trenches <b>520</b> reduce the output capacitance of the transistor while p-type liner <b>526</b> provides for charge balancing in the drift region to increase the blocking capability of the transistor. In one exemplary method of forming transistor <b>500</b>, regions <b>506</b> and <b>512</b> are formed in a similar manner to previous embodiments. A set of process steps for forming the dielectric-filled trenches is disclosed in the above-referenced commonly assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,376,878 to Christopher B. Kocon, titled “MOS-Gated Devices with Alternating Zones of Conductivity,” incorporated herein in its entirety. The trenched-gate structures are formed using conventional techniques.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">In an alternative embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, oppositely doped liners <b>626</b>N and <b>626</b>P are formed adjacent the opposite sidewalls of a dielectric-filled trench <b>620</b>. That is, a dielectric-filled trench <b>620</b> has a p-type liner <b>626</b>P extending along the exterior sidewall on one side, and an n-type liner <b>626</b>N extending along the exterior sidewall on the opposite side of the same trench. Other variations of this accumulation transistor with dielectric-filled trenches are possible. These include, for example, an accumulation transistor with a planar (as opposed to trenched) gate structure; an accumulation transistor with a p-type liner that covers only the exterior sidewalls and not the bottom of trenches <b>526</b>; and an accumulation transistor with a single trench structure with a p-type liner that lines the lower portion of the trench.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">In another embodiment, an accumulation-mode transistor employs one or more diodes stacked inside a trench for charge balancing purposes. A simplified cross section view of an exemplary accumulation-mode transistor <b>700</b> according to this embodiment is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In this embodiment, the charge balancing diodes are formed inside the same trench as the gate. Trench <b>702</b> includes gate electrode <b>710</b> below which n-type <b>723</b> and p-type <b>725</b> silicon or doped polysilicon layers form pn junctions. A dielectric layer <b>708</b> separates the diode structure from gate terminal <b>702</b> as well as drift region <b>706</b>. As shown, there is no dielectric layer along the bottom of trenches <b>720</b>, thus allowing the bottom region <b>727</b> to be in electrical contact with the underlying region. In one embodiment, similar considerations to those dictating the design and manufacture of the gate oxide of MOS transistors are applied in designing and forming insulating layer <b>708</b>. For example, as in gate oxide of MOS transistors, the thickness of insulating layer <b>708</b> is determined by such factors as the voltage that insulating layer <b>708</b> is required to sustain and the extent to which the electric field in the trench diode is to be induced in drift region <b>706</b> (i.e., the extent of coupling through the insulating layer). The charge spreading in this embodiment is controlled by the optimization of the diode avalanche breakdown and the width of the depletion in the trenched diodes described more fully next.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">As is well-known in this art, under reverse-bias conditions, the electric field is highest at the junction between regions <b>706</b> and <b>712</b> and linearly reduces in drift region <b>706</b> in the direction away from the junction between regions <b>706</b> and <b>712</b> at a rate dictated by the doping concentration of regions <b>712</b> and <b>714</b>. It is also well known that the larger the area under the electric field curve (i.e., the lower the rate at which the electric field reduces), the greater is the breakdown voltage. During operation, the diodes embedded in trenches <b>702</b> are reverse biased and thus the electric field is highest at the diode junctions (e.g., at the junction between opposite conductivity type regions <b>725</b> and <b>723</b>). Through insulating layer <b>708</b>, the electric field in the trench diodes induces a corresponding electric field in drift region <b>706</b>. The induced field is manifested in drift region <b>706</b> in the form of an up-swing spike and a general increase in the electric field curve in drift region <b>706</b>. This increase in the electric field results in a larger area under the electric field curve, which in turn results in a higher breakdown voltage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">It can be seen that by using multiple diodes in trenches <b>702</b>, multiple spikes can be induced along the depth of conduction regions in drift region <b>706</b>. This results in an electric field curve which tapers down from its highest level at a far lower rate than in conventional structures. An almost trapezoidal-shaped area can thus be obtained under the electric field curve in drift region <b>706</b> as opposed to the conventional triangular shape. A far greater breakdown voltage can thus be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">When structure <b>700</b> is biased in the conduction state, current passes through conduction region of drift region <b>706</b>. By introducing diode trenches <b>702</b>, the electric filed across the reverse-biased trenched diodes influences the charge distribution in adjacent drift region <b>706</b> such that a more uniform charge spreading is obtained in drift region <b>706</b>. By spreading the charge more uniformly in drift regions <b>706</b>, the silicon area taken up by drift region <b>706</b> is more efficiently used. Hence, for the same size drift region <b>706</b>, the portion of the on-resistance attributable to the conduction region of drift region <b>706</b> is, in effect, reduced. This enables reducing the cell pitch for the same on-resistance. Accordingly, diode trenches <b>706</b> enable optimizing structure <b>700</b> to have higher breakdown voltage, lower on-resistance, and smaller cell pitch than can be achieved by conventional techniques.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">Other variations of accumulation-mode transistor <b>700</b> are possible. One such variation is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. In this embodiment, diode trenches <b>820</b> are disposed on either sides of gate trenches <b>802</b>, extending well into drift region <b>806</b>. Diode trenches <b>820</b> include one or more diode structures made up of opposite conductivity type regions <b>823</b> and <b>825</b> that form one or more pn junctions inside the trench. A thin dielectric layer <b>821</b> extending along the trench inner sidewalls insulates the diodes in the trench from drift region <b>806</b>. In another variation of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, not shown, one or more charge electrodes are formed in the gate trench below the gate electrode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">An exemplary method of forming the structure in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is as follows. An n-type epitaxial layer is formed over substrate <b>814</b>. N-type region <b>812</b> is formed in the epitaxial layer by implanting dopants into the epitaxial layer. Depending on the desired doping concentration, n-type dopants may be implanted into the epitaxial layer so that channel regions <b>812</b> have a higher doping concentration than portion <b>806</b> of the epitaxial layer, or alternatively, p-type counter-dopants may be implanted into the epitaxial layer so that channel regions <b>812</b> have a lower doping concentration than portion <b>806</b> of the epitaxial layer. In another embodiment, regions <b>806</b> and <b>812</b> are formed by growing two n-type epitaxial layers having different doping concentrations. An exemplary set of process steps for forming the trenched diodes are described in the above-referenced commonly assigned patent application Ser. No. 10/821,796 titled “Schottky Diode Using Charge Balance Structure,” filed Apr. 9, 2004, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The trenched-gate structures are formed using conventional techniques.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the channel regions in which the conduction channel is formed (e.g., regions <b>312</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) are merged with the drift region to form a single region <b>906</b> in which trenches <b>902</b> are formed. Thus, drift region <b>906</b> extends from the top surface of the structure to substrate <b>914</b>. Transistor <b>900</b> operates in the same manner as transistor <b>300</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. This embodiment has the advantage of a simpler manufacturing process because of elimination of the processing steps associated with forming the channel regions between the trenches. To maintain the same transistor current capability as the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> structure, the doping concentration in region <b>906</b> needs to be increased. This in turn reduces the transistor voltage blocking capability. But, due to the presence of the charge balancing trenched electrodes, the increased doping concentration does not result in as much of a reduction in the transistor blocking capability. It is to be understood that the channel regions in the other embodiments illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-8</figref> may similarly be merged with the drift region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, heavily doped p-type regions <b>1018</b> are formed in channel regions <b>1012</b> between trenches <b>1002</b>. P-type regions <b>1018</b> minimize the area of channel regions <b>1012</b> and reduce device leakage. P-type regions <b>1018</b> also allow for p+ contact which improve hole current flow in avalanche and improve device robustness. Each of p+ regions <b>1018</b> may be a single continuous region extending the length of the mesa (i.e., in the dimension perpendicular to the page) between trenches, or may be one of multiple p+ regions formed at intervals along the length of the mesa between the trenches. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows a three-dimensional view of a variation of the structure in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. As shown, p+ regions <b>1118</b> laterally extend to abut the trenches between which they are located. However, p+ regions <b>1118</b> are formed at intervals along the length of the mesa so that channel regions <b>1112</b> can be contacted along their top surface in order to accommodate current flow when the transistor is turned on. An advantage of extending the p+ region between adjacent trenches as compared to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> wherein p+ regions <b>1018</b> are laterally spaced from the trenches is that the alignment tolerance required by the spacing between the p+ regions and the edge of trenches in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is eliminated thus resulting in a smaller cell pitch. The p+ regions can be used in a similar manner in any one of the accumulation transistors described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, n-type channel regions <b>1212</b> include more heavily doped shallow n+ source regions <b>1203</b>. Heavily doped source regions <b>1203</b> result in better contact with the overlying source electrode, and thus reduce the contact resistance. Heavily doped source regions <b>1203</b> can extend along the top surface of channel regions <b>1212</b> between trenches as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, or can alternatively be formed as two regions adjacent trench sidewalls along the top edge of channel regions <b>1212</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. An advantage of this approach is the source metal contacting lightly doped channel regions <b>1212</b> forms a Schottky contact therebetween which helps minimize leakage current. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows a 3-dimensional view of the structure illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. As shown, n+ source regions <b>1432</b> are formed at intervals along the length of the mesa between trenches in channel regions <b>1412</b>. N+ regions <b>1432</b> may alternatively be a single continuous region extending the length of the mesa between trenches. The heavily doped source regions as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-14</figref> can be used in the same manner in any one of the accumulation transistors described herein. The heavily doped regions in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-14</figref> can be formed in respective channel regions using known masking and implanting techniques.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">It is to be understood that any of the charge balancing structures illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-8</figref> may be combined with one or more of the structural variations and features illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-14</figref> as desired. For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows the charge balancing structure illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> in combination with the highly-doped p+ regions, wherein the channel regions are merged with the drift region to form a single silicon region <b>1506</b> in which the trenches are formed. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows another example wherein the charge balancing structure illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is combined with the highly doped n+ regions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">Also, variations on exemplary vertical MOS-gated accumulation transistors have been discussed to illustrate the various features and advantages of the present invention. One of skill in the art appreciates that these can be implemented in other types of devices including planar-gate vertical transistors, planar-gate lateral transistors, trenched-gate lateral transistors, diodes, bipolar transistors and the like. FIGS. <b>17</b> and <b>18</b>A-<b>18</b>C show few examples of such devices. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, laterally-positioned electrodes <b>1711</b> <i>a </i>and <b>1711</b> <i>b </i>are integrated in a planar-gate accumulation-mode lateral transistor <b>1700</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A-18C</figref>, laterally-extending diode trenches <b>1820</b> are integrated in a planar-gate accumulation-mode lateral transistor <b>1800</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref> shows a top view of transistor <b>1800</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18C</figref> respectively show the cross section views along lines <b>18</b>A-<b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>C-<b>18</b>C in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>. In the FIGS. <b>17</b> and <b>18</b>A-<b>18</b>C embodiments, as in the previous embodiment, the charge balance electrodes and diodes extend parallel to the current flow.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows a cross-section view of a trenched-gate accumulation FET <b>1900</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. FET <b>1900</b> includes an n-type substrate <b>1902</b>, an n-type drift region <b>1904</b>, and an n-type mesa region <b>1906</b>. Gate trenches <b>1908</b> extend through mesa region <b>1906</b> and terminate in drift region <b>1904</b>. Each gate trench <b>1908</b> is lined with a dielectric layer <b>1910</b> along its sidewalls and bottom, and includes a recessed gate <b>1912</b>. N-type source regions <b>1914</b> flank each side of trenches <b>1908</b> as shown.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">A p-type body region <b>1916</b> extends into mesa region <b>1906</b> between each pair of gate trenches <b>1908</b>. Body regions <b>1916</b> form a p-n junction with mesa region <b>1906</b>. The p-n junction results in a stronger pinch-off for improved blocking and Rdson. The amount of pinch-off, determined by the voltage and charge in the pinched-off region, influences the blocking characteristics. Also, the ratio of the pinched channel length (Lp in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) to the pinched channel width (Wp in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) needs to be kept as high as possible (preferably &gt;1) for good blocking capability. Note that the pinched channel length Lp is the spacing between the bottom of region <b>1914</b> and the bottom of the shallower one of the gate <b>1912</b> and body region <b>1916</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, body regions <b>1916</b> extend deeper than mesa region <b>1906</b>, however, in another embodiment, a shallower body region (extending to a shallow depth within region <b>1906</b> or to a depth just above the lower surface of mesa region <b>1906</b>) may be formed. But, a deeper body region, as shown, is advantageous since the built-in potential of the p-n junction (Vbi,max value is Eg/q, ˜1.1V) also pinches the channel thus resulting in better blocking capability. In other embodiments, each body region <b>1916</b> is advantageously formed as a continuous stripe along the dimension perpendicular to the page. Using a continuous stripe, as opposed to multiple body regions with gaps therebetween, prevents the possibility of leakage current to flow through the gaps. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> more clearly illustrates an implementation of continuous body regions <b>2316</b> in one embodiment of the invention. In an alternate variation, the continuous body region is broken up into multiple regions, however the gaps between the body regions needs to be kept small enough so that the gaps can be fully depleted by the built-in potential. For cellular designs, each body region <b>1916</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) is enclosed within the cell such that it helps in pinching off the entire channel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">Incorporation of the body regions in the accumulation FET, in accordance with the different embodiments of the invention, results in a net built-in voltage which is about four times greater than that without the body regions. Hence the charge (Q) in the channel can be kept higher to obtain better on-resistance with high blocking capability. Since the accumulation layer mobility is higher than inversion layer mobility, the channel resistance is lower for accumulation FETs. This is particularly true for silicon carbide (SiC) based devices. Also, the pinched regions (i.e., the portions of mesa region <b>1906</b> between body region <b>1916</b> and its adjacent gate trenches <b>1908</b>) can carry current, particularly at higher current densities, in parallel to the channel regions. This further lowers the Rdson thus improving device power handling capability and its efficiency. Also, due to higher transconductance and lower Vth, the accumulation FET in accordance with the invention is particularly attractive for low gate voltage, high current applications.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">Conventional accumulation FETs rely solely on MOS depletion and hence are sensitive to oxide charge variations and work function differences. However, in the accumulation FET of the present invention, majority of the blocking is provided by the p-n junction, and thus the FET device is less sensitive to oxide charges. The threshold voltage (Vth) of the accumulation FET is primarily controlled by Wp (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) and the doping concentration of mesa region <b>1906</b>. In contrast, for conventional enhancement mode FETs, Vth is controlled by the Tox, Qox, p-well dose/drive, source junction depth (Xjs), and p-well junction depth (Xjw). Therefore, the Vth of accumulation FET of the present invention could be better controlled, particularly for low Vth devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">The p-n diode formed between body region <b>1916</b> and mesa region <b>1906</b> injects minority carriers when forward biased and thus the associated reverse recovery may be undesirable in certain applications. This undesirable effect can be eliminated or substantially minimized in a number of ways. In a first approach, the doping concentration of body region <b>1916</b> is reduced. In a second approach illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, a resistor <b>2018</b> is coupled between body regions <b>2016</b> and source regions <b>2014</b>. Resistor <b>2018</b> drastically reduces the diode current, but still keeps body regions <b>2016</b> at ground potential during normal operation. The capacitance associated with the p-n junction needs to be charged through resistor <b>2018</b> during switching from on to off state. Thus, the resistance value of resistor <b>2018</b> should be carefully chosen such that the switching is not adversely affected while the injection of minority carriers is minimized. A third approach is to float body regions <b>2016</b> either by not biasing them to any potential, or as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, burying them in silicon. The latter approach completely eliminates the body diode problem.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> shows an exemplary implementation of an embodiment of the invention in a multi-pillar charge balance structure. In general, integrating super junction structures, such as that in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, reduces the Rdson drastically. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> shows an isometric view of an exemplary stripe geometry device with continuous body stripes <b>2316</b> and multi-pillar charge balance structure.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0070">As can be seen, the accumulation FET has lower Rsp, Qg and Irrm, and a much higher transconductance (Gm) than the conventional enhancement FET. Also, simulation results showed that the electric field lines in the drift region of the accumulation FET had little crowding, were equally spaced and substantially flat, and as such similar blocking capability as the conventional FET was obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">Known process techniques can be used to form the accumulation FET of the present invention. For example, the manufacturing methods described above may be used and modified in one of a number of ways to obtain the structures shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19-23</figref>. Body regions <b>1916</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) can be formed in a number of ways. In a first approach, multiple implants of p-type dopants into mesa region <b>1906</b> are carried out using varying energies to form body regions <b>1916</b> with a relatively uniform doping concentration and a rectangular profile with minimal lateral bulge. In a second approach, a trench may be formed through mesa regions <b>1906</b> between adjacent gate trenches <b>1908</b>, and then selectively filled with p-type silicon using well know selective epitaxial growth (SEG) techniques. The latter approach provides good aspect ratio with a rectangular shape, and uniform doping concentration. These two techniques can be modified, as known in this art, to form the buried body regions <b>2120</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. Resistor <b>2018</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> may be formed in a number of ways.
