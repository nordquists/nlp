<heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/227,750, filed Sep. 8, 2011, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates generally to semiconductor device processing techniques and, more particularly, to a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) structure having multiple threshold voltage devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Field effect transistors (FETs) are widely used in the electronics industry for switching, amplification, filtering, and other tasks related to both analog and digital electrical signals. Most common among these are metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFET or MOS), in which a gate structure is energized to create an electric field in an underlying channel region of a semiconductor body, by which electrons are allowed to travel through the channel between a source region and a drain region of the semiconductor body. Complementary MOS (CMOS) devices have become widely used in the semiconductor industry, wherein both n-type and p-type (NMOS and PMOS) transistors are used to fabricate logic and other circuitry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">The source and drain regions of an FET are typically formed by adding dopants to targeted regions of a semiconductor body on either side of the channel. A gate structure is formed above the channel, which includes a gate dielectric located over the channel and a gate conductor above the gate dielectric. The gate dielectric is an insulator material, which prevents large leakage currents from flowing into the channel when a voltage is applied to the gate conductor, while allowing the applied gate voltage to set up a transverse electric field in the channel region in a controllable manner. Conventional MOS transistors typically include a gate dielectric formed by depositing or by growing silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) or silicon oxynitride (SiON) over a silicon wafer surface, with doped polysilicon formed over the SiO<sub>2 </sub>to act as the gate conductor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Continuing trends in semiconductor device manufacturing include reduction in electrical device feature sizes (i.e., scaling), as well as improvements in device performance in terms of device switching speed and power consumption. MOS transistor performance may be improved by reducing the distance between the source and the drain regions under the gate conductor of the device, known as the gate or channel length, and by reducing the thickness of the layer of gate dielectric that is formed over the semiconductor surface. However, there are electrical and physical limitations on the extent to which the thickness of SiO<sub>2 </sub>gate dielectrics can be reduced. For example, thin SiO<sub>2 </sub>gate dielectrics are prone to gate tunneling leakage currents resulting from direct tunneling of electrons through the thin gate dielectric.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Scaling of the gate dielectric is a challenge in improving performance of advanced field effect transistors. In a field effect transistor employing a silicon oxide based gate dielectric, the leakage current through the gate dielectric increases exponentially with the decrease in the thickness of the gate dielectric. Such devices typically become too leaky to provide high performance at or below a thickness of about 1.1 nm for the silicon oxide gate dielectric.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">Accordingly, recent MOS and CMOS transistor scaling efforts have focused on high-k dielectric materials having dielectric constants greater than that of SiO<sub>2 </sub>(e.g., greater than about 3.9). High-k dielectric materials can be formed in a thicker layer than scaled SiO<sub>2</sub>, and yet still produce equivalent field effect performance. The relative electrical performance of such high-k dielectric materials is often expressed in terms equivalent oxide thickness (EOT), since the high-k material layer may be thicker, while still providing the equivalent electrical effect of a much thinner layer of SiO<sub>2</sub>. Because the dielectric constant “k” is higher than silicon dioxide, a thicker high-k dielectric layer can be employed to mitigate tunneling leakage currents, while still achieving the equivalent electrical performance of a thinner layer of thermally grown SiO<sub>2</sub>.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY</heading>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">In general, CMOS integration requires two gate materials, one having a work function near the valence band edge of the semiconductor material in the channel and the other having a work function near the conduction band edge of the same semiconductor material. In CMOS devices having a silicon channel, a conductive material having a work function of about 4.0 eV is typically necessary for n-type metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (NFETs) and another conductive material having a work function of about 5.0 eV is typically necessary for p-type metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (PFETs). In conventional CMOS devices employing polysilicon gate materials, a heavily p-doped polysilicon gate and a heavily n-doped polysilicon gate are employed to address the needs. However, in CMOS devices employing high-k gate dielectric materials as discussed above, suitable materials satisfying the work function requirements are needed. So far, identification of materials for a dual work function metal gate electrode system has presented some challenges.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">One approach in implementing high-k dielectrics in CMOS devices is to employ heavily doped polysilicon materials along with high-k gate dielectric materials in the gates. A threshold voltage (V<sub>t</sub>) offset is observed, however, when high-k gate dielectric materials are integrated with polysilicon gate electrodes, which can be as much as 600 mV for p-type metal oxide semiconductor (PMOS) devices. The source of the offset is in general believed to be oxygen vacancies, or oxygen deficiencies, as well as Fermi-level pinning due to metal-silicon bonds in the high-k gate dielectrics. While metal gate electrodes tend to mitigate the threshold voltage offset effect, no solution has been proposed to fundamentally address the V<sub>t </sub>shift in high-k dielectric gates having a polysilicon gate conductor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">A replacement gate process architecture avoids the problems of work function material stability seen in the gate first architecture. Here, a dummy gate structure is used to self-align the source and drain implant and anneals, followed by stripping out the dummy gate materials and replacing them with the high-k and metal gate materials. Although this process is more complex than a gate first technique, advantages of a replacement gate flow include the use of separate PMOS and NMOS metals for work function optimization. In addition, the two metals are not exposed to high temperatures, simplifying material selection. Further, the polysilicon gate removal can actually be used to enhance strain techniques, thereby increasing drive currents.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">System-On-a-Chip (SOC) applications require transistors formed on a common substrate and having a plurality of different threshold voltages. Both high-k, metal gate first and gate last fabrication schemes have challenges with respect to achieving V<sub>t </sub>adjustment to the desired threshold voltages. One way to adjust such threshold voltages, for example, by lowering V<sub>t </sub>for PFET devices and increasing V<sub>t </sub>for NFET with high-k metal gates is to fill oxygen vacancies in the high-k (e.g., hafnium oxide) dielectric layer. Disclosed herein are embodiments directed to an innovative processing scheme resulting in a unique CMOS device structure having modulated threshold voltages. Such a scheme may be used, for example, to create low and high V<sub>t </sub>PFETs and NFETs. In brief, the embodiments utilize an oxide spacer that comes into physical contact with the high-k layer. The oxygen in the oxide spacer delivers oxygen to the high-k layer for a first transistor device to shift the V<sub>t </sub>(lower or higher depending upon the device polarity) for the first FET device, while a second FET device does not include the oxide spacer. In that manner, the V<sub>t </sub>for the first FET is different from that of the second FET.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">Referring generally to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 8</figref>, there is shown a series of cross sectional views of an exemplary embodiment of a method of forming a CMOS structure having multiple threshold voltage devices in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an exemplary semiconductor substrate <b>102</b> suitable for use in this regard. The semiconductor substrate <b>102</b> includes a semiconductor material, which may be selected from, but is not limited to, silicon, germanium, silicon-germanium alloy, silicon carbon alloy, silicon-germanium-carbon alloy, gallium arsenide, indium arsenide, indium phosphide, III-V compound semiconductor materials, II-VI compound semiconductor materials, organic semiconductor materials, and other compound semiconductor materials. Where the semiconductor material of the semiconductor substrate <b>102</b> is a single crystalline silicon-containing semiconductor material, the single crystalline silicon-containing semiconductor material may be selected from single crystalline silicon, a single crystalline silicon carbon alloy, a single crystalline silicon germanium alloy, and a single crystalline silicon germanium carbon alloy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">The semiconductor material of the semiconductor substrate <b>102</b> may be appropriately doped either with p-type dopant atoms or with n-type dopant atoms. The dopant concentration of the semiconductor substrate <b>102</b> may range from about 1.0×10<sup>15 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>to about 1.0×10<sup>19 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, and more specifically from about 1.0×10<sup>16 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>to about 3.0×10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, although lesser and greater dopant concentrations are contemplated herein also. In addition, the semiconductor substrate <b>102</b> may be a bulk substrate, a semiconductor-on-insulator or silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate, or a hybrid substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an isolation region <b>104</b>, such as shallow trench isolation (STI), formed in the substrate <b>102</b>. The STI region <b>104</b> may include a dielectric material such as silicon oxide and/or silicon nitride, and is formed by methods well known in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the formation of first and second transistor devices <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, on the substrate <b>102</b>, on opposing sides of the STI region <b>104</b>. Here, the semiconductor structure is an example of replacement gate FET technology. Thus, the first transistor device <b>106</b> and the second transistor device <b>108</b> include source and drain extension regions <b>110</b> formed, for example, by ion implantation or other known techniques with a dummy gate structure <b>112</b> (including cap layer <b>114</b>) formed on a high-k gate dielectric layer <b>115</b> and first sidewall spacers <b>116</b> in place. The source and drain extension regions <b>110</b> have a doping of the same or opposite conductivity type of the doping of the substrate <b>102</b>. Source and drain regions <b>118</b> are also depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which are formed, for example, by ion implantation or other known techniques of the same conductivity type as the extension regions <b>110</b>. The first and second sidewall spacers <b>116</b>, <b>120</b> are formed, for example, by deposition of a dielectric material layer (e.g., an oxygen-impermeable material such as silicon nitride) followed by an anisotropic etching process such as reactive ion etch (RIE). Silicide contacts <b>122</b> for the source and drain regions are also depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. It will be noted that the silicide contacts <b>122</b> may be formed before or after the formation of the final metal gate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">Although not specifically shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an interfacial layer (IL) may be formed on the exposed semiconductor surface of the substrate <b>102</b> between the first sidewall spacers <b>116</b> such as, for example, by a wet chemical oxidation that includes treating the cleaned semiconductor surface <b>102</b> (e.g., by hydrofluoric acid) with a mixture of ammonium hydroxide, hydrogen peroxide and water (in a 1:1:5 ratio) at 65° C. Alternatively, a chemical oxide layer can also be formed by treating the HF-last semiconductor surface in ozonated aqueous solutions, with the ozone concentration usually varying from, but not limited to: 2 parts per million (ppm) to 40 ppm. However, it will be appreciated that an IL layer may be formed by other processes known in the art such as, for example, by atomic layer deposition (ALD) of SiO<sub>2 </sub>or by rapid thermal anneal (RTA) in an O<sub>2 </sub>or NH<sub>3 </sub>ambient environment. The formation of an IL allows for nucleation of the high-k dielectric layer <b>115</b> formed thereon, which has a dielectric constant that is greater than the dielectric constant (7.5) of silicon nitride.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">The high-k dielectric layer <b>115</b> may be formed by methods well known in the art including, for example, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), ALD, molecular beam deposition (MBD), pulsed laser deposition (PLD), liquid source misted chemical deposition (LSMCD), etc. In an exemplary embodiment, the high-k dielectric layer <b>118</b> includes a metal and oxygen, and optionally nitrogen and/or silicon. Specific examples of high-k dielectric materials include, but are not limited to: HfO<sub>2</sub>, ZrO<sub>2</sub>, La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub>, SrTiO<sub>3</sub>, LaAlO<sub>3</sub>, Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, HfO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>, ZrO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>, La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>, TiO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>, SrTiO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>, LaAlO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>, Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>, a silicate thereof, and an alloy thereof. Each value of x is independently from 0.5 to 3 and each value of y is independently from 0 to 2. The thickness of the high-k dielectric layer <b>115</b> may be from about 1 nm to about 10 nm, and more specifically from about 1.5 nm to about 3 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">Prior to removal of the dummy gate structure, an interlevel dielectric (ILD) layer <b>124</b> is formed over top surfaces the device. The ILD layer <b>124</b> includes a dielectric material such as silicon oxide, silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, or a combination thereof. Alternatively, the ILD layer <b>124</b> may include a low-k dielectric material having a dielectric constant less than 3.9 (e.g., the dielectric constant of silicon oxide), and more specifically less than 2.5. Exemplary low-k dielectric materials include organosilicate glass (OSG) and SiLK®. The ILD layer <b>124</b> is planarized to expose a top surface of the dummy gate structure, such as cap layer <b>114</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the removal of dummy gate structures of the first and second transistor devices <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>. In accordance with a replacement gate process, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the dummy gate structure <b>112</b> (and cap layer <b>114</b>) being removed, such as through one or more etch processes, so as to form a recess <b>126</b> that exposes a top surface of the high-k gate dielectric <b>115</b>. In a further embodiment described below, the gate dielectric layer <b>115</b> could also be a dummy structure such that the recess <b>126</b> would expose the top surface of the substrate <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">As then shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a conformal oxide layer <b>128</b> (e.g., silicon oxide) is then deposited over the structure of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, including over top surfaces of the ILD layer <b>124</b>, sidewalls of first spacers <b>116</b> and the top surface of high-k layer <b>115</b>. This may be implemented by, for example, a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, horizontal portions of the conformal oxide layer <b>128</b> are anisotropically removed so as to form vertical oxide spacers <b>130</b> in contact with the high-k gate dielectric layers <b>115</b> of the first and second transistor devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">Referring next to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a blocking mask layer <b>132</b> is formed over the device and is thereafter patterned so as expose the second transistor device <b>108</b>. This allows for selective removal of the vertical oxide spacers <b>130</b> of the second transistor device <b>108</b> that in turn results in the desired threshold voltage variation between the first and second transistor devices <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>. Removal of the vertical oxide spacers <b>130</b> of the second transistor device <b>108</b> may be performed by, for example, a wet hydrofluoric (HF) acid etch.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">Alternatively, the block mask <b>132</b> could be formed and selectively patterned after the deposition of the oxide spacer material but before the anisotropic etch to remove the horizontal portion of the oxide layer. Thereafter, the oxide layer is removed from the second transistor device <b>108</b> by, for example, a wet HF acid etch. The mask is the removed and an anisotropic etch such as RIE can be used to remove the horizontal portions of the oxide <b>128</b> over the first transistor device <b>106</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">In another alternative approach, the block mask <b>132</b> could be formed and selectively patterned over the second transistor device <b>108</b> prior to the formation of the conformal oxide layer <b>128</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. With this scheme, the block mask would prevent the oxide layer from being formed inside the recess <b>126</b> of the second transistor device. Thereafter, the anisotropic dry etch would be used to remove the horizontal portions of the oxide <b>128</b> over the first transistor device <b>106</b>. Regardless of the approach used, the net result is to form the vertical oxide spacers <b>130</b> only for the first transistor device <b>106</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">Once the vertical oxide spacers <b>130</b> are formed for the first transistor device <b>106</b>, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates metal gate filling and planarization of the first and second transistor devices <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> with one or more metal gate fill materials <b>132</b>, as known in the art. The metal gate fill materials <b>132</b> may include one or more layers of metal materials such as, for example, aluminum (Al), tantalum (Ta), tantalum nitride (TaN), tungsten (W), tungsten nitride (WN), titanium (Ti) and titanium nitride (TiN), having an appropriate workfunction depending on whether the transistor is an NFET or a PFET device. From this point, further CMOS device processing as known in the art may continue, such as the formation of additional wiring and dielectric layers for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">Because of the presence of the vertical oxide spacers <b>130</b> in contact with the high-k gate dielectric layer <b>115</b> of the first transistor device, oxygen atoms may be diffused from the vertical oxide spacers <b>130</b> to the high-k gate dielectric layer <b>115</b> during subsequent thermal processing. This results in a modification of the V<sub>t </sub>(lower or higher depending upon the device polarity) for the first FET device <b>106</b> with respect to the second FET device <b>108</b> that does not include the vertical oxide spacers <b>130</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">As indicated above, in lieu of a dummy gate structure atop a final high-k dielectric layer, the entire gate stack formed on the substrate <b>102</b> may be a sacrificial or dummy structure.
