<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">This invention relates to portable electronic devices, and more particularly to portable electronic devices including Universal-Serial-Bus (USB) or Expanded Universal-Serial-Bus (EUSB) connections.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Universal-Serial-Bus (USB) has been widely deployed as a standard bus for connecting peripherals such as digital cameras and music players to personal computers (PCs) and other devices. Currently, the top transfer rate of USB is 480 Mb/s, which is quite sufficient for most applications. Faster serial-bus interfaces are being introduced to address different requirements. PCI Express, at 2.5 Gb/s, and SATA, at 1.5 Gb/s and 3.0 Gb/s, are two examples of high-speed serial bus interfaces for the next generation devices, as are IEEE 1394 and Serial Attached Small-Computer System Interface (SCSI).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30(A)</figref> shows a prior-art peripheral-side USB connector. USB connector <b>10</b> may be mounted on a board in the peripheral. USB connector <b>10</b> can be mounted in an opening in a plastic case (not shown) for the peripheral.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">USB connector <b>10</b> contains a small connector substrate <b>14</b>, which is often white ceramic, black rigid plastic, or another sturdy substrate. Connector substrate <b>14</b> has four or more metal contacts <b>16</b> formed thereon. Metal contacts <b>16</b> carry the USB signals generated or received by a controller chip in the peripheral. USB signals include power, ground, and serial differential data D+, D−.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">USB connector <b>10</b> contains a metal case that wraps around connector substrate <b>14</b>. The metal case touches connector substrate <b>14</b> on three of the sides of connector substrate <b>14</b>. The top side of connector substrate <b>14</b>, holding metal contacts <b>16</b>, has a large gap to the top of the metal case. On the top and bottom of this metal wrap are formed holes <b>12</b>. USB connector <b>10</b> is a male connector, such as a type-A USB connector.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30(B)</figref> shows a female USB connector. Female USB connector <b>20</b> can be an integral part of a host or PC, or can be connected by a cable. Another connector substrate <b>22</b> contains four metal contacts <b>24</b> that make electrical contact with the four metal contacts <b>16</b> of the male USB connector <b>10</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30(A)</figref>. Connector substrate <b>22</b> is wrapped by a metal case, but small gaps are between the metal case and connector substrate <b>22</b> on the lower three sides.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">Locking is provided by metal springs <b>18</b> in the top and bottom of the metal case.

This allows the metal casings to be connected together and grounded.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">Other bus interfaces offer higher transfer rates than USB devices, which have a top transfer rate of 480 Mb/s. For example, Peripheral-Component-Interconnect (PCI) Express (2.5 Gb/s) and Serial-Advanced-Technology-Attachment (SATA) (1.5 Gb/s and 3.0 Gb/s) are two examples of high-speed serial bus interfaces for next generation devices. IEEE 1394 (Firewire) supports 3.2 Gb/s. Serial Attached Small-Computer System Interface (SCSI) supports 1.5 Gb/s. These high speed interfaces renders standard USB devices undesirable for some applications.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">What is needed is a high speed USB flash memory device using a single dual-personality flexible system that supports both standard Universal-Serial-Bus (USB) devices and a higher speed USB targeted at 5.0 Gb/S with the addition of extra transmit and receive signal pairs, plus a ground line that serves as separating line to the two communication signal pairs that make up the extended five additional pins.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">The present invention is directed to both standard USB 2.0 devices and high speed extended USB (EUSB) devices in which a printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) is encased within a single-shot molded housing. According to an aspect of the present invention, the PCBA includes a PCB having standard USB metal contact pads disposed on a top (first) surface, and all passive components and integrated circuits (ICs) mounted on a bottom (second) surface. In accordance with an aspect of the invention, single-shot molded housing is formed in a single shot molding process such that a thin top (first) portion of the housing is formed on the first surface of the PCBA, and a second portion of the housing is formed on the second surface of the PCBA such that the passive components and ICs are encased by the bottom portion. By utilizing a single shot molding process to form the single-shot molded housing over the PCBA, the present invention provides an inexpensive manufacturing method (i.e., lower cost and high assembly throughput when compared with assembly using external shell casings) that also provides greater moisture and water resistance and higher impact force resistance than that achieved using conventional manufacturing methods. In accordance with another aspect of the invention, the top portion of the molded housing is formed with elongated ribs that extend between associated pairs of the standard USB metal contact pads. These ribs provide the advantage of serving as a guide for host connector pins to avoid shorting to adjacent pins when the USB device is slanted at an angle in the host socket, and also serve to prevent undesirable wear of the standard USB metal contact pads due to repeated insertion into a host socket.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a dual-personality memory system supports both standard USB 2.0 devices and high speed extended USB (EUSB) devices that are formed in accordance with the method provided above. A host side of the dual-personality memory system includes a multiple pin (e.g., nine-pin) USB female socket that is similar to a standard female USB socket, but in addition to the standard (four) USB contact pins utilized to facilitate communications with standard USB 2.0 devices, the extended multiple pin USB socket includes one or more additional rows of contacts that facilitate extended communications (i.e., including additional transmitting/receiving differential pairs) between the host system and dual personality “extended” USB (EUSB) devices (e.g., memory cards). Each EUSB device <b>101</b> includes both standard USB contacts, a second row of extended function contacts, and a special controller that facilitates communication with a host system using either the standard serial USB communication protocol using the four standard USB contacts (e.g., when the EUSB memory card is plugged into a “standard” USB female socket), or extended communications using both the standard contacts and the second row of contacts (e.g., when the EUSB memory card is plugged into the multiple pin USB female socket of a dual-personality memory system).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">In accordance with a specific embodiment of the present invention, a EUSB device <b>101</b> includes both standard USB metal contacts and a row of metal contact springs that exposed by openings formed in the top (first) portion of the molded housing, and extend from the EUSB memory card in a way that facilitates reliable extended (e.g., nine bit) communications. The EUSB device <b>101</b> includes a printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) including at least one dual-personality communication integrated circuit (IC) mounted on a lower surface of the PCB, four standard USB fixed contacts disposed on an upper surface of the PCB near the PCB's front edge, and several (e.g., five) metal contact springs positioned behind the standard USB contacts. In accordance with an aspect of the invention, the PCB is formed with parallel slots (openings) that are disposed behind the standard USB contacts, and the metal contact springs are mounted such that a portion of each metal contact spring extends through a corresponding slot and through a corresponding opening such that a contact portion of each contact spring protrudes above the upper planar surface defined by the top portion of the molded housing. A dual-personality communication IC is configured to selectively communicate either with a standard USB host system by way of the standard USB contacts (only), or with a dual-personality flash memory card system by way of all (e.g., nine) contact pads/springs. By forming the contact springs such that they extend through the slots/openings and protrude above the housing surface, the contact springs are provided with sufficient tolerance to both reliably contact corresponding contact pads of a host female socket, and are also able to bend downward (i.e., into the molded housing) when the contact springs are pressed against the corresponding contact pads of a host female socket.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, the EUSB device <b>101</b> is manufactured by forming a contact spring assembly in which the contact springs are mounted on a base (e.g., a PCB or plastic) substrate, and the assembly is then mounted onto the device PCB such that the springs protrude through the parallel slots (openings) defined in the PCB. The PCB includes standard USB contact pads formed on its upper surface between its front edge and the row of slots, and contact pads formed on its lower PCB surface for mounting one or more ICs and passive components. According to an aspect of the invention, the spring assembly is mounted onto the lower surface of the PCB such that each contact spring extends through a corresponding slot such that a contact portion thereof protrudes from the upper PCB surface (and above the upper planar surface of the top housing portion after the molding process is completed), and such that the base covers the slots during a subsequent plastic molding step. By forming the PCBA in this manner, the springs are quickly and reliably mounted onto the PCB, and the base of the spring assembly covers the slots. The PCBA is then placed in a mold cavity, and a single-shot molded housing is formed such that a top housing portion is formed on the top PCB surface (i.e., except over the standard USB metal contact pads and contact springs), and a bottom housing portion is formed over the bottom PCB surface such that the passive components and ICs are entirely encased in housing material. The upper mold die used to form the top portion of the molded housing includes parallel bars and protrusions (poles) that respectively cover and prevent the formation of molding material on the contact pads and contact springs. The resulting EUSB memory card forms a modular structure including a connector plug with the standard USB metal contact pads and the contact springs being arranged such that, when said connector plug is inserted into said extended multiple pin USB socket, each of the standard USB contact pads contacts a corresponding standard USB contact of the extended multiple pin USB socket, and each of the contact springs contacts a corresponding dual-personality contact of the extended multiple pin USB socket. By forming the EUSB memory card in this manner, final assembly of the EUSB memory card into any of several external housings is greatly simplified, which reduces manufacturing costs by simplifying the assembly process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">According to an aspect of the invention, passive components are mounted onto the PCB using one or more standard surface mount technology (SMT) techniques, and one or more unpackaged IC die (e.g., the dual-personality communication IC die and a flash memory die) are mounted using chip-on-board (COB) techniques. During the SMT process, the SMT-packaged passive components (e.g., capacitors, oscillators, and light emitting diodes) are mounted onto contact pads disposed on the PCB, and then known solder reflow techniques are utilized to connect leads of the passive components to the contact pads. During the subsequent COB process, the IC dies are secured onto the PCB using know die-bonding techniques, and then electrically connected to corresponding contact pads using, e.g., known wire bonding techniques. After the COB process is completed, the housing is formed over the passive components and IC dies using plastic molding techniques. By combining SMT and COB manufacturing techniques to produce modular USB core components, the present invention provides several advantages over conventional manufacturing methods that utilize SMT techniques only. First, by utilizing COB techniques to mount the USB controller and flash memory, the large PCB area typically taken up by SMT-packaged controllers and flash devices is dramatically reduced, thereby facilitating significant miniaturization of the resulting footprint (i.e., providing a shorter device length and thinner device width). Second, the IC die height is greatly reduced, thereby facilitating stacked memory arrangements that greatly increase memory capacity of the EUSB memory cards without increasing the EUSB memory card footprint. Further, overall manufacturing costs are reduced by utilizing unpackaged controllers and flash devices (i.e., by eliminating the cost associated with SMT-package normally provided on the controllers and flash devices). Therefore, the combined COB and SMT method according to the present invention provides a less expensive and higher quality (i.e., more reliable) memory product with a smaller size than that possible using conventional SMT-only manufacturing methods.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">According to another embodiment of the present invention, front edges of the parallel ribs formed on the upper surface of a USB or EUSB device are linked by a cross-rib that serves to protect the front edge of the PCBA, to prevent a user's finger from touching the four standard USB contact pads, and to provide extra thickness for the five “extended” pins to form higher loop so that the spring action is more flexible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">According to yet another embodiment of the present invention, the standard USB metal contact pads of a USB or EUSB device comprise raised middle rails that facilitate better contact with the spring metal contacts of a female USB connector socket.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the EUSB device <b>101</b> is disposed in a plastic molded external housing so as to form a device assembly including a standard USB metal plug shell and a cover. By forming the EUSB memory card in the manner described above, the present invention greatly simplifies the assembly process utilized to form the device assembly, thus reducing overall costs.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">The present invention relates to an improved method for manufacturing extended USB (EUSB) devices (e.g., memory cards), and in particular to EUSB devices (memory cards) manufactured by the method. The following description is presented to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention as provided in the context of a particular application and its requirements. As used herein, the terms “upper”, “upwards”, “lower”, “downward”, “front” and “back” are intended to provide relative positions for purposes of description, and are not intended to designate an absolute frame of reference. Various modifications to the preferred embodiment will be apparent to those with skill in the art, and the general principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments. Therefore, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the particular embodiments shown and described, but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and novel features herein disclosed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1(A)</figref>, <b>1</b>(B) and <b>1</b>(C) show a dual-personality USB memory system <b>100</b> including an extended 9-pin (multiple pin) USB female socket <b>190</b> that communicates with both standard USB memory cards and dual-personality extended USB (EUSB) memory cards <b>101</b> that are manufactured and operate in accordance with the present invention. That is, in accordance with the exemplary embodiment, dual-personality USB memory system <b>100</b> is operated to process (receive and transmit) both standard USB 2.0 (four pin) signals and extended function signals through extended 9-pin USB socket <b>190</b> in a manner consistent with that described in co-owned U.S. Pat. No. 7,108,560, entitled “Extend USB Protocol Plug and Receptacle for implementing Single-Mode Communication”, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In particular, in accordance with the 9-pin embodiment disclosed herein, in additional to the four standard USB 2.0 signals (i.e., power, ground, D+ and D−), the extra five contact springs are utilized to transmit and additional ground (e.g., using the middle spring), a transmitting differential pair (T+ and T−), and a receiving differential pair (R+ and R−) using the left and right side contact spring pairs, respectively. Thus the term “extended USB” (EUSB) is used herein to mean at least one transmitting/receiving signal pair in addition to the four standard USB signals. With the additional of these signal pairs, transmitting/receiving modes can be executed concurrently without the wait state of transmitting on receiving to complete, and vice versa, thereby significantly enhancing communication speeds.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">Because many conventional USB (male) connectors and (female) sockets (also referred to as standard USB plug connectors and standard USB sockets herein) are widely deployed, it is advantageous for the improved extended USB connector to be compatible with standard USB sockets, and an extended USB socket to be compatible with standard USB connectors for backward compatibility. Although the height and width of USB connectors/sockets have to remain the same for insertion compatibility, the length of each may be extended to fit additional metal contacts for additional signals. Furthermore, additional metal contacts (pins or springs) may be disposed on the plug connector, either adjacent to opposite the existing four standard USB metal contacts. As indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(A)</figref>, plug connector <b>114</b> of EUSB device <b>101</b> represents such extended plug connector that includes the four standard USB metal contact pads <b>121</b> and the five additional (extended-use) contact springs <b>122</b> that are disposed in a row behind standard USB metal contact pads <b>121</b>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">Similar to the general embodiment described above with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1(A) and 1(B)</figref>, EUSB device <b>101</b>A includes a PCBA <b>110</b> made up of a PCB <b>111</b> with standard USB contacts <b>121</b> formed on its upper surface <b>116</b> between front edge portion <b>111</b>P-<b>1</b> and the row of openings <b>115</b>, and one or more ICs <b>130</b> (e.g., dual-personality communication IC <b>131</b> and memory IC <b>135</b>) and passive components <b>140</b> mounted on lower PCB surface <b>118</b>. PCB <b>111</b> is formed in accordance with known PCB manufacturing techniques such that metal contacts <b>121</b>, IC dies <b>130</b>, and passive components <b>140</b> are electrically interconnected by a predefined network including conductive traces and other conducting structures that are sandwiched between multiple layers of an insulating material (e.g., FR4) and adhesive.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">As indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(A)</figref>, according to an aspect of the present invention, spring assembly <b>120</b> is mounted onto lower surface <b>118</b> of the PCB <b>111</b> such that each contact spring <b>122</b> extends through a corresponding opening <b>115</b> such that a contact portion <b>124</b> of each contact spring <b>122</b> protrudes from the upper PCB surface <b>116</b> in the manner described above with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(B)</figref>. In one embodiment, each contact spring <b>122</b> is a substantially C-shaped spring structure having a pair of base portions <b>123</b> that are secured to a substrate <b>125</b>, and a central contact portion <b>124</b> that forms an arched (bent) structure extending between base portions <b>123</b>.

As described in further detail below, PCBA <b>110</b> is then placed in a mold cavity, and a single-shot molded housing <b>150</b> is formed that includes a lower portion <b>150</b>B formed over lower surface <b>118</b> such that ICs <b>130</b> and passive components <b>140</b> are encased by plastic, and upper portion <b>150</b>A formed over upper surface <b>116</b> of PCB <b>111</b>, whereby upper portion <b>150</b>A is formed such that standard USB contacts <b>121</b> and contact springs <b>122</b> are exposed as described herein by opening <b>155</b> and by slots defined between ribs <b>157</b>. By forming EUSB device <b>101</b>A in this manner, PCBA <b>111</b> is protected on both sides by respective portions of molded housing <b>150</b>, and final assembly of the EUSB memory card into any of several external housings (see example below) is greatly simplified, which reduces manufacturing costs by simplifying the assembly process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">Housing <b>150</b> is molded plastic formed and arranged such that substantially all of the plastic used to form housing <b>150</b> is located either below (i.e., on one side of) lower surface <b>118</b> of PCB <b>111</b>, or above upper surface <b>116</b> of PCB <b>111</b>. As indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(B)</figref>, lower housing portion <b>150</b>B includes a peripheral surface <b>151</b> extending downward (i.e., perpendicular to PCB <b>111</b>), and a planar lower surface <b>152</b>B that extends parallel to PCB <b>111</b>. For discussion purposes, the portion of peripheral surface <b>151</b> surrounding handle section <b>112</b> of PCB <b>111</b> is referred to below as handle surface section <b>151</b>-<b>1</b>, and the section of peripheral surface <b>151</b> surrounding plug section <b>114</b> of PCB <b>111</b> is referred to below as plug surface section <b>151</b>-<b>2</b>. Similarly, the portion of lower surface <b>152</b>B covering handle section <b>112</b> of PCB <b>111</b> is referred to below as handle surface section <b>152</b>-<b>1</b>B, and the section of lower surface <b>152</b>B covering plug section <b>114</b> of PCB <b>111</b> is referred to below as plug cover section <b>152</b>-<b>2</b>B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(A)</figref>, according to another aspect of the invention, passive components <b>140</b> are mounted onto lower surface <b>118</b> of PCB <b>111</b> using one or more standard surface mount technology (SMT) techniques, and one or more unpackaged IC dies <b>130</b> are mounted on PCB <b>111</b> using chip-on-board (COB) techniques. During the SMT process, passive components <b>140</b>, such as resistors, capacitors, and oscillator are mounted onto associated contact pads <b>119</b>-<b>3</b> disposed on lower surface <b>118</b>, and are then secured to the contact pads using known solder reflow techniques. To facilitate the SMT process, each of the passive components is packaged in any of the multiple known (preferably lead-free) SMT packages (e.g., ball grid array (BGA) or thin small outline package (TSOP)). In contrast, IC dies <b>130</b> are unpackaged, semiconductor “chips” that are mounted onto surface <b>118</b> and electrically connected to corresponding contact pads using known COB techniques. Passive components <b>140</b>, IC dies <b>131</b> and <b>135</b> and metal contacts <b>121</b> and <b>122</b> are operably interconnected by way of metal traces that are formed on and in PCB <b>111</b> using known techniques.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(B)</figref>, a thickness T<b>1</b> and width W<b>1</b> of connector plug <b>114</b> is selected to produce a secure (snug) fit inside either an external case (discussed below) or directly into socket <b>190</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). According to another aspect of the present invention, planar upper surface <b>152</b>A and planar lower surface <b>152</b>B are parallel to PCB <b>111</b>, and are spaced such that a first thickness T<b>1</b> of connector plug <b>114</b> (i.e., measured between upper housing surface <b>152</b>A and lower housing surface <b>152</b>B adjacent to metal contacts <b>121</b>) is substantially equal to a second thickness T<b>2</b> adjacent a rear end of handle section <b>114</b>. That is, as indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(B)</figref>, EUSB device <b>101</b>A is substantially flat along its entire length (i.e., measured from the rear edge of handle section <b>112</b> to the front edge of plug section <b>114</b>). In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(B)</figref>, the uppermost surface of EUSB device <b>101</b>A is defined by upper housing surface <b>152</b>A, which is parallel to planar lower housing surface <b>152</b>B along the entire length of EUSB device <b>101</b>A.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068">According to an aspect of the present invention, the “flatness” associated with modular USB core component <b>102</b> is achieved by mounting all of the IC dies (“chips”) and other electronic components of modular USB core component <b>102</b> on lower surface <b>118</b> of PCB <b>111</b> (i.e., on the side opposite to metal contacts <b>121</b>), and forming a thin layer of molding material on upper surface <b>116</b>. That is, the minimum overall thickness of modular USB core component <b>102</b> is determined by the thickness T<b>1</b> that is required to maintain a snug connection between connector plug <b>114</b> and female USB socket connector <b>190</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). This arrangement requires that ribs <b>157</b> extend a predetermined distance above upper surface <b>116</b>, and that plug wall section <b>151</b>-<b>2</b>B plug and lower wall section <b>152</b>-<b>2</b>B of lower housing portion <b>150</b>B extend a predetermined distance below PCB <b>111</b> such that the distance between upper surface <b>152</b>A and lower wall section <b>152</b>-<b>2</b>B provide the required thickness T<b>1</b>. The present inventors have found that the overall thickness of modular USB core component <b>102</b> can be minimized by mounting the IC dies <b>130</b> and <b>135</b> and passive components (e.g., capacitor <b>142</b>) only on lower surface <b>118</b> of PCB <b>111</b>, and by minimizing the thickness of the upper housing portion <b>150</b>A such that upper surface <b>152</b>A is slightly above the surface of metal contact pads <b>121</b>. That is, if the IC dies and passive components are mounted on upper surface <b>116</b>, then the overall thickness of the resulting USB structure would be the required thickness T<b>1</b> plus the thickness that the ICs extend above PCB <b>111</b> (plus the thickness of a protective wall, if used).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">According to another aspect associated with the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(B)</figref>, upper surface <b>116</b> of PCB <b>111</b> in handle section <b>112</b> is covered by upper housing portion <b>150</b>B, thus facilitating the production of EUSB device <b>101</b> with a maximum thickness equal to thickness T<b>1</b> of plug portion <b>114</b>. That is, because upper housing portion <b>150</b>A is formed on upper surface <b>116</b> with a uniform thickness, and upper surface <b>152</b>A defines the higher end of required plug structure thickness T<b>1</b>, the overall height of EUSB device <b>101</b> is minimized. As indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(B)</figref>, in accordance with feature specifically associated with EUSB device <b>101</b>, upper housing portion <b>150</b>A is disposed on upper surface <b>116</b>, but does not extend over peripheral (side) edge <b>111</b>P of PCB <b>111</b>, and peripheral wall <b>151</b> (e.g., front edge <b>151</b>-<b>2</b> and rear edge <b>151</b>-<b>1</b>) extends around up to but does not cover peripheral edge <b>111</b>P of PCB <b>111</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0070"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flow diagram showing a method for producing a EUSB memory card according to another embodiment of the present invention. Summarizing the novel method, a PCB panel is fabricated including multiple PCBs, each PCB defining openings (block <b>210</b>; described below with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>). Contact springs are then mounted onto the PCB panel such that each contact spring extends through a corresponding opening and contact portions of each contact spring protrude above the upper surface of the PCB (block <b>220</b>; described below with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-10</figref>). ICs and passive components are then attached to the PCBs (block <b>225</b>-<b>245</b>; described below with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-14</figref>), and then a single-shot molded housing is formed on the PCB such that the passive components and ICs are covered, and such that substantially all of the PCB's upper surface is exposed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">According to another aspect of the invention, the passive components are then mounted on the PCB panel using SMT techniques (block <b>225</b>), and then unpackaged IC dies are die bonded and wire bonded onto the PCB panel using COB techniques (block <b>240</b>). Plastic molding is then performed to form a plastic housing over the PCB panel in a single molding step (single-shot) (block <b>260</b>), which is then singulated into individual EUSB memory cards (block <b>260</b>). This portion of the method provides several advantages over conventional manufacturing methods that utilize SMT techniques only. First, by utilizing COB techniques to mount the USB controller and flash memory, the large amount of space typically taken up by these devices is dramatically reduced, thereby facilitating significant miniaturization of the resulting EUSB memory card footprint. Second, by implementing the wafer grinding methods described below, the die height is greatly reduced, thereby facilitating stacked memory arrangements such as those described below. The molded housing also provides greater moisture and water resistance and higher impact force resistance than that achieved using conventional manufacturing methods. In comparison to the standard USB memory card manufacturing that used SMT process, it is cheaper to use the combined COB and SMT (plus molding) processes described herein because, in the SMT-only manufacturing process, the bill of materials such as Flash memory and the EUSB controller chip are also manufactured by COB process, so all the COB costs are already factored into the packaged memory chip and controller chip. Therefore, the combined COB and SMT method according to the present invention provides a less expensive and higher quality (i.e., more reliable) extended USB memory card product with a smaller size than that possible using conventional SMT-only manufacturing methods.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0072">Referring to the lower end of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the EUSB memory cards are marked (block <b>270</b>), and then tested, packed and shipped (block <b>280</b>).

The die bonding process generally involves mounting IC dies <b>131</b> into lower surface region <b>118</b>A, which is surrounded by contact pads <b>119</b>-<b>1</b>, and mounting IC die <b>135</b> into lower surface region <b>118</b>B, which is surrounded by contact pads <b>119</b>-<b>2</b>. In one specific embodiment, an operator loads IC dies <b>131</b> and <b>135</b> onto a die bonder machine according to known techniques. The operator also loads multiple PCB panels <b>300</b>(<i>t</i> <b>2</b>) onto the magazine rack of the die bonder machine. The die bonder machine picks the first PCB panel <b>300</b>(<i>t</i> <b>2</b>) from the bottom stack of the magazine and transports the selected PCB panel from the conveyor track to the die bond (DB) epoxy dispensing target area. The magazine lowers a notch automatically to get ready for the machine to pick up the second piece (the new bottom piece) in the next cycle of die bond operation. At the die bond epoxy dispensing target area, the machine automatically dispenses DB epoxy, using pre-programmed write pattern and speed with the correct nozzle size, onto the target areas <b>118</b>A and <b>118</b>B of each of the PCB <b>111</b> of PCB panel <b>300</b>(<i>t</i> <b>2</b>). When all PCBs <b>111</b> have completed this epoxy dispensing process, the PCB panel is conveyed to a die bond (DB) target area. Meanwhile, at the input stage, the magazine is loading a second PCB panel to this vacant DB epoxy dispensing target area. At the die bond target area, the pick up arm mechanism and collet (suction head with rectangular ring at the perimeter so that vacuum from the center can create a suction force) picks up an IC die <b>131</b> and bonds it onto area <b>118</b>A, where epoxy has already dispensed for the bonding purpose, and this process is then performed to place IC die <b>135</b> into region <b>118</b>B. Once all the PCB boards <b>111</b> on the PCB panel have completed die bonding process, the PCB panel is then conveyed to a snap cure region, where the PCB panel passes through a chamber having a heating element that radiates heat having a temperature that is suitable to thermally cure the epoxy. After curing, the PCB panel is conveyed into the empty slot of the magazine waiting at the output rack of the die bonding machine. The magazine moves up one slot after receiving a new panel to get ready for accepting the next panel in the second cycle of process. The die bonding machine will repeat these steps until all of the PCB panels in the input magazine are processed. This process step may repeat again for the same panel for stack die products that may require to stacks more than one layer of memory die. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13(B)</figref> is a top perspective views showing PCB <b>111</b>-<b>1</b> of PCB panel <b>300</b>(<i>t</i> <b>3</b>) after the die bonding process is completed.</div>

The wire bonding process proceeds as follows. Once a full magazine of PCB panels <b>300</b>(<i>t</i> <b>3</b>) (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13(B)</figref>) has completed the die bonding operation, an operator transports the PCB panels <b>300</b>(<i>t</i> <b>3</b>) to a nearby wire bonder (WB) machine, and loads the PCB panels <b>300</b>(<i>t</i> <b>3</b>) onto the magazine input rack of the WB machine. The WB machine is pre-prepared with the correct program to process this specific EUSB memory card. The coordinates of all the ICs' pads <b>119</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>119</b>-<b>2</b> and PCB gold fingers were previously determined and programmed on the WB machine. After the PCB panel with the attached dies is loaded at the WB bonding area, the operator commands the WB machine to use optical vision to recognize the location of the first wire bond pin of the first memory die of the first PCB on the panel. Once the first pin is set correctly, the WB machine can carry out the whole wire bonding process for the rest of the panels of the same product type automatically.
