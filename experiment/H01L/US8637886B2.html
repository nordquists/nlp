<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">An exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described below in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a top view of an example of a semiconductor light emitting element (light emitting diode) <b>1</b> to which the present exemplary embodiment is applied. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, taken along the line II-II. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> from which a protective layer <b>400</b> to be described later is eliminated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">The semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> includes: a substrate <b>110</b>; an intermediate layer <b>120</b> laminated on the substrate <b>110</b>; and a base layer <b>130</b> laminated on the intermediate layer <b>120</b>. The semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> also includes: an n-type semiconductor layer <b>140</b> laminated on the base layer <b>130</b>; a light emitting layer <b>150</b> laminated on the n-type semiconductor layer <b>140</b>; and a p-type semiconductor layer <b>160</b> laminated on the light emitting layer <b>150</b>. Note that, in the following description, the n-type semiconductor layer <b>140</b>, the light emitting layer <b>150</b> and the p-type semiconductor layer <b>160</b> are collectively referred to as laminated semiconductor layers <b>100</b>, if necessary.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">The semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> has the laminated p-type semiconductor layer <b>160</b>, light emitting layer <b>150</b> and n-type semiconductor layer <b>140</b> cut out in the thickness direction at a part of their regions so that a top surface <b>140</b> <i>c </i>of the n-type semiconductor layer <b>140</b> is exposed upward.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">Additionally, the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> includes a transparent conductive layer <b>170</b> that is conductive and transparent to light outputted from the light emitting layer <b>150</b> and that is laminated on the p-type semiconductor layer <b>160</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">Furthermore, the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> includes a transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> that is insulative and transparent to the light outputted from the light emitting layer <b>150</b> and that is laminated as a one-piece layer so as to run from the top surface of the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b> through the side surfaces of the p-type semiconductor layer <b>160</b>, the light emitting layer <b>150</b> and the n-type semiconductor layer <b>140</b> to the top surface <b>140</b> <i>c </i>of the n-type semiconductor layer <b>140</b>. The transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> also functions as a protective film. Thus, a material that is chemically stable and excellent in moisture resistance is suitable for the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">Let first refractive index n<b>1</b> and second refractive index n<b>2</b> denote the refractive index of the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b> and that of the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> for a light emission wavelength ฮป (nm) of the light emitting layer <b>150</b>, respectively. Then, both the refractive indices have a relationship of n<b>1</b>&gt;n<b>2</b>. The remainder (n<b>1</b>โn<b>2</b>) of both the refractive indices causes reflection on the interface between the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b> and the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> to increase, and light extraction efficiency from the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> to improve. It is desirable that the remainder of the refractive indices be 0.4 or more.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">Additionally, plural through-holes penetrating the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> in the thickness direction thereof are provided for the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b>. In the present exemplary embodiment, among the plural through-holes, plural ones (twenty-eight in the specific example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) are arranged above the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b>, for example, while plural ones (four in the specific example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) are arranged above the top surface <b>140</b> <i>c </i>of the n-type semiconductor layer <b>140</b> as well, for example. With this configuration, the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b> is partially exposed via the plural through-holes when the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> is laminated on the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b>, for example; and the n-type semiconductor layer <b>140</b> is partially exposed via the plural through-holes when the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> is laminated on the top surface <b>140</b> <i>c </i>of the n-type semiconductor layer <b>140</b>, for example. Each of the plural through-holes provided for the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> has a circular shape as seen from above (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), and further has a so-called tapered cross section (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) such that the diameter of the through-hole decreases toward the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b>. A circle, which has no stress concentration, is the most suitable for the shape of the through-holes formed in the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b>. However, a polygon having a large radius of curvature at the angles thereof, an ellipse or the like may be employed. Meanwhile, in the specific example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the through-holes reach the boundary between the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> and the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b>. However, the through-holes may extend partially into the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b> unless the through-holes penetrate the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">Furthermore, the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> includes a p-electrode <b>200</b> that functions as one electrode (positive electrode) when the light emitting layer <b>150</b> is caused to emit light and that is further laminated on the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b> and the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b>, which are laminated on the p-type semiconductor layer <b>160</b>. The p-electrode <b>200</b> has: a p-conductor portion <b>210</b> (corresponding to a conductor portion) formed of plural (twenty-eight in the specific example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) p-connecting conductors <b>211</b> (corresponding to plural connecting conductors) that penetrate the respective plural through-holes provided for the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> and that have one ends provided so as to be in contact with the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b>; and a p-pad portion <b>220</b> (corresponding to an electrode portion) that is formed on the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b>, connected with the other ends of the plural p-connecting conductors <b>211</b> and is used for electrical connection with outside. Electrically, these plural through-holes cause a current to pass through the light emitting layer <b>150</b> with a uniform current density, and thereby improve light emission efficiency of the whole light emitting layer <b>150</b> and yields of the light emitting element. It is desirable that the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> be arranged with a large number of tiny through-holes. However, the size of the through-holes is preferably in the range of 1 to 20 ฮผm because of unevenness in forming the through-holes and difficulty in micromachining technique. Note that, in the present exemplary embodiment, the p-conductor portion <b>210</b> and the p-pad portion <b>220</b> have an integral structure in the p-electrode <b>200</b>. This will be described later.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">Moreover, the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> further includes an n-electrode <b>300</b> that functions as the other electrode (negative electrode) when the light emitting layer <b>150</b> is caused to emit light and that is further laminated on the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b>, which is laminated on the top surface <b>140</b> <i>c </i>of the n-type semiconductor layer <b>140</b>. The n-electrode <b>300</b> has: an n-conductor portion <b>310</b> formed of plural (four in the specific example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) n-connecting conductors <b>311</b> that penetrate the respective plural through-holes provided for the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> and that have one ends provided so as to be in contact with the top surface <b>140</b> <i>c </i>of the n-type semiconductor layer <b>140</b>; and an n-pad portion <b>320</b> that is connected with the other ends of the plural n-connecting conductors <b>311</b> and is used for electrical connection with outside. Note that, in the present exemplary embodiment, the n-conductor portion <b>310</b> and the n-pad portion <b>320</b> have an integral structure in the n-electrode <b>300</b> similarly to the above-described p-electrode <b>200</b>. This will be described later.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">Additionally, the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> includes the protective layer <b>400</b> that is laminated as a one-piece layer over the p-electrode <b>200</b>, the periphery of the p-electrode <b>200</b>, the side surfaces of the p-type semiconductor layer <b>160</b>, the light emitting layer <b>150</b> and the n-type semiconductor layer <b>140</b>, the n-electrode <b>300</b> and the periphery of the n-electrode <b>300</b>, to thereby protect the p-electrode <b>200</b> and the n-electrode <b>300</b>. However, the protective layer <b>400</b> is not provided at a roughly central region (the circular region in this specific example) of the top surface of the p-electrode <b>200</b> and a roughly central region (the circular region in this specific example) of the top surface of the n-electrode <b>300</b>. With this configuration, in the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b>, the top surface of the p-electrode <b>200</b> and that of the n-electrode <b>300</b> are partially exposed to the outside. These exposed regions are used for electrical connection with outside, when the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> is mounted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">When the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> is used by flip-chip bonding as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> to be described later, solder bumps may be respectively formed in advance at the exposed region of the p-electrode <b>200</b> and that of the n-electrode <b>300</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. A eutectic metal such as AuSn, for example, having a low melting point (less than 400 degrees C.) is a suitable material for the solder bumps. It is desirable that a solder bump used for such a purpose be a film having a thickness of 1 ฮผm or more and be formed by a plating method, for example, from the viewpoint of productivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">As described above, the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> of the present exemplary embodiment has a structure in which the p-electrode <b>200</b> and the n-electrode <b>300</b> are formed on one surface side that is opposite to the substrate <b>110</b>. In the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b>, the p-electrode <b>200</b> and the n-electrode <b>300</b> are used as the positive electrode and the negative electrode, respectively, and the light emitting layer <b>150</b> emits light by feeding a current through the laminated semiconductor layers <b>100</b> (more specifically, the p-type semiconductor layer <b>160</b>, the light emitting layer <b>150</b> and the n-type semiconductor layer <b>140</b>) via both the electrodes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">Hereinafter, a description is given of each component of the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> of the present exemplary embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0006">&lt;Substrate&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">The substrate <b>110</b> is not particularly limited as long as it is a substrate having a surface on which group III nitride semiconductor crystals are epitaxially grown. The substrate <b>110</b> to be used may be selected from various substrates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">The semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> of the present exemplary embodiment is mounted by flip-chip bonding so that light is extracted from the substrate <b>110</b> side, as will be described later. Accordingly, it is preferable that the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> have light transparency to the light emitted from the light emitting layer <b>150</b> in order to enhance the light extraction efficiency. In particular, it is preferable to use, as the substrate <b>110</b>, sapphire whose C-plane is the principal plane. If sapphire is used as the substrate <b>110</b>, it is better to form the intermediate layer <b>120</b> (a buffer layer) on the C-plane of the sapphire.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0007">&lt;Intermediate Layer&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">The intermediate layer <b>120</b> is preferably made of polycrystalline Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N (0โฆxโฆ1), and is more preferably made of single-crystal Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N (0โฆxโฆ1). For example, the intermediate layer <b>120</b> may be made of polycrystalline Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N (0โฆxโฆ1) having a thickness of 10 to 500 nm. The intermediate layer <b>120</b> has a function of reducing the difference in lattice constants between the substrate <b>110</b> and the base layer <b>130</b>, and facilitating formation of a single-crystal layer oriented in the c-axis on the (0001) plane (C-plane) of the substrate <b>110</b>. Accordingly, if a single-crystal base layer <b>130</b> is laminated on the intermediate layer <b>120</b>, a base layer <b>130</b> having more favorable crystallinity can be laminated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0008">&lt;Base Layer&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">As the base layer <b>130</b>, Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N (0โฆxโฆ1, 0โฆyโฆ1, 0โฆzโฆ1, x+y+z=1) may be used. Using Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N (0โฆxโฆ1) makes it easier to form a base layer <b>130</b> having favorable crystallinity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">The film thickness of the base layer <b>130</b> is preferably 0.1 ฮผm or more. Setting the film thickness at more than this value tends to give an Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N layer having favorable crystallinity. Additionally, the film thickness of the base layer <b>130</b> is preferably 10 ฮผm or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0009">&lt;Laminated Semiconductor Layers&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">The laminated semiconductor layers <b>100</b> including a group III nitride semiconductor are formed by laminating the n-type semiconductor layer <b>140</b>, the light emitting layer <b>150</b> and the p-type semiconductor layer <b>160</b> on the substrate <b>110</b> in this order, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0170">After that, the light (blue light) outputted from the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> proceeds in the sealing portion <b>34</b>, namely, in the concave portion <b>31</b> <i>a</i>, and is emitted to the outside from an emitting surface provided on an upper portion of the sealing portion <b>34</b> directly or after reflection on the inner wall (the bottom or the wall surfaces) of the concave portion <b>31</b> <i>a</i>. However, some of light heading for the emitting surface reflects on the emitting surface, and proceeds inside of the sealing portion <b>34</b> again. During this time, in the sealing portion <b>34</b>, some of the blue light is converted into green light and red light by the phosphor, and the converted green light and red light are emitted from the emitting surface to the outside together with the blue light directly or after reflection on the bottom or the wall surfaces. Accordingly, white light including the blue light, the green light and the red light is emitted from the light emitting device <b>30</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0171">In the present exemplary embodiment, the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> is provided with a structure for reflecting light by using the difference between the refractive index of the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> and that of another adjacent layer (the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b> in the p-electrode <b>200</b>, and the n-type semiconductor layer <b>140</b> in the n-electrode <b>300</b>), and is further provided with a metal reflection layer (the p-metal reflection layer <b>202</b> in the p-electrode <b>200</b>, and the n-metal reflection layer <b>302</b> in the n-electrode <b>300</b>) on the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b>. With this configuration, if the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> is mounted by flip-chip bonding, light outputted in the direction opposite to an intended direction (the direction from the light emitting layer <b>150</b> to the substrate <b>110</b>) to extract light can be reflected toward the substrate <b>110</b> more. As a result, the light extraction efficiency from the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0172">In the present exemplary embodiment, the p-metal reflection layer <b>202</b> is provided in the p-electrode <b>200</b>, while the n-metal reflection layer <b>302</b> is provided in the n-electrode <b>300</b>. Thus, the configuration of the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> can be simplified as compared with a case in which the electrodes and the metal reflection layers are separately provided, and upsizing of the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> can be prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0173">In the present exemplary embodiment, since the p-metal reflection layer <b>202</b> is a component of the p-electrode <b>200</b>, plural through-holes are provided for the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> arranged between the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b> and the p-electrode <b>200</b>, and the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b> and the p-electrode <b>200</b> (more specifically, the p-conductor portion <b>210</b> formed of the plural p-connecting conductors <b>211</b> provided for the p-electrode <b>200</b>) are electrically connected via these plural through-holes.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0175">In contrast, in the present exemplary embodiment, devising the shape of each through-hole formed in the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> allows for reduction in the degree of bent in each of the layers that compose the p-electrode <b>200</b> and are laminated around the through-holes. Thus, in forming the p-electrode <b>200</b> on the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> in which the plural through-holes are formed, the occurrence of cracks in each layer composing the p-electrode <b>200</b> can be suppressed.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0179">In particular, in the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> used by flip-chip bonding as in the present exemplary embodiment, solder bumps may be formed in advance on the p-electrode <b>200</b> and the n-electrode <b>300</b> when the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> is manufactured.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0180">Hereinafter, a description is given of examples of the present invention. However, the present invention is not limited to the examples.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0181">The present inventor manufactured semiconductor light emission elements <b>1</b> that each have a different shape of the through-holes provided for the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b>. In this example, GaInN, which is a sort of a group III nitride semiconductor, is used as a III-V semiconductor, and the light emission wavelength ฮป thereof was set at 450 nm (blue light). Then, for each of the obtained semiconductor light emitting elements <b>1</b>, an evaluation was made of the boundary structure between the p-electrode <b>200</b> and the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> and the boundary structure between the n-electrode <b>300</b> and the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b>. Here, IZO was used as the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b>, and SiO<sub>2 </sub>(silicon dioxide) was used as the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b>. Additionally, the thickness of the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b> was set at about 250 nm, and the film thickness H of the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> was set at 380 nm (Hโ5Q).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0188">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, it can be seen that the tapered cross sections of the through-holes provided for the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> leads to smooth continuation of the layers that compose the p-electrode <b>200</b> and are laminated around the through-holes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0189">In contrast, referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, it can be seen that if the cross sections of the through-holes provided for the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> are not made tapered but are configured so as to rise perpendicularly to the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b> (in this example, a case where the through-holes are made cylindrical), cracks are made which correspond to the bent regions in the respective layers that compose the p-electrode <b>200</b> and are laminated around the through-holes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0190">In the present exemplary embodiment, the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> having the through-holes formed therein are provided in both the p-electrode <b>200</b> and the n-electrode <b>300</b>. However, the configuration is not limited thereto. It is only necessary that the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> is provided at least on the p-electrode <b>200</b> side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0191">In the present exemplary embodiment, for the through-holes provided on the p-electrode <b>200</b> side and the through-holes provided on the n-electrode <b>300</b> side, the p-first diameter Dp<b>1</b> and the n-first diameter Dn<b>1</b> are set at the same size, and the p-second diameter Dp<b>2</b> and the n-second diameter Dn<b>2</b> are set at the same size. However, the configuration is not limited thereto. The size of each through-hole may be varied on the p-electrode <b>200</b> side and on the n-electrode <b>300</b> side, as long as the diameters satisfy relationships of Dp<b>1</b>&lt;Dp<b>2</b> and Dn<b>1</b>&lt;Dn<b>2</b>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0193">Furthermore, in the present exemplary embodiment, a circular structure is employed for the through-holes provided on the p-electrode <b>200</b> side and the through-holes provided on the n-electrode <b>300</b> side. However, the configuration is not limited thereto. For example, a polygonal or an elliptic structure may be employed. If a polygonal structure is employed, it is desirable to give each corner a curvature. Further, the shape of each through-hole may be varied on the p-electrode <b>200</b> side and on the n-electrode <b>300</b> side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0194">If the through-holes are formed through the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> up to the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b>, the depth of digging down is desirably 10 to 50% of the thickness of the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b>, and more desirably 15 to 30% thereof. If an attempt is made to form the through-holes without digging up to the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b>, the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> may remain at the bottoms of the through-holes in the regions where the through-holes are formed. If the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> remains at the bottoms of the through-holes, the forward voltage Vf of the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> increases. On the other hand, if the through-holes are formed so as to penetrate both the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> and the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b> (a case in which the p-type semiconductor layer <b>160</b> is exposed via the through-holes), the p-adhesion layer <b>201</b> comes into contact with the p-type semiconductor layer <b>160</b> directly. In this case, since the direct contact between the p-adhesion layer <b>201</b> and the p-type semiconductor layer <b>160</b> is not an ohmic contact, a current is not directly supplied from the p-adhesion layer <b>201</b> to the p-type semiconductor layer <b>160</b>, but is indirectly supplied from the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b> (the inner wall surfaces of the through-holes provided for the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b>) coming into contact with the p-adhesion layer <b>201</b> through the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b> to the p-type semiconductor layer <b>160</b>. Accordingly, if the through-holes provided for the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> penetrate the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b>, the contact area between the p-electrode <b>200</b> and the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b> becomes extremely small, causing the forward voltage Vf of the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> to significantly increase.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0195">Additionally, in the present exemplary embodiment, the cross-sectional shape of the inner wall surface of each through-hole is made linear for both the through-holes provided on the p-electrode <b>200</b> side and the through-holes provided on the n-electrode <b>300</b> side. However, the configuration is not limited thereto. The cross-sectional shape of the inner wall surface of each through-hole may be curvilinear, for example, or one having a step or the like, for example, as long as the p-first inclination angle ฮธp<b>1</b> or the n-first inclination angle ฮธn <b>1</b> is an acute angle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0196">Furthermore, in the present exemplary embodiment, the p-second inclination angle ฮธp<b>2</b> and the n-second inclination angle ฮธn<b>2</b> are obtuse angles for both the through-holes provided on the p-electrode <b>200</b> side and the through-holes provided on the n-electrode <b>300</b> side. However, these angles are not limited thereto, but may be right angles, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0197">Still furthermore, in the present exemplary embodiment, the description has been given by taking the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> including a group III nitride semiconductor as an example. However, the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> is not limited thereto, but is only necessary to include a III-V semiconductor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0198">The foregoing description of the exemplary embodiments of the present invention has been provided for the purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed. Obviously, many modifications and variations will be apparent to practitioners skilled in the art.
