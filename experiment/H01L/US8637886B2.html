<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">An exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described below in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a top view of an example of a semiconductor light emitting element (light emitting diode) <b>1</b> to which the present exemplary embodiment is applied. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, taken along the line II-II. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> from which a protective layer <b>400</b> to be described later is eliminated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">The semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> includes: a substrate <b>110</b>; an intermediate layer <b>120</b> laminated on the substrate <b>110</b>; and a base layer <b>130</b> laminated on the intermediate layer <b>120</b>. The semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> also includes: an n-type semiconductor layer <b>140</b> laminated on the base layer <b>130</b>; a light emitting layer <b>150</b> laminated on the n-type semiconductor layer <b>140</b>; and a p-type semiconductor layer <b>160</b> laminated on the light emitting layer <b>150</b>. Note that, in the following description, the n-type semiconductor layer <b>140</b>, the light emitting layer <b>150</b> and the p-type semiconductor layer <b>160</b> are collectively referred to as laminated semiconductor layers <b>100</b>, if necessary.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">The semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> has the laminated p-type semiconductor layer <b>160</b>, light emitting layer <b>150</b> and n-type semiconductor layer <b>140</b> cut out in the thickness direction at a part of their regions so that a top surface <b>140</b> <i>c </i>of the n-type semiconductor layer <b>140</b> is exposed upward.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">Additionally, the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> includes a transparent conductive layer <b>170</b> that is conductive and transparent to light outputted from the light emitting layer <b>150</b> and that is laminated on the p-type semiconductor layer <b>160</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">Furthermore, the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> includes a transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> that is insulative and transparent to the light outputted from the light emitting layer <b>150</b> and that is laminated as a one-piece layer so as to run from the top surface of the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b> through the side surfaces of the p-type semiconductor layer <b>160</b>, the light emitting layer <b>150</b> and the n-type semiconductor layer <b>140</b> to the top surface <b>140</b> <i>c </i>of the n-type semiconductor layer <b>140</b>. The transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> also functions as a protective film. Thus, a material that is chemically stable and excellent in moisture resistance is suitable for the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">Let first refractive index n<b>1</b> and second refractive index n<b>2</b> denote the refractive index of the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b> and that of the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> for a light emission wavelength λ (nm) of the light emitting layer <b>150</b>, respectively. Then, both the refractive indices have a relationship of n<b>1</b>&gt;n<b>2</b>. The remainder (n<b>1</b>−n<b>2</b>) of both the refractive indices causes reflection on the interface between the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b> and the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> to increase, and light extraction efficiency from the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> to improve. It is desirable that the remainder of the refractive indices be 0.4 or more.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">Additionally, plural through-holes penetrating the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> in the thickness direction thereof are provided for the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b>. In the present exemplary embodiment, among the plural through-holes, plural ones (twenty-eight in the specific example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) are arranged above the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b>, for example, while plural ones (four in the specific example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) are arranged above the top surface <b>140</b> <i>c </i>of the n-type semiconductor layer <b>140</b> as well, for example. With this configuration, the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b> is partially exposed via the plural through-holes when the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> is laminated on the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b>, for example; and the n-type semiconductor layer <b>140</b> is partially exposed via the plural through-holes when the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> is laminated on the top surface <b>140</b> <i>c </i>of the n-type semiconductor layer <b>140</b>, for example. Each of the plural through-holes provided for the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> has a circular shape as seen from above (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), and further has a so-called tapered cross section (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) such that the diameter of the through-hole decreases toward the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b>. A circle, which has no stress concentration, is the most suitable for the shape of the through-holes formed in the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b>. However, a polygon having a large radius of curvature at the angles thereof, an ellipse or the like may be employed. Meanwhile, in the specific example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the through-holes reach the boundary between the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> and the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b>. However, the through-holes may extend partially into the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b> unless the through-holes penetrate the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">Furthermore, the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> includes a p-electrode <b>200</b> that functions as one electrode (positive electrode) when the light emitting layer <b>150</b> is caused to emit light and that is further laminated on the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b> and the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b>, which are laminated on the p-type semiconductor layer <b>160</b>. The p-electrode <b>200</b> has: a p-conductor portion <b>210</b> (corresponding to a conductor portion) formed of plural (twenty-eight in the specific example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) p-connecting conductors <b>211</b> (corresponding to plural connecting conductors) that penetrate the respective plural through-holes provided for the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> and that have one ends provided so as to be in contact with the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b>; and a p-pad portion <b>220</b> (corresponding to an electrode portion) that is formed on the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b>, connected with the other ends of the plural p-connecting conductors <b>211</b> and is used for electrical connection with outside. Electrically, these plural through-holes cause a current to pass through the light emitting layer <b>150</b> with a uniform current density, and thereby improve light emission efficiency of the whole light emitting layer <b>150</b> and yields of the light emitting element. It is desirable that the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> be arranged with a large number of tiny through-holes. However, the size of the through-holes is preferably in the range of 1 to 20 μm because of unevenness in forming the through-holes and difficulty in micromachining technique. Note that, in the present exemplary embodiment, the p-conductor portion <b>210</b> and the p-pad portion <b>220</b> have an integral structure in the p-electrode <b>200</b>. This will be described later.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">Moreover, the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> further includes an n-electrode <b>300</b> that functions as the other electrode (negative electrode) when the light emitting layer <b>150</b> is caused to emit light and that is further laminated on the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b>, which is laminated on the top surface <b>140</b> <i>c </i>of the n-type semiconductor layer <b>140</b>. The n-electrode <b>300</b> has: an n-conductor portion <b>310</b> formed of plural (four in the specific example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) n-connecting conductors <b>311</b> that penetrate the respective plural through-holes provided for the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> and that have one ends provided so as to be in contact with the top surface <b>140</b> <i>c </i>of the n-type semiconductor layer <b>140</b>; and an n-pad portion <b>320</b> that is connected with the other ends of the plural n-connecting conductors <b>311</b> and is used for electrical connection with outside. Note that, in the present exemplary embodiment, the n-conductor portion <b>310</b> and the n-pad portion <b>320</b> have an integral structure in the n-electrode <b>300</b> similarly to the above-described p-electrode <b>200</b>. This will be described later.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">Additionally, the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> includes the protective layer <b>400</b> that is laminated as a one-piece layer over the p-electrode <b>200</b>, the periphery of the p-electrode <b>200</b>, the side surfaces of the p-type semiconductor layer <b>160</b>, the light emitting layer <b>150</b> and the n-type semiconductor layer <b>140</b>, the n-electrode <b>300</b> and the periphery of the n-electrode <b>300</b>, to thereby protect the p-electrode <b>200</b> and the n-electrode <b>300</b>. However, the protective layer <b>400</b> is not provided at a roughly central region (the circular region in this specific example) of the top surface of the p-electrode <b>200</b> and a roughly central region (the circular region in this specific example) of the top surface of the n-electrode <b>300</b>. With this configuration, in the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b>, the top surface of the p-electrode <b>200</b> and that of the n-electrode <b>300</b> are partially exposed to the outside. These exposed regions are used for electrical connection with outside, when the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> is mounted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">When the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> is used by flip-chip bonding as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> to be described later, solder bumps may be respectively formed in advance at the exposed region of the p-electrode <b>200</b> and that of the n-electrode <b>300</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. A eutectic metal such as AuSn, for example, having a low melting point (less than 400 degrees C.) is a suitable material for the solder bumps. It is desirable that a solder bump used for such a purpose be a film having a thickness of 1 μm or more and be formed by a plating method, for example, from the viewpoint of productivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">As described above, the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> of the present exemplary embodiment has a structure in which the p-electrode <b>200</b> and the n-electrode <b>300</b> are formed on one surface side that is opposite to the substrate <b>110</b>. In the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b>, the p-electrode <b>200</b> and the n-electrode <b>300</b> are used as the positive electrode and the negative electrode, respectively, and the light emitting layer <b>150</b> emits light by feeding a current through the laminated semiconductor layers <b>100</b> (more specifically, the p-type semiconductor layer <b>160</b>, the light emitting layer <b>150</b> and the n-type semiconductor layer <b>140</b>) via both the electrodes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">Hereinafter, a description is given of each component of the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> of the present exemplary embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0006">&lt;Substrate&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">The substrate <b>110</b> is not particularly limited as long as it is a substrate having a surface on which group III nitride semiconductor crystals are epitaxially grown. The substrate <b>110</b> to be used may be selected from various substrates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">The semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> of the present exemplary embodiment is mounted by flip-chip bonding so that light is extracted from the substrate <b>110</b> side, as will be described later. Accordingly, it is preferable that the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> have light transparency to the light emitted from the light emitting layer <b>150</b> in order to enhance the light extraction efficiency. In particular, it is preferable to use, as the substrate <b>110</b>, sapphire whose C-plane is the principal plane. If sapphire is used as the substrate <b>110</b>, it is better to form the intermediate layer <b>120</b> (a buffer layer) on the C-plane of the sapphire.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0007">&lt;Intermediate Layer&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">The intermediate layer <b>120</b> is preferably made of polycrystalline Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N (0≦x≦1), and is more preferably made of single-crystal Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N (0≦x≦1). For example, the intermediate layer <b>120</b> may be made of polycrystalline Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N (0≦x≦1) having a thickness of 10 to 500 nm. The intermediate layer <b>120</b> has a function of reducing the difference in lattice constants between the substrate <b>110</b> and the base layer <b>130</b>, and facilitating formation of a single-crystal layer oriented in the c-axis on the (0001) plane (C-plane) of the substrate <b>110</b>. Accordingly, if a single-crystal base layer <b>130</b> is laminated on the intermediate layer <b>120</b>, a base layer <b>130</b> having more favorable crystallinity can be laminated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0008">&lt;Base Layer&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">As the base layer <b>130</b>, Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>y</sub>In<sub>z</sub>N (0≦x≦1, 0≦y≦1, 0≦z≦1, x+y+z=1) may be used. Using Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N (0≦x≦1) makes it easier to form a base layer <b>130</b> having favorable crystallinity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">The film thickness of the base layer <b>130</b> is preferably 0.1 μm or more. Setting the film thickness at more than this value tends to give an Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>N layer having favorable crystallinity. Additionally, the film thickness of the base layer <b>130</b> is preferably 10 μm or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0009">&lt;Laminated Semiconductor Layers&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">The laminated semiconductor layers <b>100</b> including a group III nitride semiconductor are formed by laminating the n-type semiconductor layer <b>140</b>, the light emitting layer <b>150</b> and the p-type semiconductor layer <b>160</b> on the substrate <b>110</b> in this order, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Each of the n-type semiconductor layer <b>140</b>, the light emitting layer <b>150</b> and the p-type semiconductor layer <b>160</b> may be formed of plural semiconductor layers.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0171">In the present exemplary embodiment, the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> is provided with a structure for reflecting light by using the difference between the refractive index of the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> and that of another adjacent layer (the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b> in the p-electrode <b>200</b>, and the n-type semiconductor layer <b>140</b> in the n-electrode <b>300</b>), and is further provided with a metal reflection layer (the p-metal reflection layer <b>202</b> in the p-electrode <b>200</b>, and the n-metal reflection layer <b>302</b> in the n-electrode <b>300</b>) on the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b>. With this configuration, if the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> is mounted by flip-chip bonding, light outputted in the direction opposite to an intended direction (the direction from the light emitting layer <b>150</b> to the substrate <b>110</b>) to extract light can be reflected toward the substrate <b>110</b> more. As a result, the light extraction efficiency from the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0172">In the present exemplary embodiment, the p-metal reflection layer <b>202</b> is provided in the p-electrode <b>200</b>, while the n-metal reflection layer <b>302</b> is provided in the n-electrode <b>300</b>. Thus, the configuration of the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> can be simplified as compared with a case in which the electrodes and the metal reflection layers are separately provided, and upsizing of the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> can be prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0173">In the present exemplary embodiment, since the p-metal reflection layer <b>202</b> is a component of the p-electrode <b>200</b>, plural through-holes are provided for the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> arranged between the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b> and the p-electrode <b>200</b>, and the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b> and the p-electrode <b>200</b> (more specifically, the p-conductor portion <b>210</b> formed of the plural p-connecting conductors <b>211</b> provided for the p-electrode <b>200</b>) are electrically connected via these plural through-holes.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0175">In contrast, in the present exemplary embodiment, devising the shape of each through-hole formed in the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> allows for reduction in the degree of bent in each of the layers that compose the p-electrode <b>200</b> and are laminated around the through-holes. Thus, in forming the p-electrode <b>200</b> on the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> in which the plural through-holes are formed, the occurrence of cracks in each layer composing the p-electrode <b>200</b> can be suppressed.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0176">Meanwhile, in the present exemplary embodiment, since the n-metal reflection layer <b>302</b> is a component of the n-electrode <b>300</b>, plural through-holes are provided for the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> arranged between the n-type semiconductor layer <b>140</b> and the n-electrode <b>300</b>, and the n-type semiconductor layer <b>140</b> and the n-electrode <b>300</b> (more specifically, the n-conductor portion <b>310</b> formed of the plural n-connecting conductors <b>311</b> provided for the n-electrode <b>300</b>) are electrically connected via these plural through-holes.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0179">In particular, in the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> used by flip-chip bonding as in the present exemplary embodiment, solder bumps may be formed in advance on the p-electrode <b>200</b> and the n-electrode <b>300</b> when the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> is manufactured. In many cases, a material (AuSn or the like) having a higher melting point than an ordinary solder is used for a solder bump. For this reason, when the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> is mounted by flip-chip bonding, the p-electrode <b>200</b> and the n-electrode <b>300</b> tend to be subjected to stress and thermal shock due to thermal expansion and thermal contraction. In the present exemplary embodiment, the above-described structure is employed at the boundary between the plural p-connecting conductors <b>211</b> and the p-pad portion <b>220</b> in the p-electrode <b>200</b>. Thus, even if the p-electrode <b>200</b> is subjected to thermal stress in mounting, cracks arising from heat are hardly made. Additionally, in the present exemplary embodiment, the above-described structure is employed at the boundary between the plural n-connecting conductors <b>311</b> and the n-pad portion <b>320</b> in the n-electrode <b>300</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0180">Hereinafter, a description is given of examples of the present invention. However, the present invention is not limited to the examples.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0181">The present inventor manufactured semiconductor light emission elements <b>1</b> that each have a different shape of the through-holes provided for the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b>. In this example, GaInN, which is a sort of a group III nitride semiconductor, is used as a III-V semiconductor, and the light emission wavelength λ thereof was set at 450 nm (blue light). Then, for each of the obtained semiconductor light emitting elements <b>1</b>, an evaluation was made of the boundary structure between the p-electrode <b>200</b> and the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> and the boundary structure between the n-electrode <b>300</b> and the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b>. Here, IZO was used as the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b>, and SiO<sub>2 </sub>(silicon dioxide) was used as the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b>. Additionally, the thickness of the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b> was set at about 250 nm, and the film thickness H of the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> was set at 380 nm (H≃5Q).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0188">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, it can be seen that the tapered cross sections of the through-holes provided for the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> leads to smooth continuation of the layers that compose the p-electrode <b>200</b> and are laminated around the through-holes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0189">In contrast, referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, it can be seen that if the cross sections of the through-holes provided for the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> are not made tapered but are configured so as to rise perpendicularly to the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b> (in this example, a case where the through-holes are made cylindrical), cracks are made which correspond to the bent regions in the respective layers that compose the p-electrode <b>200</b> and are laminated around the through-holes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0190">In the present exemplary embodiment, the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> having the through-holes formed therein are provided in both the p-electrode <b>200</b> and the n-electrode <b>300</b>. However, the configuration is not limited thereto. It is only necessary that the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> is provided at least on the p-electrode <b>200</b> side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0191">In the present exemplary embodiment, for the through-holes provided on the p-electrode <b>200</b> side and the through-holes provided on the n-electrode <b>300</b> side, the p-first diameter Dp<b>1</b> and the n-first diameter Dn<b>1</b> are set at the same size, and the p-second diameter Dp<b>2</b> and the n-second diameter Dn<b>2</b> are set at the same size. However, the configuration is not limited thereto. The size of each through-hole may be varied on the p-electrode <b>200</b> side and on the n-electrode <b>300</b> side, as long as the diameters satisfy relationships of Dp<b>1</b>&lt;Dp<b>2</b> and Dn<b>1</b>&lt;Dn<b>2</b>.</div>

The cross-sectional shape of each through-hole may be varied on the p-electrode <b>200</b> side and on the n-electrode <b>300</b> side, as long as the angles satisfy relationships of θp<b>1</b>&lt;θp<b>2</b> and θn<b>1</b>&lt;θn<b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0193">Furthermore, in the present exemplary embodiment, a circular structure is employed for the through-holes provided on the p-electrode <b>200</b> side and the through-holes provided on the n-electrode <b>300</b> side. However, the configuration is not limited thereto. For example, a polygonal or an elliptic structure may be employed. If a polygonal structure is employed, it is desirable to give each corner a curvature. Further, the shape of each through-hole may be varied on the p-electrode <b>200</b> side and on the n-electrode <b>300</b> side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0194">If the through-holes are formed through the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> up to the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b>, the depth of digging down is desirably 10 to 50% of the thickness of the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b>, and more desirably 15 to 30% thereof. If an attempt is made to form the through-holes without digging up to the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b>, the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> may remain at the bottoms of the through-holes in the regions where the through-holes are formed. If the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> remains at the bottoms of the through-holes, the forward voltage Vf of the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> increases. On the other hand, if the through-holes are formed so as to penetrate both the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> and the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b> (a case in which the p-type semiconductor layer <b>160</b> is exposed via the through-holes), the p-adhesion layer <b>201</b> comes into contact with the p-type semiconductor layer <b>160</b> directly. In this case, since the direct contact between the p-adhesion layer <b>201</b> and the p-type semiconductor layer <b>160</b> is not an ohmic contact, a current is not directly supplied from the p-adhesion layer <b>201</b> to the p-type semiconductor layer <b>160</b>, but is indirectly supplied from the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b> (the inner wall surfaces of the through-holes provided for the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b>) coming into contact with the p-adhesion layer <b>201</b> through the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b> to the p-type semiconductor layer <b>160</b>. Accordingly, if the through-holes provided for the transparent insulating layer <b>180</b> penetrate the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b>, the contact area between the p-electrode <b>200</b> and the transparent conductive layer <b>170</b> becomes extremely small, causing the forward voltage Vf of the semiconductor light emitting element <b>1</b> to significantly increase.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0195">Additionally, in the present exemplary embodiment, the cross-sectional shape of the inner wall surface of each through-hole is made linear for both the through-holes provided on the p-electrode <b>200</b> side and the through-holes provided on the n-electrode <b>300</b> side. However, the configuration is not limited thereto. The cross-sectional shape of the inner wall surface of each through-hole may be curvilinear, for example, or one having a step or the like, for example, as long as the p-first inclination angle θp<b>1</b> or the n-first inclination angle θn <b>1</b> is an acute angle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0196">Furthermore, in the present exemplary embodiment, the p-second inclination angle θp<b>2</b> and the n-second inclination angle θn<b>2</b> are obtuse angles for both the through-holes provided on the p-electrode <b>200</b> side and the through-holes provided on the n-electrode <b>300</b> side. However, these angles are not limited thereto, but may be right angles, for example.</div>
