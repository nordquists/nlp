<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This application is a national stage application into the USPTO of PCT/US 2011/042071 of international filing date Jun. 28, 2011, of which priority to is claimed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The invention relates to the general field of Integrated Circuit (IC) devices and fabrication methods, and more particularly to multilayer or Three Dimensional Integrated Circuit (3D-IC) devices</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">2. Discussion of Background Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Over the past 40 years, one has seen a dramatic increase in functionality and performance of Integrated Circuits (ICs). This has largely been due to the phenomenon of “scaling” i.e. component sizes within ICs have been reduced (“scaled”) with every successive generation of technology. There are two main classes of components in Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) ICs, namely transistors and wires. With “scaling”, transistor performance and density typically improve and this has contributed to the previously-mentioned increases in IC performance and functionality. However, wires (interconnects) that connect together transistors degrade in performance with “scaling”. The situation today may be that wires dominate performance, functionality and power consumption of ICs. 3D stacking of semiconductor chips may be one avenue to tackle issues with wires. By arranging transistors in 3 dimensions instead of 2 dimensions (as was the case in the 1990s), one can place transistors in ICs closer to each other. This reduces wire lengths and keeps wiring delay low. However, there are many barriers to practical implementation of 3D stacked chips. These include:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0006">Constructing transistors in ICs typically require high temperatures (higher than ˜700° C.) while wiring levels are constructed at low temperatures (lower than ˜400° C.). Copper or Aluminum wiring levels, in fact, can get damaged when exposed to temperatures higher than ˜400° C. If one would like to arrange transistors in 3 dimensions along with wires, it has the challenge described below. For example, let us consider a 2 layer stack of transistors and wires i.e. Bottom Transistor Layer, above it Bottom Wiring Layer, above it Top Transistor Layer and above it Top Wiring Layer. When the Top Transistor Layer may be constructed using Temperatures higher than 700° C., it can damage the Bottom Wiring Layer.</li> <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0007">Due to the above mentioned problem with forming transistor layers above wiring layers at temperatures lower than 400° C., the semiconductor industry has largely explored alternative architectures for 3D stacking. In these alternative architectures, Bottom Transistor Layers, Bottom Wiring Layers and Contacts to the Top Layer are constructed on one silicon wafer. Top Transistor Layers, Top Wiring Layers and Contacts to the Bottom Layer are constructed on another silicon wafer. These two wafers are bonded to each other and contacts are aligned, bonded and connected to each other as well. Unfortunately, the size of Contacts to the other Layer may be large and the number of these Contacts may be small. In fact, prototypes of 3D stacked chips today utilize as few as 10,000 connections between two layers, compared to billions of connections within a layer. This low connectivity between layers may be because of two reasons: (i) Landing pad size needs to be relatively large due to alignment issues during wafer bonding. These could be due to many reasons, including bowing of wafers to be bonded to each other, thermal expansion differences between the two wafers, and lithographic or placement misalignment. This misalignment between two wafers limits the minimum contact landing pad area for electrical connection between two layers; (ii) The contact size needs to be relatively large. Forming contacts to another stacked wafer typically involves having a Through-Silicon Via (TSV) on a chip. Etching deep holes in silicon with small lateral dimensions and filling them with metal to form TSVs may be not easy. This places a restriction on lateral dimensions of TSVs, which in turn impacts TSV density and contact density to another stacked layer. Therefore, connectivity between two wafers may be limited.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">It may be highly desirable to circumvent these issues and build 3D stacked semiconductor chips with a high-density of connections between layers. To achieve this goal, it may be sufficient that one of three requirements must be met: (1) A technology to construct high-performance transistors with processing temperatures below ˜400° C.; (2) A technology where standard transistors are fabricated in a pattern, which allows for high density connectivity despite the misalignment between the two bonded wafers; and (3) A chip architecture where process temperature increase beyond 400° C. for the transistors in the top layer does not degrade the characteristics or reliability of the bottom transistors and wiring appreciably. This patent application describes approaches to address options (1), (2) and (3) in the detailed description section. In the rest of this section, background art that has previously tried to address options (1), (2) and (3) will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">U.S. Pat. No. 7,052,941 from Sang-Yun Lee (“S-Y Lee”) describes methods to construct vertical transistors above wiring layers at less than 400° C. In these single crystal Si transistors, current flow in the transistor's channel region may be in the vertical direction. Unfortunately, however, almost all semiconductor devices in the market today (logic, DRAM, flash memory) utilize horizontal (or planar) transistors due to their many advantages, and it may be difficult to convince the industry to move to vertical transistor technology.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">A paper from IBM at the Intl. Electron Devices Meeting in 2005 describes a method to construct transistors for the top stacked layer of a 2 chip 3D stack on a separate wafer. This paper is “Enabling SOI-Based Assembly Technology for Three-Dimensional (3D) Integrated Circuits (ICs),” <i>IEDM Tech. Digest</i>, p. 363 (2005) by A. W. Topol, D. C. La Tulipe, L. Shi, et al. (“Topol”). A process flow may be utilized to transfer this top transistor layer atop the bottom wiring and transistor layers at temperatures less than 400° C. Unfortunately, since transistors are fully formed prior to bonding, this scheme suffers from misalignment issues. While Topol describes techniques to reduce misalignment errors in the above paper, the techniques of Topol still suffer from misalignment errors that limit contact dimensions between two chips in the stack to &gt;130 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">The textbook “Integrated Interconnect Technologies for 3D Nanoelectronic Systems” by Bakir and Meindl (“Bakir”) describes a 3D stacked DRAM concept with horizontal (i.e. planar) transistors. Silicon for stacked transistors may be produced using selective epitaxy technology or laser recrystallization. Unfortunately, however, these technologies have higher defect density compared to standard single crystal silicon. This higher defect density degrades transistor performance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">In the NAND flash memory industry, several organizations have attempted to construct 3D stacked memory. These attempts predominantly use transistors constructed with poly-Si or selective epi technology as well as charge-trap concepts. References that describe these attempts to 3D stacked memory include “Integrated Interconnect Technologies for 3D Nanoelectronic Systems”, Artech House, 2009 by Bakir and Meindl (“Bakir”), “Bit Cost Scalable Technology with Punch and Plug Process for Ultra High Density Flash Memory”, Symp. VLSI Technology Tech. Dig. pp. 14-15, 2007 by H. Tanaka, M. Kido, K. Yahashi, et al. (“Tanaka”), “A Highly Scalable 8-Layer 3D Vertical-Gate (VG) TFT NAND Flash Using Junction-Free Buried Channel BE-SONOS Device,” Symposium on VLSI Technology, 2010 by W. Kim, S. Choi, et al. (“W. Kim”), “A Highly Scalable 8-Layer 3D Vertical-Gate (VG) TFT NAND Flash Using Junction-Free Buried Channel BE-SONOS Device,” Symposium on VLSI Technology, 2010 by Hang-Ting Lue, et al. (“Lue”) and “Sub-50 nm Dual-Gate Thin-Film Transistors for Monolithic 3-D Flash”, IEEE Trans. Elect. Dev., vol. 56, pp. 2703-2710, November 2009 by A. J. Walker (“Walker”). An architecture and technology that utilizes single crystal Silicon using epi growth is described in “A Stacked SONOS Technology, Up to 4 Levels and 6 nm Crystalline Nanowires, with Gate-All-Around or Independent Gates (ΦFlash), Suitable for Full 3D Integration”, International Electron Devices Meeting, 2009 by A. Hubert, et al (“Hubert”). However, the approach described by Hubert has some challenges including the use of difficult-to-manufacture nanowire transistors, higher defect densities due to formation of Si and SiGe layers atop each other, high temperature processing for long times, and difficult manufacturing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">It is clear based on the background art mentioned above that invention of novel technologies for 3D stacked chips will be useful.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">Three dimensional integrated circuits are known in the art, though the field may be in its infancy with a dearth of commercial products. Many manufacturers sell multiple standard two dimensional integrated circuit (2DIC) devices in a single package known as a Multi-Chip Modules (MCM) or Multi-Chip Packages (MCP). Often these 2DICs are laid out horizontally in a single layer, like the Core 2 Quad microprocessor MCMs available from Intel Corporation of Santa Clara, Calif. In other products, the standard 2DICs are stacked vertically in the same MCP like in many of the moviNAND flash memory devices available from Samsung Electronics of Seoul, South Korea like the illustration shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 81C</figref>. None of these products are true 3DICs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">Devices where multiple layers of silicon or some other semiconductor (where each layer comprises active devices and local interconnect like a standard 2DIC) are bonded together with Through Silicon Via (TSV) technology to form a true 3DIC have been reported in the literature in the form of abstract analysis of such structures as well as devices constructed doing basic research and development in this area. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 81A</figref> illustrates an example in which Through Silicon Vias are constructed continuing vertically through all the layers creating a global interlayer connection. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 81B</figref> provides an illustration of a 3D IC system in which a Through Silicon Via <b>8104</b> may be placed at the same relative location on the top and bottom of all the 3D IC layers creating a standard vertical interface between the layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">Constructing future 3DICs may require new architectures and new ways of thinking. In particular, yield and reliability of extremely complex three dimensional systems will have to be addressed, particularly given the yield and reliability difficulties encountered in complex Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) built in recent deep submicron process generations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">Fortunately, current testing techniques will likely prove applicable to 3D IC manufacturing, though they will be applied in very different ways. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 100</figref> illustrates a prior art set scan architecture in a 2D IC ASIC <b>10000</b>. The ASIC functionality may be present in logic clouds <b>10020</b>, <b>10022</b>, <b>10024</b> and <b>10026</b> which are interspersed with sequential cells like, for example, pluralities of flip flops indicated at <b>10012</b>, <b>10014</b> and <b>10016</b>. The ASIC <b>10000</b> also has input pads <b>10030</b> and output pads <b>10040</b>. The flip flops are typically provided with circuitry to allow them to function as a shift register in a test mode. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 100</figref> the flip flops form a scan register chain where pluralities of flip flops <b>10012</b>, <b>10014</b> and <b>10016</b> are coupled together in series with Scan Test Controller <b>10010</b>. One scan chain may be shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 100</figref>, but in a practical design comprising millions of flip flops many sub-chains will be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">In the test architecture of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 100</figref>, test vectors are shifted into the scan chain in a test mode. Then the part may be placed into operating mode for one or more clock cycles, after which the contents of the flip flops are shifted out and compared with the expected results. This provides an excellent way to isolate errors and diagnose problems, though the number of test vectors in a practical design can be very large and an external tester may be often required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 101</figref> shows a prior art boundary scan architecture in exemplary ASIC <b>10100</b>. The part functionality may be shown in logic function block <b>10110</b>. The part also has a variety of input/output cells <b>10120</b>, each comprising a bond pad <b>10122</b>, an input buffer <b>10124</b>, and a tri-state output buffer <b>10126</b>. Boundary Scan Register Chains <b>10132</b> and <b>10134</b> are shown coupled in series with Scan Test Control block <b>10130</b>. This architecture operates in a similar manner as the set scan architecture of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 100</figref>. Test vectors are shifted in, the part may be clocked, and the results are then shifted out to compare with expected results. Typically, set scan and boundary scan are used together in the same ASIC to provide complete test coverage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 102</figref> shows a prior art Built-In Self Test (BIST) architecture for testing a logic block <b>10200</b> which comprises a core block function <b>10210</b> (what is being tested), inputs <b>10212</b>, outputs <b>10214</b>, a BIST Controller <b>10220</b>, an input Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) <b>10222</b>, and an output Cyclical Redundancy Check (CRC) circuit <b>10224</b>. Under control of BIST Controller <b>10220</b>, LFSR <b>10222</b> and CRC <b>10224</b> are seeded (set to a known starting value), the logic block <b>10200</b> may be clocked a predetermined number of times with LFSR <b>10222</b> presenting pseudo-random test vectors to the inputs of Block Function <b>10210</b> and CRC <b>10224</b> monitoring the outputs of Block Function <b>10210</b>. After the predetermined number of clocks, the contents of CRC <b>10224</b> are compared to the expected value (or “signature”). If the signature matches, logic block <b>10200</b> passes the test and may be deemed good. This sort of testing may be good for fast “go” or “no go” testing as it may be self-contained to the block being tested and does not require storing a large number of test vectors or use of an external tester. BIST, set scan, and boundary scan techniques are often combined in complementary ways on the same ASIC. A detailed discussion of the theory of LSFRs and CRCs can be found in Digital Systems Testing and Testable Design, by Abramovici, Breuer and Friedman, Computer Science Press, 1990, pp 432-447.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">Another prior art technique that may be applicable to the yield and reliability of 3DICs is Triple Modular Redundancy. This may be a technique where the circuitry may be instantiated in a design in triplicate and the results are compared. Because two or three of the circuit outputs are always assumed in agreement (as may be the case assuming single error and binary signals) voting circuitry (or majority-of-three or MAJ3) takes that as the result. While primarily a technique used for noise suppression in high reliability or radiation tolerant systems in military, aerospace and space applications, it also can be used as a way of masking errors in faulty circuits since if any two of three replicated circuits are functional the system will behave as if it may be fully functional. A discussion of the radiation tolerant aspects of Triple Modular Redundancy systems, Single Event Effects (SEE), Single Event Upsets (SEU) and Single Event Transients (SET) can be found in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2009/0204933 to Rezgui (“Rezgui”).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">Over the past 40 years, there has been a dramatic increase in functionality and performance of Integrated Circuits (ICs).

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">There are many techniques to construct 3D stacked integrated circuits or chips including:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">Through-silicon via (TSV) technology: Multiple layers of transistors (with or without wiring levels) can be constructed separately. Following this, they can be bonded to each other and connected to each other with through-silicon vias (TSVs).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">Monolithic 3D technology: With this approach, multiple layers of transistors and wires can be monolithically constructed. Some monolithic 3D approaches are described in pending U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 12/900,379 and 12/904,119.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">Irrespective of the technique used to construct 3D stacked integrated circuits or chips, heat removal may be a serious issue for this technology. For example, when a layer of circuits with power density P may be stacked atop another layer with power density P, the net power density may be 2P. Removing the heat produced due to this power density may be a significant challenge. In addition, many heat producing regions in 3D stacked integrated circuits or chips have a high thermal resistance to the heat sink, and this makes heat removal even more difficult.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">Several solutions have been proposed to tackle this issue of heat removal in 3D stacked integrated circuits and chips. These are described in the following paragraphs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">Many publications have suggested passing liquid coolant through multiple device layers of a 3D-IC to remove heat. This is described in “Microchannel Cooled 3D Integrated Systems”, Proc. Intl. Interconnect Technology Conference, 2008 by D. C. Sekar, et al and “Forced Convective Interlayer Cooling in Vertically Integrated Packages,” Proc. Intersoc. Conference on Thermal Management (ITHERM), 2008 by T. Brunschweiler, et al.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">Thermal vias have been suggested as techniques to transfer heat from stacked device layers to the heat sink. Use of power and ground vias for thermal conduction in 3D-ICs has also been suggested. These techniques are described in “Allocating Power Ground Vias in 3D ICs for Simultaneous Power and Thermal Integrity” ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems (TODAES), May 2009 by Hao Yu, Joanna Ho and Lei He.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">Other techniques to remove heat from 3D Integrated Circuits and Chips will be beneficial.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0005">Section 1: Construction of 3D Stacked Semiconductor Circuits and Chips with Processing Temperatures Below 400° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0233">This section of the document describes a technology to construct single-crystal silicon transistors atop wiring layers with less than 400° C. processing temperatures. This allows construction of 3D stacked semiconductor chips with high density of connections between different layers, because the top-level transistors are formed well-aligned to bottom-level wiring and transistor layers. Since the top-level transistor layers are very thin (preferably less than about 200 nm), alignment can be done through these thin silicon and oxide layers to features in the bottom-level.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0234"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows different parts of a standard transistor used in Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) logic and SRAM circuits. The transistor may be constructed out of single crystal silicon material and may include a source <b>0106</b>, a drain <b>0104</b>, a gate electrode <b>0102</b> and a gate dielectric <b>0108</b>. Single crystal silicon layers <b>0110</b> can be formed atop wiring layers at less than about 400° C. using an “ion-cut process.” Further details of the ion-cut process will be described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A-E</figref>. Note that the terms smart-cut, smart-cleave and nano-cleave are used interchangeably with the term ion-cut in this document. Gate dielectrics can be grown or deposited above silicon at less than about 400° C. using a Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) process, an Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process or a plasma-enhanced thermal oxidation process. Gate electrodes can be deposited using CVD or ALD at sub-400° C. temperatures as well. The only part of the transistor that requires temperatures greater than about 400° C. for processing may be the source-drain region, which receives ion implantation which needs to be activated. It may be clear based on <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> that novel transistors for 3D integrated circuits that do not need high-temperature source-drain region processing will be useful (to get a high density of inter-layer connections).</div>

The bottom layer <b>0202</b> can be a single crystal silicon layer. Alternatively, it can be a wafer having transistors with wiring layers above it. This process of ion-cut based layer transfer may include several steps, as described in the following sequence:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0237">Step (A): A silicon dioxide layer <b>0204</b> may be deposited above the generic bottom layer <b>0202</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> illustrates the structure after Step (A) is completed.</li> <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0238">Step (B): The top layer of doped or undoped silicon <b>0206</b> to be transferred atop the bottom layer may be processed and an oxide layer <b>0208</b> may be deposited or grown above it. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> illustrates the structure after Step (B) is completed.</li> <li id="ul0003-0003" num="0239">Step (C): Hydrogen may be implanted into the top layer silicon <b>0206</b> with the peak at a certain depth to create the hydrogen plane <b>0210</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0236">A possible flow for constructing 3D stacked semiconductor chips with standard transistors may be shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A-E</figref>. The process flow may comprise several steps in the following sequence:

<br/>
The challenge with following this flow to construct 3D integrated circuits with aluminum or copper wiring may be apparent from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A-E</figref>. During Step (E), temperatures above about 700° C. are utilized for constructing the top layer of transistors. This can damage copper or aluminum wiring in the bottom wiring layer <b>0304</b>. It may be therefore apparent from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A-E</figref> that forming source-drain regions and activating implanted dopants forms the primary concern with fabricating transistors with a low-temperature (sub-400° C.) process.

Section 1.1: Junction-Less Transistors as a Building Block for 3D Stacked Chips
</li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0237">One method to solve the issue of high-temperature source-drain junction processing may be to make transistors without junctions i.e. Junction-Less Transistors (JLTs). An embodiment of this invention uses JLTs as a building block for 3D stacked semiconductor circuits and chips.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0238"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a schematic of a junction-less transistor (JLT) also referred to as a gated resistor or nano-wire. A heavily doped silicon layer (typically above 1×10<sup>19</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, but can be lower as well) forms source <b>0404</b>, drain <b>0402</b> as well as channel region of a JLT. A gate electrode <b>0406</b> and a gate dielectric <b>0408</b> are present over the channel region of the JLT. The JLT has a very small channel area (typically less than 20 nm on one side), so the gate can deplete the channel of charge carriers at 0V and turn it off I-V curves of n channel <b>0412</b> and p channel <b>0410</b> junction-less transistors are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> as well. These indicate that the JLT can show comparable performance to a tri-gate transistor that may be commonly researched by transistor developers. Further details of the JLT can be found in “Junctionless multigate field-effect transistor,” Appl. Phys. Lett., vol. 94, pp. 053511 2009 by C.-W. Lee, A. Afzalian, N. Dehdashti Akhavan, R. Yan, I.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0239"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A-F</figref> describes a process flow for constructing 3D stacked circuits and chips using JLTs as a building block. The process flow may comprise several steps, as described in the following sequence:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0251">Step (A): The bottom layer of the 3D stack may be processed with transistors and wires. This may be indicated in the figure as bottom layer of transistors and wires <b>502</b>.

It starts by taking a donor wafer which may be already n+ doped and activated. Alternatively, the process can start by implanting a silicon wafer and activating at high temperature forming an n+ activated layer, which may be conductive or semi-conductive. Then, H+ ions are implanted for ion-cut within the n+ layer. Following this, a layer transfer may be performed. The process as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A-E</figref> may be utilized for transferring and ion-cut of the layer forming the structure of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> illustrates the structure after Step (B) is completed.</li> <li id="ul0005-0003" num="0253">Step (C): Using lithography (litho) and etch, the n+ Si layer may be defined and may be present only in regions where transistors are to be constructed.

The gate electrode material could be Titanium Nitride. Alternatively, other materials such as TaN, W, Ru, TiAlN, polysilicon could be used. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref> illustrates the structure after Step (D) is completed.</li> <li id="ul0005-0005" num="0255">Step (E): Litho and etch are conducted to leave the gate dielectric material and the gate electrode material only in regions where gates are to be formed. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref> illustrates the structure after Step (E) is completed.

This oxide region serves to isolate adjacent transistors. Following this, rest of the process flow continues, where contact and wiring layers could be formed. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5F</figref> illustrates the structure after Step (F) is completed.
<br/>
Note that top-level transistors are formed well-aligned to bottom-level wiring and transistor layers. Since the top-level transistor layers are made very thin (preferably less than 200 nm), the lithography equipment can see through these thin silicon layers and align to features at the bottom-level. While the process flow shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A-F</figref> gives the key steps involved in forming a JLT for 3D stacked circuits and chips, it is conceivable to one skilled in the art that changes to the process can be made. For example, process steps and additional materials/regions to add strain to junction-less transistors can be added or a p+ silicon layer could be used. Furthermore, more than two layers of chips or circuits can be 3D stacked.
</li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0240"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A-D</figref> shows that JLTs that can be 3D stacked fall into four categories based on the number of gates they use: One-side gated JLTs as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, two-side gated JLTs as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, three-side gated JLTs as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, and gate-all-around JLTs as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>. JLTs may include n+ silicon region <b>602</b>, gate dielectric <b>604</b>, gate electrode <b>606</b>, source region <b>608</b>, drain region <b>610</b>, and region under gate <b>612</b>. The JLT shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A-F</figref> falls into the three-side gated JLT category. As the number of JLT gates increases, the gate gets more control of the channel, thereby reducing leakage of the JLT at 0V. Furthermore, the enhanced gate control can be traded-off for higher doping (which improves contact resistance to source-drain regions) or bigger JLT cross-sectional areas (which may be easier from a process integration standpoint). However, adding more gates typically increases process complexity.</div>

Note that top-level transistors are formed well-aligned to bottom-level wiring and transistor layers. Since the top-level transistor layers are made very thin (preferably less than 200 nm), the lithography equipment can see through these thin silicon layers and align to features at the bottom-level. While the process flow shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A-E</figref> gives the key steps involved in forming a two side gated JLT for 3D stacked circuits and chips, it is conceivable to one skilled in the art that changes to the process can be made. For example, process steps and additional materials/regions to add strain to junction-less transistors can be added. Furthermore, more than two layers of chips or circuits can be 3D stacked. An important note in respect to the JLT devices been presented may be that the layer transferred used for the construction may a thin layer of less than about 200 nm and in many applications even less than about 40 nm. This may be achieved by the depth of the implant of the H+ layer used for the ion-cut and by following this by thinning using etch and/or CMP.

Note that top-level transistors are formed well-aligned to bottom-level wiring and transistor layers. This, in turn, may be due to top-level transistor layers being very thin (typically less than 200 nm). One can look through these thin silicon layers and align to features at the bottom-level. Due to their extensive use in the DRAM industry, several technologies exist to optimize RCAT processes and devices. These are described in “The breakthrough in data retention time of DRAM using Recess-Channel-Array Transistor (RCAT) for 88 nm feature size and beyond,” <i>VLSI Technology, </i>2003. <i>Digest of Technical Papers. </i>2003 <i>Symposium on</i>, vol., no., pp. 11-12, 10-12 Jun. 2003 by Kim, J.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0007">Section 1.3: Improvements and Alternatives</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0255">Various methods, technologies and procedures to improve devices shown in Section 1.1 and Section 1.2 are given in this section. Single crystal silicon (this term used interchangeably with mono-crystalline silicon) may be used for constructing transistors in Section 1.3. Thickness of layer transferred silicon may be typically less than about 2 um or less than about 1 um or could be even less than about 0.2 um, unless stated otherwise. Interconnect (wiring) layers are constructed substantially of copper or aluminum or some other higher conductivity material, such as silver. The term planar transistor or horizontally oriented transistor could be used to describe any constructed transistor where source and drain regions are in the same horizontal plane and current flows between them.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0008">Section 1.3.1: Construction of CMOS Circuits with Sub-400° C. Processed Transistors</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0256"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A-I</figref> show procedures for constructing CMOS circuits using sub-400° C. processed transistors (i.e. junction-less transistors and recessed channel transistors) described thus far in this document. When doing layer transfer for junction-less transistors and recessed channel transistors, it may be easy to construct just nMOS transistors in a layer or just pMOS transistors in a layer. However, constructing CMOS circuits requires both nMOS transistors and pMOS transistors, so it requires additional ideas. NMOS transistors may also be called ‘p-type’ transistors' and PMOS transistors may also be called ‘n-type transistors’ in this document.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0257"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref> shows one procedure for forming CMOS circuits. nMOS and pMOS layers of CMOS circuits are stacked atop each other. A layer of n-channel sub-400° C. transistors (with none or one or more wiring layers) <b>1406</b> with associated oxide layer <b>1404</b> may be first formed over a bottom layer of transistors and wires <b>1402</b>. Following this, a layer of p-channel sub-400° C. transistors (with none or one or more wiring layers) <b>1410</b> with associated oxide layer <b>1406</b> may be formed. Oxide layer <b>1412</b> may be deposited over the stack structure. This structure may be important since CMOS circuits typically include both n-channel and p-channel transistors. A high density of connections exists between different layers <b>1402</b>, <b>1406</b> and <b>1410</b>. The p-channel wafer <b>1410</b> could have its own optimized crystal structure that improves mobility of p-channel transistors while the n-channel wafer <b>1406</b> could have its own optimized crystal structure that improves mobility of n-channel transistors. For example, it is known that mobility of p-channel transistors may be maximum in the (110) plane while the mobility of n-channel transistors may be maximum in the (100) plane. The wafers <b>1410</b> and <b>1406</b> could have these optimized crystal structures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0258"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B-F</figref> shows another procedure for forming CMOS circuits that utilizes junction-less transistors and repeating layouts in one direction. The procedure may include several steps, in the following sequence:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0014-0001" num="0331">Step (1): A bottom layer of transistors and wires <b>1414</b> may be first constructed above which a layer of landing pads <b>1418</b> may be constructed. A layer of silicon dioxide <b>1416</b> may be then constructed atop the layer of landing pads <b>1418</b>. Size of the landing pads <b>1418</b> may be W<sub>x</sub>+delta (W<sub>x</sub>) in the X direction, where W<sub>x </sub>may be the distance of one repeat of the repeating pattern in the (to be constructed) top layer. delta(W<sub>x</sub>) may be an offset added to account for some overlap into the adjacent region of the repeating pattern and some margin for rotational (angular) misalignment within one chip (IC). Size of the landing pads <b>1418</b> may be F or 2 F plus a margin for rotational misalignment within one chip (IC) or higher in the Y direction, where F is the minimum feature size. Note that the terms landing pad and metal strip are used interchangeably in this document. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref> is a drawing illustration after Step (1).</li> <li id="ul0014-0002" num="0332">Step (2): A top layer having regions of n+ Si <b>1424</b> and p+ Si <b>1422</b> repeating over-and-over again may be constructed atop a p− Si wafer <b>1420</b> with associated oxide <b>1426</b> for isolation. The pattern repeats in the X direction with a repeat distance denoted by W. In the Y direction, there may be no pattern at all; the wafer may be completely uniform in that direction. This ensures misalignment in the Y direction does not impact device and circuit construction, except for any rotational misalignment causing difference between the left and right side of one IC. A maximum rotational (angular) misalignment of 0.5 um over a 200 mm wafer results in maximum misalignment within one 10 by 10 mm IC of 25 nm in both X and Y direction. Total misalignment in the X direction may be much larger, which is addressed in this invention as shown in the following steps. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref> shows a drawing illustration after Step (2).</li> <li id="ul0014-0003" num="0333">Step (3): The top layer shown in Step (2) receives an H+ implant to create the cleaving plane in the p− silicon region and may be flipped and bonded atop the bottom layer shown in Step (1). A procedure similar to the one shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A-E</figref> may be utilized for this purpose. Note that the top layer shown in Step (2) has had its dopants activated with an anneal before layer transfer. The top layer may be cleaved and the remaining p− region may be etched or polished (CMP) away until only the N+ and P+ stripes remain. During the bonding process, a misalignment can occur in X and Y directions, while the angular alignment may be typically small. This may be because the misalignment may be due to factors like wafer bow, wafer expansion due to thermal differences between bonded wafers, etc.; these issues do not typically cause angular alignment problems, while they impact alignment in X and Y directions.
<br/>
Since the width of the landing pads may be slightly wider than the width of the repeating n and p pattern in the X-direction and there's no pattern in the Y direction, the circuitry in the top layer can shifted left or right and up or down until the layer-to-layer contacts within the top circuitry are placed on top of the appropriate landing pad. This is further explained below:
</li> <li id="ul0014-0004" num="0334">Let us assume that after the bonding process, co-ordinates of alignment mark of the top wafer are (x<sub>top</sub>, y<sub>top</sub>) while co-ordinates of alignment mark of the bottom wafer are (x<sub>bottom</sub>, y<sub>bottom</sub>). <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14D</figref> shows a drawing illustration after Step (3).</li> <li id="ul0014-0005" num="0335">Step (4): A virtual alignment mark may be created by the lithography tool. X co-ordinate of this virtual alignment mark may be at the location (x<sub>top</sub>+(an integer k)*W<sub>x</sub>). The integer k may be chosen such that modulus or absolute value of (x<sub>top</sub>+(integer k)*W<sub>x</sub>−x<sub>bottom</sub>)&lt;=W<sub>x</sub>/2. This guarantees that the X co-ordinate of the virtual alignment mark may be within a repeat distance (or within the same section of width W<sub>x</sub>) of the X alignment mark of the bottom wafer. Y co-ordinate of this virtual alignment mark may be y<sub>bottom </sub>(since silicon thickness of the top layer may be thin, the lithography tool can see the alignment mark of the bottom wafer and compute this quantity). Though-silicon connections <b>1428</b> are now constructed with alignment mark of this mask aligned to the virtual alignment mark. The terms through via or through silicon vias can be used interchangeably with the term through-silicon connections in this document. Since the X co-ordinate of the virtual alignment mark may be within the same ((p+)-oxide-(n+)-oxide) repeating pattern (of length W<sub>x</sub>) as the bottom wafer X alignment mark, the through-silicon connection <b>1428</b> substantially always falls on the bottom landing pad <b>1418</b> (the bottom landing pad length may be W<sub>x </sub>added to delta (W<sub>x</sub>), and this spans the entire length of the repeating pattern in the X direction). <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14E</figref> is a drawing illustration after Step (4).</li> <li id="ul0014-0006" num="0336">Step (5): n channel and p channel junction-less transistors are constructed aligned to the virtual alignment mark. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14F</figref> is a drawing illustration after Step (5).
<br/>
From steps (1) to (5), it may be clear that 3D stacked semiconductor circuits and chips can be constructed with misalignment tolerance techniques. Essentially, a combination of 3 key ideas—repeating patterns in one direction of length W<sub>x</sub>, landing pads of length (W<sub>x</sub>+delta (W<sub>x</sub>)) and creation of virtual alignment marks—are used such that even if misalignment occurs, through silicon connections fall on their respective landing pads. While the explanation in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B-F</figref> is shown for a junction-less transistor, similar procedures can also be used for recessed channel transistors. Thickness of the transferred single crystal silicon or mono-crystalline silicon layer may be less than about 2 um, and can be even lower than about 1 um or about 0.4 um or about 0.2 um.

Section 1.3.2: Accurate Transfer of Thin Layers of Silicon with Ion-Cut
</li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0260">It may be desirable to transfer very thin layers of silicon (less than about 100 nm) atop a bottom layer of transistors and wires using the ion-cut technique. For example, for the process flow in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A-F</figref>, it may be desirable to have very thin layers (&lt;100 nm) of n+ Si <b>1109</b>. In that scenario, implanting hydrogen and cleaving the n+ region may not give the exact thickness of n+ Si desirable for device operation. An improved process for addressing this issue is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A-F</figref>. The process flow in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A-F</figref> may include several steps as described in the following sequence:

It is clear from the process shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A-F</figref> that one can get excellent control of the n+ layer <b>1508</b>'s thickness after layer transfer.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0277">Most of the figures described thus far in this document assumed the transferred top layer of silicon may be very thin (for example, less than about 200 nm).

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0278">Additionally, when circuit cells are built on two or more layers of thin silicon, and enjoy the dense vertical through silicon via interconnections, the metallization layer scheme to take advantage of this dense 3D technology may be improved as follows. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</figref> illustrates the prior art of silicon integrated circuit metallization schemes. The conventional transistor silicon layer <b>2402</b> may be connected to the first metal layer <b>2410</b> thru the contact <b>2404</b>. The dimensions of this interconnect pair of contact and metal lines generally are at the minimum line resolution of the lithography and etch capability for that technology process node. Traditionally, this may be called a “1X’ design rule metal layer. Usually, the next metal layer may be also at the “1X’ design rule, the metal line <b>2412</b> and via below <b>2405</b> and via above <b>2406</b> that connects metal line <b>2412</b> with <b>2410</b> or with <b>2414</b> where desired. Then the next few layers are often constructed at twice the minimum lithographic and etch capability and called ‘2X’ metal layers, and have thicker metal for current carrying capability. These are illustrated with metal line <b>2414</b> paired with via <b>2407</b> and metal line <b>2416</b> paired with via <b>2408</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</figref>. Accordingly, the metal via pairs of <b>2418</b> with <b>2409</b>, and <b>2420</b> with bond pad opening <b>2422</b>, represent the ‘4X’ metallization layers where the planar and thickness dimensions are again larger and thicker than the 2X and 1X layers. The precise number of 1X or 2X or 4X layers may vary depending on interconnection needs and other requirements; however, the general flow may be that of increasingly larger metal line, metal space, and via dimensions as the metal layers are farther from the silicon transistors and closer to the bond pads.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0279">The metallization layer scheme may be improved for 3D circuits as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24B</figref>. The first crystallized silicon device layer <b>2454</b> may be illustrated as the NMOS silicon transistor layer from the above 3D library cells, but may also be a conventional logic transistor silicon substrate or layer. The ‘1X’ metal layers <b>2450</b> and <b>2449</b> are connected with contact <b>2440</b> to the silicon transistors and vias <b>2438</b> and <b>2439</b> to each other or metal <b>2448</b>. The 2X layer pairs metal <b>2448</b> with via <b>2437</b> and metal <b>2447</b> with via <b>2436</b>. The 4X metal layer <b>2446</b> may be paired with via <b>2435</b> and metal <b>2445</b>, also at 4X. However, now via <b>2434</b> may be constructed in 2X design rules to enable metal line <b>2444</b> to be at 2X. Metal line <b>2443</b> and via <b>2433</b> are also at 2X design rules and thicknesses. Vias <b>2432</b> and <b>2431</b> are paired with metal lines <b>2442</b> and <b>2441</b> at the 1X minimum design rule dimensions and thickness. The thru silicon via <b>2430</b> of the illustrated PMOS layer transferred silicon layer <b>2452</b> may then be constructed at the 1X minimum design rules and provide for maximum density of the top layer. The precise numbers of 1X or 2X or 4X layers may vary depending on circuit area and current carrying metallization requirements and tradeoffs.

Then the top transistor source <b>4308</b> and drain <b>4310</b> are defined by etching away the n+ from the region designated for gates <b>4312</b> and the isolation region between transistors <b>4314</b>. This step may be aligned to the bottom layer of transistors and wires <b>4306</b> so the formed transistors could be properly connected to the underlying bottom layer of transistors and wires <b>4306</b>. Then an additional masking and etch step may be performed to remove the n− layer between transistors, shown as <b>4316</b>, thus providing better transistor isolation as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43C</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43D</figref> illustrates an optional formation of shallow p+ region <b>4318</b> for the JFET gate formation.

After the thick oxide deposition <b>4320</b>, a layer of a light reflecting material, such as, for example, Aluminum, may be applied as a reflective layer <b>4322</b>. An opening <b>4324</b> in the reflective layer may be masked and etched, allowing the laser light <b>4326</b> to heat the p+ implanted area <b>4330</b>, and reflecting the majority of the laser energy from laser light <b>4326</b> away from bottom layer of transistors and wires <b>4306</b>. Normally, the open area <b>4324</b> may be less than 10% of the total wafer area. Additionally, a reflective layer <b>4328</b> of copper, or, alternatively, a reflective Aluminum layer or other reflective material, may be formed in the bottom layer of transistors and wires <b>4306</b> that will additionally reflect any of the laser energy from laser light <b>4326</b> that might travel to bottom layer of transistors and wires <b>4306</b>. This same reflective &amp; open laser anneal technique might be utilized on any of the other illustrated structures to enable implant activation for transistors in the second layer transfer process flow. In addition, absorptive materials may, alone or in combination with reflective materials, also be utilized in the above laser or other optical energy transfer anneal techniques. A photonic energy absorbing layer <b>4332</b>, such as amorphous carbon of an appropriate thickness, may be deposited or sputtered at low temperature over the area that needs to be laser heated, and then masked and etched as appropriate, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43F</figref>. This allows the minimum laser energy to be employed to effectively heat the area to be implant activated, and thereby minimizes the heat stress on the reflective layers <b>4322</b> &amp; <b>4328</b> and the bottom layer of transistors and wires <b>4306</b>. The laser or optical energy reflecting layer <b>4322</b> can then be etched or polished away and contacts can be made to various terminals of the transistor. This flow enables the formation of fully crystallized top JFET transistors that could be connected to the underlying multi-metal layer semiconductor device without exposing the underlying device to high temperature.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0281">Section 1 described the formation of 3D stacked semiconductor circuits and chips with sub-400° C. processing temperatures to build transistors and high density of vertical connections. In this section an alternative method may be explained, in which a transistor may be built with any replacement gate (or gate-last) scheme that may be utilized widely in the industry. This method allows for high temperatures (above about 400° C.) to build the transistors. This method utilizes a combination of three concepts:

In these repeating layouts, transistors could be arranged in substantially parallel bands.
<br/>
A very high density of vertical connections may be possible with this method. Single crystal silicon (or mono-crystalline silicon) layers that are transferred may be less than about 2 um thick, or could even be thinner than about 0.4 um or about 0.2 um. This replacement gate process may also be called a gate replacement process.

The connection paths between two transistors located on two layers therefore may include: a first landing pad or metal strip substantially parallel to a certain axis, a through via and a second landing pad or metal strip substantially perpendicular to a certain axis. Features are formed using virtual alignment marks whose positions depend on misalignment during bonding. Also, through-silicon connections in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26A-D</figref> have relatively high capacitance due to the size of the landing pads. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that variations of this process flow are possible (e.g., different versions of regular layouts could be used along with replacement gate processes to get a high density of connections between 3D stacked circuits and chips).

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0288">An interesting alternative may be available when using the carrier wafer flow described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46A-G</figref>. In this flow we can use the two sides of the transferred layer to build NMOS, a ‘p-type transistor’, on one side and PMOS, an ‘n-type transistor’ on the other side Timing properly the replacement gate step such flow could enable full performance transistors properly aligned to each other.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0289">Another alternative is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref> whereby the implant of an atomic species <b>4810</b>, such as H+, may be screened from the sensitive gate areas <b>4803</b> by first masking and etching a shield implant stopping layer of a dense material <b>4850</b>, for example 5,000 angstroms of Tantalum, and may be combined with 5,000 angstroms of photoresist <b>4852</b>.

Moreover, a heterostructure bipolar transistor (HBT) may be utilized in the floating body structure by using silicon for the emitter region and SiGe for the base and collector regions, thus giving a higher beta than a regular bipolar junction transistor (BJT).

A 3D charge-trap memory has thus been constructed, with (1) horizontally-oriented transistors—i.e. current flowing in substantially the horizontal direction in transistor channels, (2) some of the memory cell control lines—e.g., bit lines BL, constructed of heavily doped silicon and embedded in the memory cell layer, (3) side gates simultaneously deposited over multiple memory layers for transistors, and (4) mono-crystalline (or single-crystal) silicon layers obtained by layer transfer techniques such as ion-cut. This use of single-crystal silicon obtained with ion-cut is a key differentiator from past work on 3D charge-trap memories such as “A Highly Scalable 8-Layer 3D Vertical-Gate (VG) TFT NAND Flash Using Junction-Free Buried Channel BE-SONOS Device,” Symposium on VLSI Technology, 2010 by Hang-Ting Lue, et al. that used polysilicon.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0314">It may be desirable to place the peripheral circuits for functions such as, for example, memory control, on the same mono-crystalline silicon or polysilicon layer as the memory elements or string rather than reside on a mono-crystalline silicon or polysilicon layer above or below the memory elements or string on a 3D IC memory chip. However, that memory layer substrate thickness or doping may preclude proper operation of the peripheral circuits as the memory layer substrate thickness or doping provides a fully depleted transistor channel and junction structure, such as, for example, FD-SOI.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0017">Section 10: NuPackning Technology</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0336"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53A</figref> illustrates a packaging scheme used for several high-performance microchips. A silicon chip <b>5302</b> may be attached to an organic substrate <b>5304</b> using solder bumps <b>5308</b>. The organic substrate <b>5304</b>, in turn, may be connected to an FR4 printed wiring board (also called board) <b>5306</b> using solder bumps <b>5312</b>. The co-efficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of silicon may be about 3.2 ppm/K, the CTE of organic substrates may be typically about 17 ppm/K and the CTE of FR4 material may be typically about 17 ppm/K. Due to this large mismatch between CTE of the silicon chip <b>5302</b> and the organic substrate <b>5304</b>, the solder bumps <b>5308</b> are subjected to stresses, which can cause defects and cracking in solder bumps <b>5308</b>. To avoid this, underfill material <b>5310</b> may be dispensed between solder bumps. While underfill material <b>5310</b> can prevent defects and cracking, it can cause other challenges. Firstly, when solder bump sizes are reduced or when high density of solder bumps may be required, dispensing underfill material becomes difficult or even impossible, since underfill cannot flow in little spaces. Secondly, underfill may be hard to remove once dispensed. Due to this, if a chip on a substrate may be found to have defects and needs to be removed and replaced by another chip, it may be difficult. This makes production of multi-chip substrates difficult. Thirdly, underfill can cause the stress due to the mismatch of CTE between the silicon chip <b>5302</b> and the organic substrate <b>5304</b> to be more efficiently communicated to the low k dielectric layers present between on-chip interconnects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0337"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54B</figref> illustrates a packaging scheme used for many low-power microchips. A silicon chip <b>5314</b> may be directly connected to an FR4 substrate <b>5316</b> using solder bumps <b>5318</b>. Due to the large difference in CTE between the silicon chip <b>5314</b> and the FR4 substrate <b>5316</b>, underfill <b>5320</b> may be dispensed many times between solder bumps. As mentioned previously, underfill brings with it challenges related to difficulty of removal and stress communicated to the chip low k dielectric layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0338">In both of the packaging types described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54A</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54B</figref> and also many other packaging methods available in the literature, the mismatch of co-efficient of thermal expansion (CTE) between a silicon chip and a substrate, or between a silicon chip and a printed wiring board, may be a serious issue in the packaging industry. A technique to solve this problem without the use of underfill may be advantageous.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0339"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54A-F</figref> describes an embodiment of this invention, where use of underfill may be avoided in the packaging process of a chip constructed on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer.

Background information on silicides utilized for contact resistance reduction can be found in “NiSi Salicide Technology for Scaled CMOS,” H. Iwai, et. al., Microelectronic Engineering, 60 (2002), pp 157-169; “Nickel vs. Cobalt Silicide integration for sub-50 nm CMOS”, B.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0374">While the “silicide-before-layer-transfer” process flow described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59A-I</figref> can be used for many sub-400° C. 3D stacking applications, alternative approaches exist. Silicon forms silicides with many materials such as nickel, cobalt, platinum, titanium, manganese, and other materials that form silicides with silicon. By alloying two materials, one of which has a silicidation temperature greater than about 400° C. and one of which has a silicidation temperature less than about 400° C., in a certain ratio, the silicidation temperature of the alloy can be reduced to below about 400° C. For example, nickel silicide has a silicidation temperature of 400-450° C., while platinum silicide has a silicidation temperature of about 300° C. By depositing an alloy of Nickel and Platinum (in a certain ratio) on a silicon region and then annealing to form a silicide, one could lower the silicidation temperature to less than about 400° C. Another example could be deposition of an alloy of Nickel and Palladium (in a certain ratio) on a silicon region and then annealing to form a silicide, one could lower the silicidation temperature to less than about 400° C. As mentioned below, Nickel Silicide forms at about 400-450° C., while Palladium Silicide forms at around 250° C. By forming a mixture of these two silicides, silicidation temperature may be lowered to less than about 400° C.</div>

It will be obvious to someone skilled in the art that alternative versions of this flow are possible with various methods to attach temporary carriers and with various versions of the gate-last process flow. One alternative version of this flow is as follows. Multiple layers of transistors may be formed atop each other using layer transfer schemes. Each layer may have its own gate dielectric, gate electrode and source-drain implants. Process steps such as isolation may be shared between these multiple layers of transistors, and these steps could be performed once the multiple layers of transistors (with gate dielectrics, gate electrodes and source-drain implants) are formed atop each other. A shared rapid thermal anneal may be conducted to activate dopants in the multiple layers of transistors. The multilayer transistor stack may then be layer transferred onto a temporary carrier following which transistor layers may be transferred one at a time onto different substrates using multiple layer transfer steps. A replacement gate process may then be carried out once layer transfer steps are complete.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0399"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 75A</figref> is a drawing illustration of the principle of programmable (or configurable) interconnect tile <b>7500</b> using Antifuse. Two consecutive metal layers have orthogonal arrays of metal strips, <b>7510</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>7510</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>7510</b>-<b>3</b>, <b>7510</b>-<b>4</b> and <b>7508</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>7508</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>7508</b>-<b>3</b>, <b>7508</b>-<b>4</b>. AFs are present in the dielectric isolation layer between two consecutive metal layers at crossover locations between the perpendicular traces, e.g., <b>7512</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>7512</b>-<b>4</b>. Normally the AF starts in its isolating state, and to program it so the two strips <b>7510</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>7508</b>-<b>4</b> will connect, one needs to apply a relatively high programming voltage <b>7506</b> to strip <b>7510</b>-<b>1</b> through programming transistor <b>7504</b>, and ground <b>7514</b> to strip <b>7508</b>-<b>4</b> through programming transistor <b>7518</b>. This is done by applying appropriate control pattern to Y decoder <b>7502</b> and X decoder <b>7516</b>, respectively. A typical programmable connectivity array tile will have up to a few tens of metal strips to serve as connectivity for a Logic Block (“LB”) described later.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0400">One should recognize that the regular pattern of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 75A</figref> often needs to be modified to accommodate specific needs of the architecture. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 75B</figref> describes a routing tile <b>7500</b>B where one of the full-length strips was partitioned into shorter sections <b>7508</b>-<b>4</b>B<b>1</b> and <b>7508</b>-<b>4</b>B<b>2</b>. This allows, for example, for two distinct electrical signals to use a space assigned to a single track and is often used when LB input and output (“I/O”) signals need to connect to the routing fabric. Since Logic Block may have 10-20 (or even more) I/O pins, using a full-length strip wastes a significant number of available tracks. Instead, splitting of strips into multiple section is often used to allow I/O signals to connect to the programmable interconnect using at most two, rather than four, AFs <b>7512</b>-<b>3</b>B, <b>7512</b>-<b>4</b>B, and hence trading access to routing tracks with fabric size. Additional penalty is that multiple programming transistors, <b>7518</b>-B and <b>7518</b>-B<b>1</b> in this case instead of just <b>7518</b>-B, and additional decoder outputs, are needed to accommodate the multiplicity of fractional strips. Another use for fractional strips may be to connect to tracks from another routing hierarchy, e.g., longer tracks, or for bringing other special signals such as local clocks, local resets, etc., into the routing fabric.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0401">Unlike prior art for designing Field Programmable Gate Array (“FPGA”), the current invention suggests constructing the programming transistors and much or all of the programming circuitry at a level above the one where the functional diffusion level circuitry of the FPGA resides, hereafter referred to as an “Attic.”. This provides an advantage in that the technology used for the functional FPGA circuitry has very different characteristics from the circuitry used to program the FPGA. Specifically, the functional circuitry typically needs to be done in an aggressive low-voltage technology to achieve speed, power, and density goals of large scale designs. In contrast, the programming circuitry needs high voltages, does not need to be particularly fast because it operates only in preparation of the actual in-circuit functional operation, and does not need to be particularly dense as it needs only on the order of 2N transistors for N*N programmable AFs. Placing the programming circuitry on a different level from the functional circuitry allows for a better design tradeoff than placing them next to each other. A typical example of the cost of placing both types of circuitry next to each other is the large isolation space between each region because of their different operating voltage. This is avoided in the case of placing programming circuitry not in the base (i.e., functional) silicon but rather in the Attic above the functional circuitry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0402">It is important to note that because the programming circuitry imposes few design constraints except for high voltage, a variety of technologies such as Thin Film Transistors (“TFT”), Vacuum FET, bipolar transistors, and others, can readily provide such programming function in the Attic.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0403">A possible fabrication method for constructing the programming circuitry in an Attic above the functional circuitry on the base silicon is by bonding a programming circuitry wafer on top of functional circuitry wafer using Through Silicon Vias. Other possibilities include layer transfer using ion implantation (typically but not exclusively hydrogen), spraying and subsequent doping of amorphous silicon, carbon nano-structures, and similar. The key that enables the use of such techniques, that often produce less efficient semiconductor devices in the Attic, is the absence of need for high performance and fast switching from programming transistors. The only major requirement is the ability to withstand relatively high voltages, as compared with the functional circuitry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0404">Another advantage of AF-based FPGA with programming circuitry in an Attic is a simple path to low-cost volume production. One needs simply to remove the Attic and replace the AF layer with a relatively inexpensive custom via or metal mask.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0405">Another advantage of programming circuitry being above the functional circuitry is the relatively low impact of the vertical connectivity on the density of the functional circuitry. By far, the overwhelming number of programming AFs resides in the programmable interconnect and not in the Logic Blocks. Consequently, the vertical connections from the programmable interconnections need to go upward towards the programming transistors in the Attic and do not need to cross downward towards the functional circuitry diffusion area, where dense connectivity between the routing fabric and the LBs occurs, where it would incur routing congestion and density penalty.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0406"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 76A</figref> is a drawing illustration of a routing tile <b>7500</b> similar to that in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 75A</figref>, where the horizontal and vertical strips are on different but adjacent metal layers. Tile <b>7520</b> is similar to routing tile <b>7500</b> but rotated 90 degrees. When larger routing fabric is constructed from individual tiles, we need to control signal propagation between tiles. This can be achieved by stitching the routing fabric from same orientation tiles (as in either <b>7500</b> or <b>7520</b> with bridges such as <b>701</b>A or <b>701</b>VV, described later, optionally connecting adjacent strips) or from alternating orientation tiles, such as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 76B</figref>. In that case the horizontal and vertical tracks alternate between the two metals such as <b>7602</b> and <b>7604</b>, or <b>7608</b> and <b>7612</b>, with AF present at each overlapping edge such as <b>7606</b> and <b>7610</b>. When a segment needs to be extended its edge AF <b>7606</b> (or <b>7610</b>) is programmed to conduct, whereas by default each segment will span only to the edge of its corresponding tile. Change of signal direction, such as vertical to horizontal (or vice versa) is achieved by programming non-edge AF such as <b>7512</b>-<b>1</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 75A</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0407">Logic Blocks are constructed to implement programmable logic functions. There are multiple ways of constructing LBs that can be programmed by AFs.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0408">Each logic block needs to be able to drive its outputs onto the programmable routing. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77A</figref> illustrates an inverter <b>7704</b> (with input <b>7702</b> and output <b>7706</b>) that can perform this function with logical inversion. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77B</figref> describes two inverters configured as a non-inverting buffer <b>7714</b> (with input <b>7712</b> and output <b>7716</b>) made of variable size inverters <b>7710</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0413"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 79</figref> is a drawing illustration of an example Antifuse-based FPGA tiling <b>7900</b> as mentioned above. It comprises of LB <b>7910</b> embedded in programmable routing fabric <b>7920</b>. The LB can include any combination of the components described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 77A-D</figref> and <b>78</b>-<b>78</b>A, with its inputs and outputs <b>7902</b> and <b>7906</b>. Each one of the inputs and outputs can be connected to short horizontal wires such as <b>7922</b>H by an AF-based connection matrix <b>7908</b> made of individual AFs such as <b>7901</b>. The short horizontal wires can span multiple tiles through activating AF-based programming bridges <b>7901</b> HH and <b>7901</b>A. These programming bridges are constructed either from short strips on adjacent metal layer in the same direction as the main wire and with an AF at each end of the short strip, or through rotating adjacent tiles by 90 degree as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 76B</figref> and using single AF for bridging. Similarly, short vertical wires <b>7922</b>V can span multiple tiles through activating AF-based programming bridges <b>7901</b> VV. Change of signal direction from horizontal to vertical and vice versa can be achieved through activating AFs <b>7901</b> in connection matrices like <b>7901</b>HV. In addition to short wires the tile also includes horizontal and vertical long wires <b>7924</b>. These wires span multiple cells and only a fraction of them is accessible to the short wires in a given tile through AF-based connection <b>7924</b>LH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0414">The depiction of the AF-based programmable tile above is just one example, and other variations are possible.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0415"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 80</figref> is a drawing illustration of alternative implementation of the current invention, with AFs present in two dielectric layers. Here the functional transistors of the Logic Blocks are defined in the base substrate <b>8002</b>, with low metal layers <b>8004</b> (M1 &amp; M2 in this depiction, can be more as needed) providing connectivity for the definition of the LB. AFs are present in select locations between metal layers of low metal layers <b>8004</b> to assist in finalizing the function of the LB. AFs in low metal layers <b>8004</b> can also serve to configure clocks and other special signals (e.g., reset) present in layer <b>8006</b> for connection to the LB and other special functions that do not require high density programmable connectivity to the configurable interconnect fabric <b>8007</b>. Additional AF use can be to power on used LBs and un-power the unused ones to save on power dissipation of the device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0416">On top of layer <b>8006</b> comes configurable interconnect fabric <b>8007</b> with a second Antifuse layer. This connectivity is done similarly to the way depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 79</figref> typically occupying two or four metal layers. Programming of AFs in both layers is done with programming circuitry designed in an Attic TFT layer <b>8010</b>, or other alternative over the oxide transistors, placed on top of configurable interconnect fabric <b>8007</b> similarly to what was described previously. Finally, additional metals layers <b>8012</b> are deposited on top of Attic TFT layer <b>8010</b> to complete the programming circuitry in Attic TFT layer <b>8010</b>, as well as provide connections to the outside for the FPGA.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0417">The advantage of this alternative implementation is that two layers of AFs provide increased programmability (and hence flexibility) for FPGA, with the lower AF layer close to the base substrate where LB configuration needs to be done, and the upper AF layer close to the metal layers comprising the configurable interconnect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0418">U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,374,564 and 6,528,391, describe the process of Layer Transfer whereby a few tens or hundreds nanometer thick layer of mono-crystalline silicon from “donor” wafer is transferred on top of a base wafer using oxide-oxide bonding and ion implantation. Such a process, for example, is routinely used in the industry to fabricate the so-called Silicon-on-Insulator (“SOI”) wafers for high performance integrated circuits (“IC”s).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0419">Yet another alternative implementation of the current invention is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 80A</figref>. It builds on the structure of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 80</figref>, except that what was base substrate <b>8002</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 80</figref> is now a primary silicon layer <b>8002</b>A placed on top of an insulator above base substrate <b>8014</b> using the abovementioned Layer Transfer process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0420">In contrast to the typical SOI process where the base substrate carries no circuitry, the current invention suggest to use base substrate <b>8014</b> to provide high voltage programming circuits that will program the lower level low metal layers <b>8004</b> of AFs. We will use the term “Foundation” to describe this layer of programming devices, in contrast to the “Attic” layer of programming devices placed on top that has been previously described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0421">The major obstacle to using circuitry in the Foundation is the high temperature potentially needed for Layer Transfer, and the high temperature needed for processing the primary silicon layer <b>8002</b>A. High temperatures in excess of 400° C. that are often needed for implant activation or other processing can cause damage to pre-existing copper or aluminum metallization patterns that may have been previously fabricated in Foundation base substrate <b>8014</b>. U.S. Patent Application Publication 2009/0224364 proposes using tungsten-based metallization to complete the wiring of the relatively simple circuitry in the Foundation. Tungsten has very high melting temperature and can withstand the high temperatures that may be needed for both for Layer Transfer and for processing of primary silicon layer <b>8002</b>A. Because the Foundation provides mostly the programming circuitry for AFs in low metal layers <b>8004</b>, its lithography can be less advanced and less expensive than that of the primary silicon layer <b>8002</b>A and facilitates fabrication of high voltage devices needed to program AFs. Further, the thinness and hence the transparency of the SOI layer facilitates precise alignment of patterning of primary silicon layer <b>8002</b>A to the underlying patterning of base substrate <b>8014</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0422">Having two layers of AF-programming devices, Foundation on the bottom and Attic on the top, is an effective way to architect AF-based FPGAs with two layers of AFs. The first AF layer low metal layers <b>8004</b> is close to the primary silicon base substrate <b>8002</b> that it configures, and its connections <b>8016</b> to it and to the Foundation programming devices in base substrate <b>8014</b> may be directed downwards. The second layer of AFs in configurable interconnect fabric <b>8007</b> has its programming connections directed upward towards Attic TFT layer <b>8010</b>. This way the AF connections to its programming circuitry minimize routing congestion across layers <b>8002</b>, <b>8004</b>, <b>8006</b>, and <b>8007</b>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0426">In general, logic devices need varying amounts of logic, memory, and I/O. The continuous array (“CA”) of U.S. Pat. No. 7,105,871 allows flexible definition of the logic device size, yet for any size the ratio between the three components remained fixed, barring minor boundary effect variations. Further, there exist other types of specialized logic that are difficult to implement effectively using standard logic such as DRAM, Flash memory, DSP blocks, processors, analog functions, or specialized I/O functions such as SerDes. The continuous array of prior art does not provide effective solution for these specialized yet not common enough functions that would justify their regular insertion into CA wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0427">Embodiments of the current invention enable a different and more flexible approach.

Instead of adding a broad variety of such blocks into the CA which would make it generally area-inefficient, and instead of using a range of CA types with different block mixes which would lead to a large number of expensive mask sets, the current invention allows using Through Silicon Via to enable a new type of configurable system.</div>

For FPGA-type tile <b>8300</b>A an edge size between 0.5 mm and 1 mm represents a good tradeoff between granularity and area loss due to unused potential dicing lines.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0430">In some types of CA wafers it may be advantageous to have metal lines crossing perpendicularly the potential dicing lines, which will allow connectivity between individual tiles.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0444">There are many manufacturing and performance advantages to the flexible construction and sizing of 3D Configurable System as described above. At the same time it is also helpful if the complete 3D Configurable System behaves as a single system rather than as a collection of individual tiles. In particular it is helpful is such 3D Configurable System can automatically configure itself for self-test and for functional operation in case of FPGA logic and the likes. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 86</figref> illustrates how this can be achieved in CA architecture, where a wafer <b>8600</b> carrying a CA of tiles <b>8601</b> with potential dicing lines <b>8602</b> has targeted 3×3 die size for device <b>8611</b> with actual dicing lines <b>8612</b>.</div>

The MCU is a fully autonomous controller such as <b>8051</b> with program and data memory and input/output lines. The MCU of each tile is used to configure, initialize, and potentially tests and manage, the configurable logic of the tile. Using the compass rose <b>8799</b> as a reference in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 87</figref>, MCU inputs of each tile are connected to its southern neighbor through fixed connection lines <b>8704</b> and its western neighbor through fixed connection lines <b>8706</b>. Similarly each MCU drives its northern and eastern neighbors. Each MCU is controlled in priority order by its western neighbor and by its southern neighbor. For example, MCU <b>8702</b>-<b>11</b> is controlled by MCU <b>8702</b>-<b>01</b>, while MCU <b>8702</b>-<b>01</b> having no western neighbor is controlled by MCU <b>8702</b>-<b>00</b> south of it.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0446"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 88</figref> is a drawing illustration of a scheme using modified Joint Test Action Group (“JTAG”) (also known as IEEE Standard 1149.1) industry standard interface interconnection scheme. Each MCU has two TDI inputs TDI <b>8816</b> and TDIb <b>8814</b> instead of one, which are priority encoded with <b>8816</b> having the higher priority. JTAG inputs TMS and TCK are shared in parallel among the tiles, while JTAG TDO output of each MCU is driving its northern and eastern neighbors.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0448">U.S. Patent Application Publication 2009/0224364 describes methods to create 3D systems made of stacking very thin layers, of thickness of few tens to few hundreds of nanometers, of mono-crystalline silicon with pre-implanted patterning on top of base wafer using low-temperature (below approximately 400□ C) technique called layer transfer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0449">An alternative of the invention uses vertical redundancy of configurable logic device such as FPGA to improve the yield of 3DICs. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 89</figref> is a drawing illustration of a programmable 3D IC with redundancy. It comprises of three stacked layers <b>8900</b>, <b>8910</b> and <b>8920</b>, each having 3×3 array of programmable LBs <b>8902</b>, <b>8912</b>, <b>8922</b> respectively indexed with three dimensional subscripts. One of the stacked layers is dedicated to redundancy and repair, while the rest of the layers—two in this case—are functional. In this discussion we will use the middle layer <b>8910</b> as the repair layer. Each of the LB outputs has a vertical connection such as <b>8940</b> that can connect the corresponding outputs at all vertical layers through programmable switches such as <b>8907</b> and <b>8917</b>. The programmable switch can be Antifuse-based, a pass transistor, or an active-device switch.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0450">Functional connection <b>8904</b> connects the output of LB (<b>1</b>,<b>0</b>,<b>0</b>) through switches <b>8906</b> and <b>8908</b> to the input of LB (<b>2</b>,<b>0</b>,<b>0</b>). In case LB (<b>1</b>,<b>0</b>,<b>0</b>) malfunctions, which can be found by testing, the corresponding LB (<b>1</b>,<b>0</b>,<b>1</b>) on the redundancy/repair layer can be programmed to replace it by turning off switches <b>8906</b>, <b>8918</b> and turning on switches <b>8907</b>, <b>8917</b>, and <b>8916</b> instead. The short vertical distance between the original LB and the repair LB guarantees minimal impact on circuit performance. In a similar way LB (<b>1</b>,<b>0</b>,<b>1</b>) could serve to repair malfunction in LB (<b>1</b>,<b>0</b>,<b>2</b>). It should be noted that the optimal placement for the repair layer is about the center of the stack, to optimize the vertical distance between malfunctioning and repair LBs. It should be also noted that a single repair layer can repair more than two functional layers, with slowly decreasing efficacy of repair as the number of functional layers increases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0451">In a 3D IC based on layer transfer in U.S. Patent Applications Publications 2006/0275962 and 2007/0077694 we will call the underlying wafer a Receptor wafer, while the layer placed on top of it will come from a Donor wafer. Each such layer can be patterned with advanced fine pitch lithography to the limits permissible by existing manufacturing technology. Yet the alignment precision of such stacked layers is limited. Best layer transfer alignment between wafers is currently on the order of 1 micron, almost two orders of magnitude coarser than the feature size available at each individual layer, which prohibits true high-density vertical system integration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0452"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 90A</figref> is a drawing illustration that sets the basic elements to show how such large misalignment can be reduced for the purpose of vertical stacking of pre-implanted mono-crystalline silicon layers using layer transfer. Compass rose <b>9040</b> is used throughout to assist in describing the invention. Donor wafer <b>9000</b> comprises repetitive bands of P devices <b>9006</b> and N devices <b>9004</b> in the north-south direction as depicted in its magnified region <b>9002</b>. The width of the P band <b>9006</b> is Wp <b>9016</b>, and that of the N band <b>9004</b> is Wn <b>9014</b>. The overall pattern repeats every step W <b>9008</b>, which is the sum of Wp, Wn, and possibly an additional isolation band. Alignment mark <b>9020</b> is aligned with these patterns on <b>9000</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 90B</figref> is a drawing illustration that demonstrates how such donor wafer <b>9000</b> can be placed on top of a Receptor wafer <b>9010</b> that has its own alignment mark <b>9021</b>. In general, wafer alignment for layer transfer can maintain very precise angular alignment between wafers, but the error DY <b>9022</b> in north-south direction and DX <b>9024</b> in east-west direction are large and typically much larger than the repeating step W <b>9008</b>. This situation is illustrated in drawing of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 90C</figref>. However, because the pattern on the donor wafer repeats in the north-south direction, the effective error in that direction is only Rdy <b>9025</b>, the remainder of error DY <b>9022</b> modulo W <b>9008</b>. Clearly, Rdy <b>9025</b> is equal or smaller than W <b>9008</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0453"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 90D</figref> is a drawing illustration that completes the explanation of this concept. For a feature on the Receptor to have an assured connection with any point in a metal strip <b>9038</b> of the Donor, it is sufficient that the Donor strip is of length W in the north-south direction plus the size of an inter-wafer via <b>9036</b> (plus any additional overhang as dictated by the layout design rules as needed, plus accommodation for angular wafer alignment error as needed, plus accommodations for wafer bow and warp as needed). Also, because the transferred layer is very thin as noted above, it is transparent and both alignment marks <b>9020</b> and <b>9021</b> are visible readily allowing calculation of Rdy and the alignment of via <b>9036</b> to alignment mark <b>9020</b> in east-west direction and to alignment mark <b>9021</b> in north-south direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0454"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 91A</figref> is a drawing illustration that extends this concept into two dimensions.

As before, the transparency of the very thin transferred layer readily allows the calculation of Rdx and Rdy after layer transfer. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 91D</figref>, in a manner analogous to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 90D</figref>, shows that the minimum landing area <b>9138</b> on the Receptor wafer to guarantee connection to any region of the Donor wafer is of size Ly <b>9105</b> (Wy plus inter-wafer via <b>9166</b> size) by Lx <b>9107</b> (Wx plus via <b>9166</b> size), plus any overhangs that may be required by layout rules and additional wafer warp, bow, or angular error accommodations as needed. As before, via <b>9166</b> is aligned to both marks <b>9120</b> and <b>9121</b>. Landing area <b>9138</b> may be much smaller than wafer misalignment errors DY and DX.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0455"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 91E</figref> is a drawing illustration that suggests that the landing area can actually be smaller than Ly times Lx. The Receptor wafer <b>9110</b> may have metal strip landing area <b>9138</b> of minimum width necessary for fully containing a via <b>9166</b> and of length Ly <b>9105</b>. Similarly, the Donor wafer <b>9100</b> may include metal strip <b>9139</b> of minimum width necessary for fully containing a via <b>9166</b> and of length Lx <b>9107</b>. This guarantees that irrespective of wafer alignment error the two strips will always cross each other with sufficient overlap to fully place a via in it, aligned to both marks <b>9120</b> and <b>9121</b> as before.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0465"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 94A</figref> is a drawing illustration of extending the structure of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 92C</figref> to an 8×12 array <b>9402</b>. This can be extended as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 94B</figref> to fill a full reticle sized area <b>9403</b> with the exemplary 8×12 array <b>9402</b> pattern of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 94A</figref>. Reticle sized area <b>9403</b>, such as shown by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 94B</figref>, may then be repeated across the entire wafer. This is a variation of the Continuous Array as described before in respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 83A-F</figref>. This alternative embodiment of continuous array as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 94B</figref>, does not have any potential dicing lines, but rather, may use one or more custom etch steps to define custom dice lines. Accordingly a specific custom device may be diced from the previously generic wafer. The custom dice lines may be created by etching away some of the structures such as transistors of the continuous array as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 94C</figref>. This custom function etching may have a shape of multiple thin strips <b>9404</b> created by a custom mask, such as a dicing line mask, to etch away a portion of the devices. Thus custom forming logic function, blocks, arrays, or devices <b>9406</b> (for clarity, not all possible blocks are labeled). A portion of these logic functions, blocks, arrays, or devices <b>9406</b> may be interconnected horizontally with metallization and may be connected to circuitry above and below using TSV or utilizing the monolithic 3D variation, including the embodiments in this document. This custom function alternative has some advantages relative to the use of the previously described potential dice lines, such as, the saving of the allocated area for the unused dice lines and the saving of the mask and the processing of the interconnection over the unused dice lines. However, in both variations substantial savings would be achieved relative to the state of the art. The state of art for FPGA vendors, as well as some other products, is that for a product release for a specific process node more than ten variations would be offered by the vendor. These variations use the same logic fabric applied to different devices sizes offering various amount of logic. In many cases, the variation also includes the amount of memories and I/O cells. State of the art IC devices may require more than 30 different masks at a typical total mask set cost of a few million dollars. For a vendor to offer the multiple device option, it would lead to substantial investment in multiple mask sets. The current invention allows the use of a generic continuous array and then a customization process would be applied to construct multiple device sizes out of the same mask set. Therefore, for example, a continuous array as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 94B</figref> is customized to a specific device size by etching the multiple thin strips <b>9404</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 94C</figref>. This could be done to various types of continuous terrains as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 83A-F</figref>. Accordingly, wafers may be processed using one generic mask set of more than ten masks and then multiple device offerings may be constructed by few custom function masks which would define specific sizes out of the generic continues array structure. And, accordingly, the wafer may then be diced to a different size for each device offering.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0466">The concept of customizing a Continuous Array can be also applied to logic, memory, I/O and other structures. Memory arrays have non-repetitive elements such as bit and word decoders, or sense amplifiers, which need to be tailored to each memory size. An embodiment of the invention is to tile substantially the entire wafer with a dense pattern of memory cells, and then customize it using selective etching as before, and providing the required non-repetitive structures through an adjacent logic layer below or above the memory layer. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 95A</figref> is a drawing illustration of a typical 6-transistor SRAM cell <b>9520</b>, with its word line <b>9522</b>, bit line <b>9524</b> and bit line inverse <b>9526</b>. Such a bit cell is typically densely packed and highly optimized for a given process. A dense SRAM array <b>9530</b> may be constructed of a plurality of 6-transistor SRAM cell <b>9520</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 95B</figref>. A four by four array <b>9532</b> may be defined through custom etching away the cells in channel <b>9534</b>, leaving bit lines <b>9536</b> and word lines <b>9538</b> unconnected. These word lines <b>9538</b> may be then connected to an adjacent logic layer below or above that may have a word decoder <b>9550</b> (depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 95C</figref>) that may drive them through outputs <b>9552</b>. Similarly, the bit lines <b>9536</b> may be driven by another decoder such as bit line decoder <b>9560</b> (depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 95D</figref>) through its outputs <b>9562</b>. A sense amplifier <b>9568</b> is also shown. A critical feature of this approach is that the customized logic, such as word decoder <b>9550</b>, bit line decoder <b>9560</b>, and sense amplifier <b>9568</b>, may be provided from below or above in close vertical proximity to the area where it is needed, thus assuring high performance customized memory blocks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0467">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 148A</figref>, the custom dicing line mask referred to in the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 94C</figref> discussion to create multiple thin strips <b>9404</b> for etching may be shaped to created chamfered block corners <b>14802</b> of custom blocks <b>14804</b> to relieve stress.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0469">Passivation of the edge created by the custom function etching may be accomplished as follows. If the custom function etched edge is formed on a layer or strata that is not the topmost one, then it may be passivated or sealed by filling the etched out area with dielectric, such as a Spin-On-Glass (SOG) method, and CMPing flat to continue to the next 3DIC layer transfer. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 148C</figref>, the topmost layer custom function etched edge may be passivated with an overlapping layer or layers of material including, for example, oxide, nitride, or polyimide. Oxide may be deposited over custom function etched block edge <b>14880</b> and may be lithographically defined and etched to overlap the custom function etched block edge <b>14880</b> shown as oxide structure <b>14884</b>. Silicon nitride may be deposited over wafer and oxide structure <b>14884</b>, and may be lithographically defined and etched to overlap the custom function etched block edge <b>14880</b> and oxide structure <b>14884</b>, shown as nitride structure <b>14886</b>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0471">Person skilled in the art will recognize that it is now possible to assemble a true monolithic 3D stack of mono-crystalline silicon layers or strata with high performance devices using advanced lithography that repeatedly reuse same masks, with only few custom metal masks for each device layer. Such person will also appreciate that one can stack in the same way a mix of disparate layers, some carrying transistor array for general logic and other carrying larger scale blocks such as memories, analog elements, Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), and I/O. Moreover, such a person would also appreciate that the custom function formation by etching may be accomplished with masking and etching processes such as, for example, a hard-mask and Reactive Ion Etching (RIE), or wet chemical etching, or plasma etching. Furthermore, the passivation or sealing of the custom function etching edge may be stair stepped so to enable improved sidewall coverage of the overlapping layers of passivation material to seal the edge.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0472">Another alternative of the invention for general type of 3D logic IC is presented on <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 96A</figref>. Here logic is distributed across multiple layers such as <b>9602</b>, <b>9612</b> and <b>9622</b>. An additional layer of logic (“Repair Layer”) <b>9632</b> is used to effect repairs as needed in any of logic layers <b>9602</b>, <b>9612</b> or <b>9622</b>. Repair Layer's essential components include BIST Controller Checker (“BCC”) <b>9634</b> that has access to I/O boundary scans and to all FF scan chains from logic layers, and uncommitted logic such as Gate Array described above. Such gate array can be customized using custom metal mask. Alternately it can use Direct-Write e-Beam technology such as available from Advantest or Fujitsu to write custom masking patterns in photoresist at each die location to repair the IC directly on the wafer during manufacturing process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0473">It is important to note that substantially all the sequential cells like, for example, flip flops (FFs), in the logic layers as well as substantially all the primary output boundary scan have certain extra features as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 97</figref>. Flip flop <b>9702</b> shows a possible embodiment and has its output <b>9704</b> drive gates in the logic layers, and in parallel it also has vertical stub <b>9706</b> raising to the Repair Layer <b>9632</b> through as many logic layers as required such as logic layers <b>9602</b> and <b>9612</b>. In addition to any other scan control circuitry that may be necessary, flip flop <b>9702</b> also has an additional multiplexer <b>9714</b> at its input to allow selective or programmable coupling of replacement circuitry on the Repair Layer to flip flop <b>9702</b> D input. One of the multiplexer inputs <b>9710</b> can be driven from the Repair Layer, as can multiplexer control <b>9708</b>. By default, when <b>9708</b> is not driven, multiplexer control is set to steer the original logic node <b>9712</b> to feed the FF, which is driven from the preceding stages of logic. If a repair circuit is to replace the original logic coupled to original logic node <b>9712</b>, a programmable element like, for example, a latch, an SRAM bit, an antifuse, a flash memory bit, a fuse, or a metal link defined by the Direct-Write e-Beam repair, is used to control multiplexer control <b>9708</b>. A similar structure comprising of input multiplexer <b>9724</b>, inputs <b>9726</b> and <b>9728</b>, and control input <b>9730</b> is present in substantively every primary output <b>9722</b> boundary scan cell <b>9720</b>, in addition to its regular boundary scan function, which allows the primary outputs to be driven by the regular input <b>9726</b> or replaced by input <b>9728</b> from the Repair Layer as needed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0474">The way the repair works can be now readily understood from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 96A</figref>. To maximize the benefit from this repair approach, designs need to be implemented as partial or full scan designs. Scan outputs are available to the BCC on the Repair Layer, and the BCC can drive the scan chains. The uncommitted logic on the Repair Layer can be finalized by processing a high metal or via layer, for example a via between layer 5 and layer 6 (“VIA6”), while the BCC is completed with metallization prior to that via, up to metal 5 in this example. During manufacturing, after the IC has been finalized to metal 5 of the repair layer, the chips on the wafer are powered up through a tester probe, the BIST is executed, and faulty FFs are identified. This information is transmitted by BCC to the external tester, and is driving the repair cycle. In the repair cycle the logic cone that feeds the faulty FF is identified, the net-list for the circuit is analyzed, and the faulty logic cone is replicated on the Repair Layer using Direct-Write e-Beam technology to customize the uncommitted logic through writing VIA6, and the replicated output is fed down to the faulty FF from the Repair Layer replacing the original faulty logic cone. It should be noted that because the physical location of the replicated logic cone can be made to be approximately the same as the original logic cone and just vertically displaced, the impact of the repaired logic on timing should be minimal. In alternate implementation additional features of uncommitted logic such as availability of variable strength buffers, may be used to create repair replica of the faulty logic cone that will be slightly faster to compensate for the extra vertical distance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0475">People skilled in the art will appreciate that Direct-Write e-Beam customization can be done on any metal or via layer as long as such layer is fabricated after the BCC construction and metallization is completed. They will also appreciate that for this repair technique to work the design can have sections of logic without scan, or without special circuitry for FFs such as described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 97</figref>. Absence of such features in some portion of the design will simply reduce the effectiveness of the repair technique. Alternatively, the BCC can be implemented on one or more of the Logic Layers, or the BCC function can be performed using an external tester through JTAG or some other test interface. This allows full customization of all contact, metal and via layers of the Repair Layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0476"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 96B</figref> is a drawing illustration of the concept that it may be beneficial to chain FFs on each logic layer separately before feeding the scan chains outputs to the Repair Layer because this may allow testing the layer for integrity before continuing with 3D IC assembly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0477">It should be noted that the repair flow just described can be used to correct not only static logic malfunctions but also timing malfunctions that may be discovered through the scan or BIST test. Slow logic cones may be replaced with faster implementations constructed from the uncommitted logic on the Repair Layer further improving the yield of such complex systems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0478"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 96C</figref> is a drawing illustration of an alternative implementation of the invention where the ICs on the wafer may be powered and tested through contactless means instead of making physical contact with the wafer, such as with probes, avoiding potential damage to the wafer surface. One of the active layers of the 3D IC may include Radio Frequency (“RF”) antenna <b>96</b>C<b>02</b> and RF to Direct Current (“DC”) converter <b>96</b>C<b>04</b> that powers the power supply unit <b>96</b>C<b>06</b>. Using this technique the wafer can be powered in a contactless manner to perform self-testing. The results of such self-testing can be communicated with computing devices external to the wafer under test using RF module <b>96</b>C<b>14</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0479">An alternative embodiment of the invention may use a small photovoltaic cell <b>96</b>C<b>10</b> to power the power supply unit instead of RF induction and RF to DC converter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0480">An alternative approach to increase yield of complex systems through use of 3D structure is to duplicate the same design on two layers vertically stacked on top of each other and use BIST techniques similar to those described in the previous sections to identify and replace malfunctioning logic cones. This should prove particularly effective repairing very large ICs with very low yields at manufacturing stage using one-time, or hard to reverse, repair structures such as antifuses or Direct-Write e-Beam customization. Similar repair approaches can also assist systems that may need a self-healing ability at every power-up sequence through use of memory-based repair structures as described with regard to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 98</figref> below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0481"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 98</figref> is a drawing illustration of one possible implementation of this concept. Two vertically stacked logic layers <b>9801</b> and <b>9802</b> implement essentially an identical design. The design (same on each layer) is scan-based and includes BIST Controller/Checker on each layer <b>9851</b> and <b>9852</b> that can communicate with each other either directly or through an external tester. <b>9821</b> is a representative FF on the first layer that has its corresponding flip flop <b>9822</b> on layer 2, each fed by its respective identical logic cones <b>9811</b> and <b>9812</b>. The output of flip flop <b>9821</b> is coupled to the A input of multiplexer <b>9831</b> and the B input of multiplexer <b>9832</b> through vertical connection <b>9806</b>, while the output of flip flop <b>9822</b> is coupled to the A input of multiplexer <b>9832</b> and the B input of multiplexer <b>9831</b> through vertical connection <b>9805</b>. Each such output multiplexer is respectively controlled from control points <b>9841</b> and <b>9842</b>, and multiplexer outputs drive the respective following logic stages at each layer. Thus, either logic cone <b>9811</b> and flip flop <b>9821</b> or logic cone <b>9812</b> and flip flop <b>9822</b> may be either programmably coupleable or selectively coupleable to the following logic stages at each layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0482">It should be noted that the multiplexer control points <b>9841</b> and <b>9842</b> can be implemented using a memory cell, a fuse, an Antifuse, or any other customizable element such as metal link that can be customized by a Direct-Write e-Beam machine. If a memory cell is used, its contents can be stored in a ROM, a flash memory, or in some other non-volatile storage mechanism elsewhere in the 3D IC or in the system in which it is deployed and loaded upon a system power up, a system reset, or on-demand during system maintenance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0483">Upon power on the BCC initializes all multiplexer controls to select inputs A and runs diagnostic test on the design on each layer. Failing FF are identified at each logic layer using scan and BIST techniques, and as long as there is no pair of corresponding FF that fails, the BCCs can communicate with each other (directly or through an external tester) to determine which working FF to use and program the multiplexer controls <b>9841</b> and <b>9842</b> accordingly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0484">It should be noted that if multiplexer controls <b>9841</b> and <b>9842</b> are reprogrammable as in using memory cells, such test and repair process can potentially occur at every power on instance, or on demand, and the 3D IC can self-repair in-circuit. If the multiplexer controls are one-time programmable, the diagnostic and repair process may need to be performed using external equipment. It should be noted that the techniques for contact-less testing and repair as previously described with regard to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 96C</figref> can be applicable in this situation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0485">An alternative embodiment of this concept can use multiplexer <b>9714</b> at the inputs of the FF such as described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 97</figref>. In that case both the Q and the inverted Q of FFs may be used, if present.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0486">Person skilled in the art will appreciate that this repair technique of selecting one of two possible outputs from two essentially similar blocks vertically stacked on top of each other can be applied to other type of blocks in addition to FF described above. Examples of such include, but are not limited to, analog blocks, I/O, memory, and other blocks. In such cases the selection of the working output may lead to specialized multiplexing but it does not change its essential nature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0487">Such person will also appreciate that once the BIST diagnosis of both layers is complete, a mechanism similar to the one used to define the multiplexer controls can be also used to selectively power off unused sections of a logic layers to save on power dissipation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0488">Yet another variation on the invention is to use vertical stacking for on the fly repair using redundancy concepts such as Triple (or higher) Modular Redundancy (“TMR”). TMR is a well known concept in the high-reliability industry where three copies of each circuit are manufactured and their outputs are channeled through a majority voting circuitry. Such TMR system will continue to operate correctly as long as no more than a single fault occurs in any TMR block. A major problem in designing TMR ICs is that when the circuitry is triplicated the interconnections become significantly longer slowing down the system speed, and the routing becomes more complex slowing down system design. Another major problem for TMR is that its design process is expensive because of correspondingly large design size, while its market is limited.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0489">Vertical stacking offers a natural solution of replicating the system image on top of each other. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 99</figref> is a drawing illustration of such system with three layers <b>9901</b> <b>9902</b> <b>9903</b>, where combinatorial logic is replicated such as in logic cones <b>9911</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>9911</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>9911</b>-<b>3</b>, and FFs are replicated such as <b>9921</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>9921</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>9921</b>-<b>3</b>. One of the layers, <b>9901</b> in this depiction, includes a majority voting circuitry <b>9931</b> that arbitrates among the local FF output <b>9951</b> and the vertically stacked FF outputs <b>9952</b> and <b>9953</b> to produce a final fault tolerant FF output that needs to be distributed to all logic layers as <b>9941</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>9941</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>9941</b>-<b>3</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0490">Person skilled in the art will appreciate that variations on this configuration are possible such as dedicating a separate layer just to the voting circuitry that will make layers <b>9901</b>, <b>9902</b> and <b>9903</b> logically identical; relocating the voting circuitry to the input of the FFs rather than to its output; or extending the redundancy replication to more than 3 instances (and stacked layers).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0491">The abovementioned method for designing TMR addresses both of the mentioned weaknesses. First, there is essentially no additional routing congestion in any layer because of TMR, and the design at each layer can be optimally implemented in a single image rather than in triplicate. Second, any design implemented for non high-reliability market can be converted to TMR design with minimal effort by vertical stacking of three original images and adding a majority voting circuitry either to one of the layers, to all three layers as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 99</figref>, or as a separate layer. A TMR circuit can be shipped from the factory with known errors present (masked by the TMR redundancy), or a Repair Layer can be added to repair any known errors for an even higher degree of reliability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0492">The exemplary embodiments discussed so far are primarily concerned with yield enhancement and repair in the factory prior to shipping a 3D IC to a customer. Another embodiment of the invention is providing redundancy and self-repair once the 3D IC is deployed in the field. This is a desirable product characteristic because defects may occur in products that tested as operating correctly in the factory. For example, this can occur due to a delayed failure mechanism such as a defective gate dielectric in a transistor that develops into a short circuit between the gate and the underlying transistor source, drain or body. Immediately after fabrication such a transistor may function correctly during factory testing, but with time and applied voltages and temperatures, the defect can develop into a failure which may be detected during subsequent tests in the field. Many other delayed failure mechanisms are known. Regardless of the nature of the delayed defect, if it creates a logic error in the 3D IC then subsequent testing according to the invention may be used to detect and repair it.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0493"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 103</figref> illustrates an exemplary 3D IC generally indicated by <b>10300</b> according to the invention. 3D IC <b>10300</b> comprises two layers labeled Layer <b>1</b> and Layer <b>2</b> and separated by a dashed line in the figure. Layer <b>1</b> and Layer <b>2</b> may be bonded together into a single 3D IC using methods known in the art. The electrical coupling of signals between Layer <b>1</b> and Layer <b>2</b> may be realized with Through-Silicon Via (TSV) or some other interlayer technology. Layer <b>1</b> and Layer <b>2</b> may each comprise a single layer of semiconductor devices called a Transistor Layer and its associated interconnections (typically realized in one or more physical Metal Layers) which are called Interconnection Layers. The combination of a Transistor Layer and one or more Interconnection Layers is called a Circuit Layer. Layer <b>1</b> and Layer <b>2</b> may each comprise one or more Circuit Layers of devices and interconnections as a matter of design choice.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0494">Regardless of the details of their construction, Layer <b>1</b> and Layer <b>2</b> in 3D IC <b>10300</b> perform substantially identical logic functions. In some embodiments, Layer <b>1</b> and Layer <b>2</b> may each be fabricated using the same masks for all layers to reduce manufacturing costs. In other embodiments there may be small variations on one or more mask layers. For example, there may be an option on one of the mask layers which creates a different logic signal on each layer which tells the control logic blocks on Layer <b>1</b> and Layer <b>2</b> that they are the controlling Layer <b>1</b> and Layer <b>2</b> respectively in cases where this is important. Other differences between the layers may be present as a matter of design choice.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0495">Layer <b>1</b> comprises Control Logic <b>10310</b>, representative scan flip flops <b>10311</b>, <b>10312</b> and <b>10313</b>, and representative combinational logic clouds <b>10314</b> and <b>10315</b>, while Layer <b>2</b> comprises Control Logic <b>10320</b>, representative scan flip flops <b>10321</b>, <b>10322</b> and <b>10323</b>, and representative logic clouds <b>10324</b> and <b>10325</b>. Control Logic <b>10310</b> and scan flip flops <b>10311</b>, <b>10312</b> and <b>10313</b> are coupled together to form a scan chain for set scan testing of combinational logic clouds <b>10314</b> and <b>10315</b> in a manner previously described. Control Logic <b>10320</b> and scan flip flops <b>10321</b>, <b>10322</b> and <b>10323</b> are also coupled together to form a scan chain for set scan testing of combinational logic clouds <b>10324</b> and <b>10325</b>. Control Logic blocks <b>10310</b> and <b>10320</b> are coupled together to allow coordination of the testing on both Layers. In some embodiments, Control Logic blocks <b>10310</b> and <b>10320</b> may be able to test either themselves or each other. If one of them is bad, the other can be used to control testing on both Layer <b>1</b> and Layer <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0496">Persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the scan chains in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 103</figref> are representative only, that in a practical design there may be millions of flip flops which may be broken into multiple scan chains, and the inventive principles disclosed herein apply regardless of the size and scale of the design.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0497">As with previously described embodiments, the Layer <b>1</b> and Layer <b>2</b> scan chains may be used in the factory for a variety of testing purposes. For example, Layer <b>1</b> and Layer <b>2</b> may each have an associated Repair Layer (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 103</figref>) which was used to correct any defective logic cones or logic blocks which originally occurred on either Layer <b>1</b> or Layer <b>2</b> during their fabrication processes. Alternatively, a single Repair Layer may be shared by Layer <b>1</b> and Layer <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0498"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 104</figref> illustrates exemplary scan flip flop <b>10400</b> (surrounded by the dashed line in the figure) suitable for use with the invention. Scan flip flop <b>10400</b> may be used for the scan flip flop instances <b>10311</b>, <b>10312</b>, <b>10313</b>, <b>10321</b>, <b>10322</b> and <b>10323</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 103</figref>. Present in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 104</figref> is D-type flip flop <b>10402</b> which has a Q output coupled to the Q output of scan flip flop <b>10400</b>, a D input coupled to the output of multiplexer <b>10404</b>, and a clock input coupled to the CLK signal. Multiplexer <b>10404</b> also has a first data input coupled to the output of multiplexer <b>10406</b>, a second data input coupled to the SI (Scan Input) input of scan flip flop <b>10400</b>, and a select input coupled to the SE (Scan Enable) signal. Multiplexer <b>10406</b> has a first and second data inputs coupled to the D<b>0</b> and D<b>1</b> inputs of scan flip flop <b>10400</b> and a select input coupled to the LAYER_SEL signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0499">The SE, LAYER_SEL and CLK signals are not shown coupled to input ports on scan flip flop <b>10400</b> to avoid over complicating the disclosure—particularly in drawings like <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 103</figref> where multiple instances of scan flip flop <b>10400</b> appear and explicitly routing them would detract from the concepts being presented. In a practical design, all three of those signals are typically coupled to an appropriate circuit for every instance of scan flip flop <b>10400</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0500">When asserted, the SE signal places scan flip flop <b>10400</b> into scan mode causing multiplexer <b>10404</b> to gate the SI input to the D input of D-type flip flop <b>10402</b>. Since this signal goes to all scan flip flops <b>10400</b> in a scan chain, this has the effect of connecting them together as a shift register allowing vectors to be shifted in and test results to be shifted out. When SE is not asserted, multiplexer <b>10404</b> selects the output of multiplexer <b>10406</b> to present to the D input of D-type flip flop <b>10402</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0501">The CLK signal is shown as an “internal” signal here since its origin will differ from embodiment to embodiment as a matter of design choice. In practical designs, a clock signal (or some variation of it) is typically routed to every flip flop in its functional domain. In some scan test architectures, CLK will be selected by a third multiplexer (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 104</figref>) from a domain clock used in functional operation and a scan clock for use in scan testing. In such cases, the SCAN_EN signal will typically be coupled to the select input of the third multiplexer so that D-type flip flop <b>10402</b> will be correctly clocked in both scan and functional modes of operation. In other scan architectures, the functional domain clock is used as the scan clock during test modes and no additional multiplexer is needed. Persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that many different scan architectures are known and will realize that the particular scan architecture in any given embodiment will be a matter of design choice and in no way limits the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0502">The LAYER_SEL signal determines the data source of scan flip flop <b>10400</b> in normal operating mode. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 103</figref>, input D<b>1</b> is coupled to the output of the logic cone of the Layer (either Layer <b>1</b> or Layer <b>2</b>) where scan flip flop <b>10400</b> is located, while input D<b>0</b> is coupled to the output of the corresponding logic cone on the other Layer. The default value for LAYER_SEL is thus logic-1 which selects the output from the same Layer. Each scan flip flop <b>10400</b> has its own unique LAYER_SEL signal. This allows a defective logic cone on one Layer to be programmably or selectively replaced by its counterpart on the other Layer. In such cases, the signal coupled to D<b>1</b> being replaced is called a Faulty Signal while the signal coupled to D<b>0</b> replacing it is called a Repair Signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0503"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 105A</figref> illustrates an exemplary 3D IC generally indicated by <b>10500</b>. Like the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 103</figref>, 3D IC <b>10500</b> comprises two Layers labeled Layer <b>1</b> and Layer <b>2</b> and separated by a dashed line in the drawing figure. Layer <b>1</b> comprises Layer <b>1</b> Logic Cone <b>10510</b>, scan flip flop <b>10512</b>, and XOR gate <b>10514</b>, while Layer <b>2</b> comprises Layer <b>2</b> Logic Cone <b>10520</b>, scan flip flop <b>10522</b>, and XOR gate <b>10524</b>. The scan flip flop <b>10400</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 104</figref> may be used for scan flip flops <b>10512</b> and <b>10522</b>, though the SI and other internal connections are not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 105A</figref>. The output of Layer <b>1</b> Logic Cone <b>10510</b> (labeled DATA<b>1</b> in the drawing figure) is coupled to the D<b>1</b> input of scan flip flop <b>10512</b> on Layer <b>1</b> and the D<b>0</b> input of scan flip flop <b>10522</b> on Layer <b>2</b>. Similarly, the output of Layer <b>2</b> Logic Cone <b>10520</b> (labeled DATA<b>2</b> in the drawing figure) is coupled to the D<b>1</b> input of scan flip flop <b>10522</b> on Layer <b>2</b> and the D<b>0</b> input of scan flip flop <b>10512</b> on Layer <b>1</b>. Each of the scan flip flops <b>10512</b> and <b>10522</b> has its own LAYER_SEL signal (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 105A</figref>) that selects between its D<b>0</b> and D<b>1</b> inputs in a manner similar to that illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 104</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0504">XOR gate <b>10514</b> has a first input coupled to DATA<b>1</b>, a second input coupled to DATA<b>2</b>, and an output coupled to signal ERROR<b>1</b>. Similarly, XOR gate <b>10524</b> has a first input coupled to DATA<b>2</b>, a second input coupled to DATA<b>1</b>, and an output coupled to signal ERROR<b>2</b>. If the logic values present on the signals on DATA<b>1</b> and DATA<b>2</b> are not equal, ERROR<b>1</b> and ERROR<b>2</b> will equal logic-1 signifying there is a logic error present. If the signals on DATA<b>1</b> and DATA<b>2</b> are equal, ERROR<b>1</b> and ERROR<b>2</b> will equal logic-0 signifying there is no logic error present. Persons of ordinary skill in art will appreciate that the underlying assumption here is that only one of the Logic Cones <b>10510</b> and <b>10520</b> will be bad simultaneously. Since both Layer <b>1</b> and Layer <b>2</b> have already been factory tested, verified and, in some embodiments, repaired, the statistical likelihood of both logic cones developing a failure in the field is extremely unlikely even without any factory repair, thus validating the assumption.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0505">In 3D IC <b>10500</b>, the testing may be done in a number of different ways as a matter of design choice. For example, the clock could be stopped occasionally and the status of the ERROR<b>1</b> and ERROR<b>2</b> signals monitored in a spot check manner during a system maintenance period. Alternatively, operation can be halted and scan vectors run with a comparison done on every vector. In some embodiments a BIST testing scheme using Linear Feedback Shift Registers to generate pseudo-random vectors for Cyclic Redundancy Checking may be employed. These methods all involve stopping system operation and entering a test mode. Other methods of monitoring possible error conditions in real time will be discussed below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0506">In order to effect a repair in 3D IC <b>10500</b>, two determinations are typically made: (1) the location of the logic cone with the error, and (2) which of the two corresponding logic cones is operating correctly at that location. Thus a method of monitoring the ERROR<b>1</b> and ERROR<b>2</b> signals and a method of controlling the LAYER_SEL signals of scan flip flops <b>10512</b> and <b>10522</b> are may be needed, though there are other approaches. In a practical embodiment, a method of reading and writing the state of the LAYER_SEL signal may be needed for factory testing to verify that Layer <b>1</b> and Layer <b>2</b> are both operating correctly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0507">Typically, the LAYER_SEL signal for each scan flip flop will be held in a programmable element like, for example, a volatile memory circuit like a latch storing one bit of binary data (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 105A</figref>). In some embodiments, the correct value of each programmable element or latch may be determined at system power up, at a system reset, or on demand as a routine part of system maintenance. Alternatively, the correct value for each programmable element or latch may be determined at an earlier point in time and stored in a non-volatile medium like a flash memory or by programming antifuses internal to 3D IC <b>10500</b>, or the values may be stored elsewhere in the system in which 3D IC <b>10500</b> is deployed. In those embodiments, the data stored in the non-volatile medium may be read from its storage location in some manner and written to the LAYER_SEL latches.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0508">Various methods of monitoring ERROR<b>1</b> and ERROR<b>2</b> are possible. For example, a separate shift register chain on each Layer (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 105A</figref>) could be employed to capture the ERROR<b>1</b> and ERROR<b>2</b> values, though this would carry a significant area penalty. Alternatively, the ERROR<b>1</b> and ERROR<b>2</b> signals could be coupled to scan flip flops <b>10512</b> and <b>10522</b> respectively (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 105A</figref>), captured in a test mode, and shifted out. This would carry less overhead per scan flip flop, but would still be expensive.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0509">The cost of monitoring the ERROR<b>1</b> and ERROR<b>2</b> signals can be reduced further if it is combined with the circuitry necessary to write and read the latches storing the LAYER_SEL information. In some embodiments, for example, the LAYER_SEL latch may be coupled to the corresponding scan flip flop <b>10400</b> and have its value read and written through the scan chain. Alternatively, the logic cone, the scan flip flop, the XOR gate, and the LAYER_SEL latch may all be addressed using the same addressing circuitry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0510">Illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 105B</figref> is circuitry for monitoring ERROR<b>2</b> and controlling its associated LAYER_SEL latch by addressing in 3D IC <b>10500</b>. Present in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 105B</figref> is 3D IC <b>10500</b>, a portion of the Layer <b>2</b> circuitry discussed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 105A</figref> including scan flip flop <b>10522</b> and XOR gate <b>10524</b>. A substantially identical circuit (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 105B</figref>) will be present on Layer <b>1</b> involving scan flip flop <b>10512</b> and XOR gate <b>10514</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0511">Also present in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 105B</figref> is LAYER_SEL latch <b>10570</b> which is coupled to scan flip flop <b>10522</b> through the LAYER_SEL signal. The value of the data stored in latch <b>10570</b> determines which logic cone is used by scan flip flop <b>10522</b> in normal operation. Latch <b>10570</b> is coupled to COL_ADDR line <b>10574</b> (the column address line), ROW_ADDR line <b>10576</b> (the row address line) and COL_BIT line <b>10578</b>. These lines may be used to read and write the contents of latch <b>10570</b> in a manner similar to any SRAM circuit known in the art. In some embodiments, a complementary COL_BIT line (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 105B</figref>) with inverted binary data may be present. In a logic design, whether implemented in full custom, semi-custom, gate array or ASIC design or some other design methodology, the scan flip flops will not line up neatly in rows and columns the way memory cells do in a memory block. In some embodiments, a tool may be used to assign the scan flip flops into virtual rows and columns for addressing purposes. Then the various virtual row and column lines would be routed like any other signals in the design.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0512">The ERROR<b>2</b> line <b>10572</b> may be read at the same address as latch <b>10570</b> using the circuit comprising N-channel transistors <b>10582</b>, <b>10584</b> and <b>10586</b> and P channel transistors <b>10590</b> and <b>10592</b>. N-channel transistor <b>10582</b> has a gate terminal coupled to ERROR<b>2</b> line <b>10572</b>, a source terminal coupled to ground, and a drain terminal coupled to the source of N-channel transistor <b>10584</b>. N-channel transistor <b>10584</b> has a gate terminal coupled to COL_ADDR line <b>10574</b>, a source terminal coupled to N-channel transistor <b>10582</b>, and a drain terminal coupled to the source of N-channel transistor <b>10586</b>. N-channel transistor <b>10586</b> has a gate terminal coupled to ROW_ADDR line <b>10576</b>, a source terminal coupled to the drain N-channel transistor <b>10584</b>, and a drain terminal coupled to the drain of P-channel transistor <b>10590</b> and the gate of P-channel transistor <b>10592</b> through line <b>10588</b>. P-channel transistor <b>10590</b> has a gate terminal coupled to ground, a source terminal coupled to the positive power supply, and a drain terminal coupled to line <b>10588</b>. P-channel transistor <b>10592</b> has a gate terminal coupled to line <b>10588</b>, a source terminal coupled to the positive power supply, and a drain terminal coupled to COL_BIT line <b>10578</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0513">If the particular ERROR<b>2</b> line <b>10572</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 105B</figref> is not addressed (i.e., either COL_ADDR line <b>10574</b> equals the ground voltage level (logic-0) or ROW_ADDR line <b>10576</b> equals the ground voltage supply voltage level (logic-0)), then the transistor stack comprising the three N-channel transistors <b>10582</b>, <b>10584</b> and <b>10586</b> will be non-conductive. The P-channel transistor <b>10590</b> functions as a weak pull-up device pulling the voltage level on line <b>10588</b> to the positive power supply voltage (logic-1) when the N-channel transistor stack is non-conductive. This causes P-channel transistor <b>10592</b> to be non-conductive presenting high impedance to COL_BIT line <b>10578</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0514">A weak pull-down (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 105B</figref>) is coupled to COL_BIT line <b>10578</b>. If all the memory cells coupled to COL_BIT line <b>10578</b> present high impedance, then the weak pull-down will pull the voltage level to ground (logic-0).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0515">If the particular ERROR<b>2</b> line <b>10572</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 105B</figref> is addressed (i.e., both COL_ADDR line <b>10574</b> and ROW_ADDR line <b>10576</b> are at the positive power supply voltage level (logic-1)), then the transistor stack comprising the three N-channel transistors <b>10582</b>, <b>10584</b> and <b>10586</b> will be non-conductive if ERROR<b>2</b> =logic-0 and conductive if ERROR2=logic-1. Thus the logic value of ERROR<b>2</b> may be propagated through P-channel transistors <b>10590</b> and <b>10592</b> and onto the COL_BIT line <b>10578</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0516">An advantage of the addressing scheme of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 105B</figref> is that a broadcast ready mode is available by addressing all of the rows and columns simultaneously and monitoring all of the column bit lines <b>10578</b>. If all the column bit lines <b>10578</b> are logic-0, all of the ERROR<b>2</b> signals are logic-0 meaning there are no bad logic cones present on Layer <b>2</b>. Since field correctable errors will be relatively rare, this can save a lot of time locating errors relative to a scan flip flop chain approach. If one or more bit lines is logic-1, faulty logic cones will only be present on those columns and the row addresses can be cycled quickly to find their exact addresses. Another advantage of the scheme is that large groups or all of the LAYER_SEL latches can be initialized simultaneously to the default value of logic-1 quickly during a power up or reset condition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0517">At each location where a faulty logic cone is present, if any, the defect is isolated to a particular layer so that the correctly functioning logic cone may be selected by the corresponding scan flip flop on both Layer <b>1</b> and Layer <b>2</b>. If a large non-volatile memory is present in the 3D IC <b>10500</b> or in the external system, then automatic test pattern generated (ATPG) vectors may be used in a manner similar to the factory repair embodiments. In this case, the scan itself is capable of identifying both the location and the correctly functioning layer. Unfortunately, this may lead to a large number of vectors and a correspondingly large amount of available non-volatile memory which may not be available in all embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0518">Using some form of Built In Self Test (BIST) has the advantage of being self contained inside 3D IC <b>10500</b> without needing the storage of large numbers of test vectors. Unfortunately, BIST tests tend to be of the “go” or “no go” variety. They identify the presence of an error, but are not particularly good at diagnosing either the location or the nature of the fault. Fortunately, there are ways to combine the monitoring of the error signals previously described with BIST techniques and appropriate design methodology to quickly determine the correct values of the LAYER_SEL latches.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0519"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 106</figref> illustrates an exemplary portion of the logic design implemented in a 3D IC such as <b>10300</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 103</figref> or <b>10500</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 105A</figref>. The logic design is present on both Layer <b>1</b> and Layer 2 with substantially identical gate-level implementations. Preferably, all of the flip flops (not illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 106</figref>) in the design are implemented using scan flip flops similar or identical in function to scan flip flop <b>10400</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 104</figref>. Preferably, all of the scan flip flops on each Layer have the sort of interconnections with the corresponding scan flip flop on the other Layer as described in conjunction with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 105A</figref>. Preferably, each scan flip flop will have an associated error signal generator (e.g., an XOR gate) for detecting the presence of a faulty logic cone, and a LAYER_SEL latch to control which logic cone is fed to the flip flop in normal operating mode as described in conjunction with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 105A and 105B</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0520">Present in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 106</figref> is an exemplary logic function block (LFB) <b>10600</b>. Typically LFB <b>10600</b> has a plurality of inputs, an exemplary instance being indicated by reference number <b>10602</b>, and a plurality of outputs, an exemplary instance being indicated by reference number <b>10604</b>. Preferably LFB <b>10600</b> is designed in a hierarchical manner, meaning that it typically has smaller logic function blocks such as <b>10610</b> and <b>10620</b> instantiated within it. Circuits internal to LFBs <b>10610</b> and <b>10620</b> are considered to be at a “lower” level of the hierarchy than circuits present in the “top” level of LFB <b>10600</b> which are considered to be at a “higher” level in the hierarchy. LFB <b>10600</b> is exemplary only. Many other configurations are possible. There may be more (or less) than two LFBs instantiated internal to LFB <b>10600</b>. There may also be individual logic gates and other circuits instantiated internal to LFB <b>10600</b> not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 106</figref> to avoid overcomplicating the disclosure. LFBs <b>10610</b> and <b>10620</b> may have internally instantiated even smaller blocks forming even lower levels in the hierarchy. Similarly, Logic Function Block <b>10600</b> may itself be instantiated in another LFB at an even higher level of the hierarchy of the overall design.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0521">Present in LFB <b>10600</b> is Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) <b>10630</b> circuit for generating pseudo-random input vectors for LFB <b>10600</b> in a manner well known in the art. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 106</figref> one bit of LFSR <b>10630</b> is associated with each of the inputs <b>10602</b> of LFB <b>10600</b>. If an input <b>10602</b> couples directly to a flip flop (preferably a scan flip flop similar to <b>10400</b>) then that scan flip flop may be modified to have the additional LFSR functionality to generate pseudo-random input vectors. If an input <b>10602</b> couples directly to combinatorial logic, it will be intercepted in test mode and its value determined and replaced by a corresponding bit in LFSR <b>10630</b> during testing. Alternatively, the LFSR <b>10630</b> circuit will intercept all input signals during testing regardless of the type of circuitry it connects to internal to LFB <b>10600</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0522">Thus during a BIST test, all the inputs of LFB <b>10600</b> may be exercised with pseudo-random input vectors generated by LFSR <b>10630</b>. As is known in the art, LFFR <b>10630</b> may be a single LFSR or a number of smaller LFSRs as a matter of design choice. LFSR <b>10630</b> is preferably implemented using a primitive polynomial to generate a maximum length sequence of pseudo-random vectors. LFSR <b>10630</b> needs to be seeded to a known value, so that the sequence of pseudo-random vectors is deterministic. The seeding logic can be inexpensively implemented internal to the LFSR <b>10630</b> flip flops and initialized, for example, in response to a reset signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0523">Also present in LFB <b>10600</b> is Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) <b>10632</b> circuit for generating a signature of the LFB <b>10600</b> outputs generated in response to the pseudo-random input vectors generated by LFSR <b>10630</b> in a manner well known in the art. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 106</figref> one bit of CRC <b>10632</b> is associated with each of the outputs <b>10604</b> of LFB <b>10600</b>. If an output <b>10604</b> couples directly to a flip flop (preferably a scan flip flop similar to <b>10400</b>) then that scan flip flop may be modified to have the additional CRC functionality to generate the signature. If an output <b>10604</b> couples directly to combinatorial logic, it will be monitored in test mode and its value coupled to a corresponding bit in CRC <b>10632</b>. Alternatively, all the bits in CRC will passively monitor an output regardless of the source of the signal internal to LFB <b>10600</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0524">Thus during a BIST test, all the outputs of LFB <b>10600</b> may be analyzed to determine the correctness of their responses to the stimuli provided by the pseudo-random input vectors generated by LFSR <b>10630</b>. As is known in the art, CRC <b>10632</b> may be a single CRC or a number of smaller CRCs as a matter of design choice. As known in the art, a CRC circuit is a special case of an LFSR, with additional circuits present to merge the observed data into the pseudo-random pattern sequence generated by the base LFSR. The CRC <b>10632</b> is preferably implemented using a primitive polynomial to generate a maximum sequence of pseudo-random patterns. CRC <b>10632</b> needs to be seeded to a known value, so that the signature generated by the pseudo-random input vectors is deterministic. The seeding logic can be inexpensively implemented internal to the LFSR <b>10630</b> flip flops and initialized, for example, in response to a reset signal. After completion of the test, the value present in the CRC <b>10632</b> is compared to the known value of the signature. If all the bits in CRC <b>10632</b> match, the signature is valid and the LFB <b>10600</b> is deemed to be functioning correctly. If one or more of the bits in CRC <b>10632</b> does not match, the signature is invalid and the LFB <b>10600</b> is deemed to not be functioning correctly. The value of the expected signature can be inexpensively implemented internal to the CRC <b>10632</b> flip flops and compared internally to CRC <b>10632</b> in response to an evaluate signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0525">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 106</figref>, LFB <b>10610</b> comprises LFSR circuit <b>10612</b>, CRC circuit <b>10614</b>, and logic function <b>10616</b>. Since its input/output structure is analogous to that of LFB <b>10600</b>, it can be tested in a similar manner albeit on a smaller scale. If LFB <b>10600</b> is instantiated into a larger block with a similar input/output structure, LFB <b>10600</b> may be tested as part of that larger block or tested separately as a matter of design choice. It is not required that all blocks in the hierarchy have this input/output structure if it is deemed unnecessary to test them individually. An example of this is LFB <b>10620</b> instantiated inside LFB <b>10600</b> which does not have an LFSR circuit on the inputs and a CRC circuit on the outputs and which is tested along with the rest of LFB <b>10600</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0526">Persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that other BIST test approaches are known in the art and that any of them may be used to determine if LFB <b>10600</b> is functional or faulty.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0527">In order to repair a 3D IC like 3D IC <b>10500</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 105A</figref> using the block BIST approach, the part is put in a test mode and the DATA<b>1</b> and DATA<b>2</b> signals are compared at each scan flip flop <b>10400</b> on Layer <b>1</b> and Layer <b>2</b> and the resulting ERROR<b>1</b> and ERROR<b>2</b> signals are monitored as described in the embodiments above or possibly using some other method. The location of the faulty logic cone is determined with regards to its location in the logic design hierarchy. For example, if the faulty logic cone were located inside LFB <b>10610</b> then the BIST routine for only that block would be run on both Layer <b>1</b> and Layer <b>2</b>. The results of the two tests determine which of the blocks (and by implication which of the logic cones) is functional and which is faulty. Then the LAYER_SEL latches for the corresponding scan flip flops <b>10400</b> can be set so that each receives the repair signal from the functional logic cone and ignores the faulty signal. Thus the layer determination can be made for a modest cost in hardware in a shorter period of time without the need for expensive ATPG testing.</div>

Layer <b>1</b> and Layer <b>2</b> are bonded together using techniques known in the art to form 3D IC <b>10900</b> and interconnected with TSVs or other interlayer interconnect technology. Each Layer further comprises an instance of Logic Function Block <b>10910</b>, each of which in turn comprises an instance of Logic Function Block (LFB) <b>10920</b>. LFB <b>10920</b> comprises LSFR circuits on its inputs (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 109A</figref>) and CRC circuits on its outputs (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 109A</figref>) in a manner analogous to that described with respect to LFB <b>10600</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 106</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0537">Each instance of LFB <b>10920</b> has a plurality of multiplexers <b>10922</b> associated with its inputs and a plurality of multiplexers <b>10924</b> associated with its outputs. These multiplexers may be used to programmably or selectively replace the entire instance of LFB <b>10920</b> on either Layer <b>1</b> or Layer <b>2</b> with its counterpart on the other layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0538">On power up, system reset, or on demand from control logic located internal to 3D IC <b>10900</b> or elsewhere in the system where 3D IC <b>10900</b> is deployed, the various blocks in the hierarchy can be tested. Any faulty block at any level of the hierarchy with BIST capability may be programmably and selectively replaced by its corresponding instance on the other Layer. Since this is determined at the block level, this decision can be made locally by the BIST control logic in each block (not shown in FIG. <b>109</b>A), though some coordination may be required with higher level blocks in the hierarchy with regards to which Layer the plurality of multiplexers <b>10922</b> sources the inputs to the functional LFB <b>10920</b> in the case of multiple repairs in the same vicinity in the design hierarchy. Since both Layer <b>1</b> and Layer <b>2</b> preferably leave the factory fully functional, or alternatively nearly fully functional, a simple approach is to designate one of the Layers, for example, Layer <b>1</b>, as the primary functional layer. Then the BIST controllers of each block can coordinate locally and decide which block should have its inputs and outputs coupled to Layer <b>1</b> through the Layer <b>1</b> multiplexers <b>10922</b> and <b>10924</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0539">Persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that significant area can be saved by employing this embodiment. For example, since LFBs are evaluated instead of individual logic cones, the interlayer selection multiplexers for each individual flip flop like multiplexer <b>10406</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 104</figref> and multiplexer <b>10814</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 108</figref> can be removed along with the LAYER_SEL latches <b>10570</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 105B</figref> since this function is now handled by the pluralities of multiplexers <b>10922</b> and <b>10924</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 109A</figref>, all of which may be controlled one or more control signals in parallel. Similarly, the error signal generators (e.g., XOR gates <b>10514</b> and <b>10524</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 105A and 10816</figref> and <b>10826</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 108</figref>) and any circuitry needed to read them like coupling them to the scan flip flops or the addressing circuitry described in conjunction with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 105B</figref> may also be removed, since in this embodiment entire Logic Function Blocks rather than individual Logic Cones are replaced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0540">Even the scan chains may be removed in some embodiments, though this is a matter of design choice. In embodiments where the scan chains are removed, factory testing and repair would also have to rely on the block BIST circuits. When a bad block is detected, an entire new block would need to be crafted on the Repair Layer with Direct-Write e-Beam. Typically this takes more time than crafting a replacement logic cone due to the greater number of patterns to shape, and the area savings may need to be compared to the test time losses to determine the economically superior decision.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0541">Removing the scan chains also entails a risk in the early debug and prototyping stage of the design, since BIST circuitry is not very good for diagnosing the nature of problems. If there is a problem in the design itself, the absence of scan testing will make it harder to find and fix the problem, and the cost in terms of lost time to market can be very high and hard to quantify. Prudence might suggest leaving the scan chains in for reasons unrelated to the field repair aspects of the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0542">Another advantage to embodiments using the block BIST approach is described in conjunction with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 109B</figref>. One disadvantage to some of the earlier embodiments is that the majority of circuitry on both Layer <b>1</b> and Layer <b>2</b> is active during normal operation. Thus power can be substantially reduced relative to earlier embodiments by operating only one instance of a block on one of the layers whenever possible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0543">Present in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 109B</figref> are 3D IC <b>10900</b>, Layer <b>1</b> and Layer <b>2</b>, and two instances each of LFBs <b>10910</b> and <b>10920</b>, and pluralities of multiplexers <b>10922</b> and <b>10924</b> previously discussed. Also present in each Layer in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 109B</figref> is a power select multiplexer <b>10930</b> associated with that layer's version of LFB <b>10920</b>. Each power select multiplexer <b>10930</b> has an output coupled to the power terminal of its associated LFB <b>10920</b>, a first select input coupled to the positive power supply (labeled VCC in the figure), and a second input coupled to the ground potential power supply (labeled GND in the figure). Each power select multiplexer <b>10930</b> has a select input (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 109B</figref>) coupled to control logic (also not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 109B</figref>), typically present in duplicate on Layer <b>1</b> and Layer <b>2</b> though it may be located elsewhere internal to 3D IC <b>10900</b> or possibly elsewhere in the system where 3D IC <b>10900</b> is deployed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0544">Persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that there are many ways to programmably or selectively power down a block inside an integrated circuit known in the art and that the use of power select multiplexer <b>10930</b> in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 109B</figref> is exemplary only. Any method of powering down LFB <b>10920</b> is within the scope of the invention. For example, a power switch could be used for both VCC and GND. Alternatively, the power switch for GND could be omitted and the power supply node allowed to “float” down to ground when VCC is decoupled from LFB <b>10920</b>. In some embodiments, VCC may be controlled by a transistor, like either a source follower or an emitter follower which is itself controlled by a voltage regulator, and VCC may be removed by disabling or switching off the transistor in some way. Many other alternatives are possible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0545">In some embodiments, control logic (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 109B</figref>) uses the BIST circuits present in each block to stitch together a single copy of the design (using each block's plurality of input and output multiplexers which function similarly to pluralities of multiplexers <b>10922</b> and <b>10924</b> associated with LFB <b>10920</b>) comprised of functional copies of all the LFBs. When this mapping is complete, all of the faulty LFBs and the unused functional LFBs are powered off using their associated power select multiplexers (similar to power select multiplexer <b>10930</b>). Thus the power consumption can be reduced to the level that a single copy of the design would lead to using standard two dimensional integrated circuit technology.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0546">Alternatively, if a layer, for example, Layer <b>1</b> is designated as the primary layer, then the BIST controllers in each block can independently determine which version of the block is to be used. Then the settings of the pluralities of multiplexers <b>10922</b> and <b>10924</b> are set to couple the used block to Layer <b>1</b> and the settings of powers select multiplexers <b>10930</b> can be set to power down the unused block. Typically, this should reduce the power consumption by half relative to embodiments where power select multiplexers <b>10930</b> or equivalent are not implemented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0547">There are test techniques known in the art that are a compromise between the detailed diagnostic capabilities of scan testing with the simplicity of BIST testing. In embodiments employing such schemes, each BIST block (smaller than a typical LFB, but typically comprising a few tens to a few hundreds of logic cones) stores a small number of initial states in particular scan flip flops while most of the scan flip flops can use a default value. CAD tools may be used to analyze the design's net-list to identify the necessary scan flip flops to allow efficient testing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0548">During test mode, the BIST controller shifts in the initial values and then starts the clocking the design. The BIST controller has a signature register which might be a CRC or some other circuit which monitors bits internal to the block being tested. After a predetermined number of clock cycles, the BIST controller stops clocking the design, shifts out the data stored in the scan flip flops while adding their contents to the block signature, and compares the signature to a small number of stored signatures (one for each of the stored initial states.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0549">This approach has the advantage of not needing a large number of stored scan vectors and the “go” or “no go” simplicity of BIST testing. The test block is less fine than identifying a single faulty logic cone, but much coarser than a large Logic Function Block. In general, the finer the test granularity (i.e., the smaller the size of the circuitry being substituted for faulty circuitry) the less chance of a delayed fault showing up in the same test block on both Layer <b>1</b> and Layer <b>2</b>. Once the functional status of the BIST block has been determined, the appropriate values are written to the latches controlling the interlayer multiplexers to replace a faulty BIST block on one if the layers, if necessary. In some embodiments, faulty and unused BIST blocks may be powered down to conserve power.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0550">While discussions of the various exemplary embodiments described so far concern themselves with finding and repairing defective logic cones or logic function blocks in a static test mode, embodiments of the invention can address failures due to noise or timing. For example, in 3D IC <b>10300</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 103</figref> and in 3D IC <b>10700</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 107</figref> the scan chains can be used to perform at-speed testing in a manner known in the art. One approach involves shifting a vector in through the scan chains, applying two or more at-speed clock pulses, and then shifting out the results through the scan chain. This will catch any logic cones that are functionally correct at low speed testing but are operating too slowly to function in the circuit at full clock speed. While this approach will allow field repair of slow logic cones, it requires the time, intelligence and memory capacity necessary to store, run and evaluate scan vectors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0551">Another approach is to use block BIST testing at power up, reset, or on-demand to over-clock each block at ever increasing frequencies until one fails, determine which layer version of the block is operating faster, and then substitute the faster block for the slower one at each instance in the design. This has the more modest time, intelligence and memory requirements generally associated with block BIST testing, but it still may lead to placing the 3D IC in a test mode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0552"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 110</figref> illustrates an embodiment where errors due to slow logic cones can be monitored in real time while the circuit is in normal operating mode. An exemplary 3D IC generally indicated at <b>11000</b> comprises two Layers labeled Layer <b>1</b> and Layer <b>2</b> and separated by a dashed line in the drawing figure. The Layers each comprise one or more Circuit Layers and are bonded together to form 3D IC <b>11000</b>. They are electrically coupled together using TSVs or some other interlayer interconnect technology.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0553"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 110</figref> focuses on the operation of circuitry coupled to the output of a single Layer <b>2</b> Logic Cone <b>11020</b>, though substantially identical circuitry is also present on Layer <b>1</b> (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 110</figref>). Also present in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 110</figref> is scan flip flop <b>11022</b> with its D input coupled to the output of Layer <b>2</b> Logic Cone <b>11020</b> and its Q output coupled to the D<b>1</b> input of multiplexer <b>11024</b> through interlayer line <b>11012</b> labeled Q<b>2</b> in the figure. Multiplexer <b>11024</b> has an output DATA<b>2</b> coupled to a logic cone (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 110</figref>) and a D<b>0</b> input coupled the Q<b>1</b> output of the Layer <b>1</b> flip flop corresponding to flip flop <b>11022</b> (not shown in the figure) through interlayer line <b>11010</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0554">XOR gate <b>11026</b> has a first input coupled to Q<b>1</b>, a second input coupled to Q<b>2</b>, and an output coupled to a first input of AND gate <b>11046</b>. AND gate <b>11046</b> also has a second input coupled to TEST_EN line <b>11048</b> and an output coupled to the Set input of RS flip flop <b>11028</b>. RS flip flop also has a Reset input coupled to Layer <b>2</b> Reset line <b>11030</b> and an output coupled to a first input of OR gate <b>11032</b> and the gate of N-channel transistor <b>11038</b>. OR gate <b>11032</b> also has a second input coupled to Layer <b>2</b> OR-chain Input line <b>11034</b> and an output coupled to Layer <b>2</b> OR-chain Output line <b>11036</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0555">Layer <b>2</b> control logic (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 110</figref>) controls the operation of XOR gate <b>11026</b>, AND gate <b>11046</b>, RS flip flop <b>11028</b>, and OR gate <b>11032</b>. The TEST_EN line <b>11048</b> is used to disable the testing process with regards to Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b>. This is desirable in cases where, for example, a functional error has already been repaired and differences between Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> are routinely expected and would interfere with the background testing process looking for marginal timing errors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0556">Layer <b>2</b> Reset line <b>11030</b> is used to reset the internal state of RS flip flop <b>11028</b> to logic-0 along with all the other RS flip flops associated with other logic cones on Layer <b>2</b>. OR gate <b>11032</b> is coupled together with all of the other OR-gates associated with other logic cones on Layer <b>2</b> to form a large Layer <b>2</b> distributed OR function coupled to all of the Layer <b>2</b> RS flip flops like <b>11028</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 110</figref>. If all of the RS flip flops are reset to logic-0, then the output of the distributed OR function will be logic-0. If a difference in logic state occurs between the flip flops generating the Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> signals, XOR gate <b>11026</b> will present a logic-1 through AND gate <b>11046</b> (if TEST_EN=logic-1) to the Set input of RS flip flop <b>11028</b> causing it to change state and present a logic-1 to the first input of OR gate <b>11032</b>, which in turn will produce a logic-1 at the output of the Layer <b>2</b> distributed OR function (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 110</figref>) notifying the control logic (not shown in the figure) that an error has occurred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0557">The control logic can then use the stack of N-channel transistors <b>11038</b>, <b>11040</b> and <b>11042</b> to determine the location of the logic cone producing the error. N-channel transistor <b>11038</b> has a gate terminal coupled to the Q output of RS flip flop <b>11028</b>, a source terminal coupled to ground, and a drain terminal coupled to the source of N-channel transistor <b>11040</b>. N-channel transistor <b>11040</b> has a gate terminal coupled to the row address line ROW_ADDR line, a source terminal coupled to the drain of N-channel transistor <b>11038</b>, and a drain terminal coupled to the source of N-channel transistor <b>11042</b>. N-channel transistor <b>11042</b> has a gate terminal coupled to the column address line COL_ADDR line, a source terminal coupled to the drain of N-channel transistor <b>11040</b>, and a drain terminal coupled to the sense line SENSE <b>11044</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0558">The row and column addresses are virtual addresses, since in a logic design the locations of the flip flops will not be neatly arranged in rows and columns. In some embodiments a Computer Aided Design (CAD) tool is used to modify the net-list to correctly address each logic cone and then the ROW_ADDR and COL_ADDR signals are routed like any other signal in the design.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0559">This produces an efficient way for the control logic to cycle through the virtual address space. If COL_ADDR=ROW_ADDR=logic-1 and the state of RS flip flop is logic-1, then the transistor stack will pull SENSE=logic-0. Thus a logic-1 will only occur at a virtual address location where the RS flip flop has captured an error. Once an error has been detected, RS flip flop <b>11028</b> can be reset to logic-0 with the Layer <b>2</b> Reset line <b>11030</b> where it will be able to detect another error in the future.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0560">The control logic can be designed to handle an error in any of a number of ways. For example, errors can be logged and if a logic error occurs repeatedly for the same logic cone location, then a test mode can be entered to determine if a repair is necessary at that location. This is a good approach to handle intermittent errors resulting from marginal logic cones that only occasionally fail, for example, due to noise, and may test as functional in normal testing. Alternatively, action can be taken upon receipt of the first error notification as a matter of design choice.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0561">As discussed earlier in conjunction with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 99</figref>, using Triple Modular Redundancy at the logic cone level can also function as an effective field repair method, though it really creates a high level of redundancy that masks rather than repairs errors due to delayed failure mechanisms or marginally slow logic cones. If factory repair is used to make sure all the equivalent logic cones on each layer test functional before the 3D IC is shipped from the factory, the level of redundancy is even higher. The cost of having three layers versus having two layers, with or without a repair layer must be factored into determining the best embodiment for any application.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0562">An alternative TMR approach is shown in exemplary 3D IC <b>11100</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 111</figref>. Present in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 111</figref> are substantially identical Layers labeled Layer <b>1</b>, Layer <b>2</b> and Layer <b>3</b> separated by dashed lines in the figure.

If a Repair Layer is present (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 111</figref>), then the flip flop <b>9702</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 97</figref> may be used to implement repair of a defective logic cone before 3D IC <b>11100</b> is shipped from the factory.

Thus if one of the three logic cones or one of the three flip flops is defective, the correct logic value will be present at the output of all three MAJ3 gates.</div>

Another advantage is that MAJ3 gates <b>11112</b>, <b>11122</b> and <b>11132</b> also effectively function as a Single Event Transient (SET) filter while MAJ3 gates <b>11116</b>, <b>11126</b> and <b>11136</b> also effectively function as a Single Event Upset (SEU) filter for high reliability or radiation tolerant applications as described in Rezgui cited above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0571">Embodiments of the invention can be applied to a large variety of commercial as well as high reliability, aerospace and military applications. The ability to fix defects in the factory with Repair Layers combined with the ability to automatically fix delayed defects (by masking them with three layer TMR embodiments or replacing faulty circuits with two layer replacement embodiments) allows the creation of much larger and more complex three dimensional systems than is possible with conventional two dimensional integrated circuit (IC) technology.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0582">Several embodiments of the invention utilize Triple Modular Redundancy distributed over three Layers. In such embodiments it is desirable to use the same masks for all three Layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0583"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 116A</figref> illustrates a via metal overlap pattern <b>11600</b> comprising a 3×3 array of TSVs (or other interlayer coupling technology). The TMR interlayer connections occur in the proximity of a majority-of-three (MAJ3) gate typically fanning in or out from either a flip flop or functional block. Thus at each location on each of the three layers we have the function f(X<b>0</b>, X<b>1</b>, X<b>2</b>)=MAJ3(X<b>0</b> , X<b>1</b>, X<b>2</b>) being implemented where X<b>0</b>, X<b>1</b> and X<b>2</b> are the three inputs to the MAJ3 gate. For purposes of this discussion the X<b>0</b> input is always coupled to the version of the signal generated on the same layer as the MAJ3 gate and the X<b>1</b> and X<b>2</b> inputs come from the other two layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0584">In via metal overlap pattern <b>11600</b>, via metal overlap pads <b>11602</b>, <b>11612</b> and <b>11616</b> are coupled to the X<b>0</b> input of the MAJ3 gate on that layer, via metal overlap pads <b>11604</b>, <b>11608</b> and <b>11618</b> are coupled to the X<b>1</b> input of the MAJ3 gate on that layer, and via metal overlap pads <b>11606</b>, <b>11610</b> and <b>11614</b> are coupled to the X<b>2</b> input of the MAJ3 gate on that layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0585"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 116B</figref> illustrates an exemplary 3D IC generally indicated by <b>11620</b> having three Layers labeled Layer <b>1</b>, Layer <b>2</b> and Layer <b>3</b> from bottom to top. Each layer comprises an instance of via metal overlap pattern <b>11600</b> in the proximity of each MAJ3 gate used to implement a TMR related interlayer coupling. Layer <b>2</b> is offset one interlayer via pitch to the right relative to Layer <b>1</b> while Layer <b>3</b> is offset one interlayer via pitch to the right relative to Layer <b>2</b>. The illustration in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 116B</figref> is an abstraction. While it correctly shows the two interlayer via pitch offsets in the horizontal direction, a person of ordinary skill in the art will realize that each row of via metal overlap pads in each instance of via metal overlap pattern <b>11600</b> is horizontally aligned with the same row in the other instances.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0586">Thus there are three locations where a via metal overlap pad is aligned on all three layers. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 116B</figref> shows three interlayer vias <b>11630</b>, <b>11640</b> and <b>11650</b> placed in those locations coupling Layer <b>1</b> to Layer <b>2</b> and three more interlayer vias <b>11632</b>, <b>11642</b> and <b>11652</b> placed in those locations coupling Layer <b>2</b> to Layer <b>3</b>. The same interlayer via mask may be used for both interlayer via fabrication steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0587">Thus the interlayer vias <b>11630</b> and <b>11632</b> are vertically aligned and couple together the Layer <b>1</b> X<b>2</b> MAJ3 gate input, the Layer <b>2</b> X<b>0</b> MAJ3 gate input, and the Layer <b>3</b> X<b>1</b> MAJ3 gate input. Similarly, the interlayer vias <b>11640</b> and <b>11642</b> are vertically aligned and couple together the Layer <b>1</b> X<b>1</b> MAJ3 gate input, the Layer <b>2</b> X<b>2</b> MAJ3 gate input, and the Layer <b>3</b> X<b>0</b> MAJ3 gate input. Finally, the interlayer vias <b>11650</b> and <b>11652</b> are vertically aligned and couple together the Layer <b>1</b> X<b>0</b> MAJ3 gate input, the Layer <b>2</b> X<b>1</b> MAJ3 gate input, and the Layer <b>3</b> X<b>2</b> MAJ3 gate input. Since the X<b>0</b> input of the MAJ3 gate in each layer is driven from that layer, we can see that each driver is coupled to a different MAJ3 gate input on each layer assuring that no drivers are shorted together and the each MAJ3 gate on each layer receives inputs from each of the three drivers on the three Layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0588">Yet another variation on the invention is to use the concepts of repair and redundancy layers to implement extremely large designs that extend beyond the size of a single reticle, up to and inclusive of a full wafer. This concept of Wafer Scale Integration (“WSI”) was attempted in the past by companies such as Trilogy Systems and was abandoned because of extremely low yield. The ability of the current invention to effect multiple repairs by using a repair layer, or of masking multiple faults by using redundancy layers, makes WSI with very high yield a viable option.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0589">One embodiment of the invention improves WSI by using the Continuous Array (CA) concept described above. In the case of WSI, however, the CA may extend beyond a single reticle and may potentially span the whole wafer. A custom mask may be used to etch away unused parts of the wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0590">Particular care must be taken when a design such as WSI crosses reticle boundaries. Alignment of features across a reticle boundary may be worse than the alignment of features within the reticle, and WSI designs must accommodate this potential misalignment. One way of addressing this is to use wider than minimum metal lines, with larger than minimum pitches, to cross the reticle boundary, while using a full lithography resolution within the reticle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0591">Another embodiment of the invention uses custom reticles for location on the wafer, creating a partial of full custom design across the wafer. As in the previous case, wider lines and coarser line pitches may be used for reticle boundary crossing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0592">In all WSI embodiments yield-enhancement is achieved through fault masking techniques such as TMR, or through repair layers, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 96</figref> through <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 116</figref>. At one extreme of granularity, a WSI repair layer on an individual flip flop level is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 98</figref>, which would provide a close to 100% yield even at a relatively high fault density. At the other end of granularity would be a block level repair scheme, with large granularity blocks at one layer effecting repair by replacing faulty blocks on the other layer. Connection techniques, such as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 93</figref>, may be used to connect the peripheral input/output signals of a large-granularity block across vertical device layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0593">In another variation on the WSI invention one can selectively replace blocks on one layer with blocks on the other layer to provide speed improvement rather than to effect logical repair.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0594">In another variation on the WSI invention one can use vertical stacking techniques as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 84A-84E</figref> to flexibly provide variable amounts of specialized functions, and I/O in particular, to WSI designs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0595"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 117A</figref> is a drawing illustration of prior art of reticle design. A reticle image <b>11700</b>, which is the largest area that can be conveniently exposed on the wafer for patterning, can be made up of a multiplicity of identical integrated circuits (IC) such as <b>11701</b>. In other cases (not shown) it can be made up of a multiplicity of non-identical ICs. Between the ICs are the dicing lanes <b>11703</b>, all fitting within the reticle boundary <b>11705</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0596"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 117B</figref> is a drawing illustration how such reticle image can be used to pattern the surface of wafer <b>11710</b> (partially shown), where the reticle image <b>11700</b> is repeatedly tiling the wafer surface which may use a step-and-repeat process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0597"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 118A</figref> is a drawing illustration of this process as applied to WSI design. In the general case there may be multiple types of reticles such as CA style reticle <b>11820</b> and ASIC style reticle <b>11810</b>. In this situation the reticle may include a multiplicity of connecting lines <b>11814</b> that are perpendicular to the reticle edges and touch the reticle boundary <b>11812</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 118B</figref> is a drawing illustration where a large section of the wafer <b>11852</b> may have a combination of such reticle images, both ASIC style <b>11856</b> and CA style <b>11854</b>, projected on adjacent sites of the wafer <b>11852</b>. The inter-reticle boundary <b>11858</b> is in this case spanned by the connecting lines <b>11814</b>. Because the alignment across reticles is typically lower than the resolution within the reticle, the width and pitch of these inter-reticle wires may need to be increased to accommodate the inter-reticle alignment errors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0598">The array of reticles comprising a WSI design may extend as necessary across the wafer, up to and inclusive of the whole wafer. In the case where the WSI is smaller than the full wafer, multiple WSI designs may be placed on a single wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0599">Another use of this invention is in bringing to market, in a cost-effective manner, semiconductor devices in the early stage of introducing a new lithography process to the market, when the process yield is low. Currently, low yield poses major cost and availability challenges during the new lithography process introduction stage. Using any or all three-dimensional repair or fault tolerance techniques described in this invention and illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 96 through 116</figref> would allow an inexpensive way to provide functional parts during that stage. Once the lithography process matures, its fault density drops, and its yield increases, the repair layers can be inexpensively stripped off as part of device cost reduction, permanently steering signal propagation only within the base layer through programming or through tying-off the repair control logic. Another possibility would be to continue offering the original device as a higher-priced fault-tolerant option, while offering the stripped version without fault-tolerance at a lower price point.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0600">Despite best simulation and verification efforts, many designs end up containing design bugs even after implementation and manufacturing as semiconductor devices. As design complexity, size, and speed grow, debugging modern devices after manufacturing, the so-called “post-silicon debugging,” becomes more difficult and more expensive. A major cause for this difficulty lies in the need to access a large number of signals over many clock cycles, on top of the fact that some design errors may manifest themselves only when the design is run at-speed. U.S. Pat. No. 7,296,201 describes how to overcome this difficulty by incorporating debugging elements into design itself, providing the ability to control and trace logic circuits, to assist in their debugging. DAFCA of Framingham, Mass. offers technology based on this principle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0601"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 119</figref> illustrates prior art of Design for Debug Infrastructure (“DFDI)” as described in M. Abramovici, “In-system Silicon Validation and Debug”, IEEE Design and Test of Computers 25(3), 2008. <b>11902</b> is a signal wrapper that allows controlling what gets propagated to a target object. <b>11904</b> is a multiplexer implementing this function. <b>11910</b> is an illustration of such DFDI using said signal wrappers <b>11912</b>, in conjunction with CapStim <b>11914</b>—capture/stimulus module—and PTE, a Programmable Trigger Engine <b>11916</b>, make together a debug module that fully observes and controls signals of target validation module <b>11918</b>. Yet this ability to debug comes at cost—the addition of DFDI to the design increases the size of the design while still being limited to the number of signals it can store and monitor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0602">The current invention of 3D devices, including monolithic 3D devices, offers new ways for cost-effective post-silicon debugging. One possibility is to use an uncommitted repair layer <b>9632</b> such as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 96A</figref> and construct a dedicated DFDI to assist in debugging the functional logic layers <b>9602</b>, <b>9612</b> and <b>9622</b> at-speed. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 120</figref> is a drawing illustration of such implementation, noting that signal wrapper <b>11902</b> is functionally equivalent to multiplexer <b>9714</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 97</figref>, which is already present in front of every flip flop of layers or strata <b>12002</b>, <b>12012</b>, and <b>12022</b>. The construction of such debug module <b>12036</b> on the uncommitted logic layer <b>12032</b> can be accomplished using Direct-Write e-Beam technology such as available from Advantest or Fujitsu to write custom masking patterns in photo-resist. The only difference is that the new repair layer, the uncommitted logic layer <b>12032</b>, now also includes register files needed to implement PTE and CaptStim and should be designed to work with the existing BIST controller/checker <b>12034</b>. Using e-Beam is a cost effective option for this purpose as there is a need for only a small number of so-instrumented devices. Existing faults in the functional levels may also need to be repaired using the same e-beam technique. Alternatively, only fully functional devices can be selected for instrumentation with DFDI. After the design is debugged, the repair layer is used for regular device repair for yield enhancement as originally intended.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0603">Designing customized DFDI is in itself an expensive endeavor. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 121</figref> is a drawing illustration of a variation on this invention. It uses functional logic layers or strata such as <b>12102</b>, <b>12112</b> and <b>12122</b> with flip flops manufactured on a regular grid <b>12134</b>. In such case a standardized DFDI layer <b>12132</b> that includes sophisticated debug module <b>12136</b> can be designed and used to replace the ad-hoc DFDI layer, made from the uncommitted logic layer <b>12032</b>, which has the ability to efficiently observe and control all, or a very large number, of the flip flops on the functional logic layers. This standard DFDI can be placed on one or more early wafers just for the purpose of post-silicon debugging on multiple designs. This will make the design of a mask set for this DFDI layer cost-effective, spreading it across multiple projects. After the debugging is accomplished, this standard DFDI layer may be replaced by a regular repair layer <b>9632</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0604">Another variation on this invention uses logic layers or strata that do not include flip flops manufactured on a regular grid but still uses standardized DFDI <b>12232</b> as described above. In this case a relatively inexpensive custom metal interconnect masks can be designed just to create an interposer <b>12234</b> to translate the irregular flip flop pattern on logic layers <b>12202</b>, <b>12212</b> and <b>12222</b> to the regular interconnect of standardized DFDI layer. Similarly to the previous cases, once the post-silicon debugging is completed, the interposer and the standardized DFDI are replaced by a regular repair layer <b>9632</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0605">Another variation on the DFDI invention illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 121 and 122</figref> is to replace the DFDI layer or strata with a flexible and powerful standard BIST layer or strata. In contrast to a DFDI layer, the BIST layer will be potentially placed on every wafer throughout the design lifetime. While such BIST layer incurs additional manufacturing cost, it saves on using very expensive testers and probe cards. The mask cost and design cost of such BIST layer can be amortized over multiple designs as in the case of DFDI, and designs with irregularly placed flip flops can take advantage of it using inexpensive interposer layers as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 122</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0606">A person of ordinary skills in the art will recognize that the DFDI invention such as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 121 and 122</figref> can be replicated on a more than one stratum of a 3D semiconductor device to accommodate a broad range of design complexity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0607">Another serious problem with designing semiconductor devices as the lithography minimum feature size scales down is signal re-buffering using repeaters. With the increased resistivity of metal traces in the deep sub-micron regime, signals need to be re-buffered at rapidly decreasing intervals to maintain circuit performance and immunity to circuit noise. This phenomenon has been described at length in “Prashant Saxena et al., Repeater Scaling and Its Impact on CAD, IEEE Transactions On Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, Vol. 23, No. 4, April 2004.” The current invention offers a new way to minimize the routing impact of such re-buffering. Long distance signals are frequently routed on high metal layers to give them special treatment like wire size or isolation from crosstalk. When signals present on high metal layers need re-buffering, an embodiment of the invention is to use the active layer or strata above to insert repeaters, rather than drop the signal all the way to the diffusion layer of its current layer or strata. This approach reduces the routing blockages created by the large number of vias created when signals repeatedly need to move between high metal layers and the diffusion below, and suggests to selectively replace them with fewer vias to the active layer above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0608">Manufacturing wafers with advanced lithography and multiple metal layers is expensive. Manufacturing three-dimensional devices, including monolithic 3D devices, where multiple advanced lithography layers or strata each with multiple metal layers are stacked on top of each other is even more expensive. The vertical stacking process offers new degree of freedom that can be leveraged with appropriate Computer Aided Design (“CAD”) tools to lower the manufacturing cost.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0609">Most designs are made of blocks, but the characteristics of these block is frequently not uniform. Consequently, certain blocks may require fewer routing resources, while other blocks may require very dense routing resources. In two dimensional devices the block with the highest routing density demands dictates the number of metal layers for the whole device, even if some device regions may not need them. Three dimensional devices offer a new possibility of partitioning designs into multiple layers or strata based on the routing demands of the blocks assigned to each layer or strata.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0610">Another variation on this invention is to partition designs into blocks that may require a particular advanced process technology for reasons of density or speed, and blocks that have less demanding requirements for reasons of speed, area, voltage, power, or other technology parameters. Such partitioning may be carried into two or more partitions and consequently different process technologies or nodes may be used on different vertical layers or strata to provide optimized fit to the design's logic and cost demands. This is particularly important in mobile, mass-produced devices, where both cost and optimized power consumption are of paramount importance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0611">Synthesis CAD tools currently used in the industry for two-dimensional devices include a single target library. For three-dimensional designs these synthesis tools or design automation tools may need to be enhanced to support two or more target libraries to be able to support synthesis for disparate technology characteristics of vertical layers or strata. Such disparate layers or strata will allow better cost or power optimization of three-dimensional designs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0612"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 123</figref> is a flowchart illustration for an algorithm partitioning a design into two target technologies, each to be placed on a separate layer or strata, when the synthesis tool or design automation tool does not support multiple target technologies. One technology, APL (Advanced Process Library), may be faster than the other, RPL (Relaxed Process Library), with concomitant higher power, higher manufacturing cost, or other differentiating design attributes. The two target technologies may be two different process nodes, wherein one process node, such as the APL, may be more advanced in technology than the other process node, such as the RPL. The RPL process node may employ much lower cost, for example, by at least 20%, lithography tools and have lower manufacturing costs than the APL. The APL may have more aggressive design rules than the RPL.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0613">The partitioning starts with synthesis into APL with a target performance. Once complete, timing analysis may be done on the design and paths may be sorted by timing slack. The total estimated chip area A(t) may be computed and reasonable margins may be added as usual in anticipation of routing congestion and buffer insertion. The number of vertical layers S may be selected and the overall footprint A(t)/S may be computed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0614">In the first phase components belonging to paths estimated to require APL, based on timing slack below selected threshold Th, may be set aside (tagged APL). The area of these component may be computed to be A(apl). If A(apl) represents a fraction of total area A(t) greater than (S−1)/S then the process terminates and no partitioning into APL and RPL is possible—the whole design needs to be in the APL.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0615">If the fraction of the design that requires APL is smaller than (S−1)/S then it is possible to have at least one layer of RPL. The partitioning process now starts from the largest slack path and towards lower slack paths. It tentatively tags all components of those paths that are not tagged APL with RPL, while accumulating the area of the marked components as A(rpl). When A(rpl) exceeds the area of a complete layer, A(t)/S, the components tentatively marked RPL may be permanently tagged RPL and the process continues after resetting A(rpl) to zero. If all paths are revisited and the components tentatively tagged RPL do not make for an area of a complete layer or strata, their tagging may be reversed back to APL and the process is terminated. The reason is that we want to err on the side of caution and a layer or strata should be an APL layer if it contains a mix of APL and RPL components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0616">The process as described assumes the availability of equivalent components in both APL and RPL technology. Ordinary persons skilled in the art will recognize that variations on this process can be done to accommodate non-equivalent technology libraries through remapping of the RPL-tagged components in a subsequent synthesis pass to an RPL target library, while marking all the APL-tagged components as untouchable. Similarly, different area requirements between APL and RPL can be accommodated through scaling and de-rating factors at the decision making points of the flow. Moreover, the term layer, when used in the context of layers of mono-crystalline silicon and associated transistors, interconnect, and other associated device structures in a 3D device, such as, for example, uncommitted repair layer <b>9632</b>, may also be referred to as stratum or strata.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0617">The partitioning process described above can be re-applied to the resulting partitions to produce multi-way partitioning and further optimize the design to minimize cost and power while meeting performance objectives.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0618">Embodiments of the invention can be applied to a large variety of commercial as well as high reliability, aerospace and military applications. The ability to fix defects in the factory with Repair Layers combined with the ability to automatically fix delayed defects (by masking them with three layer TMR embodiments or replacing faulty circuits with two layer replacement embodiments) allows the creation of much larger and more complex three dimensional systems than is possible with conventional two dimensional integrated circuit (IC) technology. These various aspects of the invention can be traded off against the cost requirements of the target application.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0619">For example, a 3D IC targeted an inexpensive consumer products where cost is dominant consideration might do factory repair to maximize yield in the factory but not include any field repair circuitry to minimize costs in products with short useful lifetimes. A 3D IC aimed at higher end consumer or lower end business products might use factory repair combined with two layer field replacement. A 3D IC targeted at enterprise class computing devices which balance cost and reliability might skip doing factory repair and use TMR for both acceptable yields as well as field repair. A 3D IC targeted at high reliability, military, aerospace, space or radiation tolerant applications might do factory repair to ensure that all three instances of every circuit are fully functional and use TMR for field repair as well as SET and SEU filtering. Battery operated devices for the military market might add circuitry to allow the device to operate only one of the three TMR layers to save battery life and include a radiation detection circuit which automatically switches into TMR mode when needed if the operating environment changes. Many other combinations and tradeoffs are possible within the scope of the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0620">Some embodiments of the invention may include alternative techniques to build IC (Integrated Circuit) devices including techniques and methods to construct 3D IC systems. Some embodiments of the invention may enable device solutions with far less power consumption than prior art. These device solutions could be very useful for the growing application of mobile and/or mobile low power electronic devices or systems such as mobile phones, smart phone, tablet computers, cameras and the like. For example, incorporating the 3D IC semiconductor devices according to some embodiments of the invention within these mobile electronic devices or systems could provide superior mobile units that could operate much more efficiently and for a much longer time than with prior art technology.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0621">3D ICs according to some embodiments of the invention could also enable electronic and semiconductor devices with much a higher performance due to the shorter interconnect as well as semiconductor devices with far more complexity via multiple levels of logic and providing the ability to repair or use redundancy. The achievable complexity of the semiconductor devices according to some embodiments of the invention could far exceed what was practical with the prior art technology. These advantages could lead to more powerful computer systems and improved systems that have embedded computers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0622">Some embodiments of the invention may also enable the design of state of the art electronic systems at a greatly reduced non-recurring engineering (NRE) cost by the use of high density 3D FPGAs or various forms of 3D array base ICs with reduced custom masks as been described previously. These systems could be deployed in many products and in many market segments. Reduction of the NRE may enable new product family or application development and deployment early in the product lifecycle by lowering the risk of upfront investment prior to a market being developed. The above advantages may also be provided by various mixes such as reduce NRE using generic masks for layers of logic and other generic mask for layers of memories and building a very complex system using the repair technology to overcome the inherent yield limitation. Another form of mix could be building a 3D FPGA and add on it 3D layers of customizable logic and memory so the end system could have field programmable logic on top of the factory customized logic. In fact there are many ways to mix the many innovative elements to form 3D IC to support the need of an end system and to provide it with competitive edge. Such end system could be electronic based products or other type of systems that include some level of embedded electronics, such as, for example, cars, remote controlled vehicles, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0623">It is worth noting that many of the principles of the invention are also applicable to conventional two dimensional integrated circuits (2DICs). For example, an analogous of the two layer field repair embodiments could be built on a single layer with both versions of the duplicate circuitry on a single 2D IC employing the same cross connections between the duplicate versions. A programmable technology like, for example, fuses, antifuses, flash memory storage, etc., could be used to effect both factory repair and field repair. Similarly, an analogous version of some of the TMR embodiments are unique topologies in 2DICs as well as in 3DICs which would also improve the yield or reliability of 2D IC systems if implemented on a single layer.</div>

It can be observed that the STI regions <b>12522</b> can go right through to the bottom of silicon layer <b>12516</b> and provide good electrical isolation.

The 3D integrated circuit, could, for example, be constructed with two silicon layers <b>12604</b> and <b>12616</b>. The heat removal apparatus <b>12602</b> could include a heat spreader and a heat sink. The power distribution network or structure could consist of a global power grid <b>12610</b> that takes the supply voltage (denoted as VDD) from power pads and transfers it to local power grids <b>12608</b> and <b>12606</b>, which then transfer the supply voltage to logic cells or gates such as <b>12614</b> and <b>12615</b>. Vias <b>12618</b> and <b>12612</b>, such as the previously described TSV or TLV, could be used to transfer the supply voltage from the global power grid <b>12610</b> to local power grids <b>12608</b> and <b>12606</b>. The 3D integrated circuit could have a similar distribution networks, such as for ground and other supply voltages, as well. Typically, many contacts are made between the supply and ground distribution networks and silicon layer <b>12604</b>. Due to this, there could exist a low thermal resistance between the power/ground distribution network and the heat removal apparatus <b>12602</b>. Since power/ground distribution networks are typically constructed of conductive metals and could have low effective electrical resistance, they could have a low thermal resistance as well. Each logic cell or gate on the 3D integrated circuit (such as, for example <b>12614</b>) is typically connected to VDD and ground, and therefore could have contacts to the power and ground distribution network. These contacts could help transfer heat efficiently (i.e. with low thermal resistance) from each logic cell or gate on the 3D integrated circuit (such as, for example <b>12614</b>) to the heat removal apparatus <b>12602</b> through the power/ground distribution network and the silicon layer <b>12604</b>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0628">While the previous paragraph described how an existing power distribution network or structure can transfer heat efficiently from logic cells or gates in 3D-ICs to their heat sink, many techniques to enhance this heat transfer capability will be described hereafter in this patent application. These embodiments of the invention can provide several benefits, including lower thermal resistance and the ability to cool higher power 3D-ICs. These techniques are valid for different implementations of 3D-ICs, including monolithic 3D-ICs and TSV-based 3D-ICs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0629"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 128</figref> describes an embodiment of the invention, where the concept of thermal contacts is described. Two mono-crystalline silicon layers, <b>12804</b> and <b>12816</b> may have transistors. Silicon layer <b>12816</b> could be thinned down from its original thickness, and its thickness could be in the range of approximately 3 nm to approximately 1 um. Mono-crystalline silicon layer <b>12804</b> could have STI regions <b>12810</b>, gate dielectric regions <b>12812</b>, gate electrode regions <b>12814</b> and several other regions required for transistors (not shown). Mono-crystalline silicon layer <b>12816</b> could have STI regions <b>12830</b>, gate dielectric regions <b>12832</b>, gate electrode regions <b>12834</b> and several other regions required for transistors (not shown). Heat removal apparatus <b>12802</b> may include, for example, heat spreaders and heat sinks. In the example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 128</figref>, mono-crystalline silicon layer <b>12804</b> is closer to the heat removal apparatus <b>12802</b> than other mono-crystalline silicon layers such as <b>12816</b>. Dielectric regions <b>12806</b> and <b>12846</b> could be used to insulate wiring regions such as <b>12822</b> and <b>12842</b> respectively. Through-layer vias for power delivery <b>12818</b> and their associated dielectric regions <b>12820</b> are shown. A thermal contact <b>12824</b> can be used that connects the local power distribution network or structure, which may include wiring layers <b>12842</b> used for transistors in the silicon layer <b>12804</b>, to the silicon layer <b>12804</b>. Thermal junction region <b>12826</b> can be either a doped or undoped region of silicon, and further details of thermal junction region <b>12826</b> will be given in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 129</figref>. The thermal contact such as <b>12824</b> can be preferably placed close to the corresponding through-layer via for power delivery <b>12818</b>; this helps transfer heat efficiently from the through-layer via for power delivery <b>12818</b> to thermal junction region <b>12826</b> and silicon layer <b>12804</b> and ultimately to the heat removal apparatus <b>12802</b>. For example, the thermal contact <b>12824</b> could be located within approximately 2 um distance of the through-layer via for power delivery <b>12818</b> in the X-Y plane (the through-layer via direction is considered the Z plane in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 128</figref>). While the thermal contact such as <b>12824</b> is described above as being between the power distribution network or structure and the silicon layer closest to the heat removal apparatus, it could also be between the ground distribution network and the silicon layer closest to the heat sink. Furthermore, more than one thermal contact <b>12824</b> can be placed close to the through-layer via for power delivery <b>12818</b>. These thermal contacts can improve heat transfer from transistors located in higher layers of silicon such as <b>12816</b> to the heat removal apparatus <b>12802</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0630"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 129</figref> describes an embodiment of the invention, where various implementations of thermal junctions and associated thermal contacts are illustrated. P-wells in CMOS integrated circuits are typically biased to ground and N-wells are typically biased to the supply voltage VDD. Thermal contacts and junctions may be formed differently. A thermal contact <b>12904</b> between the power (VDD) distribution network and a P-well <b>12902</b> can be implemented as shown in N+ in P-well thermal junction and contact example <b>12908</b>, where an n+ doped region thermal junction <b>12906</b> is formed in the P-well region at the base of the thermal contact <b>12904</b>. The n+ doped region thermal junction <b>12906</b> ensures a reverse biased p-n junction can be formed in N+ in P-well thermal junction and contact example <b>12908</b> and makes the thermal contact viable (i.e. not highly conductive) from an electrical perspective. The thermal contact <b>12904</b> could be formed of a conductive material such as copper, aluminum or some other material. A thermal contact <b>12914</b> between the ground (GND) distribution network and a P-well <b>12912</b> can be implemented as shown in P+ in P-well thermal junction and contact example <b>12918</b>, where a p+ doped region thermal junction <b>12916</b> may be formed in the P-well region at the base of the thermal contact <b>12914</b>. The p+ doped region thermal junction <b>12916</b> makes the thermal contact viable (i.e. not highly conductive) from an electrical perspective. The p+ doped region thermal junction <b>12916</b> and the P-well <b>12912</b> would typically be biased at ground potential.

The p+ doped region thermal junction <b>12936</b> makes the thermal contact viable (i.e. not highly conductive) from an electrical perspective due to the reverse biased p-n junction formed in P+ in N-well thermal junction and contact example <b>12938</b>. Note that the thermal contacts are designed to conduct negligible electricity, and the current flowing through them is several orders of magnitude lower than the current flowing through a transistor when it is switching. Therefore, the thermal contacts can be considered to be designed to conduct heat and conduct negligible (or no) electricity.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0651"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 146</figref> illustrates an embodiment of this invention that could have heat spreading regions located on the sides of 3D-ICs. The 3D integrated circuit shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 146</figref> could be potentially constructed using techniques described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/900,379 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/904,119. Two mono-crystalline silicon layers, <b>14604</b> and <b>14616</b> are shown. Silicon layer <b>14616</b> could be thinned down from its original thickness, and its thickness could be in the range of approximately 3 nm to approximately 1 um. Silicon layer <b>14604</b> may include transistors which could have gate electrode region <b>14614</b>, gate dielectric region <b>14612</b>, and shallow trench isolation (STI) regions <b>14610</b>. Silicon layer <b>14616</b> may include transistors which could have gate electrode region <b>14634</b>, gate dielectric region <b>14632</b>, and shallow trench isolation (STI) regions <b>14622</b>. It can be observed that the STI regions <b>14622</b> can go right through to the bottom of silicon layer <b>14616</b> and provide good electrical isolation. A through-layer via (TLV) <b>14618</b> could be present and may include its dielectric region <b>14620</b>. Wiring layers for silicon layer <b>14604</b> are indicated as <b>14608</b> and wiring dielectric is indicated as <b>14606</b>. Wiring layers for silicon layer <b>14616</b> are indicated as <b>14638</b> and wiring dielectric is indicated as <b>14636</b>. The heat removal apparatus, which could include a heat spreader and a heat sink, is indicated as <b>14602</b>. Thermally conductive material <b>14640</b> could be present at the sides of the 3D-IC shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 146</figref>. Thus, a thermally conductive heat spreading region could be located on the sidewalls of a 3D-IC. The thermally conductive material <b>14640</b> could be a dielectric such as, for example, insulating carbon, diamond, diamond like carbon (DLC), and various other materials that provide better thermal conductivity than silicon dioxide. Essentially, these materials could have thermal conductivity higher than about 0.6 W/m-K. One possible scheme that could be used for forming these regions could involve depositing and planarizing the thermally conductive material <b>14640</b> at locations on or close to the dicing regions, such as potential dicing scribe lines, of a 3D-IC after an etch process. The wafer could then be diced. Although this embodiment of the invention is described with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 146</figref>, one could combine the concept of having thermally conductive material regions on the sidewalls of 3D-ICs with ideas shown in other figures of this patent application, such as, for example, the concept of having lateral heat spreaders shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 131</figref>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0656">These systems could be deployed in many products and in many market segments. Reduction of the NRE may enable new product family or application development and deployment early in the product lifecycle by lowering the risk of upfront investment prior to a market being developed. The above advantages may also be provided by various mixes such as reduced NRE using generic masks for layers of logic and other generic mask for layers of memories and building a very complex system using the repair technology to overcome the inherent yield limitation. Another form of mix could be building a 3D FPGA and add on it 3D layers of customizable logic and memory so the end system could have field programmable logic on top of the factory customized logic. In fact there are many ways to mix the many innovative elements to form 3D IC to support the need of an end system, including using multiple devices wherein more than one device incorporates elements of the invention. An end system could benefits from memory device utilizing the invention 3D memory together with high performance 3D FPGA together with high density 3D logic and so forth. Using devices that use one or multiple elements of the invention would allow for better performance and or lower power and other advantages resulting from the inventions to provide the end system with a competitive edge. Such end system could be electronic based products or other type of systems that include some level of embedded electronics, such as, for example, cars, remote controlled vehicles, etc.</div>
