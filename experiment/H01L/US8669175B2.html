<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">In the following Detailed Description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. In this regard, directional terminology, such as “top,” “bottom,” “front,” “back,” “leading,” “trailing,” etc., is used with reference to the orientation of the Figure(s) being described. Because components of embodiments of the present invention can be positioned in a number of different orientations, the directional terminology is used for purposes of illustration and is in no way limiting. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural or logical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following detailed description, therefore, is not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">In the following embodiments of the invention are described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are generally utilized to refer to like elements throughout, and wherein the various structures are not necessarily drawn to scale. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more embodiments of embodiments of the invention. It may be evident, however, to one skilled in the art that one or more embodiments of the embodiments of the invention may be practiced with a lesser degree of these specific details. The following description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">Devices with semiconductor chips are described below. The semiconductor chips may be of extremely different types and may include for example integrated electrical, electro-optical, electro-mechanical or electro-biological circuits. The semiconductor chips may, for example, be configured as power semiconductor chips, such as power MOSFETs (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors), IGBTs (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors), JFETs (Junction Gate Field Effect Transistors), power bipolar transistors or power diodes. Furthermore, the semiconductor chips may include logic circuits, control circuits, microprocessors or microelectromechanical components. In particular, semiconductor chips having a vertical structure may be involved, that is to say that the semiconductor chips may be fabricated in such a way that electric currents can flow in a direction perpendicular to the main surfaces of the semiconductor chips. A semiconductor chip having a vertical structure may have contact elements in particular on its two main surfaces, that is to say on its top side and bottom side. In particular, power semiconductor chips may have a vertical structure. Furthermore, the devices described below may include integrated circuits to control the integrated circuits of other semiconductor chips. The semiconductor chips need not be manufactured from specific semiconductor material, for example Si, SiC, SiGe, GaAs, and, furthermore, may contain inorganic and/or organic materials that are not semiconductors, such as for example insulators, plastics or metals. Moreover, the semiconductor chips may be packaged or unpackaged.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">The semiconductor chips may have contact elements (or contact pads or electrodes) which allow electrical contact to be made with the integrated circuits included in the semiconductor chips. One or more metal layers may be applied to the contact elements of the semiconductor chips. The metal layers may be manufactured with any desired geometric shape and any desired material composition. The metal layers may, for example, be in the form of a layer covering an area. Any desired metal or metal alloy, for example from aluminum, titanium, gold, silver, copper, palladium, platinum, nickel, chromium or nickel vanadium, may be used as the material. The metal layers need not be homogenous or manufactured from just one material, that is to say various compositions and concentrations of the materials contained in the metal layers are possible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">The semiconductor chips may be placed on carriers. The carriers may be of any shape, size or material. During the fabrication of the devices the carriers may be connected to each other. The carriers may also be made from one piece. The carriers may be connected among each other by connection means with the purpose of separating some of the carriers in the course of the fabrication. Separation of the carriers may be carried out by mechanical sawing, a laser beam, cutting, stamping, milling, etching or any other appropriate method. The carriers may be electrically conductive. They may be fabricated from metals or metal alloys, in particular copper, copper alloys, iron nickel, aluminum, aluminum alloys, or other appropriate materials. The carriers may be, for example, a leadframe or a part of a leadframe. Furthermore, the carriers may be plated with an electrically conductive material, for example copper, silver, iron nickel or nickel phosphorus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">The devices may include electrically insulating material. The electrically insulating material may cover any fraction of any number of surfaces of the components of the device. The electrically insulating material may serve various functions. It may be used, for example, to electrically insulate components of the device from each other and/or from external components, but the electrically insulating material may also be used as a platform to mount other components, for example wiring layers. The electrically insulating material may be used to produce fan-out type packages. In a fan-out type package at least some of the external contact elements and/or conductor tracks connecting the semiconductor chip to the external contact elements are located laterally outside of the outline of the semiconductor chip or do at least intersect the outline of the semiconductor chip. Thus, in fan-out type packages, a peripherally outer part of the package of the semiconductor chip is typically (additionally) used for electrically bonding the package to external applications, such as application boards etc. This outer part of the package encompassing the semiconductor chip effectively enlarges the contact area of the package in relation to the footprint of the semiconductor chip, thus leading to relaxed constraints in view of package pad size and pitch with regard to later processing, e.g., second level assembly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">The electrically insulating material may be deposited on the components of the device using various techniques. For example, the electrically insulating material may be deposited by printing or from a gas phase or a solution or by using any other appropriate method. The electrically insulating material may, for example, contain silicone material or may entirely consist of silicone (or polymerized siloxanes or polysiloxanes). The electrically insulating material may have an elastic modulus of, for example, less than 100 MPa. The electrically insulating material may be thermally conducting so that it can dissipate the heat generated by the semiconductor chips. It may also be provided that the devices contain electrically insulating material that is thermally insulating.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">One or more electrically conductive layers may be placed over the semiconductor chips and/or the electrically insulating material. The electrically conductive layers may, for example, be used to produce a redistribution layer. The electrically conductive layers may be used as wiring layers to make electrical contact with the semiconductor chips from outside the devices or to make electrical contact with other semiconductor chips and/or components contained in the devices. The electrically conductive layers may be manufactured with any desired geometric shape and any desired material composition. The electrically conductive layers may, for example, be composed of conductor tracks, but may also be in the form of a layer covering an area. Any desired electrically conductive materials, such as metals, for example copper, aluminum, nickel, palladium, silver, tin or gold, metal alloys, metal stacks or organic conductors, may be used as the material. The electrically conductive layers need not be homogenous or manufactured from just one material, that is to say various compositions and concentrations of the materials contained in the electrically conductive layers are possible. Furthermore, the electrically conductive layers may be arranged above or below or between electrically insulating layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">The semiconductor chips and the electrically conductive layers may be joined by soldering. Soldering is a process in which two or more items, such as metal items, are joined together by melting and flowing a solder material into the joint. In order to solder the semiconductor chips to the electrically conductive layers, solder material may be deposited on the semiconductor chips, in particular one or more contact elements of the semiconductor chips.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">The devices described below include external contact elements or external contact pads, which may be of any shape and size. The external contact elements may be accessible from outside the device and may thus allow electrical contact to be made with the semiconductor chips from outside the device. Furthermore, the external contact elements may be thermally conducting and may serve as heat sinks for dissipating the heat generated by the semiconductor chips. The external contact elements may be composed of any desired electrically conducting material, for example of a metal, such as copper, aluminum or gold, a metal alloy or an electrically conducting organic material. Solder material may be deposited on the external contact elements.</div>

The method illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5K</figref> is an implementation of the methods illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2D</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3E</figref>. Furthermore, the device <b>500</b> is an implementation of the devices <b>100</b> and <b>400</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>.

Moreover, the details of the device <b>500</b> can be likewise applied to the devices <b>100</b> and <b>400</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the carrier <b>10</b> is provided which may be electrically conductive. The carrier <b>10</b> may be a plate or a foil made of a rigid material, for example a metal or a metal alloy, such as copper, aluminum, nickel, CuFeP, steel or stainless steel. The carrier <b>10</b> may have a flat upper surface on which the semiconductor chips <b>12</b> are placed later on. The shape of the carrier <b>10</b> is not limited to any geometric shape, and the carrier <b>10</b> may have any appropriate size. For example, the thickness of the carrier <b>10</b> may be in the range from 50 μm to 1 mm. Furthermore, the carrier <b>10</b> may be structured. The carrier <b>10</b> may be, for example, a leadframe or a part of a leadframe. Moreover, the carrier <b>10</b> may be plated with an electrically conductive material, for example copper, silver, iron nickel or nickel phosphorus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">A material <b>11</b>, for example an adhesive material, may be deposited on the upper surface of the carrier <b>10</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. The adhesive material <b>11</b> may be made of a polymer or any other suitable material. The adhesive material <b>11</b> may contain silicone, i.e., polymerized siloxanes or polysiloxanes, or fluorinated silicone or may be entirely made of silicone. The adhesive material <b>11</b> may further be a mixture of silicone and epoxy resin or a mixture of silicone and polyimide. After hardening, the adhesive material <b>11</b> may have an elastic modulus of less than 100 MPa, in particular less than 50 MPa or 20 MPa or 10 MPa or 5 MPa or 2 MPa or 1 MPa or 500 kPa or 200 kPa or 100 kPa or 50 kPa or 20 kPa. The elastic modulus is also known as the Young's modulus, modulus of elasticity or tensile modulus. The elastic modulus may be defined as the ratio of stress, which has units of pressure, to strain, which is dimensionless; therefore the elastic modulus itself has units of pressure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">The elastic modulus of the adhesive material <b>11</b> as described above may allow a floating mounting of the semiconductor chips <b>12</b>. Due to the different thermal expansion coefficients of the carrier <b>10</b> and the semiconductor chips <b>12</b>, floating mounting of the semiconductor chip <b>12</b> is desired to reduce the mechanical stress induced during temperature cycles. As an example, copper of which the carrier <b>10</b> may be manufactured has a thermal expansion coefficient of about 17×10<sup>−6</sup>/K and silicon of which the semiconductor chips <b>12</b> may be manufactured has a thermal expansion coefficient of about 3×10<sup>−6</sup>/K.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">The adhesive material <b>11</b> may have a thermal conductivity for example in the range between 0.1 W/mK and 5 W/mK or higher. Alternatively, the adhesive material <b>11</b> may be thermally insulating. The adhesive material <b>11</b> may exhibit low outgassing during cure and in particular high thixotropy. Elastosil may be used for the adhesive material <b>11</b>, for example Elastosil RT705, which is commercially available.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">The adhesive material <b>11</b> may be deposited at those places of the upper surface of the carrier <b>10</b> where the semiconductor chips <b>12</b> are placed later on. When deposited the adhesive material <b>11</b> may be fluid, viscous or waxy. The deposition of the adhesive material <b>11</b> may, for example, be performed by stencil printing, screen printing, dispensing or any other appropriate method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, the semiconductor chips <b>12</b> as well as possibly further semiconductor chips are placed over the island of the adhesive material <b>11</b> deposited on the carrier <b>10</b>. Although the island of the adhesive material <b>11</b> and the semiconductor chips <b>12</b> have the same surface areas in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, their surface areas may be different. The semiconductor chips <b>12</b> may be arranged in an array. Furthermore, any suitable array of semiconductor chips may be placed on the carrier <b>10</b> (only two of the semiconductor chips are illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>). For example, more than 50 or 500 or 1000 semiconductor chips may be placed on the carrier <b>10</b>. The semiconductor chips <b>12</b> are relocated on the carrier <b>10</b> in larger spacing as they have been in the wafer bond. The semiconductor chips <b>12</b> may have been manufactured on the same semiconductor wafer, but may alternatively have been manufactured on different wafers. Furthermore, the semiconductor chips <b>12</b> may be physically identical, but may also contain different integrated circuits and/or represent other components and/or may have different outer dimensions and/or geometries. The semiconductor chips <b>12</b> may have a thickness in the range between 50 μm and several hundred micrometers. The semiconductor chips <b>12</b> have active main surfaces <b>17</b> and are arranged over the carrier <b>10</b> with their active main surfaces <b>17</b> facing away from the carrier <b>10</b>. Contact elements <b>15</b> are located on the active main surfaces <b>17</b>. The integrated circuits embedded in the semiconductor chips <b>12</b> can be electrically accessed via the contact elements <b>15</b>. The contact elements <b>15</b> may be contact pads made of a metal, for example aluminum or copper. The contact elements <b>15</b> may be irregularly arranged and may differ in terms of size and geometry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">A pick-and-place tool may be used capable of picking the semiconductor chips <b>12</b> and placing them on the adhesive material <b>11</b>. The semiconductor chips <b>12</b> may be pressed in the adhesive material <b>11</b> and may be allowed to sink up to 100% of their thickness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">After the placement of the semiconductor chips <b>12</b>, the adhesive material <b>11</b> may be cured (hardened) by a heat treatment at moderate temperatures, for example temperatures of less than 200° C. or 140° C. or 100° C. for several minutes. The heat treatment may be performed by using a hot plate or an oven.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">Photo imaging may be performed to store the positions and angles of the semiconductor chips <b>12</b> placed on the carrier <b>10</b>. Depending on the accuracy of the positioning system used to place the semiconductor chips <b>12</b>, photo imaging may not be necessary.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">Before the deposition of the electrically insulating material <b>16</b> a leveling process may be performed to align the upper main surfaces <b>17</b> of the semiconductor chips <b>12</b>. For that, a further carrier, for example a wafer, may be pressed onto the semiconductor chips <b>12</b> or onto solder deposits or electrically conductive glue or any other electrically conductive material deposited on the contact elements <b>15</b> of the semiconductor chips <b>12</b>. The leveling process may be performed before or after the adhesive material <b>11</b> is hardened.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, the electrically insulating material <b>16</b> is deposited on the semiconductor chips <b>12</b> and the exposed surfaces of the carrier <b>10</b>. The gaps between the semiconductor chips <b>12</b> are also filled with the electrically insulating material <b>16</b>. In one embodiment, the height d<sub>1 </sub>of the electrically insulating material <b>16</b> above the active main surfaces <b>17</b> of the semiconductor chips <b>12</b> may be at least 10 μm and in particular around 30 μm. After its deposition the electrically insulating material <b>16</b> may provide planar sections on its upper surface, which are coplanar to the upper surface of the carrier <b>10</b>. These planar surfaces may be used to mount other components, such as a redistribution layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">The electrically insulating material <b>16</b> used for embedding the semiconductor chips <b>12</b> may be made of a polymer or any other suitable material. The electrically insulating material <b>16</b> may contain silicone or fluorinated silicone or may be entirely made of silicone. The electrically insulating material <b>16</b> may further be a mixture of silicone and epoxy resin or a mixture of silicone and polyimide. After hardening, the electrically insulating material <b>16</b> may have an elastic modulus of less than 100 MPa, in particular less than 50 MPa or 20 MPa or 10 MPa or 5 MPa or 2 MPa or 1 MPa or 500 kPa or 200 kPa or 100 kPa or 50 kPa or 20 kPa. In particular its elastic modulus may be around 3 MPa. The electrically insulating material <b>16</b> may have a thermal conductivity for example in the range between 0.1 W/mK and 5 W/mK or higher. The electrically insulating material <b>16</b> may exhibit low outgassing during cure and in particular low thixotropy. Elastosil may be used for the electrically insulating material <b>16</b> though being highly thixotropic, for example Elastosil RT705, which is commercially available.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">The elastic modulus of the electrically insulating material <b>16</b> as described above may allow a floating mounting of the semiconductor chips <b>12</b> with respect to the metal foil <b>14</b> which is placed over the semiconductor chips <b>12</b> later on. Due to the different thermal expansion coefficients of the semiconductor chips <b>12</b> and the metal foil <b>14</b>, floating mounting of the semiconductor chip <b>12</b> is desired to reduce the mechanical stress induced during temperature cycles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">During its deposition the electrically insulating material <b>16</b> may be fluid, viscous or waxy. The deposition of the electrically insulating material <b>16</b> may, for example, be performed by stencil printing, screen printing, dispensing or any other appropriate method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">After its deposition, the electrically insulating material <b>16</b> may be semi-cured (partially hardened) by a heat treatment at moderate temperatures, for example temperatures of less than 120° C. or 100° C. or 80° C. for several minutes. The heat treatment may be performed by using a hot plate or an oven.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">The electrically insulating material <b>16</b> may be structured to create cut-outs or through-holes <b>18</b> reaching from the upper surface of the electrically insulating material <b>16</b> down to the contact elements <b>15</b> of the semiconductor chips <b>12</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref>. The embodiment ratio of the through-holes <b>18</b>, which is the ratio of the height to the width of the through-holes <b>18</b>, may depend on the method used to fill the through-holes <b>18</b> with electrically conductive material. The electrically insulating material <b>16</b> may, for example, be structured by laser ablation. It may be provided that the diameter of the through-holes <b>18</b> is not larger than 50 μm if laser structuring is employed. Laser structuring may be used in particular if the accuracy of the positioning system used to place the semiconductor chips <b>12</b> is low, and photo imaging has been performed to store the positions and angles of the semiconductor chips <b>12</b> placed on the carrier <b>10</b>. Alternative techniques to create the through-holes <b>18</b> are chemical etching or photo-lithographic structuring if the electrically insulating material <b>16</b> contains a photo-sensitive component. A further alternative is to use a printing technology for the deposition of the electrically insulating material <b>16</b>, such as stencil printing or screen printing, and to leave at least portions of the contact elements <b>15</b> exposed when printing the electrically insulating material <b>16</b> on the carrier <b>10</b> and the semiconductor chips <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">First solder material <b>19</b> may be placed in the through-holes <b>18</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5F</figref>. The solder material <b>19</b> may be applied by using stencil printing or other suitable printing methods. Alternatively, pre-shaped solder balls having diameters not larger than the diameters of the through-holes <b>18</b> may be inserted into the through-holes <b>18</b> by brushing or rolling. Furthermore, the solder material <b>19</b> or any other electrically conductive material may be filled into the through-holes <b>18</b> by using pressure to fill the material in liquid state into the through-holes <b>18</b>. As an alternative to the solder material <b>19</b>, other electrically conductive materials, such as electrically conductive glue or nanopastes, may be deposited in the through-holes <b>18</b>. It may be provided that the solder material <b>19</b> protrudes from the upper surface of the electrically insulating material <b>16</b> meaning that the solder material <b>19</b> deposited in the through-holes <b>18</b> has a height larger than d<sub>1</sub>. The solder material <b>19</b> may be made of metal alloys which are composed, for example, from the following materials: SnPb, SnAg, SnAgCu, SnAgCuNi, SnAu, SnCu and SnBi. The solder material <b>19</b> may contain flux material which exhibits low outgassing. The contact elements <b>15</b> may have a solderable surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">On top of the electrically insulating material <b>16</b> a redistribution layer may be produced. One possibility to produce the redistribution layer is to use a standard PCB (printed circuit board) industry process flow. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5G</figref>, a metal foil <b>14</b> may be applied to the upper surface of the electrically insulating layer <b>16</b>. The metal foil <b>14</b> may be made of copper, aluminum or any other metal, metal alloy or metal stack. The thickness of the metal foil <b>14</b> may be in the range between 1 and 500 μm and in particular in the range between 5 and 60 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">The metal foil <b>14</b> may be laminated onto the underlying structures by applying vacuum and pressure for a time suitable to adhere the metal foil <b>14</b> to the electrically insulating material <b>16</b>. Furthermore, heat may be applied during the lamination of the metal foil <b>14</b>. After the lamination of the metal foil <b>14</b> heat and in particular pressure may be applied to melt the solder material <b>19</b> embedded in the electrically insulating material <b>16</b>. The temperature may be in the range between 200 and 400° C. By melting the solder material <b>19</b>, a soldering process is initiated which produces soldered joints between the contact elements <b>15</b> of the semiconductor chips <b>12</b> and the metal foil <b>14</b>. Due to the heat applied during the soldering process, the electrically insulating material <b>16</b> may be cured and may connect firmly with the metal foil <b>14</b>. The metal foil <b>14</b> may be perforated to allow outgassing of the electrically insulating material <b>16</b> and the solder material <b>19</b> during cure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">On top of the metal foil <b>14</b>, a dry resist film may be laminated, which is photostructurable. Recesses may be formed in the resist film by exposure to light having a suitable wave-length. For that, a laser beam and the data recorded during the photo imaging may be used. If the accuracy of the positioning system used to place the semiconductor chips <b>12</b> is high enough, the resist film may selectively exposed to the light of the suitable wave-length emitted through a mask. Subsequently, the resist film is developed and the thereby exposed portions of the metal foil <b>14</b> are etched. Afterwards the resist film is stripped off, and only the structured metal foil <b>14</b> remains on the electrically insulating material <b>16</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5H</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">A solder stop layer <b>20</b>, which may consist of a silicone material and a ductile electrically insulating material, may be applied to the structured metal film <b>14</b> and the exposed portions of the electrically insulating material <b>16</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5I</figref>. The solder stop layer <b>20</b> may, for example, be stencil printed or screen printed leaving external contact pads <b>21</b> open at appropriate locations. The solder stop layer <b>20</b> may be cured and cleaned afterwards. The solder stop layer <b>20</b> prevents solder material from bridging between conductor tracks and creating short circuits. The solder stop layer <b>20</b> also provides protection from the environment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">As an alternative, the solder stop layer <b>20</b> may be photostructurable. By exposure to light having a suitable wave-length and subsequent development, recesses may be formed in the solder stop layer <b>20</b> to expose the external contact pads <b>21</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">Second solder material <b>22</b> may be applied onto the surfaces of the external contact pads <b>21</b> exposed from the solder stop layer <b>20</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5J</figref>. The solder material <b>22</b> may be applied by printing, for example stencil printing, followed by a heat-treatment process to melt the solder material <b>22</b>. The external contact pads <b>21</b> and the solder material <b>22</b> may be used as external connection elements later on to electrically couple the devices <b>400</b> to other components, for example a PCB. The external contact pads <b>22</b> may be laterally shifted from the contact elements <b>15</b> of the semiconductor chips <b>12</b>. Prior to the application of the solder material <b>22</b>, the external contact pads <b>21</b> may be cleaned, for example by RIE (reactive ion etching) or chemical cleaning, in order to remove solder stop material remained on the external contact pads <b>22</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5K</figref>, the devices <b>500</b> are separated from one another by separation of the carrier <b>10</b>, the electrically insulating material <b>16</b> and the redistribution layer, for example by sawing, laser ablation or etching.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">The bare backside of the carrier <b>10</b> may be used to dissipate the heat generated by the semiconductor chip <b>12</b> during operation of the device <b>500</b>. For example, a heat sink or cooling element may be attached to the backside of the carrier <b>10</b>. Furthermore, the backside may be coated with a protective and/or electrically insulating layer, for example by printing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">The devices <b>500</b> manufactured by the method described above are fan-out type packages. The electrically insulating material <b>16</b> allows the redistribution layer to extend beyond the outline of the semiconductor chip <b>12</b>. The external contact pads <b>21</b> therefore do not need to be arranged within the outline of the semiconductor chip <b>12</b> but can be distributed over a larger area. The increased area which is available for arrangement of the external contact pads <b>21</b> as a result of the electrically insulating layer <b>16</b> means that the external contact pads <b>21</b> cannot only be arranged at a great distance from one another, but that the maximum number of external contact pads <b>21</b> which can be arranged there is likewise increased compared to the situation when all the external contact pads <b>21</b> are arranged within the outline of the semiconductor chip <b>12</b>. As an alternative to fan-out type packages, it is also possible to use the method described above for the manufacturing of fan-in type packages.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">The devices <b>500</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5K</figref> and the manufacturing thereof as described above are only intended to be an exemplary embodiment, and many variations are possible. For example, semiconductor chips or passives of different types may be included in the same device <b>500</b>. The semiconductor chips and passives may differ in function, size, manufacturing technology etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">In case more than one semiconductor chip is included in the same device <b>500</b>, one of the semiconductor chips may be attached to the carrier <b>10</b> by using an adhesive material <b>11</b> that is thermally conductive and another one of the semiconductor chips may be attached to the carrier <b>10</b> by using an adhesive material <b>11</b> that is thermally insulating. In this case the heat generated by the semiconductor chip, which is thermally coupled to the carrier <b>10</b> and which may for example be a processor, is transferred to the carrier <b>10</b>, but not to the semiconductor chip which is thermally decoupled from the carrier <b>10</b>, which may for example be a DRAM or any other heat sensitive device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">Furthermore, instead of the electrically insulating adhesive material <b>11</b>, an electrically conductive adhesive material <b>11</b> may be used to mount the semiconductor chips <b>12</b> on the carrier <b>10</b>. In the latter case, the adhesive material <b>11</b> may be enriched with metal particles, for example gold, silver, nickel or copper particles, in order to produce electrical conductivity. When using an electrically conductive adhesive material <b>11</b>, an electrical connection between the backside of the semiconductor chip <b>12</b> and the carrier <b>10</b> is established.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">In case the adhesive material <b>11</b> being electrically conductive, the semiconductor chips <b>12</b> may include logic circuits having ground electrodes on their backsides or any other electrodes.

In the case of a MOSFET, the semiconductor chip <b>12</b> may have a source electrode and a gate electrode on its top surface and a drain electrode is located on the bottom surface of the semiconductor chip <b>12</b>, which is electrically coupled to the carrier <b>10</b> by using the electrically conductive adhesive material <b>11</b>. In this case, the carrier <b>10</b> may not be fully covered with the electrically insulating material <b>16</b> and a solder deposit, for example a solder ball, may be placed on the part of the carrier <b>10</b> exposed from the electrically insulating material <b>16</b> in order to create an external contact element for the drain electrode of the MOSFET.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">Depending on the type of the semiconductor chip <b>12</b>, at least a part of the upper surface <b>17</b> of the semiconductor chip <b>12</b> may be exposed from the electrically insulating material <b>16</b> and the redistribution layer.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">In the embodiment described above and illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5K</figref>, the solder material <b>19</b> deposited in the through-holes <b>18</b> is melted after the lamination of the metal foil <b>14</b>.

For example, the solder material <b>19</b> may be deposited on the contact elements <b>15</b> when the semiconductor chips <b>12</b> are still in the wafer bond. The solder material <b>15</b> may, for example, be deposited onto the contact elements <b>15</b> by stencil printing, screen printing or any other appropriate printing technique. Alternatively, solder balls may be placed on the contact elements <b>15</b>. As a further alternative, the solder material <b>19</b> may be electrochemically deposited on the contact elements <b>15</b> in order to produce the solder bumps.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">According to yet a further embodiment, the electrically insulating material <b>16</b> may be deposited using two deposition processes.
