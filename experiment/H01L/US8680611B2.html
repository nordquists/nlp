<heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The present embodiments relate in general to power semiconductor technology, and more particularly to accumulation-mode and enhancement-mode trenched-gate field effect transistors (FETs) and their methods of manufacture.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">The key component in power electronic applications is the solid state switch. From ignition control in automotive applications to battery-operated consumer electronic devices, to power converters in industrial applications, there is a need for a power switch that optimally meets the demands of the particular application. Solid state switches including, for example, the power metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (power MOSFET), the insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) and various types of thyristors have continued to evolve to meet this demand. In the case of the power MOSFET, for example, double-diffused structures (DMOS) with lateral channel (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,682,405 to Blanchard et al.), trenched gate structures (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,429,481 to Mo et al.), and various techniques for charge balancing in the transistor drift region (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,941,026 to Temple, U.S. Pat. No. 5,216,275 to Chen, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,081,009 to Neilson) have been developed, among many other technologies, to address the differing and often competing performance requirements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Some of the defining performance characteristics for the power switch are its on-resistance, breakdown voltage and switching speed. Depending on the requirements of a particular application, a different emphasis is placed on each of these performance criteria. For example, for power applications greater than about 300-400 volts, the IGBT exhibits an inherently lower on-resistance as compared to the power MOSFET, but its switching speed is lower due to its slower turn off characteristics. Therefore, for applications greater than 400 volts with low switching frequencies requiring low on-resistance, the IGBT is the preferred switch while the power MOSFET is often the device of choice for relatively higher frequency applications. If the frequency requirements of a given application dictate the type of switch that is used, the voltage requirements determine the structural makeup of the particular switch. For example, in the case of the power MOSFET, because of the proportional relationship between the drain-to-source on-resistance RDSon and the breakdown voltage, improving the voltage performance of the transistor while maintaining a low RDSon poses a challenge. Various charge balancing structures in the transistor drift region have been developed to address this challenge with differing degrees of success.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Two varieties of field effect transistors are accumulation mode FET and enhancement mode FET. In conventional accumulation FETs because no inversion channel is formed, the channel resistance is eliminated thus improving the transistor power handling capability and its efficiency. Further, with no pn body diode, the losses in synchronous rectification circuits attributable to the pn diode are reduced. A drawback of conventional accumulation transistors is that the drift region needs to be lightly doped to support a high enough reverse bias voltage. However, a lightly doped drift region results in a higher on-resistance and lower efficiency. Similarly, in enhancement mode FETs, improving the transistor break down voltage often comes at the price of higher on-resistance or vice versa.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">Device performance parameters are also impacted by the fabrication process. Attempts have been made to address some of these challenges by developing a variety of improved processing techniques. Whether it is in ultra-portable consumer electronic devices or routers and hubs in communication systems, the varieties of applications for the power switch continue to grow with the expansion of the electronic industry. The power switch therefore remains a semiconductor device with high development potential.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">The power switch can be implemented by any one of power MOSFET, IGBT, various types of thyristors and the like. Many of the novel techniques presented herein are described in the context of the power MOSFET for illustrative purposes. It is to be understood however that the various embodiments described herein are not limited to the power MOSFET and can apply to many of the other types of power switch technologies, including, for example, IGBTs and other types of bipolar switches. Further, for the purposes of illustration, the various embodiments are shown to include specific p and n type regions. It is understood by those skilled in the art that the teachings herein are equally applicable to devices in which the conductivities of the various regions are reversed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a simplified cross section view of a trenched-gate accumulation field effect transistor (FET) optimally integrated with a Schottky diode in a single cell, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment. A lightly doped n-type epitaxial layer <b>104</b> extends over and is in contact with a highly doped n-type substrate <b>102</b>. Gate trenches <b>106</b> extend into and terminate within epitaxial layer <b>104</b>. Each gate trench <b>106</b> is lined with a dielectric layer <b>108</b> along its sidewalls and bottom, and includes a recessed gate <b>110</b> and insulating material <b>112</b> atop recessed gate <b>110</b>. Triangular-shaped source regions <b>114</b> of n-type conductivity flank each side of trenches <b>106</b>. Source regions <b>114</b> overlap polysilicon gate <b>110</b> along the vertical dimension. This overlap is not necessary in such applications as high-voltage FETs wherein the absence of the overlap would have minimal impact on the transistor on-resistance Rdson. The absence of the gate-source overlap has more of an impact on Rdson in low voltage transistors, and as such its presence would be advantageous in such transistors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">Recessed portions of epitaxial layer <b>104</b> together with source regions <b>114</b> form V-shaped contact openings <b>118</b> with rounded bottoms. A Schottky bather metal <b>120</b> extends over the structure and fills contact openings <b>118</b> to make contact with source regions <b>114</b> along the sloped sidewalls of source regions <b>114</b>, and to contact epitaxial layer <b>104</b> in the recessed portions thereof. Since source regions <b>114</b> are highly doped and epitaxial layer <b>104</b> is lightly doped, top-side conductor layer <b>120</b> forms an ohmic contact with source regions <b>114</b> and a Schottky contact with epitaxial layer <b>104</b>. In one embodiment, Schottky bather metal <b>120</b> comprises titanium. A back-side conductor layer <b>122</b>, e.g., comprising aluminum (or titanium), contacts substrate <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">Unlike enhancement-mode transistors, the accumulation-mode transistor in structure <b>100</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> does not include a blocking (p-type in this example) well or body region inside which the conduction channel is formed. Instead a conducting channel is formed when an accumulation layer is formed in epitaxial layer <b>104</b> along the trench sidewalls. The transistor in structure <b>100</b> is normally on or off depending on the doping concentration of the channel region and the doping type of gates <b>110</b>. It is turned off when the channel regions are entirely depleted and lightly inverted. Also, because no inversion channel is formed, the channel resistance is eliminated thus improving the transistor power handling capability and its efficiency. Further, with no pn body diode, the losses in synchronous rectification circuits attributable to the pn diode are eliminated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">In the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> embodiment, the FET in structure <b>100</b> is a vertical trenched-gate accumulation MOSFET with the top-side conductor layer <b>120</b> forming the source conductor and the bottom-side conductor layer <b>120</b> forming the drain conductor. In another embodiment, substrate <b>102</b> is p-type thereby forming an accumulation IGBT.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2I</figref> are simplified cross section views illustrating various process steps for forming the integrated FET-Schottky diode structure <b>100</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, lower epitaxial layer <b>204</b> and upper epitaxial layer <b>205</b> are sequentially formed over n-type substrate <b>202</b> using conventional methods. Alternatively, a starting wafer material which includes epitaxial layers <b>204</b>, <b>205</b> may be used. The upper n-type epitaxial layer <b>205</b> has a higher doping concentration than the lower n-type epitaxial layer <b>204</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, a mask (not shown) is used to define and etch the silicon to form trenches <b>206</b> extending through upper epitaxial layer <b>205</b> and terminating within lower epitaxial layer <b>204</b> using known techniques. A conventional dry or wet etch may be used in forming the trenches. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, a dielectric layer <b>208</b>, e.g., comprising oxide, is grown or deposited over the structure whereby the sidewalls and bottom of trenches <b>206</b> are lined with dielectric layer <b>208</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, a layer of polysilicon <b>209</b> is then deposited to fill trenches <b>206</b> using conventional techniques. Polysilicon layer <b>209</b> may be in-situ doped to obtain the desired gate doping type and concentration. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, polysilicon layer <b>209</b> is etched back and recessed within trenches <b>206</b> to form gates <b>210</b>, using conventional techniques. Recessed gates <b>210</b> overlap upper epitaxial layer <b>205</b> along the vertical dimension. As mentioned above, depending on the target application and the design goals, recessed gates <b>210</b> need not overlap upper epitaxial layer <b>205</b> (i.e., the process sequence and the final structure need not be limited by this overlap). In other embodiments, gate <b>210</b> comprises polysilicon carbide or metal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>, a dielectric layer <b>211</b>, e.g., from oxide, is formed over the structure and then planarized using conventional techniques. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref>, a blanket etch of the planarized dielectric layer <b>211</b> (in the active region) is carried out at least in the active area of the device to expose surface areas of upper epitaxial layer <b>205</b> while portions <b>212</b> of dielectric layer <b>211</b> remain over recessed gates <b>210</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref>, a blanket angled silicon etch (e.g., dry etch in the active region) is carried out at least in the active area to form the V-shaped contact openings <b>218</b> with rounded bottoms using conventional techniques. Contact openings <b>218</b> extend clear through upper epitaxial layer <b>205</b> thus forming two source regions <b>214</b> between every two adjacent trenches. Contact openings <b>218</b> extend into and terminate within an upper half of lower epitaxial layer <b>204</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2I</figref>, top-side conductor layer <b>220</b> is formed using conventional techniques. Top-side conductor layer <b>220</b> comprises a Schottky barrier metal. As shown, top-side conductor layer <b>220</b> fills contact openings <b>218</b> so as to make contact with source regions <b>214</b> along the slanted sidewalls of source regions <b>214</b>, and with lower epitaxial layer <b>204</b> along the bottom of contact openings <b>218</b>. Since source regions <b>214</b> are highly doped and lower epitaxial layer <b>204</b> is lightly doped, top-side conductor layer <b>220</b> forms an ohmic contact with source regions <b>214</b>, and forms a Schottky contact with lower epitaxial layer <b>204</b>. As can be seen, source regions <b>214</b> and the Schottky contacts are self-aligned to trenches <b>206</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3E</figref> are simplified cross section views depicting alternate process steps to those in the latter portion of the process sequence depicted by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2G-2I</figref>, according to another exemplary embodiment. Thus, in this embodiment, the same process steps depicted by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A through 2G</figref> are carried out leading to the step depicted by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> (the step depicted by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is the same as the step depicted by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref>). In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, upper epitaxial layer <b>305</b> is etched back to expose upper sidewalls of dielectric material <b>312</b> sufficiently to accommodate the subsequent formation of dielectric spacers <b>316</b>. In one embodiment, second epitaxial layer <b>305</b> is etched back by an amount in the range of 0.05-0.5 μm. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, spacers <b>316</b> are formed adjacent to the exposed upper sidewalls of dielectric material <b>312</b> using conventional techniques. Spacers <b>316</b> are from a dielectric material different than that of dielectric material <b>312</b>. For example, if dielectric material <b>312</b> is from oxide, spacers <b>316</b> may be from nitride.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>, the exposed surface areas of upper epitaxial layer <b>305</b> are recessed clear through epitaxial layer <b>305</b> thus forming contact openings <b>318</b> which extend into lower epitaxial layer <b>304</b>. By recessing clear through upper epitaxial layer <b>305</b>, only portions <b>314</b> of upper epitaxial layer <b>305</b> directly below spacers <b>316</b> remain. Portions <b>314</b> form the transistor source regions. As can be seen, contact openings <b>318</b> and thus source regions <b>314</b> are self-aligned to trenches <b>306</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>, top-side conductor layer <b>320</b> and bottom-side conductor layer <b>322</b> are formed using conventional techniques. Conductor layer <b>320</b> comprises a Schottky bather metal. As shown, top-side conductor <b>320</b> fills contact openings <b>318</b> so as to make contact with source regions <b>314</b> along sidewalls of source regions <b>314</b>, and with the recessed portions of lower epitaxial layer <b>304</b>. Since source regions <b>314</b> are highly doped and lower epitaxial layer <b>304</b> is lightly doped, top-side conductor layer <b>320</b> forms an ohmic contact with source regions <b>314</b>, and forms a Schottky contact with lower epitaxial layer <b>304</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">In an alternate embodiment shown in FIG. <b>3</b>EE, prior to forming the top-side conductor layer, dielectric spacers <b>316</b> are removed thus exposing the top surfaces of source regions <b>314</b>. Top-side conductor layer <b>321</b> thus makes contact along the top surface and sidewalls of source regions <b>314</b>. The source contact resistance is thus reduced. In an alternate variation of the various embodiments described above, known techniques are used to form a thick bottom dielectric along the bottom of each trench before forming the gates. The thick bottom dielectric reduces the miller capacitance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">As can be seen from the various embodiments described herein, a Schottky diode is optimally integrated with a FET in a single cell which is repeated many times in an array of such cells. Also, the Schottky contact and the source regions are self-aligned to the trenches. Further, the Schottky contact results in lower on resistance Rdson and thus lower on-state losses, and also improves the transistor reverse recovery characteristics. Good blocking capability is also obtained without the need for a tight cell pitch.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">In the exemplary process sequences depicted by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2I</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3E</figref> no diffusion or implantation processes are used. While these process sequences can be used with conventional crystalline silicon material, they are particularly suitable for use with such other types of materials as silicon carbide (SiC), gallium nitride (GaN), and gallium arsenide (GaAs) where diffusion, implantation, and dopant activation processes are difficult to accomplish and control. In such embodiments, the substrate, the lower and upper epitaxial layers, as well as other regions of the transistor may comprise one of SiC, GaN, and GaAs. Further, in conventional silicon carbide based enhancement mode FETs, the contribution of the inversion channel to the on resistance is particularly high. In contrast, the contribution to the on resistance of the accumulated channel in the silicon carbide embodiment of the accumulation transistors in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2I and 3E</figref> is substantially low.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a cross section view of another embodiment.

One or more methods for forming such shield electrodes are disclosed in the above-referenced commonly assigned application Ser. No. 11/026,276.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">A limitation of some conventional silicon carbide based trenched-gate transistors is the low gate oxide breakdown voltage. In accordance with the invention, this problem is addressed by extending the Schottky contact recess deeper, e.g., to a depth greater than one half of the depth of the gate trenches. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an exemplary embodiment wherein the Schottky contact recess is extended to approximately the same depth as gate trenches <b>506</b>. The deep Schottky contact serves to shield gate oxide <b>508</b> from high electric fields and thus improves the gate oxide breakdown. This can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> which shows simulation results for two SiC based accumulation FETs one of which has a deeper Schottky contact recess. The electric field lines present along the bottom of the trench in the transistor with a shallower Schottky contact recess (right diagram) are eliminated in the transistor with a deeper Schottky contact recess case (left diagram). The electric field lines below the gate trench in the right diagram reflect increasing electric field from bottom to top. That is, the lowest-most electric field line corresponds to the highest electric filed and the upper-most electric field line corresponds to lowest electric field.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">A further advantage of the deep Schottky contact recess is reduction in transistor leakage in the blocking state. This is more clearly shown in the simulation results in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> wherein the drain current versus drain voltage is plotted for a deeper Schottky contact recess versus a shallower Schottky contact recess. As can be seen, as the drain voltage is increased from 0V to 200V, the drain current continuously rises in the case of shallower Schottky contact recess while the drain current remains flat for the deeper Schottky contact recess. Thus, a substantial reduction in transistor leakage as well as a higher gate oxide breakdown is achieved by recessing the Schottky contact deeper into epitaxial layer <b>504</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">The deeply recessed Schottky contact structure (e.g., that in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) is particularly suitable in the silicon carbide based transistors because the gate trenches need not extend as deep in the epitaxial layer as compared to the silicon based transistors. This allows shallower Schottky contact recesses which are easier to define and etch. However, similar improvements in gate oxide breakdown and transistor leakage can be obtained for similar structures using other types of material such as SiC, GaN and GaAs.</div>

This invention is not limited to p-channel FETs. One skilled in this art would know how to implement the invention in an n-channel FET or other types of power transistors in view of this disclosure. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, top metal layer <b>1832</b> is peeled back to reveal the underlying regions. Similarly, dielectric caps <b>1820</b> are partially removed from over the right two gates <b>1818</b> for illustration purposes. As shown, a lightly-doped n-type body region <b>1804</b> extends over a lightly doped p-type region <b>1802</b>. In one embodiment, p-type region <b>1802</b> is an epitaxial layer formed over a highly doped p-type substrate (not shown), and body region <b>1804</b> is formed in epitaxial layer <b>1802</b> by implanting and driving in appropriate dopants as know in this art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0090">Gate trenches <b>1806</b> extend through body region <b>1804</b> and terminate in p-type region <b>1802</b>.

A dielectric cap <b>1820</b> extends vertically over each gate <b>1818</b>. Heavily doped p-type source regions <b>1826</b> are formed in body region <b>1804</b> between adjacent trenches.

A top side metal layer <b>1832</b> is formed over the structure to make electrical contact to both source regions <b>1826</b> and heavy body regions <b>1828</b>. This FET structure is advantageous in that the cell pitch is reduced by forming the heavy body region intermittently along the source stripe, and thus a high density FET is achieved.</div>

These figures do not show the heavy body regions because these figures correspond to cross section views along the front face of the isometric view in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>, n-type body region <b>1904</b> is formed in p-type epitaxial layer <b>1902</b> using conventional implant and drive-in techniques. Trenches <b>1906</b>, gate insulator <b>1907</b> lining trenches <b>1906</b>, and the recessed polysilicon gates <b>1918</b> are formed using known techniques. A dielectric layer is formed over the structure, is then planarized, and finally uniformly etached back until the silicon surface is exposed. The space directly over each gate is thus filled with dielectric cap <b>1920</b>. In one embodiment, the exposed silicon mesa surfaces between adjacent dielectric regions <b>1920</b> are recessed to a depth intermediate the top and bottom surfaces of dielectric region <b>1920</b>, followed by a source implant to form p-type source regions. In an alternate embodiment, the source formation is carried out before recessing the silicon. The heavy body regions (not shown) can be formed before or after forming the source regions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0092"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B-1</figref> shows a variation wherein the silicon recess is carried out so that upper sidewalls of dielectric regions <b>1920</b> become exposed (i.e., source regions <b>1926</b> have flat top surfaces). <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B-2</figref> shows another variation wherein the silicon recess is carried out so that the top surface of the source regions between adjacent trenches is bowl-shaped and thus sidewalls of dielectric regions <b>1920</b> are not exposed. In one embodiment, this is achieved by performing an anisotropic silicon etch. An advantage of the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B-2</figref> variation is that a larger source surface area is provided for contact with the top conductor layer <b>1935</b>, and thus the source contact resistance is reduced.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0093"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is a simplified cross section depicting a technique for obtaining a highly compact trenched-gate FET with self-aligned heavy body and source regions. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, gate trenches with gates <b>2012</b> therein extend through p-well region <b>2004</b> and terminate within n-type drift region <b>2000</b>. In one embodiment, n-type drift region <b>2000</b> is an epitaxial layer formed over a highly doped n-type substrate (not shown). Each gate trench includes a dielectric cap <b>2014</b> over gate <b>2012</b>. As shown, the mesa regions between the two trenches is recessed such that the silicon recess has sloped outer walls extending from near the top of dielectric cap <b>2014</b> to the bottom of the mesa recess.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0094">As indicated by the solid line arrow <b>2019</b> extending perpendicularly to the bottom surface of the mesa recess, highly doped p-type heavy body region <b>2016</b> is formed by carrying out a blanket implant of dopants (e.g., BF<sub>2</sub>) at a zero degree angle. Given the zero degree angle of the heavy body implant, the opposite slopes of each trench sidewall and its immediately adjacent outer wall of the mesa recess, together with careful selection of the implant dopant type and such implant variables as implant energy, ensure that the implanted dopants do not reach the channel regions extending along the trench sidewalls in well regions <b>2004</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0095">As indicated by the two angled dashed line arrows <b>2018</b>, a blanket two-pass angled implant of n-type dopants is performed to form source regions <b>2020</b> along the sloped walls of each mesa recess. As shown, the upper trench corners block the source implants from entering the central portion of the heavy body region. As can be seen no mask is used during either the heavy body implant or the two-pass angled source implant. The mesa recess, in effect, creates a natural mask enabling formation of self-aligned heavy body and source regions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0096">The self-aligned heavy body and source regions enable a significant reduction in the cell pitch resulting in a highly dense cell structure which in turn helps reduce the transistor on-resistance. Further, self-aligned heavy body regions help improve the unclamped inductive switching (UIL) ruggedness. Also, forming the source and heavy body regions in a self-aligned manner, reduces the number of masks thus reducing the manufacturing cost while simplifying the process sequence and improving manufacturing yield. Moreover, the particular profile of the source and heavy body regions are advantageous in that: (i) the sloped outer walls the mesa recess provides a large source surface area which helps reduce the source contact resistance, and (ii) the heavy body region overlaps under the source regions which helps improve the transistor UIL ruggedness. Further, as will be seen, the technique illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is compatible with many thick bottom dielectric processes, and lends itself well to the LOCOS process.</div>

In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>, conventional silicon etch and LOCOS processes are used to form insulation-filled trench <b>2001</b> in the termination region. A pad oxide layer (not shown) and a nitride layer (not shown) are first formed over n-type silicon region <b>2000</b>. A first mask is then used to define the portion of silicon region <b>2000</b> in the termination region where silicon is to be removed. The nitride layer, pad oxide and the underlying silicon region are removed through the first mask to form trench <b>2001</b> in the termination region. Local oxidation is then carried out to fill trench <b>2001</b> with insulating material <b>2002</b>. Although not shown, the starting material may comprise a highly doped n-type substrate over which n-type region <b>2000</b> is formed, for example, epitaxially.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0099">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>, a blanket well implant and drive-in is carried out to form p-type well region <b>2004</b> in silicon region <b>2000</b>.

In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C</figref>, a second masking step is carried out to define and etch trenches <b>2006</b> which extend through well region <b>2004</b> and terminate within silicon region <b>2000</b>. A bottom portion of trenches <b>2006</b> is filled with insulating material by, for example, depositing high density plasma (HDP) oxide and then etching the deposited HDP oxide to form thick bottom oxide <b>2008</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0100">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18D</figref>, a gate insulating layer <b>2010</b> is formed along all surface areas including the trench sidewalls. Polysilicon is then deposited and doped (e.g., in situ). A third mask is used to define and etch the polysilicon to form recessed gates <b>2012</b>A in the active area, termination trench gate <b>2012</b>B and the surface gate <b>2012</b>C. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18E</figref>, a dielectric layer is formed over the structure. A fourth mask is then used to define the portion of the active region and the opening <b>2015</b> in the termination region where the dielectric layer is to be etched back. The dielectric layer is etched through the mask openings until silicon is reached. Thus, in the active region, the space directly over each gate <b>2012</b>A remains filled with dielectric material <b>2014</b>A, while opening <b>2015</b> is formed in the termination region. As can be seen, surfaces of well regions <b>2004</b>B in the active region and well region <b>2004</b>A in the termination region are exposed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0101">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18F</figref>, a silicon etch step is carried out to recess the exposed silicon surface areas in the active and termination regions. An almost bowl-shaped silicon surface is formed in well regions <b>2004</b>B between adjacent trenches in the active region and in well region <b>2004</b>A in the termination region. Next, a zero degree heavy body implant (e.g., BF<sub>2</sub>) is carried out to form p-type heavy body regions <b>2016</b>B in well regions <b>2004</b>B of the active region, and to form heavy body region <b>2016</b>A in well region <b>2004</b>A of the termination region. Source regions <b>2020</b> are then formed using a two-pass angled source implant as depicted by arrows <b>2018</b>. In the two-pass angled implant, n-type impurities are implanted at such angle that the upper trench corners prevent a central portion <b>2016</b>B of the heavy body regions from receiving the implant. Source regions <b>2020</b> are thus formed immediately adjacent the trenches while a central portion <b>2016</b>B of the heavy body regions remains intact as shown. Because of the aspect ratio of the opening <b>2015</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18E</figref>) and the angle of the two-pass source implant, termination well region <b>2004</b>A does not receive the source implants.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0102">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18G</figref>, an implant activation step is carried out to drive in the implanted dopants. A fifth mask is then used to define and etch insulating layer <b>2014</b>C to form gate contact opening <b>2019</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18H</figref>, a conductor layer (e.g., comprising metal) is then formed over the structure. A sixth mask is used to define and etch the conductor layer in order to isolate source conductor <b>2021</b>A from gate conductor <b>2021</b>B. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18I</figref>, a passivation layer is deposited. A seventh mask is then used to etch portions of the passivation layer to thereby define source and gate areas where wirebond contacts are to be made.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0103">As can be seen no mask is used in forming heavy body regions <b>2016</b>B and source regions <b>2020</b>. Also, both the heavy body and source regions are self-aligned with the trench edges. Further, heavy body region <b>2016</b>B overlaps beneath source regions <b>2020</b> but does not extend into the channel regions. A tight cell pitch with an exceptional snapback and UIL ruggedness is thus achieved. The small cell pitch helps achieve a lower Rdson. Also, since source regions <b>2020</b> are formed along the outer curved surfaces of well regions <b>2004</b>B, a larger source contact area is obtained and thus a lower source contact resistance is achieved. Moreover, the simple process sequence uses a reduced number of masking steps, is compatible with many thick bottom oxide (TBO) process modules, and lends itself well to the LOCOS method of forming the TBO.</div>

However, because of opening <b>2217</b> (in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20E</figref>) over surface polysilicon <b>2212</b>C, the silicon etch for recessing the exposed mesa surfaces also etches the exposed portion of surface polysilicon <b>2212</b>C creating an opening <b>2218</b> therein.

A LOCOS thick bottom oxide (TBO) process is then used to form a layer of insulating material <b>2402</b> along the bottom portion of both the active trenches <b>2406</b> and the wide termination trench <b>2401</b> trench, as well as over a top surface of the silicon mesa between adjacent trenches.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0116">The process steps corresponding to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22C</figref> are similar to those corresponding to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20D</figref>, however in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22C</figref> instead of forming a planar surface polysilicon <b>2212</b>C as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20D</figref>, polysilicon <b>2412</b>C extends over termination p-well <b>2204</b>A and down into wide trench <b>2401</b>. The process steps corresponding to each of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22D</figref>, <b>22</b>E, and <b>22</b>F are similar to those corresponding to each of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20E</figref>, <b>20</b>F, and <b>20</b>G, respectively, and thus will not be described. As can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22F</figref>, the gate conductor <b>2421</b>B makes contact to sidewalls of gate <b>2412</b>D inside the wide trench in the termination region. As in the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20A-20G</figref> embodiment, if after the silicon recess step in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22E</figref>, the termination polysilicon <b>2412</b>C is not fully etched through (i.e., a portion of it remains along the bottom of opening <b>2218</b> in polysilicon <b>2412</b>C), then gate conductor <b>2021</b>B would also contact a surface area of the remaining polysilicon in opening <b>2218</b>. A total of 4 masks are used, which together with the passivation pad mask (as, for example, identified in the process sequence corresponding to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18I</figref>) makes a total of 5 masks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0117"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23A-23I</figref> are cross section views at different processing steps for forming a trenched-gate FET with self-aligned features, in accordance with yet another embodiment of the invention.

In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23E</figref>, a dielectric layer is formed over the structure. A fourth mask is then used to cover the termination region as a dielectric planaraization etch is carried out in the active region so that dielectric caps <b>2514</b>A remain over each trench gate <b>2512</b>A. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23F</figref>, a mesa recess etch is carried out to recess the p-type well regions <b>2504</b>B below the top surface of dielectric caps <b>2514</b>A such that upper sidewalls of dielectric caps <b>2514</b>A become exposed. A blanket implant of dopants (e.g., arsenic) is then carried out to form n+ regions <b>2517</b> in well regions <b>2504</b>B between adjacent trenches. Nitride spacers <b>2518</b> are then formed over n+ regions <b>2517</b> along the exposed sidewalls of dielectric caps <b>2514</b>A using conventional techniques. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23G</figref>, the exposed silicon mesa between adjacent spacers <b>2518</b> are recessed to a depth within well regions <b>2504</b>B. The silicon recess removes the middle portion of n+ region <b>2517</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23F</figref>), leaving outer portions <b>2520</b> of n+ regions <b>2517</b> extending directly below spacers <b>2518</b> intact.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0118">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23H</figref>, nitride spacers <b>2518</b> are removed using conventional techniques.
