<heading id="h-0001">TECHNICAL FIELD AND PRIOR ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention concerns the field of micro- and nano-systems and their manufacture.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">In this type of device, moving mechanical structures are produced by selectively etching the layers of material, or sacrificial layers, which are underneath the moving structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention notably enables gyroscopes to be produced, with detection elements with parallel capacitive electrodes, above and below the moving structured layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention applies more specifically to the field of micro-systems, with detection elements with capacitive electrodes parallel to the plane of the moving portion produced in a structured thin layer (for example, micro-gyroscopes).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">As an example of such a system, the MEMS described in document US2006/0208326 may be cited. In this document an AlGe hermetic metal seal is produced between two substrates. A moving MEMS structure is located in the first substrate. The second substrate (Cap) may be a CMOS with an aluminium upper electrode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Such microstructures can be manufactured by various known methods.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In particular, they can be produced from a Si substrate of the “bulk” type, on which a sacrificial layer (for example SiO2) is deposited, or made to grow, followed by the structural layer (for example polycrystalline silicon). The bulk silicon substrate can then be structured before deposition of the sacrificial and structural layers, in order to obtain, for example, electrodes or connections.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">However, in this case the structural layer cannot be monocrystalline silicon, since it is not possible to deposit monocrystalline silicon, or make it grow, on an insulating layer, or a layer of any nature other than monocrystalline silicon. In addition, this non-monocrystalline structural layer has degraded mechanical properties compared to monocrystalline silicon. Lastly, thick structural layers cannot be deposited due to the very lengthy treatment times, and the costly nature which results therefrom.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition, the problem of the stress generated by thick layers is posed, as explained in the document Ganchandani et al. Impact of long, high temperature anneals on residual stress in polysilicon, 1997 International Conference on Solid-State Sensor and Actuators.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">As a variant, it is possible to manufacture a micro-system from 2 silicon substrates, one of which is covered with an oxide layer. The two substrates are attached by direct bonding.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">As an example of such a system, the one described in the article of Yamamoto et al may be cited. Title: “Capacitive Accelerometer with high aspect ratio single microstructure Using the SOI structure with polysilicon-based Interconnect technique”, which describes the manufacture of MEMS from a direct bonding of 2 substrates. On a first substrate, after deposition of an oxide layer, a layer of polycrystalline silicon is deposited, and then structured to form a lower electrode. After deposition and polishing of a new oxide layer the substrate is bonded by direct bonding to another silicon substrate, and then thinned by the structured face. The MEMS is then structured in the substrate which has been thinned by DRIE, and then released by etching of the sacrificial layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">This manufacturing method has 2 disadvantages.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">Firstly, after direct bonding and thinning, the first levels and the alignment marks are buried and therefore invisible. And it is necessary to be able to align the following levels (notably the MEMS level) with the first buried levels (notably the lower electrode). The article of Yamamoto et al mentioned above proposes to generate deep alignment marks at the start of the manufacturing method, and to fill them with oxide, and finally to reveal them again after thinning. Another method is to generate alignment marks on the rear face of the second substrate, and to seal the 2 substrates with alignment. After thinning the marks on the rear face of the second substrate would be used for alignment of the following levels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">Furthermore, with this manufacturing method, it is not possible to create a contact of the lower electrode to the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">Lastly, the technique described in document US2010/0193884 implements the formation of a MEMS with a lower electrode and an upper electrode, using 2 metal seals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">The disadvantage of this method is that the thermal budget must be restricted after the first metal seal and the formation of the lower electrode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">Moreover, in this technique the 2 substrates are structured separately. They are then sealed (by metal sealing) with an alignment of the 2 substrates, which requires particular and expensive equiμment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">The problem of finding a new production method, and a new structure of the micro- and/or nano-system type, which does not have the disadvantages explained above, is therefore posed.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">Account of the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">A device of the micro- and/or nano-system type, for example MEMS and/or NEMS, is first described, including:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0020">a first substrate, having at least one lower electrode, and a dielectric layer, positioned between the lower electrode and the first substrate; this first substrate, or lower substrate, can be, for example, made of a monocrystalline or polycrystalline semiconducting material, or it has an SOI substrate, or has several stacked materials;</li> <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0021">an intermediate substrate having a moving portion, attached, outside the moving portion, by molecular bonding, or direct bonding, with the first substrate, where the moving portion is facing at least a portion of the lower electrode,</li> <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0022">an upper substrate, attached to the intermediate substrate, for example of the CMOS type, where the said moving portion can be made to move between the lower electrode and the upper substrate.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0023">The electrode or electrodes enable the component, perpendicular to the main plane of the device, of the movement of the moving portion to be initiated or detected; but this movement of the moving portion can, in addition, have other components, particularly in a plane parallel to this main plane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0024">This structure enables a stress on the thermal budget after formation of the lower electrode to be avoided. Indeed, it enables a connection between the intermediate substrate and the first substrate, or a portion of the dielectric layer formed on the latter, to be generated, which enables no temperature limit to be imposed for the steps following the formation of the lower electrode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0025">The upper electrode can include at least one electrode, where the moving portion is facing at least a portion of this upper electrode, and where it is able to be made to move between the lower electrode and the upper electrode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0026">The upper substrate may be fixed securely to the intermediate substrate by means of a sealing bead.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0027">Means can be provided to form an electrical contact between the lower electrode and the upper electrode, and/or means can be provided to form an electrical contact between the lower electrode and the first substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0028">The intermediate substrate is preferably made from monocrystalline silicon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0029">A method is also described to produce a device of the MEMS and/or NEMS type including the following steps:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0030">forming a first substrate, including at least one electrode, called the lower electrode, and a first dielectric layer,</li> <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0031">then followed by assembling, by molecular bonding, an intermediate substrate, with the first substrate,</li> <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0032">the assembling step being then followed by producing a moving portion in the intermediate substrate,</li> <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0033">this step of producing a moving portion being then followed by forming a cavity in the first dielectric layer, at least under the moving portion, such that the moving portion is facing at least a portion of the lower electrode,</li> <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0034">the cavity forming step being then followed by assembly of a substrate, called the upper substrate, with the intermediate substrate, such that the said moving portion can be made to move between the lower electrode and the upper substrate, at least in a direction perpendicular to this lower electrode and, possibly, in a plane parallel to the main plane or to this lower electrode. The electrode or electrodes therefore enable the component, perpendicular to the main plane of the device, of the movement of the moving portion to be initiated or detected, with the understanding that this movement of the moving portion can have other components, particularly in a plane parallel to this main plane.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0035">The upper substrate can include at least one electrode, called the upper electrode, where the assembly is such that the moving portion is facing at least a portion of the upper electrode, and where the said moving portion can be made to move between the lower electrode and the upper electrode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0036">Alignment marks can be made in the rear face of the lower substrate. It is then possible to fix this structured lower substrate securely to the intermediate, unstructured substrate. This sealing can be accomplished without special equiμment. When the intermediate substrate has been thinned, if applicable, the different levels are aligned with the marks generated in the rear face of the lower substrate. In particular, these marks are also used for the alignment of the upper substrate when it is assembled with the remainder of the structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0037">In a method or device as presented above, or as explained below:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0038">The upper substrate may be fixed securely to the intermediate substrate by means of a sealing bead;</li> <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0039">and/or means can be provided to form an electrical contact between the lower electrode and the upper electrode and/or means can be provided to form an electrical contact between the lower electrode and the first substrate;</li> <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0040">and/or the intermediate substrate is made from monocrystalline silicon;</li> <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0041">and/or the upper substrate is fixed securely to the intermediate substrate hermetically and/or using a sealing bead and/or by eutectic sealing or by thermocompression using the sealing bead.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>

<heading id="h-0004">DETAILED ACCOUNT OF PARTICULAR EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0048">In the remainder of this document reference is made to molecular bonding, also called direct bonding or direct sealing. This assembly technique is described notably by Q. Y. Tong in “Silicon Wafer Bonding Technology for VLSI and MEMS applications”, Edited by S. S. Iyer and A. J. Auberton-Herve, 2002, INSPEC, London, Chapter 1, pages 1-20.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0049">An example of a structure illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which is a section view, is first described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0050">In the remainder of the document, when mention is made of a “substrate” <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b>, the term “layer” may also be understood. Consequently, for these three elements, one or other of these terms is used without differentiation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0051">The structure of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can be produced in 3 superimposed substrates <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> attached to one another, where substrate <b>200</b> is positioned between substrate <b>100</b> and substrate <b>300</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0052">Substrate <b>200</b> is, for example, between several tens of μm and several hundreds of μm thick, for example between 10 μm and 100 μm or 500 μm thick.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0053">Each of these substrates extends principally in a plane xy, where axis z is perpendicular to each of them. For this reason, plane xy is also called the main plane of the device. The thickness of each substrate, measured along axis z, can be very small compared to the lateral extensions of the device, i.e. compared to dimensions p and l of the device measured in the xy plane; p (measured along axis x) is, for example, between 10 μm and 10000 μm and <b>1</b> (measured along axis y) is, for example, between 10 μm and 10000 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0054">Substrate <b>100</b> can include a portion <b>10</b> made of a semiconducting material, whether monocrystalline or polycrystalline, for example made of silicon, or SiGe or SiC or SiGeC or GaAs or InAs or InP or Ge. As a variant, this substrate <b>100</b> may be a substrate of the “silicon on insulator” (SOI) type, including, as can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a substrate <b>10</b> made of a semiconducting material, a buried oxide layer <b>11</b> and a thin layer <b>12</b> of silicon. In this case, dielectric layer <b>101</b> and lower electrode <b>102</b> are formed respectively by buried oxide layer <b>11</b> and thin silicon layer <b>12</b>, which may possibly be doped. The advantage of this embodiment is notably the possibility, when the complete device has been produced, of being able to thin this substrate by the rear face, stopping at dielectric layer <b>11</b> and forming, by rear face <b>10</b>′, the interconnections of the means forming an electrical contact in dielectric layer <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0055">As another variant, substrate <b>100</b> may include several stacked layers, which each layer may, for example, be one or other of the materials mentioned above. The advantage of stacking several layers notably lies in the possibility of stacking several sensors, or a sensor and its associated electronics, in order to save space in the final component.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0056">Substrate <b>200</b> can be a semiconducting material, whether monocrystalline or polycrystalline, for example made of silicon, or SiGe or SiC or SiGeC or GaAs or InAs or InP or Ge.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0057">Substrate <b>300</b> (Cap) may be a CMOS substrate including, for example, another sensor, or a substrate <b>30</b> with only one upper electrode, or again a protective mechanical cap.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0058">In the remainder of the document, the lower portion or side of the device refers to the portion turned towards substrate <b>100</b>, and the upper portion or side of the device refers to the portion turned to the opposite side, towards substrate <b>300</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0059">A hermetic sealing bead <b>107</b> is produced between the 2 substrates <b>100</b>, <b>300</b>; it is, for example, a eutectic seal or a seal by thermocompression, using materials such as AlGe, AuSn, AuGe or AuSi. This bead <b>107</b> is of a thickness such that a space <b>107</b>′ is defined between the upper face of substrate <b>200</b> and upper electrode <b>302</b>. This space <b>107</b>′ allows a certain mobility of mobile mass <b>210</b>, in direction z, roughly perpendicular to the plane of the device. An example of a moving mass will be seen below, in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, which can also move in the plane of the device, i.e. in plane xy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0060">Substrates <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> are preferably connected by molecular bonding (for a good hermitic sealing) at the interface formed by oxide layer <b>103</b>. For this reason, each of these substrates are preferably in a semi-conductor material. Layer <b>103</b> is a sacrificial layer: a portion of this layer <b>103</b> is eliminated, so as to form a cavity <b>103</b>′ enabling moving mass <b>210</b> to be allowed freedom of movement in direction z, roughly perpendicular to the plane of the device. Moving mass <b>210</b> is positioned between cavity <b>103</b>′ and cavity <b>107</b>′.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0061">An oxide layer <b>101</b>, which acts as a support for an electrode <b>102</b>, is formed on first substrate <b>100</b>. This oxide layer <b>101</b> is therefore positioned between substrate <b>100</b> and electrodes layer <b>102</b>. It may or may not be structured. In the case of an SOI substrate (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), these layers are formed, respectively, by oxide layer <b>11</b> and layer <b>12</b> of semiconducting material, where the latter may be doped.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0062">Substrate <b>200</b> is structured so as to define moving mass <b>210</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0063"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> represents a simplified top view of substrate <b>200</b>, with an example of a moving mass structure <b>210</b>, also including means for detecting the movement of the moving mass in the plane of layer <b>200</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0064">The structure of this <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> represents a moving mass <b>210</b> fitted laterally with interdigitated electrostatic combs, some of which, <b>500</b>, <b>506</b>, are fixed, and others of which, <b>504</b>, <b>506</b>, are moving, where a moving comb, <b>504</b>, <b>506</b>, is interdigitated with a fixed comb, <b>500</b>, <b>502</b>. A variation of distance between a fixed comb and the moving comb opposite it results from the movement of the latter, which in turn results from a movement of moving mass <b>210</b>, leading to a variation of capacity detected by means provided for this purpose.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0065">Furthermore, moving mass <b>210</b> is free to move, for example essentially along axis Z. But the movement of the moving portion may also have a component in a direction roughly parallel to this axis Z, or again in the plane parallel to the main plane of the device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0066">It is this displacement which can be detected by lower electrodes <b>102</b> and upper electrodes <b>302</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0067">Electrode <b>302</b>, called the upper electrode, is positioned on the surface of substrate <b>300</b> turned towards moving mass <b>210</b>. The latter is thus facing each of electrodes <b>102</b>, <b>302</b> and a movement of the mass of <b>110</b> outside the plane of the device will be detected using these two capacitive detection electrodes. These two electrodes are positioned parallel to substrate <b>200</b> which contains moving mass <b>210</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0068">Upper electrode <b>302</b> and lower electrode <b>102</b> in particular allow the movement of moving mass <b>210</b> outside the plane of the layers to be detected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0069">This detection is preferentially of the capacitive type. However, in another embodiment, illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2K</figref>, the device may have only one electrode facing the moving portion, where the detection of the movement of the moving portion is obtained, in this case also, by a capacitive variation between the moving portion and the electrode. As a variant, this same device of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2K</figref> may be fitted with a cap <b>300</b>, without an upper electrode. Contacts <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> can be included, respectively between lower electrode <b>102</b> and substrate <b>100</b>, and/or between these electrodes and the surface of substrate <b>200</b>. In particular, contacts <b>106</b> enable an electrical connection to be established between lower electrodes <b>102</b> and upper electrodes <b>302</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0070">References <b>99</b>, <b>99</b>′ designate possible alignment marks, formed in rear face <b>100</b>′ of substrate <b>100</b>, which is the face which does not support layers <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>103</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0071">This structure is found in the other example embodiments presented below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0072">These aspects of the invention can apply for all the devices described in the remainder of the document.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0073"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2K</figref> illustrate a first example of a method to produce a device as described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0074">In this example method it is explained how a structural layer <b>200</b> of an MEMS made of thick monocrystalline silicon is formed, together with a lower capacitive electrode <b>102</b>, for detection outside the active zone of the MEMS, with a contact <b>104</b> of this lower electrode <b>102</b> in the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0075">One commences (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) with a substrate <b>100</b> which may consist of one of the materials previously mentioned above. If applicable, alignment marks <b>99</b>, <b>99</b>′ may be made in rear face <b>100</b>′ of this substrate, where this rear face is defined as the face opposite the one on which the various deposition operations are to be accomplished. The role of these alignment marks will be explained below. These alignment marks can also be made at a later stage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0076">On this substrate <b>100</b> an insulating layer <b>101</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>), for example made of silicon dioxide SiO2, or of another material with a low dielectric constant (for example, lower than 5), is deposited or made to grow. This insulating layer enables future lower electrode <b>102</b> of substrate <b>100</b> to be insulated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0077">As can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, this insulating layer can be structured (for example by chemical or plasma etching), in order subsequently to, for example, bring lower electrode <b>102</b> and substrate <b>100</b> into contact. One or more openings <b>101</b>′ are then formed in layer <b>101</b>, one or more of which may emerge in the surface of substrate <b>100</b> on which layer <b>101</b> has been deposited.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0078">A lower electrode layer <b>102</b>, made for example of polycrystalline silicon, or of doped amorphous silicon, or of polycrystalline or amorphous germanium, or more generally, in a semi-conductor material, possibly doped, or more generally of a conducting material, is then deposited on layer <b>101</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>). Another particular example is N or P doped polysilicon. Selecting a semi-conductor material for this layer <b>102</b> makes it possible to implement molecular bonding. This layer <b>102</b> is, for example, between 100 nm and 5 μm or 10 μm thick. A deposition technique can be chosen from one of the following techniques: LPCVD, PECVD, MBD, or others. If layer <b>101</b> has previously been structured the material constituting this electrode layer reaches, through openings <b>101</b>′, the surface of substrate <b>100</b>, thus forming a contact <b>104</b> with the latter. This contact <b>104</b> enables certain elements of the device to be earthed; rear face <b>100</b>′ of substrate <b>100</b> may also be earthed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0079">Layer <b>102</b> may possibly, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, be structured, by formation of a cavity <b>102</b>′, for example by etching, where this etching is stopped at insulating layer <b>101</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0080">This structuring of the lower electrode enables certain portions to be insulated from one another. If one has commenced with an SOI substrate (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), cavities <b>101</b>′ will have been obtained by etching of dielectric layer <b>11</b> from rear face <b>10</b>′. The next step is the deposition of an insulating layer <b>103</b>, the thickness of which will enable the distance separating electrode <b>102</b> from substrate <b>200</b> to be defined (and therefore the distance separating this electrode from future moving portion <b>210</b>), when the latter has been attached to first substrate <b>100</b>. This layer is, for example, made of an oxide such as silicon oxide (again, for example: TEOS oxide). It can also be of the order of several hundred nanometers thick, for example between 50 nm and 500 nm or 1 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0081">This insulating layer <b>103</b> can be deposited only on lower electrode <b>102</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref> or only on substrate <b>200</b>, or partly on lower electrode <b>102</b> and partly on substrate <b>200</b> (as can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref>, with layers <b>103</b> and <b>201</b>). Whichever possibility is chosen, this insulating layer will form a sacrificial layer which will be etched to release oscillating mass <b>210</b>, as explained below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0082">If layer <b>102</b> has been previously structured, the material of insulating layer <b>103</b> also fills portions <b>102</b>′ structured or etched in layer <b>102</b>, and comes into contact with the upper surface of insulating layer <b>101</b>. Certain portions of lower electrode <b>102</b> may be insulated by this insulating layer <b>103</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0083">A cavity <b>109</b> may possibly, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>, be etched in insulating layer <b>103</b> and in electrode layer <b>102</b>, the etching being stopped on insulating layer <b>101</b>. It is therefore possible to structure layer <b>103</b> and possibly layer <b>102</b>. Different portions of the lower electrode may be insulated from one another by these cavities <b>109</b> and/or by the presence, in this electrode layer, of zones of insulating material <b>103</b>, as explained above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0084">It is also possible, with a view to molecular-type bonding, to accomplish:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0085">a densification of this layer <b>103</b>, for example by oxidisation at a temperature close to the bonding temperature (for example 1050° C.), in order that all the layers have a thermal budget similar to that of the bonding (this stage notably allows the layers to be degassed). This step of densification enables the same density of layers <b>103</b> and <b>201</b> to be obtained, for improved bonding effectiveness, in order to have similar etching speeds in the final release (at a later stage both these sacrificial layers under the moving portion are etched),</li> <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0086">and/or polishing of layer <b>103</b>, which enables a very flat surface to be obtained for the molecular sealing.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0087">It is then possible to apply a direct bonding (or molecular bonding) of this substrate <b>100</b>, prepared in this manner, with a second substrate <b>200</b>, preferably made of thick monocrystalline silicon (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref>). It is then the surface of insulating layer <b>103</b> which comes into contact with substrate <b>200</b> or with a possible insulating layer <b>201</b> formed on this substrate <b>200</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0088">Whether or not layer <b>103</b> is structured (in other words: whether or not a cavity <b>109</b> is present) direct bonding of both substrates <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> can be accomplished.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0089">The process may be completed by a consolidation annealing of the bonding interface (typically at a temperature of 1000° C. to 1200° C. for several hours).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0090">Substrate <b>200</b> can then be thinned (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2I</figref>), from its surface opposite the one attached to substrate <b>100</b>, for example by a polishing technique.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0091">The moving portion of the MEMS is then defined in layer <b>200</b>′ (which results from the thinning of substrate <b>200</b>) by etching (for example, plasma etching) of layer <b>200</b>′, with stoppage at insulating layer <b>201</b>, <b>103</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2J</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0092">This step enables vertical channels <b>210</b> to be produced, which will define the contour of the moving portions of the MEMS.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0093">Lastly, a step of etching of sacrificial layers <b>201</b>, <b>103</b>, under layer <b>200</b>′ (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2K</figref>), enables the moving portion which has just been defined to be released. By this means, cavity <b>103</b>′ is formed between moving portion <b>210</b> and electrode <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0094">It is possible to stop the method at this stage, in which case no assembly with a substrate or cap <b>300</b> is accomplished, and therefore there is no 2<sup>nd </sup>electrode. But it is also possible to continue the manufacturing process with the formation of a bead <b>107</b> and assembly with a cap, as explained below, in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3C-3F</figref> (with or without contact <b>106</b>). If this cap includes an electrode <b>302</b>, a device with 2 electrodes can then be produced. The cap may be a protective mechanical cap, without any electrode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0095">A particular example of this method, which enables a direct bonding interface to be obtained, between SiO2 layer <b>103</b> and a SiO2 layer <b>201</b>, of satisfactory quality (i.e. the etching speed of which is not different from that of sacrificial layer), is as follows:

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0107">Indeed, after direct bonding and thinning of substrate <b>200</b>, new levels can be produced on layer <b>200</b>′, aligning them with the previous levels, obtained before the direct bonding.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0108">To overcome this difficulty the different levels generated on the front face of substrate <b>100</b> are aligned with these marks <b>99</b>, <b>99</b>′ in the rear face, using an optical reconnaissance system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0109">An example of such a device is represented schematically in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Rear face <b>100</b>′ of the substrate, on which marks <b>99</b>, <b>99</b>′ are made, is positioned on a “chuck” (or plate) <b>400</b> on the surface of which means forming an optical guide <b>401</b> are provided. These means essentially include optical means such as lenses <b>403</b>, <b>403</b>′, and mirrors <b>402</b>, <b>402</b>′; they will enable a beam <b>405</b> to be guided towards lower face <b>100</b>′ of the substrate, in order to read the positions of marks <b>99</b>. This device enables the precise positions of the marks generated in the rear face to be located, and therefore the other levels, in the front face, to be aligned relative to these marks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0110">Similarly, after bonding and thinning of substrate <b>200</b>, all the levels generated in the front face of layer <b>200</b>′ are aligned with these marks <b>99</b>, <b>99</b>′.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0111">Any number of substrates may be bonded and thinned, as substrate <b>200</b>, and all the levels generated on the front faces of these substrates can be aligned with marks <b>99</b>, <b>99</b>′ of the rear face of substrate <b>100</b>, or produced taking account of the positions of these marks, as explained above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0112">A description now follows, in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3F</figref>, as to how it is possible to establish a contact between lower <b>102</b> and upper <b>302</b> capacitive electrodes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0113">To this end, one commences with a substrate such as the one obtained on conclusion of the step described above in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2I</figref>. This substrate therefore includes at least one lower electrode <b>102</b>, one sacrificial layer <b>103</b> and one structural layer <b>200</b>′. It may also include one or more zones <b>101</b>′ of contact between electrode <b>102</b> and substrate <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0114">Lower electrode <b>102</b> may include one or more zones <b>102</b>′, <b>109</b> where portions of the electrode are insulated from one another.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0115">The position of one or more vias <b>106</b>′ is defined beforehand. These vias are then etched in structural layer <b>200</b>′ and insulating layer <b>103</b>, with lower electrode <b>102</b> then acting as the boundary layer. This etching is preferentially of the plasma type (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0116">After this, a layer of conducting material <b>106</b> is deposited on the surface, this layer being made, for example, of doped polysilicon, metal, or poly-Ge, etc. (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). This material also fills the cavities or via <b>106</b>′.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0117">This layer can also be either directly structured (and therefore deposited in vias <b>106</b>′, but not on the surface of substrate <b>200</b>′), or eliminated from the surface of substrate <b>200</b>′ by polishing and/or total etching without any resin mask, in which case the material present in via <b>106</b>′ is the only material which remains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0118">After this, (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>) a new layer of conducting material <b>107</b>, which can be of a nature different from the material of layer <b>106</b>, is deposited on layer <b>200</b>′, and then structured, for example by etching. This step enables the locations of the future weld beads to be defined with the cap of the device. At least one of these beads is placed in contact with material <b>106</b> used to fill at least one of vias <b>106</b>′. The thickness of these beads <b>107</b> will define the distance between the upper surface of moving portion <b>210</b> and upper electrode <b>302</b>. As a variant, it is possible to have all or a proportion of beads <b>107</b> formed beforehand on upper electrode <b>302</b>, and not on substrate <b>200</b>′.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0119">The steps of definition of moving structure <b>210</b> are then implemented, followed by those of etching of sacrificial layer <b>103</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3D and 3E</figref>), as previously described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0120">In addition, another substrate <b>300</b> has been prepared, called a cap, on a surface of which a layer <b>302</b> of conducting material has been deposited and structured. This layer <b>302</b> is made of a metal material or of a metal alloy such as, for example, AlCu, AuSn, AlSI or AuGe, etc. (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref>). Beads <b>107</b> may possibly be formed on this conducting layer <b>302</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0121">Both substrates are then sealed hermetically, for example by eutectic sealing or by thermocompression, in a vacuum or in a controlled atmosphere. Layer <b>302</b> can then come into contact with sealing bead <b>107</b>, so as to be positioned opposite moving portion <b>210</b>, which is then positioned between two electrodes <b>102</b>, <b>302</b>. Or again, if they are located on layer <b>302</b>, the beads are brought on to layer <b>200</b>′, one of them being positioned in contact with the material for filling via <b>106</b>′. The structure of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is then obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0122">Layer <b>302</b> then also has a hermetic sealing function, enabling a satisfactory level of vacuum to be obtained in the sealed cavity. By means of contacts <b>106</b> and bead <b>107</b> a contact between upper <b>302</b> and lower <b>102</b> electrodes is also made. The two substrates <b>100</b>, <b>300</b> are preferably sealed in a vacuum or controlled atmosphere, in order to keep the same level of vacuum in the cavity as in the enclosure in which the sealing is accomplished. The resonant frequency (and therefore the system's response) depends on the level of vacuum in the cavity, and the control of the atmosphere (i.e. of the pressure) in the latter enables this frequency to be set. In order to obtain a determined frequency, a determined pressure is set.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0123">The hermetic sealing also enables moving portion <b>210</b> of the device to be protected against the ambient atmosphere.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0124">The device is then ready to detect a movement of moving portion <b>210</b>, this movement taking place outside the plane of the device, i.e. essentially in direction z.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0125">But the movement of the moving portion may also have a component in a plane parallel to the device's main plane, and therefore perpendicular to Z.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0126">Detection is also accomplished by capacitive electrodes <b>102</b>, <b>302</b>. The signal obtained may be transmitted to data processing and data storage means, which are not represented in the figures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0127">In any of the above embodiments:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0012-0001" num="0128">the contacts with a view to measuring the voltages detected in the electrodes may be made through substrate <b>100</b> and/or through cap substrate <b>300</b>;</li> <li id="ul0012-0002" num="0129">and/or the upper electrode and/or the lower electrode may be etched such that they are not within the sealing zones.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0130">Cap substrate <b>300</b> may be, for example, a CMOS substrate. In this case, the last structured metal level (made, for example, of AlCu, or AlSi etc.) of this substrate may be used as an upper electrode <b>302</b> and as a hermetic sealing layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0131">The invention is not restricted to the production of MEMs components with capacitive electrodes; it may apply to any structure including only one buried lower electrode. The above method, with the formation of 2 electrodes <b>102</b>, <b>302</b>, can be modified and simplified in order to obtain a device with a single electrode. In this case material <b>302</b> need merely not be deposited on substrate <b>300</b>. If it is desired to make a hermetic seal (for example, for a mechanical protection of the device or a protection against ambient air), material <b>302</b> is deposited only above certain sealing beads <b>107</b> <i>a</i>, <b>107</b> <i>b</i>, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3G</figref>. A device with only one lower electrode may also detect a movement of the moving portion in axis z, but in a less sensitive manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0132">In a method or a device as disclosed above, molecular bonding makes it possible to hermetically seal the device, which allows a mobile structure to work in a controlled vacuum or a controlled atmosphere; it is the case in particular for a gyroscope. Molecular bonding involves a high thermal budget or a high temperature (for example between 900° C. and 1200° C.; typically 1100° C. for a SiO2-SiO2 bonding). The materials which are assembled are therefore preferably semi-conductor materials, which are compatible with such a high thermal budget or temperature; in particular the lower electrode is advantageously doped poly-Si.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0133">The invention may be applied to the production of inertial micro-system or nano-system components. This is in particular the case in the motor vehicle field, for the formation of accelerometers in airbags, or of gyroscopes for course correction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0134">It can also be applied to the production of ultrasound sensors, for medical diagnoses (probe for ultrasound scans). It notably allows the production of devices of the CMUT (Capacitive Micromachined Ultrasonic) type.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0135">It also allows the production of microphones, or again RF switches or pressure sensors, in the motor vehicle, aeronautical or aerospace fields.</div>
