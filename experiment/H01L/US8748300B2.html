<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic perspective view of a memory cell array in a semiconductor device <b>1</b> of an embodiment.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">The drain side select gate SGD and the source side select gate SGS are separated in the Y-direction. Note that, in the following description, the drain side select gate SGD and the source side select gate SGS may be simply denoted as a select gate SG without being distinguished from each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">A source line SL is provided on the source side select gate SGS. The source line SL is a metal layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">A plurality of bit lines BL are provided on the drain side select gate SGD and the source line SL. Each bit line BL extends in the Y-direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">A plurality of U-shaped memory holes MH are formed on the back gate BG and a stacked body on the back gate BG. In the electrode layers WL<b>1</b>D to WL<b>4</b>D and the drain side select gate SGD, there is formed a through hole penetrating them and extending in the Z-direction. In the electrode layers WL<b>1</b>S to WL<b>4</b>S and the source side select gate SGS, there is formed a through hole punching through them and extending in the Z-direction. The pair of holes extending in the Z-direction are connected via a depression <b>81</b> (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>) formed in the back gate BG to compose the U-shaped memory hole MH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">Channel bodies <b>20</b> and <b>51</b> are provided inside the memory hole MH in a U-shaped manner. The channel bodies <b>20</b> and <b>51</b> are silicon films, for example. A memory film <b>30</b> is provided between the channel body <b>20</b> and the inner wall of the memory hole MH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">A gate insulating film GD is provided between the drain side select gate SGD and the channel body <b>51</b>, and between the source side select gate SGS and the channel body <b>51</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">Note that, without being limited to the structure in which the entire memory hole MH is filled with the channel body in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the channel body may be formed so that a hollow part remains on the center axis side of the memory hole MH. Alternatively, there may be a structure having an insulator buried in the hollow part inside the channel body.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">A block film <b>31</b> as a first insulating film, a charge storage film <b>32</b>, and a tunnel film <b>33</b> as a second insulating film are provided, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in sequence from the electrode layer WL side, between each electrode layer WL and the channel body <b>20</b> in a memory cell transistor (simply referred to as a memory cell in the following). The block film <b>31</b> is in contact with the electrode layer WL, the tunnel film <b>33</b> is in contact with the channel body <b>20</b>, and the charge storage film <b>32</b> is provided between the block film <b>31</b> and the tunnel film <b>33</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">The channel body <b>20</b> functions as a channel in the memory cell transistor, the electrode layer WL functions as a control gate, and the charge storage film <b>32</b> functions as a data memory layer which accumulates electric charge injected from the channel body <b>20</b>. In other words, a memory cell having a structure with the control gate surrounding the periphery of the channel is formed at the intersection between the channel body <b>20</b> and each electrode layer WL.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">The semiconductor device <b>1</b> of an embodiment is a nonvolatile semiconductor memory device which can freely erase or write data electrically, and can hold the memory content even if the power is shut down.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">The memory cell is a charge-trapping memory cell, for example. The charge storage film <b>32</b>, having a large number of trap sites which capture electric charge, is a silicon nitride film, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">The tunnel film <b>33</b>, which is a silicon oxide film for example, serves as an electrical potential barrier when electric charge is injected from the channel body <b>20</b> to the charge storage film <b>32</b>, or electric charge accumulated on the charge storage film <b>32</b> diffuses to the channel body <b>20</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">The block film <b>31</b>, which is a silicon oxide film, for example, prevents electric charge accumulated on the charge storage film <b>32</b> from diffusing to the electrode layer WL.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">The drain side select gate SGD, the channel body <b>51</b>, and the gate insulating film GD therebetween compose a drain side select transistor STD.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">Note that, in the following description, the drain side select transistor STD and the source side select transistor STS may be simply denoted as a select transistor ST without being distinguished from each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">The back gate BG, the channel body <b>20</b> provided in the back gate BG, and the memory film <b>30</b> compose a back gate transistor BGT.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">A plurality of memory cells MC having the electrode layers WL<b>4</b>D to WL<b>1</b>D as the control gate are provided between the drain side select transistor STD and the back gate transistor BGT. Similarly, a plurality of memory cells MC having the electrode layers WL<b>1</b>S to WL<b>4</b>S as the control gate are provided also between the back gate transistor BGT and the source side select transistor STS.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">The plurality of memory cells MC, the drain side select transistor STS, the back gate transistor BGT, and the source side select transistor STS are connected in series through the channel bodies <b>20</b> and <b>51</b> to compose a single U-shaped memory string MS.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">A single memory string MS is buried in a pair of column-shaped parts CL extending in the stacking direction of the stacked body including a plurality of electrode layers WL and the back gate BG, and has a joint part JP which joins the lower end of the pair of the column-shaped parts CL. With a plurality of memory strings MS being arranged in the X- and Y-directions, a plurality of memory cells MC are provided in the X-, Y-, and Z-directions in a three-dimensional manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">The memory strings MS are provided in a memory cell array region in the substrate <b>10</b>. A peripheral circuit which controls the memory cell array is provided in the circumference, for example, of the memory cell array region in the substrate <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">Next, a method for manufacturing the semiconductor device <b>1</b> of an embodiment will be described, referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 5B</figref>. In the following description, a method for forming the memory cell array will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">The back gate BG is provided on the substrate <b>10</b> via an unshown insulating layer. The back gate BG is a silicon layer having an impurity such as boron doped therein, for example. A resist <b>94</b> is formed on the back gate BG, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. The resist <b>94</b> has an opening <b>94</b> <i>a </i>which has been patterned and selectively formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">Next, the back gate BG is selectively dry etched, with the resist <b>94</b> as a mask. Accordingly, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the depression <b>81</b> is formed on the back gate BG.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, a sacrifice film <b>82</b> is buried in the depression <b>81</b>. The sacrifice film <b>82</b> is, for example, a silicon nitride film, a non-doped silicon film or the like. Subsequently, the entire surface of the sacrifice film <b>82</b> is etched and, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>, the surface of the back gate BG between the depressions <b>81</b> is exposed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, after the insulating film <b>41</b> is formed on the back gate BG, a first stacked body including the electrode layers WL and the insulating layers <b>42</b> is formed thereon. The electrode layers WL and insulating layers <b>42</b> are alternately stacked on each other, so that the insulating layer <b>42</b> is interposed between the electrode layers WL. An insulating film <b>43</b> is formed on the uppermost electrode layer WL.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">Next, after the first stacked body is separated and a groove which reaches the insulating film <b>41</b> is formed by photolithography and etching, the groove is filled with an insulating film <b>45</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">After the groove is filled with the insulating film <b>45</b>, the insulating film <b>43</b> is exposed by overall etching. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, an insulating film <b>46</b> is formed on the insulating film <b>43</b>. Furthermore, a second stacked body including the select gate SG and an insulating layer <b>47</b> is formed on the insulating film <b>46</b>. The select gate SG is formed on the insulating film <b>46</b>, and the insulating layer <b>47</b> is formed on the select gate SG.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, a hole h is formed in the first and second stacked bodies on the back gate BG. The hole h is formed by Reactive Ion Etching (RIE), for example, using an unshown mask. The lower end of the hole h reaches the sacrifice film <b>82</b>, and thus the sacrifice film <b>82</b> is exposed at the bottom of the hole h. A pair of holes h are located on the single sacrifice film <b>82</b> so as to sandwich the insulating film <b>45</b> located substantially at the center of the sacrifice film <b>82</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">Next, the sacrifice film <b>82</b> is removed through the hole h by wet etching, for example. Alkaline solution such as KOH (potassium hydroxide) solution, or phosphoric acid solution (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) having an adjusted etching rate depending on temperature condition, for example, can be used as the etchant in this occasion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">Accordingly, the sacrifice film <b>82</b> is removed, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. Removal of the sacrifice film <b>82</b> causes the depression <b>81</b> to be formed in the back gate BG. Each one of the depressions <b>81</b>A has a pair of holes h connected thereto. In other words, the lower end of each one of the pair of holes h is connected to a common depression <b>81</b>, forming a single U-shaped memory hole MH.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">Subsequently, the memory film <b>30</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is formed on the inner wall of the memory hole MH in the first stacked body including the electrode layers WL. Furthermore, a silicon film is formed inside the memory film <b>30</b> in the memory hole MH as the channel body (first channel body) <b>20</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">On the other hand, processes of and subsequent to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> are performed on the second stacked body including the select gate SG as will be described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">In the semiconductor device <b>1</b> of the embodiment, the data erase operation is an operation of extracting electrons from the charge storage film <b>32</b> or injecting positive holes into the charge storage film <b>32</b>. A transistor composing the memory cell MC with the electrode layer WL as the control gate has a state in which the threshold voltage is relatively low (erase state) and a state in which the threshold voltage is relatively high (write state). The erase operation is an operation of setting the threshold voltage of the memory cell MC to the lower state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">In a memory having a general two-dimensional structure, electrons that have been written in the floating gate are extracted by raising the substrate potential. In a semiconductor device having a three-dimensional structure as in the embodiment, however, the channel of the memory cell is not directly connected to the substrate. Therefore a method for boosting the channel potential of the memory cell using Gate Induced Drain Leakage (GIDL) current that occurs in the channel at the select gate edge has been proposed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">In other words, a high electric field is generated in a depletion layer formed between the select gates SG and the diffusion region by applying high voltage to the diffusion region which is formed in the channel body <b>51</b> near the upper end of the select gate SG and has high-concentration impurity added thereto. Accordingly, the channel potential is raised by causing interband tunneling and supplying the generated positive holes to the channel bodies <b>51</b> and <b>20</b>. The potential difference between the channel body <b>20</b> and the electrode layer WL due to setting the potential of the electrode layer WL to the ground potential (0V), for example, causes extraction of electrons of the charge storage film <b>32</b>, or injection of positive holes into the charge storage film <b>32</b>, and thus the erase operation is performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">In order to raise the speed of such an erase operation, a diffusion region containing the high-concentration impurity is required in the channel body <b>51</b> near the upper end of the select gate SG.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">A method for forming the select transistor ST and the structure thereof in the embodiment will be described below, referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A to 9B</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">The process described below is performed after the memory hole MH shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> is formed. Note that, particularly in the memory hole MH, the portion penetrating the second stacked body including the select gate SG and the insulating layer <b>47</b> is defined as the hole h<b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> indicates a state in which the hole h<b>2</b> has been formed in the second stacked body.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">Subsequent to the formation of the hole h<b>2</b>, processing using dilute hydrofluoric acid, for example, is performed. The silicon oxide insulating layer <b>47</b> is etched in the process. In addition, the dilute hydrofluoric acid process performs both removal of the deposited material due to RIE when forming the hole h<b>2</b>, and pre-formation processing of the gate insulating film GD.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, etching causes the insulating layer <b>47</b> to retreat in the direction along which the side wall exposed at the hole h<b>2</b> moves away from the central axis of the hole h<b>2</b>. For example, the amount that the side wall of the insulating layer <b>47</b> retreats is about 5 (nm). Therefore, the hole diameter of the hole h<b>2</b> between the insulating layers <b>47</b> is larger than the hole diameter between the select gates SG. Accordingly, a step part <b>50</b> is formed between the side face of the select gate SG and the insulating layer <b>47</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067">Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, the gate insulating film GD is formed on the side wall of the hole h<b>2</b>. The gate insulating film GD covers the step part <b>50</b> along the step part <b>50</b>, also forming a step part on the gate insulating film GD. The gate insulating film GD is a silicon oxide film or a silicon nitride film formed by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068">Next, an amorphous silicon film which serves as a channel body (second channel body) <b>51</b> is formed inside the gate insulating film GD in the hole h<b>2</b> by the CVD method, for example. Subsequently, the amorphous silicon film is crystallized by a heat treatment to form a polycrystalline silicon film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">The channel body <b>51</b> is connected to the channel body <b>20</b> in the memory cell. The channel body <b>51</b> covers the step part <b>50</b> with the gate insulating film GD interposed therebetween, and thereby a step part is also formed on the channel body <b>51</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0070">Next, an impurity is implanted into the channel body <b>51</b> by ion implant. For example, arsenic (As) which is an n-type impurity is implanted with a dose amount not less than 5ร10<sup>14</sup>/cm<sup>2 </sup>and an acceleration voltage of 10 keV.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">In the channel body <b>51</b>, a portion covering the step part between the side face of the select gate SG and the insulating layer <b>47</b> is formed so as to follow the step part <b>50</b>, and protrudes toward the central axis of the hole h<b>2</b>. Accordingly, the efficiency of impurity injection into the portion covering the step part <b>50</b> becomes higher than into the side face of the channel body <b>51</b> formed on the side wall of the hole h<b>2</b> between the insulating layers <b>47</b>. Therefore, the portion covering the step part <b>50</b> in the channel body <b>51</b> contains impurity with a higher concentration than other parts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0072">After the implantation of impurity into the channel body <b>51</b>, a heat treatment (annealing) is performed in N<sub>2 </sub>gas atmosphere at 1000ยฐ C. for 10 seconds, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0073">Ion implant causes the density of arsenic in the portion covering the step part <b>50</b> in the channel body <b>51</b> to be higher than other parts, resulting in volume expansion of the step part <b>50</b>, and subsequent annealing causes further volume expansion. The volume of the channel body <b>51</b> after the ion implant and annealing expands by approximately two or three times, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0074">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the film thickness of a portion (volume expansion part) <b>51</b> <i>a </i>covering the step part <b>50</b> in the channel body <b>51</b> becomes thicker than the film thickness of the part provided between the insulating layers <b>47</b>. The volume expansion part <b>51</b> <i>a </i>of the channel body <b>51</b> blocks the hole h<b>2</b> near the step part <b>50</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0075">The film thickness when forming the film of the channel body <b>51</b> capable of blocking the hole h<b>2</b> with its volume expansion depends on the hole diameter of the hole h<b>2</b> and the film thickness of the gate insulating film GD. The smaller the hole diameter of the hole h<b>2</b>, the smaller the thickness of the channel body <b>51</b> capable of blocking the hole h<b>2</b> with its volume expansion becomes. The larger the film thickness of the gate insulating film GD, the smaller the film thickness of the channel body <b>51</b> capable of blocking the hole h<b>2</b> with its volume expansion becomes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0076">Note that, the type of ion implanted into the channel body <b>51</b> is not limited to arsenic and may be carbon (C) or phosphorus (P), where ion implant is notably performed with a dose amount not less than 5ร10<sup>14</sup>/cm<sup>2 </sup>in either case.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0077">Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, a semiconductor <b>53</b> containing an impurity is buried inside the channel body <b>51</b> above the portion blocked by the volume expansion part <b>51</b> <i>a </i>of the channel body <b>51</b>, i.e., above the select gate SG.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0078">For example, amorphous silicon having phosphorus doped therein with a dose amount not less than 1ร10<sup>20</sup>/cm<sup>2 </sup>is buried in the hole h<b>2</b> above the volume expansion region <b>51</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0079">After having removed the gate insulating film GD, the channel body <b>51</b>, and the semiconductor <b>53</b> on the top surface of the insulating layer <b>47</b> by RIE (Reactive Ion Etching), the semiconductor <b>53</b> is turned into polycrystalline silicon by a heat treatment. In other words, the semiconductor <b>53</b> turns into polycrystalline silicon having phosphorus doped therein as an impurity, for example. Subsequently, an interconnect WR is formed on the second stacked body to server as the bit line BL or the source line SL. The channel body <b>51</b> and the semiconductor <b>53</b> are electrically connected to the interconnect WR.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0080">The semiconductor <b>53</b> is in contact with the channel body <b>51</b> above the volume expansion part <b>51</b> <i>a </i>in the channel body <b>51</b>. The impurity (e.g., phosphorus) doped in the semiconductor <b>53</b> is diffused in the channel body <b>51</b> by applying a heat treatment after the burying of the semiconductor <b>53</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0081">The impurity concentration of the volume expansion part <b>51</b> <i>a </i>already having the impurity doped therein by the above-mentioned ion implant further rises due to diffusion of the impurity from the semiconductor <b>53</b>. The volume expansion part <b>51</b> <i>a </i>is provided in the portion covering the step part <b>50</b> between the side face of the select gate SG and the insulating layer <b>47</b>. In the embodiment, therefore, a diffusion region containing an impurity with a high concentration exists in the channel body <b>51</b> near the upper end of the select gate SG. As a result, the channel potential of the memory cell can be quickly boosted using the above-mentioned GIDL current, whereby the speed of erase operation can be increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0082">The impurity from the semiconductor <b>53</b> is also diffused in the channel body <b>51</b> formed on the side wall of the hole h<b>2</b> above the volume expansion part <b>51</b> <i>a</i>. As a result, the resistance of the upper part connected to the interconnect WR in the channel body <b>51</b> can be reduced, whereby the cell current at the read operation can be increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0083">The impurity concentration of the volume expansion part <b>51</b> <i>a </i>and the channel body <b>51</b> on the volume expansion part <b>51</b> <i>a </i>is, for example, 5ร10<sup>19</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>or more, and is higher than the impurity concentration of the channel body <b>51</b> lower than the volume expansion part <b>51</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0084">Note that, as a comparative example, a method is provided which, after the process of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, buries an insulating film (a silicon nitride film or a silicon oxide film) in the hole h<b>2</b>, performs a recess process that removes the insulating film as far as near the upper end of the select gate SG by etching, and buries an impurity-doped semiconductor in the portion where the insulating film has been removed. Also in this case, an impurity can be supplied on a channel body by diffusion of the impurity from the semiconductor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0085">However, a seam or void may easily occur in the insulating film at a location such as an interval between the select gates SG where the hole diameter is narrow, and thus their existence lowers the controllability of stopping etching of the insulating film near the upper end of the select gate SG. In other words, if etching of the insulating film reaches the seam or void, the seam or void may be expanded, which may result in formation of a relatively large gap or hollow in the insulating film between the select gates SG. Burying an impurity-doped semiconductor therein may result in the impurity-doped semiconductor getting in as far as the channel body of the select transistor and the memory cell, which may cause threshold lowering or breakdown voltage failure of the select transistor and the memory cell.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0086">On the contrary, in the embodiment as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the hole h<b>2</b> is blocked near the upper end of the select gate SG by volume expansion of the channel body <b>51</b>. Accordingly, the impurity-doped semiconductor <b>53</b> can be formed near the upper end of the select gate SG with a good position controllability, without getting into the channel body of the select gate SG and the channel body of the memory cell transistor located further below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0087">As a result, breakdown voltage failure of the gate insulating film GD caused by exposing the gate insulating film GD between the select gates SG to high-concentration impurity, and threshold lowering caused by supplying high-concentration impurity to the channel body of the select transistor and the memory cell transistor can be prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0088">Next, another method for forming the select transistor ST and its structure will be described, referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A to 8C</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0089">After the processes up to that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref> have been performed as with the specific examples mentioned above, impurity such as arsenic, phosphorus, carbon, for example, is implanted into the channel body <b>51</b> by ion implant. Annealing is then performed subsequent to the implantation of impurity into the channel body <b>51</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0090">In the channel body <b>51</b>, the portion covering the step part <b>50</b> between the side face of the select gate SG and the insulating layer <b>47</b> is formed so as to follow the step part <b>50</b>, and protrudes toward the central axis of the hole h<b>2</b>. Accordingly, the efficiency of impurity implantation into the portion covering the step part <b>50</b> becomes higher than into the side face of the channel body <b>51</b> formed on the side wall of the hole h<b>2</b> between the insulating layers <b>47</b>. Therefore, the portion covering the step part <b>50</b> in the channel body <b>51</b> contains an impurity with a higher concentration than other parts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0091">The portion covering the step part <b>50</b> in the channel body <b>51</b> has a higher impurity density than other parts due to ion implant, which results in an expanded volume, and subsequent annealing causes further volume expansion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0092">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the film thickness of the portion (volume expansion part) <b>51</b> <i>a </i>covering the step part <b>50</b> becomes thicker than the film thickness of the portion provided between the insulating layers <b>47</b> in the channel body <b>51</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0093">Note that in the specific example, the above-mentioned annealing is performed at a low temperature in comparison with the embodiment initially shown. Accordingly, the volume expansion part <b>51</b> <i>a </i>of the channel body <b>51</b> does not exhibit as much volume expansion as necessary to block the hole h<b>2</b>. Therefore, a hollow or gap exists on the central axis side of the hole h<b>2</b> inside the volume expansion part <b>51</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0094">The radial direction size W of the hollow depends on the hole diameter of the hole h<b>2</b>, the film thickness of the gate insulating film GD, and the film thickness of the channel body <b>51</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0095">The impurity implanted by ion implant can be suppressed from diffusing in the channel body <b>51</b> between the select gates SG, by suppressing the temperature of the above-mentioned annealing so that the volume expansion part <b>51</b> <i>a </i>does not exhibit as much volume expansion as necessary to block the hole h<b>2</b>. Accordingly, off leak current Ioff can be suppressed by enhancing the cut-off characteristic of the select transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0096">Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, an insulating film <b>55</b> is formed inside the channel body <b>51</b> in the hole h<b>2</b>. The insulating film <b>55</b> is a silicon oxide film or a silicon nitride film formed by Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD), for example. The insulating film <b>55</b> is buried in a hollow inside the volume expansion part <b>51</b> <i>a </i>in the hole h<b>2</b>, and blocks the hollow inside the volume expansion part <b>51</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0097">For example, if the radial direction size W (nm) of the hollow between the volume expansion parts <b>51</b> <i>a </i>in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> is 3 (nm)&lt;W&lt;10 (nm), the hollow can be blocked by making the film thickness of the insulating film <b>55</b> not less than 5 (nm).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0098">Since the ALD method exhibits good coverage characteristics for thin films, and the hole diameter of the hole h<b>2</b> between the insulating layers <b>47</b> is wider than the hole diameter of the hole h<b>2</b> between the select gates SG, the hole h<b>2</b> between the insulating layers <b>47</b> is not filled with the insulating film <b>55</b> <i>a </i>and the hollow remains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0099">In addition, the insulating film <b>55</b> is also formed inside the channel body <b>51</b> between the select gates SG below the blocked part, with a hollow slightly remaining inside the insulating film <b>55</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0100">Next, isotropic etching is performed on the insulating film <b>55</b> so as to selectively remove the insulating film <b>55</b> exposed at the side wall of the hole h<b>2</b> between the insulating layers <b>47</b>, while performing as little etching as possible on the insulating film <b>55</b> buried between the volume expansion parts <b>51</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0101">For example, if there is a seam in the insulating film <b>55</b> when removing the insulating film <b>55</b> by wet etching using dilute hydrofluoric acid, the etching rate becomes fast at the part of the seam, and thus over etching in the depth direction of the insulating film <b>55</b> blocking the interval between the volume expansion regions <b>51</b> <i>a </i>is concerned.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0102">In other words, there is a concern that, if the seam of the insulating film <b>55</b> is expanded by wet etching and overly etched in the depth direction, the impurity-doped semiconductor <b>53</b> formed in the subsequent process gets in as far as the channel body <b>51</b> between the select gates SG, which may lead to drop of the threshold value of the select transistor and disabled cut-off.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0103">For example, the insulating film <b>55</b> can be selectively etched with a good controllability by forming NH<sub>4</sub>F in a thermochemical reaction using annealing after having formed a thin film containing NF<sub>3 </sub>and NH<sub>3 </sub>on the insulating film <b>55</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0104">Accordingly, the insulating film <b>55</b> still remains inside the channel body <b>51</b> between the volume expansion parts <b>51</b> <i>a </i>and between the select gates SG, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, after having removed the insulating film <b>55</b> on the side wall of the hole h<b>2</b> between the insulating layers <b>47</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0105">As a result, the impurity-doped semiconductor <b>53</b> does not contact the channel body <b>51</b> between the select gates SG, the threshold value of the select transistor does not drop, and therefore the off leak current of a transistor is not increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0106">After having removed the insulating film <b>55</b> on the side wall of the hole h<b>2</b> between the insulating layers <b>47</b>, the impurity-doped semiconductor <b>53</b> is buried, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, inside the channel body <b>51</b> above the portion where the insulating film <b>55</b> blocks the hole h<b>2</b>, i.e., in the hole h<b>2</b> above the select gate SG.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0107">The semiconductor <b>53</b> is in contact with the channel body <b>51</b> above the portion blocked by the insulating film <b>55</b>. The impurity (e.g., phosphorus) doped in the semiconductor <b>53</b> is diffused in the channel body <b>51</b> by applying a heat treatment after the burying of the semiconductor <b>53</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0108">The impurity concentration of the volume expansion part <b>51</b> <i>a </i>already having the impurity doped therein by the above-mentioned ion injection further rises due to diffusion of the impurity from the semiconductor <b>53</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0111">Furthermore, the hole h<b>2</b> is blocked near the upper end of the select gate SG by volume expansion of the channel body <b>51</b> and the insulating film <b>55</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0113">In addition, since the insulating film <b>55</b> covers inside the channel body <b>51</b> of the select transistor and the channel body <b>20</b> of the memory cell transistor located further below, the channel bodies <b>51</b> and <b>20</b> can be protected from, for example, dilute hydrofluoric acid used in preprocessing before forming the impurity-doped semiconductor <b>53</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0114">Next, still another method for forming the select transistor ST and its structure will be described, referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0122">The insulating film <b>56</b> is formed by a film forming method which exhibits relatively low coverage characteristics.
