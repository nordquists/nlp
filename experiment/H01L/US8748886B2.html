<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device and a method for manufacturing the semiconductor device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">In this specification, a semiconductor device generally means a device which can function by utilizing semiconductor characteristics, and an electro-optic device, a semiconductor circuit, and an electronic device are all semiconductor devices.</div>

<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">An improvement in on-state characteristics (e.g., on-state current and field-effect mobility) of a transistor leads to high-speed response to an input signal and high-speed drive of a semiconductor device; thus, a semiconductor device with higher performance can be achieved. On the other hand, sufficiently low off-state current is needed to reduce power consumption of a semiconductor device. That is, required electric characteristics of a transistor vary with uses and purposes of the transistor, and it is profitable to control the electric characteristics more accurately.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">An object of one embodiment of the present invention is to provide a structure of a transistor in which an oxide semiconductor is used for a channel formation region and the threshold voltage, which is one of electric characteristics of a transistor, can be positive, and to provide a manufacturing method thereof, in order to achieve a so-called normally-off switching element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">In a transistor, it is preferable that a channel be formed at positive gate threshold voltage which is as close to 0 V as possible. If the threshold voltage of the transistor is negative, the transistor tends to be in a so-called normally-on state, in which current flows between the source electrode and the drain electrode even when the gate voltage is 0 V. For an LSI, a CPU, or a memory, electric characteristics of a transistor included in a circuit are important, and the power consumption of the semiconductor device depends on the electric characteristics. In particular, of the electric characteristics of the transistor, the threshold voltage (Vth) is important. If the threshold voltage is negative even when the field-effect mobility is high, it is difficult to control the circuit. Such a transistor in which a channel is formed even at negative voltage so that drain current flows is not suitable as a transistor used in an integrated circuit of a semiconductor device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">Further, it is important to achieve the characteristics of a transistor close to the normally-off characteristics even when the transistor is not a normally-off transistor depending on the material or the manufacturing condition. Another object of one embodiment of the present invention is to provide a structure for achieving the threshold voltage of a transistor close to zero even when the threshold voltage is negative, that is, even when the transistor is a so-called normally-on transistor, and to provide a manufacturing method thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">Another object of one embodiment of the present invention is to provide a structure of a semiconductor device which achieves high-speed response and high-speed drive by improving on-state characteristics (e.g., on-state current and field-effect mobility) of a transistor, and to provide a manufacturing method thereof, in order to achieve a semiconductor device with higher performance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">As described above, an object of one embodiment of the present invention is to provide a transistor which is formed using an oxide semiconductor layer and has electric characteristics needed for the intended use, and to provide a semiconductor device including the transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">In a transistor in which a source electrode layer and a drain electrode layer, a semiconductor layer, a gate insulating film, and a gate electrode layer are stacked in this order, an oxide semiconductor layer in which at least two oxide semiconductor layers with different energy gaps are stacked (hereinafter such an oxide semiconductor layer is also referred to as an oxide semiconductor stack) is used as the semiconductor layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">For example, the transistor is formed using an oxide semiconductor stack including a first oxide semiconductor layer in contact with the source electrode layer and the drain electrode layer and a second oxide semiconductor layer which is provided over the first oxide semiconductor layer and has an energy gap different from that of the first oxide semiconductor layer. Here, there is no limitation on the stacking order of the first oxide semiconductor layer and the second oxide semiconductor layer as long as their energy gaps are different from each other. Specifically, the energy gap of one of the oxide semiconductor layers may be 3 eV or larger, and the energy gap of the other oxide semiconductor layer may be smaller than 3 eV.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">Note that in this specification and the like, the term “energy gap” is used to mean the terms “band gap” and “forbidden band gap”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">Further, the oxide semiconductor stack may include three or more oxide semiconductor layers. In the case where the oxide semiconductor stack includes three or more oxide semiconductor layers, all the oxide semiconductor layers may have energy gaps different from each other, or some of the oxide semiconductor layers in the oxide semiconductor stack may have energy gaps equivalent to each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">For example, an oxide semiconductor stack can include a first oxide semiconductor layer in contact with a source electrode layer and a drain electrode layer; a second oxide semiconductor layer which is provided over the first oxide semiconductor layer and has a higher electron affinity than the first oxide semiconductor layer or a smaller energy gap than the first oxide semiconductor layer; and a third oxide semiconductor layer which is provided over the second oxide semiconductor layer. Note that the electron affinity and energy gap of the third oxide semiconductor layer are preferably equivalent to the electron affinity and energy gap of the first oxide semiconductor layer. Here, the electron affinity means an energy gap between a vacuum level and a bottom of a conduction band of an oxide semiconductor. With the structure in which the second oxide semiconductor layer with a small energy gap is sandwiched between the first oxide semiconductor layer and the third oxide semiconductor layer with large energy gaps, the off-state current (leakage current) of the transistor can be further reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">Specifically, the energy gaps of the first oxide semiconductor layer and the third oxide semiconductor layer are each 3 eV or larger, and the energy gap of the second oxide semiconductor layer is smaller than 3 eV. In a transistor formed using an oxide semiconductor layer, the energy gap of the oxide semiconductor layer affects electric characteristics of the transistor. For example, the smaller the energy gap of an oxide semiconductor layer used in a transistor is, the higher on-state characteristics (e.g., on-state current and field-effect mobility) can be. On the other hand, the larger the energy gap of the oxide semiconductor layer is, the smaller off-state current can be.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">In the case of a single oxide semiconductor layer, electric characteristics of a transistor are almost determined by the energy gap of the oxide semiconductor layer; thus, it is difficult for the transistor to have desired electric characteristics. However, in a transistor according to one embodiment of the present invention, an oxide semiconductor stack including a plurality of oxide semiconductor layers with different energy gaps is used, whereby electric characteristics of the transistor can be more accurately controlled and desired electric characteristics can be given to the transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">Therefore, a semiconductor device which meets various purposes such as high performance, high reliability, and low power consumption can be provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">One embodiment of the present invention is a semiconductor device including a source electrode layer and a drain electrode layer formed over an insulating surface, an oxide semiconductor stack provided over the source electrode layer and the drain electrode layer, a gate insulating film provided over the oxide semiconductor stack, and a gate electrode layer overlapping with the oxide semiconductor stack with the gate insulating film positioned therebetween. The oxide semiconductor stack includes a first oxide semiconductor layer and a second oxide semiconductor layer having an energy gap different from that of the first oxide semiconductor layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">Another embodiment of the present invention is a semiconductor device including a source electrode layer and a drain electrode layer formed over an insulating surface, an oxide semiconductor stack provided over the source electrode layer and the drain electrode layer, a gate insulating film provided over the oxide semiconductor stack, and a gate electrode layer overlapping with the oxide semiconductor stack with the gate insulating film positioned therebetween. The oxide semiconductor stack includes a first oxide semiconductor layer, a second oxide semiconductor layer that is in contact with the first oxide semiconductor layer and has a smaller energy gap than the first oxide semiconductor layer, and a third oxide semiconductor layer that is in contact with the second oxide semiconductor layer and has a larger energy gap than the second oxide semiconductor layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">In the above semiconductor device, the third oxide semiconductor layer may be provided over the second oxide semiconductor layer so as to cover a side surface of the first oxide semiconductor layer and a side surface of the second oxide semiconductor layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">In any of the above semiconductor devices, a region which is in the oxide semiconductor stack and does not overlap with the gate electrode layer preferably contains a dopant. In such a structure, the oxide semiconductor stack has a channel formation region which overlaps with the gate electrode layer with the gate insulating film positioned therebetween, and a pair of low-resistance regions between which the channel formation region is sandwiched in the channel length direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">With the oxide semiconductor layer including the low-resistance regions between which the channel formation region is sandwiched in the channel length direction, on-state characteristics (e.g., on-state current and field-effect mobility) of the transistor are improved, which enables high-speed operation and high-speed response of the transistor. Further, the low-resistance regions are formed in a self-aligned manner and do not overlap with the gate electrode layer; thus parasitic capacitance can be reduced. The reduction in parasitic capacitance leads to a reduction in the power consumption of the whole semiconductor device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">The concentration of the dopant in the low-resistance regions is preferably higher than or equal to 5×10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>and lower than or equal to 1×10<sup>22</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>.</div>

<heading>Embodiment 1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">In this embodiment, one embodiment of a semiconductor device and one embodiment of a method for manufacturing the semiconductor device are described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2D</figref>. In this embodiment, a transistor including an oxide semiconductor stack is described as an example of the semiconductor device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">A transistor <b>510</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref> is an example of a top-gate transistor. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a plan view, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along chain line X-Y in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along chain line V-W in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, which is a cross-sectional view in the channel length direction, the transistor <b>510</b> includes, over a substrate <b>400</b> which has an insulating surface and is provided with an oxide insulating film <b>436</b>, a source electrode layer <b>405</b> <i>a</i>, a drain electrode layer <b>405</b> <i>b</i>, an oxide semiconductor stack <b>403</b> which is provided over the source electrode layer <b>405</b> <i>a </i>and the drain electrode layer <b>405</b> <i>b </i>and includes a first oxide semiconductor layer <b>101</b> and a second oxide semiconductor layer <b>102</b>, a gate insulating film <b>402</b>, and a gate electrode layer <b>401</b>. An insulating film <b>407</b> is formed over the transistor <b>510</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">Note that in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 1C</figref>, an interface between the oxide semiconductor layers included in the oxide semiconductor stack <b>403</b> is schematically illustrated by a dotted line. The dotted line schematically indicates the interface between the oxide semiconductor layers included in the oxide semiconductor stack, which is unclear (indistinct); the same applies to other drawings in this specification. Note that when the interface is unclear, a continuous boundary cannot be observed between the oxide semiconductor layers in a cross-sectional observation image (TEM image) of the oxide semiconductor stack, which is taken using a transmission electron microscope (TEM).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">In the oxide semiconductor stack <b>403</b>, the stacking order of the first oxide semiconductor layer <b>101</b> and the second oxide semiconductor layer <b>102</b> is not limited by the magnitude of their energy gaps as long as the energy gaps are different from each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">Specifically, in the oxide semiconductor stack <b>403</b>, the energy gap of one of the oxide semiconductor layers is 3 eV or larger, and the energy gap of the other oxide semiconductor layer is smaller than 3 eV. As an oxide semiconductor with an energy gap of 3 eV or larger, for example, an In—Ga—Zn-based oxide semiconductor (energy gap: 3.0 eV to 3.4 eV, typically 3.2 eV) can be used. As an oxide semiconductor with an energy gap smaller than 3 eV, for example, an In—Sn—Zn-based oxide semiconductor (energy gap: 2.6 eV to 2.9 eV, typically 2.8 eV) can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2D</figref> illustrate an example of a method for manufacturing the transistor <b>510</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">First, the oxide insulating film <b>436</b> is formed over the substrate <b>400</b> having an insulating surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">There is no particular limitation on a substrate that can be used as the substrate <b>400</b> having an insulating surface as long as it has heat resistance high enough to withstand heat treatment performed later. For example, a glass substrate of barium borosilicate glass, aluminoborosilicate glass, or the like; a ceramic substrate; a quartz substrate; or a sapphire substrate can be used. A single crystal semiconductor substrate or a polycrystalline semiconductor substrate of silicon, silicon carbide, or the like; a compound semiconductor substrate of silicon germanium or the like; an SOI substrate; or the like can be used as the substrate <b>400</b>, or any of these substrates provided with a semiconductor element may be used as the substrate <b>400</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067">The semiconductor device may be manufactured using a flexible substrate as the substrate <b>400</b>. In order to manufacture a flexible semiconductor device, the transistor including the oxide semiconductor stack may be directly formed over a flexible substrate. Alternatively, the transistor including the oxide semiconductor stack may be formed over a manufacturing substrate, and then the transistor may be separated and transferred to a flexible substrate. Note that in order to separate the transistor including the oxide semiconductor stack from the manufacturing substrate and transfer it to the flexible substrate, a separation layer may be provided between the manufacturing substrate and the transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068">The oxide insulating film <b>436</b> can be formed by a plasma CVD method, a sputtering method, or the like using silicon oxide, silicon oxynitride, aluminum oxide, aluminum oxynitride, hafnium oxide, gallium oxide, silicon nitride oxide, aluminum nitride oxide, or a mixed material of any of these materials. A silicon oxide film formed by a sputtering method is used as the oxide insulating film <b>436</b> in this embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">The oxide insulating film <b>436</b> may be a single layer or a stack of layers. For example, a silicon oxide film, an In—Hf—Zn-based oxide film may be sequentially stacked over the substrate <b>400</b>. Alternatively, a silicon oxide film, an In—Zr—Zn-based oxide film with an atomic ratio of In:Zr:Zn=1:1:1 may be sequentially stacked over the substrate <b>400</b>. Further alternatively, a silicon oxide film, an In—Gd—Zn-based oxide film with an atomic ratio of In:Gd:Zn=1:1:1 may be sequentially stacked over the substrate <b>400</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0070">In the transistor <b>510</b>, the oxide insulating film <b>436</b> is in contact with the lowermost layer of the oxide semiconductor stack <b>403</b>, and thus (the bulk of) the oxide insulating film <b>436</b> preferably contains oxygen at least in excess of the stoichiometric ratio. For example, in the case where a silicon oxide film is used as the oxide insulating film <b>436</b>, the composition formula is SiO<sub>2+α</sub> (α&gt;0). By using such a film as the oxide insulating film <b>436</b>, oxygen can be supplied to the oxide semiconductor stack formed over the oxide insulating film <b>436</b>, leading to favorable characteristics. By supply of oxygen to the oxide semiconductor stack, an oxygen vacancy therein can be filled.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">Next, a conductive film which is to be a source electrode layer and a drain electrode layer (including a wiring formed in the same layer as the source electrode layer and the drain electrode layer) is formed over the oxide insulating film <b>436</b> and is selectively etched, so that the source electrode layer <b>405</b> <i>a </i>and the drain electrode layer <b>405</b> <i>b </i>are formed. The conductive film used for the source electrode layer <b>405</b> <i>a </i>and the drain electrode layer <b>405</b> <i>b </i>is formed using a material that can withstand heat treatment performed later; for example, a metal film containing an element selected from Al, Cr, Cu, Ta, Ti, Mo, and W, or a metal nitride film containing any of the above elements as a component (titanium nitride film, molybdenum nitride film, or tungsten nitride film) can be used. Alternatively, a film of a high-melting-point metal such as Ti, Mo, or W or a metal nitride film of any of these elements (titanium nitride film, molybdenum nitride film, or tungsten nitride film) may be stacked on one or both of a bottom side and a top side of a metal film of Al, Cu, or the like. Further alternatively, the conductive film used for the source electrode layer <b>405</b> <i>a </i>and the drain electrode layer <b>405</b> <i>b </i>may be formed using a conductive metal oxide. As the conductive metal oxide, indium oxide (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), tin oxide (SnO<sub>2</sub>), zinc oxide (ZnO), indium oxide-tin oxide (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>—SnO<sub>2</sub>, abbreviated to ITO), indium oxide-zinc oxide (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>—ZnO), or any of these metal oxide materials containing silicon oxide can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0072">In this embodiment, a 10-nm-thick tungsten film is formed as the source electrode layer <b>405</b> <i>a </i>and the drain electrode layer <b>405</b> <i>b</i>. Such a small thickness of the source electrode layer <b>405</b> <i>a </i>and the drain electrode layer <b>405</b> <i>b </i>leads to favorable coverage with the oxide semiconductor stack <b>403</b> formed thereover.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0073">Next, a first oxide semiconductor film <b>191</b> and a second oxide semiconductor film <b>192</b> which are to be the first oxide semiconductor layer <b>101</b> and the second oxide semiconductor layer <b>102</b>, respectively, are formed over the source electrode layer <b>405</b> <i>a </i>and the drain electrode layer <b>405</b> <i>b </i>(see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0074">The first oxide semiconductor film <b>191</b> and the second oxide semiconductor film <b>192</b> are oxide semiconductor films with energy gaps different from each other.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0075">In the steps of forming the first oxide semiconductor film <b>191</b> and the second oxide semiconductor film <b>192</b>, in order to prevent hydrogen and moisture from being contained in the oxide semiconductor films as much as possible, it is preferable that the substrate over which the oxide insulating film <b>436</b>, the source electrode layer <b>405</b> <i>a</i>, and the drain electrode layer <b>405</b> <i>b </i>are formed be preheated in a preheating chamber of a sputtering apparatus as pretreatment for film formation so that impurities such as hydrogen and moisture adsorbed onto the substrate, the oxide insulating film <b>436</b>, and the like are desorbed and eliminated.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0078">As the oxide semiconductor, for example, indium oxide, tin oxide, zinc oxide, a two-component metal oxide such as an I—Zn-based oxide, a Sn—Zn-based oxide, an Al—Zn-based oxide, a Zn—Mg-based oxide, a Sn—Mg-based oxide, an In—Mg-based oxide, or an In—Ga-based oxide, a three-component metal oxide such as an In—Ga—Zn-based oxide, an In—Al—Zn-based oxide, an In—Sn—Zn-based oxide, a Sn—Ga—Zn-based oxide, an Al—Ga—Zn-based oxide, a Sn—Al—Zn-based oxide, an In—Hf—Zn-based oxide, an In—La—Zn-based oxide, an In—Ce—Zn-based oxide, an In—Pr—Zn-based oxide, an In—Nd—Zn-based oxide, an In—Sm—Zn-based oxide, an In—Eu—Zn-based oxide, an In—Gd—Zn-based oxide, an In—Tb—Zn-based oxide, an In—Dy—Zn-based oxide, an In—Ho—Zn-based oxide, an In—Er—Zn-based oxide, an In—Tm—Zn-based oxide, an In—Yb—Zn-based oxide, or an In—Lu—Zn-based oxide, or a four-component metal oxide such as an In—Sn—Ga—Zn-based oxide, an In—Hf—Ga—Zn-based oxide, an In—Al—Ga—Zn-based oxide, an In—Sn—Al—Zn-based oxide, an In—Sn—Hf—Zn-based oxide, or an In—Hf—Al—Zn-based oxide can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0079">The oxide semiconductor may be either single crystal or non-single-crystal. In the latter case, the oxide semiconductor may be either amorphous or polycrystalline. Further, the oxide semiconductor may have either an amorphous structure including a portion having crystallinity or a non-amorphous structure. Note that in some cases, the energy gaps differ between single crystal and non-single-crystal even when the same material is used. Thus, it is important to select the material based on the energy gap as appropriate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0080">Further, for the oxide semiconductor stack, an oxide semiconductor film including a crystal and having crystallinity (crystalline oxide semiconductor film) can be used. The crystals in the crystalline oxide semiconductor film may have crystal axes oriented in random directions or in a certain direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0081">For example, as the crystalline oxide semiconductor film, a c-axis aligned crystalline oxide semiconductor (CAAC-OS) film can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0082">The CAAC-OS film is not completely single crystal nor completely amorphous. The CAAC-OS film is an oxide semiconductor film with a crystal-amorphous mixed phase structure where crystal parts and amorphous parts are included. Note that in most cases, the crystal part fits inside a cube whose one side is less than 100 nm. From an observation image obtained with a TEM, a boundary between an amorphous part and a crystal part in the CAAC-OS film is not clear. Further, with the TEM, a grain boundary in the CAAC-OS film is not found. Thus, a reduction in electron mobility due to the grain boundary is suppressed in the CAAC-OS film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0083">In each of the crystal parts included in the CAAC-OS film, a c-axis is aligned in a direction parallel to a normal vector of a surface where the CAAC-OS film is formed or a normal vector of a surface of the CAAC-OS film, triangular or hexagonal atomic arrangement which is seen from the direction perpendicular to an a-b plane is formed, and metal atoms are arranged in a layered manner or metal atoms and oxygen atoms are arranged in a layered manner when seen from the direction perpendicular to the c-axis. Note that among crystal parts, the directions of an a-axis and a b-axis of one crystal part may be different from those of another crystal part. In this specification, a simple term “perpendicular” includes a range from 85° to 95°. In addition, a simple term “parallel” includes a range from −5° to 5°.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0084">In the CAAC-OS film, distribution of crystal parts is not necessarily uniform. For example, in the formation process of the CAAC-OS film, in the case where crystal growth occurs from a surface side of the oxide semiconductor film, the proportion of crystal parts in the vicinity of the surface of the oxide semiconductor film is higher than that in the vicinity of the surface where the oxide semiconductor film is formed in some cases. Further, when an impurity is added to the CAAC-OS film, the crystal part in a region to which the impurity is added becomes amorphous in some cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0085">Since the c-axes of the crystal parts included in the CAAC-OS film are aligned in the direction parallel to a normal vector of a surface where the CAAC-OS film is formed or a normal vector of a surface of the CAAC-OS film, the directions of the c-axes may be different from each other depending on the shape of the CAAC-OS film (the cross-sectional shape of the surface where the CAAC-OS film is formed or the cross-sectional shape of the surface of the CAAC-OS film). Note that when the CAAC-OS film is formed, the direction of the c-axis of the crystal part is the direction parallel to a normal vector of the surface where the CAAC-OS film is formed or a normal vector of the surface of the CAAC-OS film. The crystal part is formed by film formation or by performing treatment for crystallization such as heat treatment after film formation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0086">In a transistor including the CAAC-OS film, a change in electric characteristics due to irradiation with visible light or ultraviolet light can be suppressed; therefore, a semiconductor device including the transistor can have high reliability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0087">For example, the CAAC-OS film is formed by a sputtering method with a polycrystalline oxide semiconductor sputtering target. When ions collide with the sputtering target, a crystal region included in the sputtering target may be separated from the target along an a-b plane; in other words, a sputtered particle having a plane parallel to an a-b plane (flat-plate-like sputtered particle or pellet-like sputtered particle) may flake off from the sputtering target. In that case, the flat-plate-like sputtered particle reaches a substrate while maintaining their crystal state, whereby the CAAC-OS film can be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0088">For the deposition of the CAAC-OS film, the following conditions are preferably used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0089">By reducing the amount of impurities entering the CAAC-OS film during the deposition, the crystal state can be prevented from being broken by the impurities. For example, the concentration of impurities (e.g., hydrogen, water, carbon dioxide, or nitrogen) which exist in the deposition chamber may be reduced. Furthermore, the concentration of impurities in a deposition gas may be reduced. Specifically, a deposition gas whose dew point is −80° C. or lower, preferably −100° C. or lower is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0090">By increasing the substrate heating temperature during the deposition, migration of a sputtered particle is likely to occur after the sputtered particle reaches a substrate surface. Specifically, the substrate heating temperature during the deposition is higher than or equal to 100° C. and lower than or equal to 740° C., preferably higher than or equal to 200° C. and lower than or equal to 500° C. By increasing the substrate heating temperature during the deposition, when the flat-plate-like sputtered particle reaches the substrate, migration occurs on the substrate surface, so that a flat plane of the flat-plate-like sputtered particle is attached to the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0091">Furthermore, it is preferable that the proportion of oxygen in the deposition gas be increased and the power be optimized in order to reduce plasma damage at the deposition. The proportion of oxygen in the deposition gas is 30 vol % or higher, preferably 100 vol %.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0092">As an example of the sputtering target, an In—Ga—Zn—O compound target is described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0093">The In—Ga—Zn—O compound target, which is polycrystalline, is made by mixing InO<sub>X </sub>powder, GaO<sub>Y </sub>powder, and ZnO<sub>Z </sub>powder in a predetermined molar ratio, applying pressure, and performing heat treatment at a temperature higher than or equal to 1000° C. and lower than or equal to 1500° C.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0101">Note that etching of the first oxide semiconductor film <b>191</b> and the second oxide semiconductor film <b>192</b> may be dry etching, wet etching, or both dry etching and wet etching.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0102">In this embodiment, since the first oxide semiconductor film <b>191</b> and the second oxide semiconductor film <b>192</b> are etched with the same mask, the first oxide semiconductor layer <b>101</b> and the second oxide semiconductor layer <b>102</b>, which have been processed, have the same shape where end portions of side surfaces thereof are aligned.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0103">Heat treatment may be performed on the oxide semiconductor stack <b>403</b> in order to remove excess hydrogen (including water and a hydroxyl group) (to perform dehydration or dehydrogenation). The temperature of the heat treatment is higher than or equal to 300° C. and lower than or equal to 700° C. or lower than the strain point of the substrate. The heat treatment can be performed in a reduced-pressure atmosphere, a nitrogen atmosphere, or the like.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0104">Note that the heat treatment apparatus is not limited to an electric furnace, and an apparatus for heating an object to be processed by heat conduction or heat radiation from a heating element such as a resistance heating element may be alternatively used. For example, a rapid thermal annealing (RTA) apparatus such as a gas rapid thermal annealing (GRTA) apparatus or a lamp rapid thermal annealing (LRTA) apparatus can be used. An LRTA apparatus is an apparatus for heating an object to be processed by radiation of light (electromagnetic wave) emitted from a lamp such as a halogen lamp, a metal halide lamp, a xenon arc lamp, a carbon arc lamp, a high pressure sodium lamp, or a high pressure mercury lamp. A GRTA apparatus is an apparatus for heat treatment using a high-temperature gas.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0142"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4D</figref> illustrate an example of a method for manufacturing the transistor <b>520</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0143">First, as in Embodiment 1, the oxide insulating film <b>436</b>, the source electrode layer <b>405</b> <i>a</i>, and the drain electrode layer <b>405</b> <i>b </i>are formed over the substrate <b>400</b> having an insulating surface. A first oxide semiconductor film and a second oxide semiconductor film are formed over the source electrode layer <b>405</b> <i>a </i>and the drain electrode layer <b>405</b> <i>b </i>and are processed into an island shape by a first photolithography process, so that the first oxide semiconductor layer <b>101</b> and the second oxide semiconductor layer <b>102</b> are formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0144">Next, a third oxide semiconductor film is formed over the second oxide semiconductor layer <b>102</b> so as to cover a side surface of the first oxide semiconductor layer <b>101</b> and a side surface of the second oxide semiconductor layer <b>102</b>, and the third oxide semiconductor film is processed into an island shape by a second photolithography process, so that the third oxide semiconductor layer <b>103</b> is formed (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>). In this manner, the oxide semiconductor stack <b>403</b> including the first oxide semiconductor layer <b>101</b>, the second oxide semiconductor layer <b>102</b>, and the third oxide semiconductor layer <b>103</b> is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0145">The third oxide semiconductor layer <b>103</b> is preferably formed using the same target as the first oxide semiconductor layer <b>101</b>. Formation conditions of the third oxide semiconductor layer <b>103</b> are the same as those of the first oxide semiconductor layer <b>101</b>; thus, description thereof is omitted here. Note that by the second photolithography process, the third oxide semiconductor layer <b>103</b> which overlaps with the second oxide semiconductor layer <b>102</b> and has a top surface shape larger than the plan area of the second oxide semiconductor layer <b>102</b> is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0146">Then, heat treatment may be performed on the oxide semiconductor stack <b>403</b> in order to remove excess hydrogen (including water and a hydroxyl group) (to perform dehydration or dehydrogenation). Conditions of the heat treatment for dehydration or dehydrogenation are the same as those in the case of the transistor <b>510</b>; thus, description thereof is omitted here.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0147">Next, the gate insulating film <b>402</b> is formed to cover the source electrode layer <b>405</b> <i>a</i>, the drain electrode layer <b>405</b> <i>b</i>, and the oxide semiconductor stack <b>403</b>. After that, oxygen <b>431</b> (including at least one of an oxygen radical, an oxygen atom, and an oxygen ion) is introduced into the oxide semiconductor stack <b>403</b> from above the gate insulating film <b>402</b>, so that oxygen is supplied to at least the third oxide semiconductor layer <b>103</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). As a method for introducing oxygen, an ion implantation method, an ion doping method, a plasma immersion ion implantation method, plasma treatment, or the like can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0148">It is preferable that the introduction of oxygen into the oxide semiconductor stack <b>403</b> make the amount of oxygen contained in the oxide semiconductor stack <b>403</b> substantially exceed that in the stoichiometric ratio. For example, a peak of the concentration of oxygen introduced by the oxygen introduction treatment is preferably higher than or equal to 1×10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>and lower than or equal to 5×10<sup>21</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0149">The oxygen <b>431</b> may be contained at least in an interface between the third oxide semiconductor layer <b>103</b> and the gate insulating film <b>402</b>. Thus, depending on the depth at which the oxygen <b>431</b> is introduced, the oxygen concentrations in the first oxide semiconductor layer <b>101</b> and the second oxide semiconductor layer <b>102</b> are each equivalent to that in the stoichiometric ratio in some cases. The depth at which oxygen is introduced into the oxide semiconductor stack <b>403</b> may be controlled by appropriately setting an implantation condition such as acceleration voltage or a dose, or the thickness of the gate insulating film <b>402</b> through which oxygen passes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0150">The timing of the introduction of the oxygen <b>431</b> is not limited to after the formation of the gate insulating film <b>402</b>. However, when oxygen is introduced through a film stacked over the oxide semiconductor stack <b>403</b>, the depth at which oxygen is introduced (introduction region) is controlled easily, which enables efficient oxygen implantation into the oxide semiconductor stack <b>403</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0151">In addition, heat treatment may be performed after the oxygen <b>431</b> is introduced. As for heating conditions, the heat treatment is preferably performed at a temperature higher than or equal to 250° C. and lower than or equal to 700° C., preferably higher than or equal to 300° C. and lower than or equal to 450° C., in an oxygen atmosphere. The heat treatment may be performed in a nitrogen atmosphere, a reduced-pressure atmosphere, or the air (ultra-dry air).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0152">In the case where at least one layer in the oxide semiconductor stack <b>403</b> is a crystalline oxide semiconductor film, part of the crystalline oxide semiconductor film becomes amorphous in some cases by the introduction of the oxygen <b>431</b>. In that case, the crystallinity may be recovered by performing heat treatment after the introduction of the oxygen <b>431</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0153">Further, in the case where an oxygen-excess region is formed in the oxide semiconductor stack <b>403</b>, an oxygen vacancy therein can be filled; thus, charge trapping centers in the oxide semiconductor stack <b>403</b> can be reduced. An oxygen vacancy exists in a portion where oxygen is eliminated in the oxide semiconductor stack <b>403</b>, and a donor level which leads to a change in electric characteristics of a transistor is formed owing to the oxygen vacancy. Since an oxygen vacancy in the film can be filled by introduction of oxygen, with the use of such an oxide semiconductor stack for a transistor, variation in the threshold voltage Vth of the transistor owing to an oxygen vacancy and a shift of the threshold voltage ΔVth can be reduced. In addition, the threshold voltage can be positively shifted to make the transistor normally-off.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0154">Next, the gate electrode layer <b>401</b> is formed over the gate insulating film <b>402</b> by a plasma CVD method, a sputtering method, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0155">Next, treatment in which a dopant <b>421</b> is selectively introduced is preferably performed. In this treatment, with the use of the gate electrode layer <b>401</b> as a mask, the dopant <b>421</b> is introduced through the gate insulating film <b>402</b>, so that the first low-resistance regions <b>121</b> <i>a </i>and <b>121</b> <i>b</i>, the second low-resistance regions <b>122</b> <i>a </i>and <b>122</b> <i>b</i>, and the third low-resistance regions <b>123</b> <i>a </i>and <b>123</b> <i>b </i>are formed (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>). Through this treatment, the first low-resistance regions <b>121</b> <i>a </i>and <b>121</b> <i>b </i>between which the first channel formation region <b>121</b> <i>c </i>is sandwiched are formed in the channel length direction in a self-aligned manner. Further, the second low-resistance regions <b>122</b> <i>a </i>and <b>122</b> <i>b </i>between which the second channel formation region <b>122</b> <i>c </i>is sandwiched are formed in the channel length direction in a self-aligned manner. Furthermore, the third low-resistance regions <b>123</b> <i>a </i>and <b>123</b> <i>b </i>between which the third channel formation region <b>123</b> <i>c </i>is sandwiched are formed in the channel length direction in a self-aligned manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0156">In the transistor <b>520</b> in this embodiment, the first low-resistance regions <b>121</b> <i>a </i>and <b>121</b> <i>b</i>, the second low-resistance regions <b>122</b> <i>a </i>and <b>122</b> <i>b</i>, and the third low-resistance regions <b>123</b> <i>a </i>and <b>123</b> <i>b </i>are regions containing the dopant and excess oxygen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0157">The low-resistance regions between which the channel formation region is sandwiched are formed in the channel length direction in the oxide semiconductor stack <b>403</b> by introducing the dopant <b>421</b>, whereby on-state characteristics of the transistor <b>520</b> are improved; accordingly, high-speed operation and high-speed response of the transistor can be achieved. Further, the low-resistance regions are formed in a self-aligned manner and do not overlap with the gate electrode layer; thus, parasitic capacitance can be reduced. The reduction in parasitic capacitance leads to a reduction in the power consumption of the whole semiconductor device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0158">The treatment for introducing the dopant <b>421</b> may be controlled by appropriately setting an implantation condition such as acceleration voltage or a dose, or the thickness of the gate insulating film <b>402</b> through which the dopant <b>421</b> passes. For example, in the case where boron is used and boron ions are implanted by an ion implantation method, the dose may be greater than or equal to 1×10<sup>13 </sup>ions/cm<sup>2 </sup>and less than or equal to 5×10<sup>16 </sup>ions/cm<sup>2</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0159">The concentrations of the dopant <b>421</b> in the first low-resistance regions <b>121</b> <i>a </i>and <b>121</b> <i>b</i>, the second low-resistance regions <b>122</b> <i>a </i>and <b>122</b> <i>b</i>, and the third low-resistance regions <b>123</b> <i>a </i>and <b>123</b> <i>b </i>are each preferably higher than or equal to 5×10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>and lower than or equal to 1×10<sup>22</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0160">The dopant may be introduced while the substrate <b>400</b> is heated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0161">Note that the treatment in which the dopant <b>421</b> is introduced to form the first low-resistance regions <b>121</b> <i>a </i>and <b>121</b> <i>b</i>, the second low-resistance regions <b>122</b> <i>a </i>and <b>122</b> <i>b</i>, and the third low-resistance regions <b>123</b> <i>a </i>and <b>123</b> <i>b </i>may be performed plural times, and plural kinds of dopants may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0162">After the dopant <b>421</b> is introduced, heat treatment may be performed. As for heating conditions, the heat treatment is preferably performed at a temperature higher than or equal to 300° C. and lower than or equal to 700° C., preferably higher than or equal to 300° C. and lower than or equal to 450° C., for one hour in an oxygen atmosphere. The heat treatment may be performed in a nitrogen atmosphere, a reduced-pressure atmosphere, or the air (ultra-dry air).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0163">In the case where at least one layer in the oxide semiconductor stack is a crystalline oxide semiconductor film, part of the crystalline oxide semiconductor film becomes amorphous in some cases by the introduction of the dopant <b>421</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0164">In this embodiment, boron is used as the dopant.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0165">Through the above steps, the transistor <b>520</b> in this embodiment is manufactured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0166">Note that the insulating film <b>407</b> may be formed to cover the transistor <b>520</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0167">In the transistor <b>520</b> described in this embodiment, the third oxide semiconductor layer <b>103</b> is formed to cover the side surface of the first oxide semiconductor layer <b>101</b> and the side surface of the second oxide semiconductor layer <b>102</b>. With such a structure, an increase in oxygen vacancies in the second oxide semiconductor layer <b>102</b> can be suppressed, and the threshold voltage of the transistor can be close to zero. Furthermore, the second oxide semiconductor layer <b>102</b> serves as a buried channel, which results in a reduction in carrier scattering.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0168">Moreover, with the structure in which the second oxide semiconductor layer <b>102</b> with a small energy gap is sandwiched between the first oxide semiconductor layer <b>101</b> and the third oxide semiconductor layer <b>103</b> with large energy gaps, the off-state current (leakage current) of the transistor can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0169">As described above, an interface between the oxide semiconductor layers included in the oxide semiconductor stack is unclear in some cases. When the interface is unclear, a portion which can be called a mixed region of a plurality of different oxide semiconductor layers is formed in some cases. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> illustrate a transistor <b>530</b> and a transistor <b>540</b>, respectively, in each of which the oxide semiconductor stack <b>403</b> includes a mixed region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0170">The transistor <b>530</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> includes, over the substrate <b>400</b> which has an insulating surface and is provided with the oxide insulating film <b>436</b>, the source electrode layer <b>405</b> <i>a</i>, the drain electrode layer <b>405</b> <i>b</i>, the oxide semiconductor stack <b>403</b> provided over the source electrode layer <b>405</b> <i>a </i>and the drain electrode layer <b>405</b> <i>b</i>, the gate insulating film <b>402</b>, and the gate electrode layer <b>401</b>. The insulating film <b>407</b> is formed over the transistor <b>530</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0171">In the transistor <b>530</b>, the oxide semiconductor stack <b>403</b> includes the first oxide semiconductor layer <b>101</b>, the second oxide semiconductor layer <b>102</b>, and a mixed region <b>201</b> between the first oxide semiconductor layer <b>101</b> and the second oxide semiconductor layer <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0172">The mixed region <b>201</b> is a region where elements contained in the first oxide semiconductor layer <b>101</b> and the second oxide semiconductor layer <b>102</b> that are stacked are mixed, and at least the composition of elements contained in the mixed region is different from that of the elements contained in the first oxide semiconductor layer <b>101</b> and that of the elements contained in the second oxide semiconductor layer <b>102</b>. For example, in the case where the oxide semiconductor stack <b>403</b> has a stacked structure of an oxide semiconductor layer containing indium, tin, and zinc and an oxide semiconductor layer containing indium, gallium, and zinc, the mixed region <b>201</b> containing indium, tin, gallium, and zinc can be formed between the first oxide semiconductor layer <b>101</b> and the second oxide semiconductor layer <b>102</b>. In addition, even in the case where elements contained in the first oxide semiconductor layer <b>101</b> and the second oxide semiconductor layer <b>102</b> are the same, the mixed region <b>201</b> whose composition (composition ratio) is different from compositions of the first oxide semiconductor layer <b>101</b> and the second oxide semiconductor layer <b>102</b> can be formed.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0173">Thus, when the mixed region <b>201</b> is provided, a boundary between the first oxide semiconductor layer <b>101</b> and the second oxide semiconductor layer <b>102</b> is unclear, and an interface scattering in the oxide semiconductor stack <b>403</b> can be suppressed.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0174">By providing the mixed region <b>201</b>, a gradient can be formed between the first oxide semiconductor layer <b>101</b> and the second oxide semiconductor layer <b>102</b> in the energy band diagram.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0175">The mixed region <b>201</b> can be formed by performing heat treatment on the oxide semiconductor stack after the first oxide semiconductor layer <b>101</b> and the second oxide semiconductor layer <b>102</b> are formed (or after the first oxide semiconductor film <b>191</b> and the second oxide semiconductor film <b>192</b> are formed). The heat treatment is performed at a temperature at which the elements in the first oxide semiconductor layer <b>101</b> and the second oxide semiconductor layer <b>102</b> can be diffused by heat under such a condition that the first oxide semiconductor layer <b>101</b> and the second oxide semiconductor layer <b>102</b> do not form a mixed region whose composition is uniform in the entire region of the oxide semiconductor stack <b>403</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0176">The heat treatment can be performed in a reduced-pressure atmosphere, a nitrogen atmosphere, an oxygen atmosphere, the air (ultra-dry air), a rare gas atmosphere, or the like.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0207">In the case where a liquid crystal element is used as the display element, a thermotropic liquid crystal, a ferroelectric liquid crystal, an anti-ferroelectric liquid crystal, or the like can be used.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0208">Alternatively, a liquid crystal composition exhibiting a blue phase for which an alignment film is unnecessary may be used for the liquid crystal layer <b>4008</b>. A blue phase is one of liquid crystal phases, which is generated just before a cholesteric phase changes into an isotropic phase while the temperature of a cholesteric liquid crystal is increased. The blue phase can be exhibited using a liquid crystal composition which is a mixture of a liquid crystal and a chiral agent. In order to increase the temperature range where the blue phase is exhibited, a liquid crystal layer may be formed by adding a polymerizable monomer, a polymerization initiator, and the like to a liquid crystal composition exhibiting a blue phase and by performing polymer stabilization treatment. The liquid crystal composition exhibiting a blue phase has a short response time, and has optical isotropy, which makes the alignment process unneeded and viewing angle dependence small. In addition, since an alignment film does not need to be provided and rubbing treatment is unnecessary, electrostatic discharge damage caused by the rubbing treatment can be prevented and defects and damage of the liquid crystal display device in the manufacturing process can be reduced. Thus, the productivity of the liquid crystal display device can be improved.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0211">In the transistor including the oxide semiconductor film disclosed in this specification, the current value in the off state (off-state current value) can be controlled to be small. Therefore, an electric signal such as an image signal can be held for a longer time and a writing interval can be set longer. Accordingly, frequency of refresh operation can be reduced, which leads to an effect of suppressing power consumption.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0212">Further, in the transistor including the oxide semiconductor film disclosed in this specification, the field-effect mobility can be controlled to be high; thus, the scan line driver circuit <b>4004</b> can drive at high speed. According to this embodiment, a switching transistor in a pixel portion and a driver transistor used for a driver circuit portion can be formed over one substrate. That is, since a semiconductor device formed of a silicon wafer or the like is not additionally needed as a driver circuit, the number of components of the semiconductor device can be reduced.</div>

Furthermore, this embodiment can be applied to a VA liquid crystal display device. The VA liquid crystal display device has a kind of form in which alignment of liquid crystal molecules of a liquid crystal display panel is controlled. In the VA liquid crystal display device, liquid crystal molecules are aligned in a vertical direction with respect to a panel surface when no voltage is applied.

Further, the sizes of display regions may differ between respective dots of color elements. Note that one embodiment of the invention disclosed herein is not limited to the application to a display device for color display; one embodiment of the invention disclosed herein can also be applied to a display device for monochrome display.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0217">Alternatively, as the display element included in the display device, a light-emitting element utilizing electroluminescence can be used. Light-emitting elements utilizing electroluminescence are classified according to whether a light-emitting material is an organic compound or an inorganic compound. In general, the former is referred to as an organic EL element, and the latter is referred to as an inorganic EL element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0218">In an organic EL element, by application of voltage to a light-emitting element, electrons and holes are separately injected from a pair of electrodes into a layer containing a light-emitting organic compound, and current flows. The carriers (electrons and holes) are recombined, and thus the light-emitting organic compound is excited. The light-emitting organic compound returns to a ground state from the excited state, thereby emitting light. Owing to such a mechanism, this light-emitting element is referred to as a current-excitation light-emitting element. Note that description is made here using an organic EL element as a light-emitting element.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0298">In this example, characteristics of a transistor having the same structure as the transistor <b>510</b> in Embodiment 1 were calculated, which included an oxide semiconductor stack including a first oxide semiconductor layer and a second oxide semiconductor layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0299">For calculation in this example, simulation software Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) manufactured by Synopsys, Inc. was used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0300">The transistor used for the calculation was a top-gate transistor which included an oxide semiconductor stack including a first oxide semiconductor layer provided over a source electrode layer and a drain electrode layer and a second oxide semiconductor layer provided over the first oxide semiconductor layer, and a 100-nm-thick gate insulating film provided over the oxide semiconductor stack. The calculation was conducted with each of the L length and the W length set to 10 μm and the drain voltage (Vd) set to 1 V.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0301">As for the structure of the oxide semiconductor stack included in the transistor, the following four samples were prepared: Transistor A including a 5-nm-thick In—Sn—Zn—O film as the first oxide semiconductor layer and a 5-nm-thick In—Ga—Zn—O film as the second oxide semiconductor layer; Transistor B including a 5-nm-thick In—Ga—Zn—O film as the first oxide semiconductor layer and a 5-nm-thick In—Sn—Zn—O film as the second oxide semiconductor layer; Transistor C, which was a comparative example, including a 5-nm-thick In—Ga—Zn—O film as the first oxide semiconductor layer and a 5-nm-thick In—Ga—Zn—O film as the second oxide semiconductor layer (i.e., the oxide semiconductor stack consisted of the In—Ga—Zn—O films); and Transistor D, which was a comparative example, including a 5-nm-thick In—Sn—Zn—O film as the first oxide semiconductor layer and a 5-nm-thick In—Sn—Zn—O film as the second oxide semiconductor layer (i.e., the oxide semiconductor stack consisted of the In—Sn—Zn—O films).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0302">The calculation was conducted setting the band gap of each of the In—Ga—Zn—O films included in Transistors A to C to 3.15 eV, the carrier lifetime thereof to 1 nanosecond, the bulk mobility thereof to 10 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs, and the electron affinity thereof to 4.6 eV. The calculation was conducted setting the band gap of each of the In—Sn—Zn—O films included in Transistors A, B, and D to 2.8 eV, the carrier lifetime thereof to 1 nanosecond, the bulk mobility thereof to 35 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs, and the electron affinity thereof to 4.6 eV.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0303">The off-state current values obtained by the calculation are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref>. Note that <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref> is a graph in which the range of drain current from 1.0×10<sup>−33 </sup>A to 1.0×10<sup>−28 </sup>A in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref> is enlarged. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref>, the vertical axis represents the drain current (A) and the horizontal axis represents the gate voltage (V).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0304">The field-effect mobility of the transistors, which was obtained by the calculation, is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the vertical axis represents the field-effect mobility (cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs) and the horizontal axis represents the gate voltage (V).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0305"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> show that Transistor D, which is a comparative example, has a larger off-state current value than the other three samples while having high field-effect mobility. In addition, Transistor C, which is a comparative sample, has low field-effect mobility and small on-state current while having favorable off-state current characteristics. In contrast, Transistor A and Transistor B, which are example transistors, have smaller off-state current values than Transistor D and higher field-effect mobility than Transistor C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0306">Specifically, the off-state current value of Transistor C was approximately 1.3×10<sup>−29 </sup>A to 2.0×10<sup>−32 </sup>A, whereas the off-state current value of Transistor A was approximately 0.6×10<sup>−29 </sup>A and the off-state current value of Transistor B was approximately 0.6×10<sup>−29 </sup>A. The field-effect mobility of Transistor D was approximately 35 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs, whereas the field-effect mobility of Transistor A was approximately 15 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs to 20 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs and the field-effect mobility of Transistor B was approximately 25 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs to 30 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0307">Note that the field-effect mobility of Transistor B was higher than that of Transistor A. It is presumable that this is because, in Transistor B, the In—Sn—Zn—O film with high field-effect mobility was in contact with the gate insulating film as the second oxide semiconductor layer and a channel was formed in the In—Sn—Zn—O film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0308">The above results indicate that characteristics (field-effect mobility and off-state current characteristics in this example) of a transistor including an oxide semiconductor stack can be variously changed depending on the stacked condition in the oxide semiconductor stack. Accordingly, with the use of the oxide semiconductor stack, the electric characteristics of the transistor can be more accurately controlled and desired electric characteristics can be given to the transistor.</div>
