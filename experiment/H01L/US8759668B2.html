<heading>RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 11/384,838 filed Mar. 20, 2006 which is incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">This invention relates to an aluminum-boron conductor formulation made from conductive aluminum particles, boron containing sources, inorganic additives, and glass frit dispersed in an organic system. The formulations are mainly screen-printable and suitable for use in the fabrication of photovoltaic devices. These formulations could also be applied by other methods such as spraying, hot melt printing, ink jet printing, pad printing and tape lamination techniques with suitable modifications of organics.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Solar cells are generally made of semiconductor materials, such as silicon (Si), which convert sunlight into useful electrical energy. A solar cell contact is in generally made of thin wafers of Si in which the required PN junction is formed by diffusing phosphorus (P) from a suitable phosphorus source into a P-type Si wafer. The side of the silicon wafer on which sunlight is incident is generally coated with an anti-reflective coating (ARC) to prevent reflective loss of sunlight. This ARC increases the solar cell efficiency. A two dimensional electrode grid pattern known as a front contact makes a connection to the N-side of silicon, and a coating of predominantly aluminum (Al) makes connection to the P-side of the silicon (back contact). Further, contacts known as silver rear contacts, made out of silver or silver-aluminum paste are printed and fired on the N-side of silicon to enable soldering of tabs that electrically connect one cell to the next in a solar cell module. These contacts are the electrical outlets from the PN junction to the outside load.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Conventional pastes for solar cell contacts contain lead frits. Inclusion of PbO in a glass component of a solar cell paste has the desirable effects of (a) lowering the firing temperature of paste compositions, (b) facilitating interaction with the silicon substrate and, upon firing, helping to form low resistance contacts with silicon. For these and other reasons PbO is a significant component in many conventional solar cell paste compositions. However, in light of environmental concerns, the use of PbO (as well as CdO), in paste compositions is now largely avoided whenever possible. Hence a need exists in the photovoltaic industry for lead-free and cadmium-free paste compositions, which afford desirable properties using lead-free and cadmium-free glasses in solar cell contact pastes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Presently, a typical solar cell silicon wafer is about 200-300 microns thick, and the trend is toward thinner wafers. Because the wafer cost is about 60% of the cell fabrication cost, the industry is seeking ever-thinner wafers, approaching 150 microns. As the wafer thickness decreases, the tendency toward bowing (bending) of the cell due to the sintering stress increases, which is generated by the great difference in the thermal coefficients of expansion (TCE) between aluminum (232×10<sup>−7</sup>/° C. @ 20-300° C.) and silicon, (26×10<sup>−7</sup>/° C. @ 20-300° C.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Known methods of mitigating silicon wafer bowing include reduction of aluminum content during screen-printing that causes incomplete formation of Back Surface Field (BSF) layers and requires a higher firing temperature to achieve the same results. Chemical (acid) etching has been used to remove the Al—Si alloy that forms after firing the Aluminum paste. This is just another step in the manufacturing process that leads to additional cost.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">Another approach is to use additives to reduce the thermal expansion mismatch between the Al layer and the silicon wafer. However, a drawback is a reduction in rear surface passivation quality and a concomitant reduction in solar cell performance. Partial covers, where only a portion of the back side of the wafer is coated with aluminum, have been used on the back surface field to counteract bowing, which causes a reduction in cell performance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">Finally, another conventional way to reduce or eliminate bowing is cooling a finished solar cell from room temperature to ca. −50° C. for several seconds after firing. With such plastic deformation of the Al—Si paste matrix, bowing is largely eliminated, but this represents an additional process step, and there is a high danger of breakage from thermal stress.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">Hence a need exists in the photovoltaic industry for a low-bow, high-performance aluminum back surface field in a solar cell contact, a method of making such a contact, and the Al paste from which such a BSF is formed.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">The present invention provides an aluminum-boron paste for application to a silicon solar cell having a p+ and n+ layer for the formation of a back-surface-field (BSF) and an emitter. The boron-doped aluminum contact formed by firing the paste eliminates or minimizes bowing of ultra thin silicon wafers, thereby improving reliability and electrical performance of solar cells made therewith, as measured by low series resistance (R<sub>S</sub>) and high shunt resistance (R<sub>sh</sub>) high efficiency (η) and high fill factor (FF), as well as reducing breakage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">Generally, the present invention includes a solar cell comprising a contact. The contact is made from a mixture wherein prior to firing, the mixture comprises at least one aluminum source, at least one boron source, and about 0.1 to about 10 wt % of a glass component. The content of aluminum is about 50 wt % to about 85 wt % of the mixture, and the content of boron is about 0.05 to about 20 wt % of the mixture.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">Another embodiment of the invention is a solar cell comprising a silicon wafer, aluminum, and boron, wherein the combined concentration of aluminum and boron (Al+B) at a depth of about 0 to about 5 microns in the silicon wafer is about 10<sup>18 </sup>to about 10<sup>20 </sup>atoms per cubic centimeter (cm<sup>3</sup>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">The compositions and methods of the present invention overcome the drawbacks of the prior art by optimizing interaction, bonding, and contact formation between back contact (BSF) components, typically silicon with Al through a properly formulated aluminum-boron paste. A conductive paste containing aluminum, boron, and a glass component, is printed on a silicon substrate, and fired to fuse the glass, sinter the metal, and provide aluminum doping into the silicon wafer to a depth of several microns. Upon firing, for a back contact, a p+ layer is formed, which is overlaid by an Al—Si eutectic layer, and which in turn is overlaid by aluminum layer which could contain boron.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">The foregoing and other features of the invention are hereinafter more fully described and particularly pointed out in the claims, the following description setting forth in detail certain illustrative embodiments of the invention, these being indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the present invention may be employed.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">Broadly, the invention provides a solar cell comprising a contact. The contact is made from a mixture wherein prior to firing, the mixture comprises at least one aluminum source, at least one boron source, and about 0.1 to about 10 wt % of a glass component. The content of aluminum is about 50 wt % to about 85 wt % of the mixture, and the content of boron is about 0.05 to about 20 wt % of the mixture.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">Another embodiment of the invention is a solar cell comprising a silicon wafer, aluminum, and boron, wherein the combined concentration of aluminum and boron (Al+B) at a depth of about 0 to about 5 microns in the silicon wafer is about 10<sup>18 </sup>to about 10<sup>20 </sup>atoms per cubic centimeter (cm<sup>3</sup>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">Another embodiment of the invention is a solar cell comprising a silicon wafer, aluminum, and boron, wherein the combined concentration of aluminum and boron (Al+B) at a depth of about 0 to about 5 microns in the silicon wafer is about 10<sup>18 </sup>to about 10<sup>20 </sup>atoms per cubic centimeter (cm<sup>3</sup>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">An aluminum back contact makes contact with both Si and the Ag/Al rear contact layer. In a back contact, the metal component preferably comprises aluminum and boron, and the glass component may be one of several types. Bismuth based glasses and alkali titanium silicate glasses each have certain advantages over the prior art when used in a solar cell back contact.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">Broadly, thick film pastes containing aluminum and glass frit are used to make back contacts for silicon-based solar cells to conduct to an external load the current generated by exposure to light. While the paste is generally applied by screen-printing, methods such as extrusion, pad printing, ink jet printing, and hot melt printing may also be used. Further with suitable organics modifications the mixture of the present invention could be applied by tape lamination techniques. Solar cells with screen-printed front contacts are fired to relatively low temperatures (550° C. to 850° C. wafer temperature; furnace set temperatures of 650° C. to 1000° C.) to form a low resistance contact between the P-side of an aluminum doped silicon wafer and an aluminum based paste. Methods for making solar cells are also envisioned herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">Aluminum- and glass-containing back contacts are used to form low resistance ohmic contacts on the back side of the solar cell due to large area melting and re solidification of Al doped (p<sup>+</sup>) epitaxially grown Si layer which increases the solar cell performance due to improved back surface field. For optimum performance a thick p<sup>+</sup> re-grown region is believed to be ideal. It is also believed that the rejection of metallic impurities from the epitaxially growing p<sup>+</sup> layer leads to high carrier lifetimes. These two factors are believed to increase the open circuit voltage, and more importantly, the open circuit voltage falls only slightly as the bulk resistivity increases. Therefore solar cell performance improves due to the formation of a substantial epitaxially re-grown p<sup>+</sup> layer in the Al back contact.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">For a back contact, upon firing, a p<sup>+</sup> layer forms on the underlying silicon by liquid-phase epitaxy. This occurs during the resolidification of the aluminum-silicon (Al—Si) melt. High-bismuth lead-free and cadmium-free glasses allow low firing temperatures in making front contacts owing to their excellent flow characteristics relatively at low temperatures. Alkali-titanium-silicate glasses are another route to attain lower firing temperatures. While lead-glasses are often avoided for environmental reasons, they are sometimes used because they are the only route at present to certain properties, such as extremely low melting and wetting glasses. Relatively high-silicon, low bismuth lead-free and cadmium-free glasses provide suitable properties for back contacts, without excessive interaction with backside Si. Similarly, high-bismuth lead-free and cadmium-free glasses allow the formation of suitable lead-free silver rear contacts on backside Si with optimal interaction with both Si and back contact Al layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">Broadly construed, the inventive pastes comprise aluminum, boron, and glass. Each ingredient is detailed hereinbelow.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">Paste Glasses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">The pastes comprise about 0.1 to about 10 wt %, preferably 0.2 to about 5 wt % of a glass component. The glass component comprises, prior to firing, one or more glass compositions. Each glass composition comprises oxide frits including, in one embodiment, Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>and SiO<sub>2</sub>. In another embodiment, the glass composition comprises an alkali oxide, TiO<sub>2</sub>, and SiO<sub>2</sub>. In a third embodiment, the glass composition comprises PbO. In particular, in various embodiments of the present invention, glass compositions for back contacts may be found in Tables 1-3. The entry “20 trivalent oxides” means one or more trivalent oxides of an element selected from the group consisting of Al, Ga, In, Sc, Y, and an element having an atomic number of from 57 to 71. In formulating the pastes, the glass frits typically have particle sizes of about 0.5 to about 10 microns, although other particle sizes may be used as known in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">Looking to Tables 1-3, more than one glass composition can be used, and compositions comprising amounts from different columns in the same table are also envisioned. If a second glass composition is used, the proportions of the glass compositions can be varied to control the extent of paste interaction with silicon and hence the resultant solar cell properties, and to control the bowing of the silicon wafer. For example, within the glass component, the first and second glass compositions may be present in a weight ratio of about 1:20 to about 20:1, and preferably about 1:5 to about 5:1. The glass component preferably contains no lead or oxides of lead, and no cadmium or oxides of cadmium. However, in certain embodiments where the properties of PbO cannot be duplicated, such embodiments advantageously comprise PbO. An entry such as “Li<sub>2</sub>O+Na<sub>2</sub>O+K<sub>2</sub>O” means that the total content of Li<sub>2</sub>O and Na<sub>2</sub>O and K<sub>2</sub>O falls within the specified ranges.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">Metal Component.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">In a solar cell contact, the metal must be conductive. In a back contact, the metal component comprises aluminum. The aluminum metal component may come in any suitable form, including aluminum metal powder, an alloy of aluminum, an aluminum salt, and organometallic aluminum, an oxide of aluminum, and an aluminum-containing glass. The aluminum particles used in the paste may be spherical, flaked, or provided in a colloidal suspension, and combinations of the foregoing may be used. In formulating the pastes, the metal powders typically have particle sizes of about 0.1 to about 40 microns, preferably less than 10 microns. For example the paste may comprise about 80 to about 99 wt % spherical aluminum particles or alternatively about 75 to about 90 wt % aluminum particles and about 1 to about 10 wt % aluminum flakes. Alternatively the paste may comprise about 75 to about 90 wt % aluminum flakes and about 1 to about 10 wt % of colloidal aluminum, or about 60 to about 95 wt % of aluminum powder or aluminum flakes and about 0.1 to about 20 wt % of colloidal aluminum. Suitable commercial examples of aluminum particles are available from Alcoa, Inc., Pittsburgh, Pa.; Ampal Inc., Flemington, N.J.; and ECKA Granulate GmbH &amp; Co. KG, of Fürth, Germany.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">An alloy of aluminum may be used, including those comprising aluminum and a metal selected from the group consisting of boron, silicon, gallium, indium, antimony, and magnesium. In one embodiment, the alloy provides both aluminum and boron, namely, as an aluminum-boron alloy, which comprises about 60 to about 99.9 wt % aluminum and about 0.1 to about 40 wt % boron. In a preferred embodiment an aluminum-boron alloy containing 0.2 weight % B could be used for up to 98 wt % of the paste mixture to provide both aluminum and boron to the mixture. In yet another preferred embodiment, one or more of the alloys Al—Si, Al—Mg, Al—Ga, Al—In, Al—Sb, Al—Sn, and Al—Zn may constitute up to about 50 wt % of the mixture.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">The boron source may boron metal powder, an alloy of boron, a salt of boron, boric acid, organometallic boron, an oxide of boron, and boron-containing glass. Combinations of the foregoing may be used. In particular, the boron source may be sodium borate, calcium borate, potassium borate, magnesium borate, B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>containing glass and combinations thereof. In a preferred embodiment, an organometallic boron solution could be used to provide boron, wherein such boron does not exceed about 5 wt % of the paste mixture.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">The Al—B pastes herein can be used to form a p<sup>+</sup> BSF several microns thick with an active peak doping concentration of about 10<sup>19 </sup>to about 10<sup>20 </sup>atoms per cm<sup>3</sup>; that is, one or two orders of magnitude higher than is achievable with conventional Al paste (e.g., on the order of 10<sup>18 </sup>atoms per cm<sup>3</sup>). This new Al—B paste uses the higher solid solubility of boron in Si and to increase the dissolution of Al into Si. Therefore Al—B paste makes it possible to deposit thinner paste layers for BSF formation, reduce bowing, and exploit the gettering properties of aluminum to improve minority carrier lifetime in solar cells without losing good ohmic contact properties of the Al—Si layer. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows measured p<sup>+</sup> carrier concentration in silicon after Al—B alloying process using the spreading resistance measurement. The spreading resistance data shows variation on p<sup>+</sup> carrier concentration due to roughness caused by the Al—B alloying process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">Organic Vehicle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">The pastes herein include a vehicle or carrier which is typically a solution of a resin dissolved in a solvent and, frequently, a solvent solution containing both resin and a thixotropic agent. The organics portion of the pastes comprises (a) at least about 80 wt % organic solvent; (b) up to about 15 wt % of a thermoplastic resin; (c) up to about 4 wt % of a thixotropic agent; and (d) up to about 2 wt % of a wetting agent. The use of more than one solvent, resin, thixotrope, and/or wetting agent is also envisioned. Although a variety of weight ratios of the solids portion to the organics portion are possible, one embodiment includes a weight ratio of the solids portion to the organics portion from about 20:1 to about 1:20, preferably about 15:1 to about 1:15, and more preferably about 10:1 to about 1:10.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">Ethyl cellulose is a commonly used resin. However, resins such as ethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose, wood rosin, mixtures of ethyl cellulose and phenolic resins, polymethacrylates of lower alcohols and the monobutyl ether of ethylene glycol monoacetate can also be used. Solvents having boiling points (1 atm) from about 130° C. to about 350° C. are suitable. Widely used solvents include terpenes such as alpha- or beta-terpineol or higher boiling alcohols such as Dowanol® (diethylene glycol monoethyl ether), or mixtures thereof with other solvents such as butyl Carbitol® (diethylene glycol monobutyl ether); dibutyl Carbitol® (diethylene glycol dibutyl ether), butyl Carbitol® acetate (diethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate), hexylene glycol, Texanol® (2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentanediol monoisobutyrate), as well as other alcohol esters, kerosene, and dibutyl phthalate. The vehicle can contain organometallic compounds, for example those based on aluminum, or boron, to modify the contact. N-Diffusol® is a stabilized liquid preparation containing an n-type diffusant with a diffusion coefficient similar to that of elemental phosphorus. Various combinations of these and other solvents can be formulated to obtain the desired viscosity and volatility requirements for each application. Other dispersants, surfactants and rheology modifiers, which are commonly used in thick film paste formulations, may be included. Commercial examples of such products include those sold under any of the following trademarks: Texanol® (Eastman Chemical Company, Kingsport, Tenn.); Dowanol® and Carbitol® (Dow Chemical Co., Midland, Mich.); Triton® (Union Carbide Division of Dow Chemical Co., Midland. Mich.), Thixatrol® (Elementis Company, Hightstown N.J.), and Diffusol® (Transene Co. Inc., Danvers, Mass.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">Among commonly used organic thixotropic agents is hydrogenated castor oil and derivatives thereof. A thixotrope is not always necessary because the solvent coupled with the shear thinning inherent in any suspension may alone be suitable in this regard. Furthermore, wetting agents may be employed such as fatty acid esters, e.g., N-tallow-1,3-diaminopropane dioleate; N-tallow trimethylene diamine diacetate; N-coco trimethylene diamine, beta diamines; N-oleyl trimethylene diamine; N-tallow trimethylene diamine; N-tallow trimethylene diamine dioleate, and combinations thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">It should be kept in mind that the foregoing compositional ranges are preferred and it is not the intention to be limited to these ranges where one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that these ranges may vary depending upon specific applications, specific components and conditions for processing and forming the end products.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">Other Additives.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">Other inorganic additives may be added to the paste to the extent of about 1 to about 30 wt %, preferably about 2 to about 25 wt % and more preferably about 5 to about 20 wt % based on the weight of the paste prior to firing. Other additives such as clays, fine silicon, silica, or carbon powder, or combinations thereof can be added to control the reactivity of the aluminum and boron with silicon. Common clays which have been calcined are suitable. Fine particles of low melting metal additives (i.e., elemental metallic additives as distinct from metal oxides) such as Pb, Bi, In, Ga, Sn, Sb, and Zn and alloys of each with at least one other metal can be added to provide a contact at a lower firing temperature, or to widen the firing window.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">A mixture of (a) glasses or a mixture of (b) crystalline additives and glasses or a mixture of (c) one or more crystalline additives can be used to formulate a glass component in the desired compositional range. The goal is to reduce bowing and improve the solar cell electrical performance. For example, second-phase crystalline materials such as Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, SnO, ZnO, SiO<sub>2</sub>, ZrO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, various alumino-silicates, bismuth silicates such as 12Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.SiO<sub>2</sub>, 2Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.SiO<sub>2</sub>, 3Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.5SiO<sub>2</sub>, Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.4SiO<sub>2</sub>, 6Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.SiO<sub>2</sub>, Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.SiO<sub>2</sub>; 2Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.3SiO<sub>2</sub>; bismuth titanates such as Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.2TiO<sub>2</sub>, 2Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.3TiO<sub>2</sub>, 2Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.4TiO<sub>2</sub>, and 6Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.TiO<sub>2</sub>; various vanadates such as MgO.V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, SrO.V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, CaO.V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, BaO.V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, ZnO.V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, Na<sub>2</sub>O.17V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, K<sub>2</sub>O.4V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, 2Li<sub>2</sub>O.5V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>; and bismuth vanadates such as 6Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, BiVO<sub>4</sub>, 2Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.3V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, and BiV<sub>3</sub>O<sub>9</sub>; bismuth vanadium titanates such as 6.5Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.2.5V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>.TiO<sub>2</sub>; zinc titanates such as 2ZnO.3TiO<sub>2</sub>; zinc silicates such as ZnO.SiO<sub>2</sub>; zirconium silicates such as ZrO<sub>2</sub>.SiO<sub>2</sub>; and reaction products thereof and combinations thereof may be added to the glass component to adjust contact properties. However, the total amounts of the above oxides must fall within the ranges specified for various embodiments disclosed elsewhere herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">Paste Preparation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">The paste according to the present invention may be conveniently prepared on a planetary mixer. The amount and type of carriers utilized are determined mainly by the final desired formulation viscosity, fineness of grind of the paste, and the desired wet print thickness. In preparing compositions according to the present invention, the particulate inorganic solids are mixed with the vehicle and dispersed with suitable equipment, such as a planetary mixer, to form a suspension, resulting in a composition for which the viscosity will be in the range of about 100 to about 500 kcps, preferably about 300 to about 400 kcps, at a shear rate of 9.6 sec<sup>−1 </sup>as determined on a Brookfield viscometer HBT, spindle 14, measured at 25° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">Printing and Firing of the Pastes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">The inventive method of making a solar cell back contact comprises: (1) applying an Al—B containing paste to the P-side of a silicon wafer on which back silver rear contact paste is already applied and dried, (2) drying the paste, and (3) applying the front contact silver paste, and (4) co-firing the front contact, silver rear contact, and Al—B back contact. The solar cell printed with silver rear contact Ag-paste, Al—B back contact paste, and Ag-front contact paste is fired at a suitable temperature, such as about 650-950° C. furnace set temperature; or about 550-850° C. wafer temperature. During firing as the wafer temperature rises above the Al—Si eutectic temperature of 577° C., the back contact Al and B dissolves Si from the substrate and a liquid Al—B—Si layer is formed. This Al—B—Si liquid continues to dissolve substrate Si during further heating to peak temperature. During the cool down period. Si precipitates back from the Al—B—Si melt. This precipitating Si grows as an epitaxial layer on the underlying Si substrate and forms a p+ layer. When the cooling melt reaches the Al—Si eutectic temperature the remaining liquid freezes as an Al—Si eutectic layer. A p+ layer is believed to provide a back surface field (BSF), which in turn increases the solar cell performance. The glass in Al—B back contact should optimally interact with both Al (and/or Al—B materials) and Si without unduly affecting the formation of an efficient BSF layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">Method of Back Contact Production.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">A solar cell back contact according to the present invention can be produced by applying any Al—B paste disclosed elsewhere herein, produced by mixing aluminum powders, boron containing materials, with the glass compositions of Tables 1, 2, or 3, to the P-side of the silicon substrate pre-coated with silver rear contact paste, for example by screen printing, to a desired wet thickness, e.g., from about 30 to 50 microns. Front contact Ag pastes are then printed on the front side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">Common to the production of front contacts, back contacts and silver rear contacts is the following. Automatic screen-printing techniques can be employed using a 200-325 mesh screen. The printed pattern is then dried at 200° C. or less, preferably at about 120° C. for about 5-15 minutes before firing. The dry printed Al—B back contact paste of the present invention can be co-fired with the silver rear contact and the front contact silver pastes for as little as 1 second up to about 5 minutes at peak temperature, in a belt conveyor furnace in air.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">Nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) or another inert atmosphere may be used if desired, but it is not necessary. The firing is generally according to a temperature profile that will allow burnout of the organic matter at about 300° C. to about 550° C., a period of peak furnace set temperature of about 650° C. to about 1000° C., lasting as little as about 1 second, although longer firing times as high as 1, 3, or 5 minutes are possible when firing at lower temperatures. For example a three-zone firing profile may be used, with a belt speed of about 1 to about 4 meters (40-160 inches) per minute. Naturally, firing arrangements having more than 3 zones are envisioned by the present invention, including 4, 5, 6, or 7, zones or more, each with zone lengths of about 5 to about 20 inches and firing temperatures of 650 to 1000° C.</div>

Electrical performance of some of these solar cells was measured with a solar tester, Model 91193-1000, Oriel Instrument Co., Stratford, Conn., under AM 1.5 sun conditions, in accordance with ASTM G-173-03. The electrical properties of the resultant solar cells are set forth in Table 6, which shows typical solar cell electrical properties and bowing for similar wafers for comparison of a prior art low bow Al paste and an Al—B paste of the invention.</div>
