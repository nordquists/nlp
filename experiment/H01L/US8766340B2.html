<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">The present application is a division of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/416,228, filed on Apr. 1, 2009. The present application claims benefit of the parent application under 35 U.S.C. §120, and claims priority benefit under 35 U.S.C. §119 of Japanese Patent Application 2008-098166, filed Apr. 4, 2008. The entire contents of each of the mentioned prior art applications are incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The present invention relates to a solid-state imaging apparatus and a manufacturing method thereof, and particularly to a solid-state imaging apparatus equipped with interlayer lenses and a manufacturing method thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">In recent years, an amplifying type image sensor, such as a charge coupled device (CCD) image sensor and a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor, has been used for an image inputting apparatus, such as a digital camera, a video camera, and an image reader. At that time, as a higher performance solid-state imaging apparatus, the amplifying type image sensor including an increased number of photoelectric conversion elements by reducing the areas of the photoelectric conversion elements thereof performing photoelectric conversions and a further reduced chip size has been desired.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">If the areas of the photoelectric conversion elements are reduced, then the quantity of receivable light lessens and the sensitivity of the image inputting apparatus lowers as the areas of the light receiving surfaces of the photoelectric conversion elements decrease. As a measure of the sensitivity lowering, the technique of forming on-chip micro lenses over the light receiving surfaces and condensing lights on the light receiving surfaces to suppress the fall of the sensitivity is known.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2004-186407 discloses the configuration of lessening the sizes from the on-chip micro lenses to the light receiving surfaces in their height directions in addition to the mounting of the on-chip micro lenses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the CMOS type solid-state imaging apparatus of Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2004-186407. An effective pixel region is arranged on the right side A of an alternate long and short dash line, in which effective pixel region a plurality of pixels is arranged. Each of the plurality of pixels includes a photoelectric conversion element performing a photoelectric conversion according to an incident light quantity. The region on the left side of the alternate long and short dash line is the region (hereinafter referred to as an out-of effective pixel region) other than the effective pixel region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">The CMOS type solid-state imaging apparatus includes photoelectric conversion regions <b>1</b>, a first metal wiring <b>2</b>, and a second metal wiring <b>3</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The on-chip micro lenses <b>5</b> are mounted over the first metal wiring <b>2</b> with a color filter <b>4</b> put between them. A step <b>6</b> is formed between the effective pixel region A and the out-of effective pixel region B. The second metal wiring <b>3</b>, which is the uppermost wiring existing in the out-of effective pixel region B, does not exist in the effective pixel region A to lessen the distance h of the effective pixel region A from the light receiving surfaces in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> (distance h&lt;distance h′ in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">If the step <b>6</b> in the solid-state imaging apparatus of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> disperses in a surface of the solid-state imaging apparatus or among different solid-state imaging apparatus, then the sensitivity of the solid-state imaging apparatus sometimes disperses. In order to suppress the dispersion of the sensitivity, it is important to manufacture the solid-state imaging apparatus so that the distances between the interlayer lenses and the photoelectric conversion elements may be uniform in the effective pixel regions A. However, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2004-186407 did not sufficient examination of the manufacturing method of the solid-state imaging apparatus illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Moreover, in order to further improve the condensing efficiency into the photoelectric conversion regions <b>1</b>, it is required to further lessen the distances between the lenses <b>5</b> and the photoelectric conversion elements (to realize a low profile).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of the specification, illustrate embodiments of the invention and, together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention.</div>
<heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">Next, the exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Incidentally, the present invention is not limited to the following exemplary embodiments.</div>
<heading>First Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1D</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2E to 2H</figref> are views for illustrating a manufacturing method of a solid-state imaging apparatus according to a first embodiment of the present invention. It is supposed in the manufacturing method of the present embodiment that the processing at the steps illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1D</figref> continues to the processing at the steps illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2E to 2H</figref>. In the drawings, reference characters A and B denote an effective pixel region (first region) and an out-of effective pixel region (second region) other than the effective pixel region A, respectively. The out-of effective pixel region B is supposed to include not only a peripheral circuit region but also an optical black region for forming a reference signal to effective pixels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">Moreover, the effective pixel region A indicates a region in which a plurality of pixels, each including a photoelectric conversion element, a circuit for reading out the signal of the photoelectric conversion element, and the like, is arranged in a matrix arrangement. The out-of effective pixel region B is arranged around the effective pixel region A. The peripheral circuits in the out-of effective pixel region B include a vertical scanning circuit and a horizontal scanning circuit, both for the driving of reading out signals of the pixels by scanning the pixels in row directions and column directions, circuits amplifying the signals of the pixels, and the like. The configurations of the effective pixel region A and the out-of effective pixel region B are the same in the following embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">Moreover, the detailed descriptions of element regions, element isolation regions, and the like, formed on a semiconductor substrate (silicon substrate or the like), will be omitted for the sake of the simplification of the descriptions in the following embodiments. Furthermore, electric contacts and via plugs for electrically connecting metal wirings mutually are not illustrated. Furthermore, since conventional steps can be applied as the steps for forming color filters and on-chip micro lenses after the formation of interlayer lenses, the detailed descriptions of the steps will be omitted. The surfaces of the photoelectric conversion elements (the surfaces of a semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>) are set as light receiving portions, and the upper direction of the solid-state imaging apparatus is set to the direction from the light receiving portions toward the on-chip micro lenses here. These suppositions are the same in the following embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">In the present embodiment, the metal wirings in the out-of effective pixel region B are formed to be three layers, and the metal wirings in the effective pixel region A are formed to be two layers. First and second metal wiring layers from the lower layer side are made of copper wirings, and the third metal wiring layer at the uppermost part is made of an aluminum wiring. Moreover, as a film having an etching resistance property to a silicon oxide film in the effective pixel region A, a film made of an organic small dielectric constant material is used. Each metal wiring layer includes a plurality of metal wirings, and is formed on different insulating films.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">First, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, polysilicon, which becomes gate electrodes of transistors, is formed on the semiconductor substrate (silicon substrate or the like) <b>100</b> including semiconductor regions <b>101</b>, each constituting a photoelectric conversion element. The polysilicon is not illustrated. Furthermore, a silicon oxide film is deposited on the polysilicon by, for example, the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, and after that, a first insulating film <b>110</b>, which has been planarized by the chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) method, is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">Next, a first metal wiring layer <b>102</b> made of copper is formed on the first insulating film <b>110</b> by the damascene method, and a first diffusion preventing film <b>115</b> is formed over the whole surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. After that, a pattern is formed by removing the first diffusion preventing film <b>115</b> over the light receiving portions (photoelectric conversion elements) by the lithography technique and the dry etching technique. Next, a second insulating film <b>111</b> made of a silicon oxide film is formed by, for example, the CVD method. If the influences caused by the steps of the first diffusion preventing film <b>115</b> are removed at the time of the formation of the second insulating film <b>111</b>, then the planarizing may be performed by the CMP method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">Next, a second metal wiring layer <b>103</b> made of copper, which becomes the wiring at the uppermost part in the effective pixel region A, is formed by the damascene method. Moreover, a silicon nitride film is formed over the whole surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> by the CVD method, and after that, the pattern of a second diffusion preventing film <b>116</b> is formed by removing the parts above the light receiving portions by the lithography technique and the dry etching technique.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">Next, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, in order that the steps caused by the second diffusion preventing film <b>116</b> may be buried, a silicon oxide film <b>117</b> is formed over the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> as an insulating film by the CVD method, a coating method, or the like. In order to remove the influences of the steps by the second diffusion preventing film <b>116</b>, the silicon oxide film <b>117</b> may be planarized by the CMP method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">Next, an organic small dielectric constant film <b>118</b> is applied over the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>, and is formed by being given a thermal treatment. As the organic small dielectric constant material, SiLK (registered trademark of The Dow Chemical Company) and the like are given. The organic small dielectric constant film <b>118</b> has a high etching resistance property to the etching to a silicon oxide film. After that, a silicon oxide film <b>119</b> is formed on the organic small dielectric constant film <b>118</b> by the CVD method or the coating method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">By the processing mentioned above, three insulating films of the silicon oxide film <b>117</b>, the organic small dielectric constant film <b>118</b>, and the silicon oxide film <b>119</b> are formed on the second diffusion preventing film <b>116</b> in this order.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">Next, although the illustration thereof is omitted, by the heretofore known lithography technique and the dry etching technique, via holes are formed in the out-of effective pixel region B. That is, the via holes for electrically connecting the second metal wiring layer <b>103</b> and an aluminum third metal wiring layer <b>104</b>, which will be formed later, to the silicon oxide film <b>119</b>, the organic small dielectric constant film <b>118</b>, the silicon oxide film <b>117</b>, and the second diffusion preventing film <b>116</b> are formed. Successively, a barrier film layer made of a metal nitride film, and a metal film made of tungsten or the like are formed over the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> by the sputtering method or the CVD method, and via holes are buried by means of a metal material. Furthermore, via plugs are formed by the planarizing of the metal film made of tungsten or the like by means of the CMP method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">Next, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, an aluminum film made of aluminum or an aluminum alloy is formed over the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> by the sputtering method or the CVD method, and the third metal wiring layer <b>104</b> is formed in the out-of effective pixel region B by the lithography technique and the dry etching technique. The aluminum film formed in the effective pixel region A is removed by the lithography technique or the dry etching technique, and then the silicon oxide film <b>119</b> is exposed. The third metal wiring layer <b>104</b> formed in the out-of effective pixel region B does not only function as a metal wiring in the peripheral circuit region, but also functions as a light blocking film in the optical black region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">Next, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, the out-of effective pixel region B is masked with a photoresist <b>113</b> by the heretofore known lithography technique, and the silicon oxide film <b>119</b> in the effective pixel region A is processed by dry etching. The present etching stops at the organic small dielectric constant film <b>118</b>, and the organic small dielectric constant film <b>118</b> is exposed in the effective pixel region A.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">Next, the photoresist <b>113</b>, which has been used at the time of the etching of the silicon oxide film <b>119</b>, is removed by the heretofore known ashing technique or the exfoliating technique. On this occasion, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, the organic small dielectric constant film <b>118</b>, which is exposed in the effective pixel region A, is simultaneously subjected to the ashing, and the silicon oxide film <b>117</b> at the lower layer of the organic small dielectric constant film <b>118</b> is exposed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">Moreover, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>, an interlayer lens forming layer <b>114</b> is formed over the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> by the CVD method. In the present embodiment, a silicon oxynitride film <b>120</b> and a silicon nitride film <b>121</b> are formed as the interlayer lens forming layer <b>114</b> by the CVD method. Next, a resist pattern <b>127</b> including convex semispherical islands is formed on the silicon nitride film <b>121</b> by the heretofore known lithography technique in order to form interlayer lenses <b>105</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">Next, etching is performed with the resist pattern <b>127</b> used as a mask, and the interlayer lenses <b>105</b> are formed as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref>. Incidentally, the parts of the silicon nitride film <b>121</b> other than the interlayer lenses <b>105</b> become a passivation film <b>106</b> over the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. Next, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2H</figref>, a planarizing layer <b>128</b> is formed over the effective pixel region A and the out-of effective pixel region B, and a color filter <b>129</b>, a planarizing layer <b>130</b>, and micro lenses <b>131</b> are formed over the planarizing layer <b>128</b>. Although the illustration thereof is omitted, in the out-of effective pixel region B, especially in the peripheral circuit region, openings for pad portions are formed by the lithography technique and the dry etching technique.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">In the present embodiment, all of the first insulating film <b>110</b>, the second insulating film <b>111</b>, and the silicon oxide film <b>117</b> for planarizing the steps owing to the second diffusion preventing film <b>116</b> arranged upward from the light receiving portions over the semiconductor regions <b>101</b> are silicon oxide films. Then, the silicon oxynitride film <b>120</b>, and the silicon nitride film <b>121</b>, from which the passivation film <b>106</b> and the interlayer lenses <b>105</b> are formed, are deposited as the upper layer of the silicon oxide film <b>117</b>. The refractive indices of these films are as follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">For example, to a light of a wavelength of 633 nm, the refractive indices of the silicon oxide films constituting the first insulating film <b>110</b>, the second insulating film <b>111</b>, and the silicon oxide film <b>117</b> for planarizing the steps are within a range of from 1.46 to 1.50; the refractive index of the silicon oxynitride film <b>120</b> is within a range of from 1.60 to 1.73; and the refractive index of the silicon nitride film <b>121</b> is 2.0. The relations among the refractive indices of these films are as follows: the refractive indices of the films are equal to the refractive indices of the light receiving surfaces of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> or gradually increase from the light receiving surfaces toward the interlayer lenses <b>105</b>, and consequently the lights transmitted through the interlayer lenses <b>105</b> can be effectively collected to the semiconductor regions <b>101</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">Moreover, in the present embodiment, the effective pixel region A and the out-of effective pixel region B have a mutually different number of wirings. Moreover, the organic small dielectric constant film <b>118</b>, which is an etch stop layer, is provided between the wiring layer at the most upper portion in the effective pixel region A and the wiring layer at the most upper portion in the out-of effective pixel region B. Moreover, the silicon oxide film <b>119</b> in the effective pixel region A is removed, and further the etch stop layer in the effective pixel region A is removed. Hereby, the organic small dielectric constant film <b>118</b> can be removed from the optical paths of the photoelectric conversion elements in the effective pixel region A. Moreover, in the out-of effective pixel region B, the organic small dielectric constant film <b>118</b> is provided between the uppermost wiring layer and the wiring layer at the lower layer of the uppermost wiring layer. Consequently, the distance between the uppermost wiring layer and the wiring layer at the lower layer thereof can be shortened with the capacitive coupling between the wiring layers suppressed. Incidentally, the uppermost wiring layer in the out-of effective pixel region B is sometimes a wiring layer for supplying a power source voltage or for grounding. In this case, the influences of the noise of the capacitive coupling owing to the potential changes of the wiring layer at the lower layer can be reduced in comparison with those in the other cases. Consequently, the distance between the uppermost wiring layer and the wiring layer at the lower layer thereof in the out-of effective pixel region B can be also shortened.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">As described above, a step is formed between the wiring at the most upper portion in the effective pixel region A and the wiring at the most upper portion in the out-of effective pixel region B (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>), and the interlayer lenses <b>105</b> are formed in the effective pixel region A by using the space formed by the step. Then, the formation of the interlayer lenses <b>105</b> in the effective pixel region A enables the further improvement of the condensing efficiency of the light receiving surface and the realization of a higher sensitivity solid-state imaging apparatus. Moreover, the formation of the interlayer lenses <b>105</b> and the passivation film <b>106</b> with the same film enables the lower profile of the solid-state imaging apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">Moreover, after that, a planarizing layer covering the interlayer lenses <b>105</b> is sometimes provided over the effective pixel region A and the out-of effective pixel region B. At this time, if the interlayer lenses <b>105</b> are provided at the step, then the planarizing becomes easy, and the film thickness of the planarizing layer can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">The heights <b>132</b> of the interlayer lenses <b>105</b> can be equal to or less than that of the top surface of the uppermost wiring layer in the out-of effective pixel region B here. The above-mentioned heights of the interlayer lenses <b>105</b> make it easy to perform the planarizing of the planarizing layer after that.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">Moreover, the position of the end faces <b>133</b> of the organic small dielectric constant film <b>118</b> and the silicon oxide film <b>119</b> located on the side closest to the effective pixel region A are different from the position of the end face <b>134</b> of the third metal wiring layer <b>104</b> located on the side closest to the effective pixel region A. In other words, at the boundary of the effective pixel region A and the out-of effective pixel region B, the organic small dielectric constant film <b>118</b> and the silicon oxide film <b>119</b> extend toward the effective pixel region A more than the degree of the extension of the third metal wiring layer <b>104</b> toward the effective pixel region A. The stepwise formation of the steps from the effective pixel region A toward the out-of effective pixel region B enables the reduction of the influences of the step from the effective pixel region A to the interlayer lens forming layer and the like formed in the out-of effective pixel region B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">Moreover, since the distance between the interlayer lenses <b>105</b> and the photoelectric conversion elements can be lessened and be made to be uniform in the effective pixel region A in conformity with the manufacturing method as the present embodiment, the dispersion of the sensitivity of the solid-state imaging apparatus can be reduced. Also in the following embodiments, the condensing efficiency of a light receiving surface can be similarly further improved, and higher sensitivity can be realized.
