<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/072,588, filed on Feb. 27, 2008, entitled “Diode and Resistive Memory Device Structures,” which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">This invention relates generally to electronic devices, and more particularly, to designs of diodes and resistive memory devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">2. Discussion of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a type of resistive memory device <b>30</b>. The memory device <b>30</b> includes an electrode <b>32</b>, a switching or active layer <b>34</b> on the electrode <b>32</b>, and an electrode <b>36</b> on the switching layer <b>34</b>. Initially, assuming that the memory device <b>30</b> is unprogrammed, in order to program the memory device <b>30</b>, ground is applied to the electrode <b>32</b>, while a positive voltage is applied to electrode <b>36</b>, so that an electrical potential V<sub>pg </sub>is applied across the memory device <b>30</b> from a higher to a lower electrical potential in the direction from electrode <b>36</b> to electrode <b>32</b>. This causes electronic charge carriers in the form of electrons and/or holes to enter the layer <b>34</b>, to provide that the overall memory device <b>30</b> is in a conductive, low-resistance (programmed) state (A, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Upon removal of such potential the memory device <b>30</b> remains in a conductive or low-resistance state having an on-state resistance illustrated at B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">In the read step of the memory device <b>30</b> in its programmed (conductive) state, an electrical potential V<sub>r </sub>is applied across the memory device <b>30</b> from a higher to a lower electrical potential in the direction from electrode <b>36</b> to electrode <b>32</b>. This electrical potential is less than the electrical potential V<sub>pg </sub>applied across the memory device <b>30</b> for programming (see above). In this situation, the memory device <b>130</b> will readily conduct current, which indicates that the memory device <b>30</b> is in its programmed state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">In order to erase the memory device <b>30</b>, a positive voltage is applied to the electrode <b>32</b>, while the electrode <b>36</b> is held at ground, so that an electrical potential V<sub>er </sub>is applied across the memory device <b>30</b> from a higher to a lower electrical potential in the direction of from electrode <b>32</b> to electrode <b>36</b>. Application of this electrical potential causes electronic charge carriers to leave the layer <b>34</b> (C), switching the layer <b>34</b> to a high-resistance state, so that the overall memory device <b>30</b> is in a high-resistance (erased) state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">In the read step of the memory device <b>30</b> in its erased (substantially non-conductive) state, the electrical potential V<sub>r </sub>is again applied across the memory device <b>30</b> from a higher to a lower electrical potential in the direction from electrode <b>36</b> to electrode <b>32</b> as described above. With the layer <b>34</b> (and memory device <b>30</b>) in a high-resistance or substantially non-conductive state, the memory device <b>30</b> will not conduct significant current, which indicates that the memory device <b>30</b> is in its erased state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">The structure and operation of conventional semiconductor diodes are well known. Typically, a diode <b>20</b> is formed by providing adjoining p and n layers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> of material, to form a p-n junction (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Increasing electrical potential applied across the diode <b>20</b> in the forward direction overcomes the threshold voltage V<sub>th </sub>of the diode <b>20</b>, which then conducts current in the forward direction, the level of current being determined by the (relatively low) on-resistance of the diode <b>20</b>. Increasing electrical potential applied across the diode <b>20</b> in the reverse direction does not cause significant conduction of current until breakdown occurs (at a relatively high voltage), whereupon the diode <b>20</b> then conducts current in the reverse direction (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">Diodes of this type are used as access devices for resistive memory devices in an array <b>40</b> including bit lines BL<b>0</b>, BL<b>1</b>, . . . and word lines WL<b>0</b>, WL<b>1</b>, . . . (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). In certain situations, such as when the diodes <b>20</b> are used as access devices for resistive memory devices <b>30</b> in a three-dimensional memory array (one array layer shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), where resistive memory devices are already fabricated on a previously formed array layer, a low temperature diode fabrication sequence is needed in order not to alter or destroy the operational characteristics of devices already formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">As will be understood, improvements in manufacturing and operational efficiency of such a resistive memory device are being sought, particularly when used in a memory array with access diodes associated therewith.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">Therefore, what is needed is an approach for improving these devices for these particular needs.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">Reference is now made in detail to specific embodiments of the present invention which illustrate the best mode presently contemplated by the inventors for practicing the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-10</figref> illustrate the fabrication of a diode in accordance with the present invention. In this particular embodiment, a Ni layer <b>50</b> is provided to a thickness of approximately 5000 Å (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an oxidation step is undertaken, either thermally or with an O/O<sub>2 </sub>containing plasma such that a NiO<sub>x </sub>oxide layer <b>52</b> is formed to a thickness of 1000-2000 Å on the remaining Ni <b>50</b>A. Next (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), a Ti layer <b>54</b> is deposited on the NiO<sub>x </sub>layer <b>52</b>, and this Ti layer <b>54</b> is fully oxidized (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) to form a TiO<sub>x </sub>layer <b>56</b> on and in contact with the NiO<sub>x </sub>layer <b>52</b>. Finally (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>), a metal layer <b>58</b> is deposited on the TiO<sub>x </sub>layer <b>56</b>, so that the resulting structure <b>59</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is formed. The metal oxide NiO<sub>x </sub>is known to be a p type semiconductor, while the TiO<sub>x </sub>is known to be an n type semiconductor. The TiO<sub>x </sub>and NiO<sub>x </sub>layers form a diode <b>60</b>, while the remaining Ni layer <b>50</b>A and metal layer <b>58</b> form ohmic contact to the diode <b>60</b>. All fabrication steps, including the oxidation steps described above, are undertaken at relatively low temperatures to achieve the object pointed out above. That is, through this low temperature diode fabrication sequence, operational characteristics of devices already formed are not altered, which might very well be the case if higher temperatures were used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">Other metal oxides such as CuO<sub>x </sub>and CoO<sub>x </sub>are also known to be p type semiconductors, while other metal oxides such as ITO and ZnO<sub>x </sub>are known to be n type semiconductors. The process described above could readily be changed to incorporate these oxides as appropriate in forming the overall structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">An alternative to the step described with regard to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. As such, after the structure of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is formed, an oxide switching layer <b>62</b> is provided on the layer <b>56</b>, and a metal layer <b>64</b> is provided on the layer <b>62</b>, forming the overall structure <b>65</b>. In this structure <b>65</b>, again, the layers <b>52</b>, <b>56</b> form a diode <b>60</b>, while the layers <b>56</b>, <b>62</b>, <b>64</b> form a resistive memory device <b>66</b>, with the layer <b>56</b> acting both as a layer of the diode <b>60</b> and an electrode of the resistive memory device <b>66</b>, so that the diode <b>60</b> and resistive memory device <b>66</b> are in series.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows yet another alternative to the approach shown with regard to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Again, starting with the structure of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, and with direct reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a bottom electrode <b>68</b> is formed on the layer <b>56</b>, a switching oxide layer <b>70</b> is formed on the electrode <b>68</b>, and a top electrode <b>72</b> is formed on the switching layer <b>70</b>. This results in the overall structure shown at <b>73</b>. As such, again, the layers <b>52</b>, <b>56</b> form a diode <b>60</b>, while the layers <b>68</b>, <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> form a resistive memory device <b>74</b> in series with that diode <b>60</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-16</figref> illustrate another embodiment of the invention. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a silicon layer <b>80</b> of a first conductivity type is provided. This layer <b>80</b> may be either amorphous silicon, polycrystalline silicon, or epitaxial silicon (including single-crystal epitaxial silicon). Provided on the layer <b>80</b> is another layer <b>82</b> of silicon of a conductivity type opposite the conductivity type of the layer <b>80</b>. This layer may also be amorphous silicon, polycrystalline silicon or epitaxial silicon (including single-crystal epitaxial silicon). These two layers <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> form a diode. Provided on the silicon layer <b>82</b> is an oxide switching layer <b>84</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>), of for example, Al<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub>, HfO<sub>x</sub>, HfSiO<sub>x</sub>, ZrO<sub>x</sub>, TiO<sub>x</sub>, CuO<sub>x</sub>, or Ta<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub>. Provided on this layer <b>84</b> is an electrode <b>86</b> of, for example, metal, i.e., Ni, Co, Pt, Ta, Ti, or W, or a metal nitride, i.e., Tin, Tan, or Wn, or an n type polycrystalline silicon material. This makes up the structure <b>87</b>. In this embodiment, the layers <b>80</b>, <b>82</b> make up a diode <b>88</b>, while the layers <b>82</b>, <b>84</b>, <b>84</b> make up a resistive memory device <b>90</b>, so that the layer <b>82</b> is both a portion of the diode <b>88</b> and an electrode of the resistive memory device <b>90</b>, with the diode <b>88</b> and resistive memory device <b>90</b> in series.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-22</figref> illustrate fabrication of another embodiment of the invention. Initially, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, an electrode <b>100</b> of for example, metal, is provided. A silicon layer <b>102</b> of a first conductivity type, either amorphous or polycrystalline silicon, is provided on the electrode <b>100</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>). With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, an interlayer dielectric <b>104</b> is formed on the silicon layer <b>102</b>, and the interlayer dielectric <b>104</b> is patterned by appropriate photoresist techniques to provide openings therethrough to the silicon layer <b>102</b> lying therebelow (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">With further reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, an implant step is undertaken, using the patterned interlayer dielectric as a mask, to form regions <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B, . . . in the silicon layer <b>102</b> of a conductivity type opposite that of the silicon layer <b>102</b> itself. Next, switching oxide <b>108</b>A, <b>108</b>B, . . . is provided in each of the openings in the interlayer dielectric layer by for example deposition, and a polishing step is undertaken to planarize the resulting structure (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>). Then, an electrode <b>110</b> of metal is provided over the resulting structure (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>). Another silicon layer <b>112</b> is provided over the resulting structure, and the process thus far described is repeated to form the multilayer structure of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">As an example, the silicon of the layer <b>102</b> and the silicon of the implanted region <b>106</b>A form a diode <b>114</b>. The silicon of the implanted region <b>106</b>A, the oxide region <b>108</b>A, and the electrode <b>110</b> form a resistive memory device <b>116</b> in series with that diode <b>114</b>. In this way, a multi-level structure can be formed. As in the formation of the diode of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-10</figref>, all fabrication steps are undertaken at relatively low temperatures to achieve the object pointed out above. That is, through this low temperature diode fabrication sequence, operational characteristics of devices already formed are not altered, which might very well be the case if higher temperatures were used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23-26</figref> illustrate examples of the use of the various embodiments of the present invention. With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the resistive memory device <b>30</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can be placed in series with the diode <b>59</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, so that the resulting structure runs in series between BL<b>0</b> and WL<b>0</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> shows the structure of <b>65</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> connected in series between BL<b>0</b> and WL<b>0</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> illustrates the device <b>73</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> connected in series between BL<b>0</b> and WL<b>0</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> illustrates the device <b>87</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> connected in series between BL<b>0</b> and WL<b>0</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">It will therefore be seen that low-temperature fabrication sequences are provided as desired. Also, various embodiments of resistive memory devices with high manufacturing and operational efficiency are herein provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">The foregoing description of the embodiments of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description.
