<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">As stated above, fabricating memory devices from rewriteable resistivity-switching materials is difficult. For example, many rewriteable resistivity-switching materials are difficult to etch chemically, increasing fabrication costs and complexity associated with their use in integrated circuits.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">In accordance with the present invention, difficult-to-etch-chemically rewriteable resistivity-switching materials may be used within a memory cell without being etched. For example, in at least one embodiment, a memory cell is provided that includes a reversible resistivity-switching material formed using a selective growth process so that the reversible resistivity-switching material may be used within the memory cell without being etched.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">In one or more exemplary embodiments, a reversible resistance-switching element may be formed using titanium oxide as a reversible resistivity-switching material. Titanium oxide films have been shown to be suitable for use in memory cells, as described, for example, in the '939 application, previously incorporated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">Titanium oxide films such as TiO, TiO<sub>2</sub>, TiO<sub>x</sub>, TiO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>, etc., are difficult to etch chemically. In at least one embodiment, through use of a selective growth process, a titanium oxide layer may be used in a reversible resistance-switching element of a memory cell without the titanium oxide layer being etched. For example, a reversible resistance-switching element may be formed by oxidizing a titanium-containing layer, such as titanium nitride, that is easier to pattern and etch than titanium oxide. In this manner, only the underlying titanium-containing layer (e.g., titanium nitride or titanium) is patterned and/or etched prior to oxidation of the titanium-containing layer and not the titanium oxide layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">In some embodiments, titanium oxide may be selectively formed by rapid thermal oxidation of a titanium-containing layer in an oxygen environment such as O<sub>2</sub>, ozone, a combination of the same, or using any other suitable oxidizing species. In other embodiments, titanium oxide may be formed by oxidizing a titanium-containing layer using oxygen diffusion in a chemical vapor deposition (“CVD”) chamber with an ozone or other oxygen source, using gaseous or liquid ozone cleaning, or using any other suitable oxidation process. In any case, the need for etching of titanium oxide layers may be eliminated and memory cell fabrication significantly simplified.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">Other materials may be selectively oxidized in accordance with the present invention to form reversible or one-time-programmable resistivity-switching materials for use in memory cells. For example, a layer of Ta, TaN, Nb, NbN, Al, AlN, Hf, HfN, V, VN, etc., may be deposited on a substrate, patterned, etched and/or oxidized similarly to a titanium-containing layer so as to form a reversible resistivity-switching material such as Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, HfO<sub>2</sub>, V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0006">Exemplary Inventive Memory Cell</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic illustration of an exemplary memory cell <b>100</b> provided in accordance with the present invention. Memory cell <b>100</b> includes a reversible resistance-switching element <b>102</b> coupled to a steering element <b>104</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">Reversible resistance-switching element <b>102</b> includes a reversible resistivity-switching material (not separately shown) having a resistance that may be reversibly switched between two or more states. For example, the reversible resistivity-switching material of reversible resistance-switching element <b>102</b> may be in an initial, low-resistivity state upon fabrication that is switchable to a high-resistivity state upon application of a first voltage and/or current. Application of a second voltage and/or current may return the reversible resistivity-switching material to a low-resistivity state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">Alternatively, reversible resistance-switching element <b>102</b> may be in an initial, high-resistance state upon fabrication that is reversibly switchable to a low-resistance state upon application of the appropriate voltage(s) and/or current(s). When used in a memory cell, one resistance state may represent a binary “0,” while another resistance state may represent a binary “1,” although more than two data/resistance states may be used. Numerous reversible resistivity-switching materials and operation of memory cells employing reversible resistance-switching elements are described, for example, in the '939 application, previously incorporated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">In at least one embodiment of the invention, reversible resistance-switching element <b>102</b> is formed using a selective growth process. As will be described further below, use of a selective growth process allows a reversible resistivity-switching material to be provided within reversible resistance-switching element <b>102</b> without the reversible resistivity-switching material having to be etched. Fabrication of reversible resistance-switching element <b>102</b> thereby is simplified.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">Steering element <b>104</b> may include a thin film transistor, a diode, or another suitable steering element that exhibits non-ohmic conduction by selectively limiting the voltage across and/or the current flow through reversible resistance-switching element <b>102</b>. In this manner, memory cell <b>100</b> may be used as part of a two or three dimensional memory array and data may be written to and/or read from memory cell <b>100</b> without affecting the state of other memory cells in the array.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">Exemplary embodiments of memory cell <b>100</b>, reversible resistance-switching element <b>102</b> and steering element <b>104</b> are described below with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-5</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0007">First Exemplary Embodiment of a Memory Cell</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a simplified perspective view of a first embodiment of a memory cell <b>200</b> provided in accordance with the present invention. With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, memory cell <b>200</b> includes a reversible resistance-switching element <b>202</b> (shown in phantom) coupled in series with a diode <b>204</b> between a first conductor <b>206</b> and a second conductor <b>208</b>. In some embodiments, a barrier layer <b>209</b> such as titanium nitride, tantalum nitride, tungsten nitride, etc., may be provided between reversible resistance-switching element <b>202</b> and diode <b>204</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">As will be described further below, reversible resistance-switching element <b>202</b> is selectively formed so as to simplify fabrication of memory cell <b>200</b>. In at least one embodiment, reversible resistance-switching element <b>202</b> includes at least a portion of a titanium oxide layer formed by oxidizing a titanium-containing layer such as titanium nitride. For example, a titanium nitride layer or another similar form of titanium may be deposited above or below diode <b>204</b>, patterned and etched (e.g., such as with first conductor <b>206</b>). The titanium nitride (or other) layer then may be oxidized to form titanium oxide (e.g., using rapid thermal oxidation or another oxidation process).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a titanium nitride or similar layer <b>210</b> is formed over, and is patterned and etched with, first conductor <b>206</b>. Titanium nitride or similar layer <b>210</b> then is oxidized to form a titanium oxide layer <b>212</b>. A portion of titanium oxide layer <b>212</b> that vertically overlaps and/or aligns with diode <b>204</b> may serve as reversible resistance-switching element <b>202</b> between diode <b>204</b> and first conductor <b>206</b> of memory cell <b>200</b>. In some embodiments, only a portion, such as one or more filaments, of reversible resistance-switching element <b>202</b> may switch and/or be switchable. Titanium oxide layer <b>212</b> may include, for example, TiO, TiO<sub>2</sub>, TiO<sub>x</sub>, TiO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y </sub>or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">While reversible resistance-switching element <b>202</b> is shown as being positioned below diode <b>204</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, it will be understood that in alternative embodiments, reversible resistance-switching element <b>202</b> may be positioned above diode <b>204</b>. Additional details for reversible resistance-switching element <b>202</b> are described below with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">Diode <b>204</b> may include any suitable diode such as a vertical polycrystalline p-n or p-i-n diode, whether upward pointing with an n-region above a p-region of the diode or downward pointing with a p-region above an n-region of the diode. Exemplary embodiments of diode <b>204</b> are described below with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">First and/or second conductor <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> may include any suitable conductive material such as tungsten, any appropriate metal, heavily doped semiconductor material, a conductive silicide, a conductive silicide-germanide, a conductive germanide, or the like. In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, first and second conductors <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> are rail-shaped and extend in different directions (e.g., substantially perpendicular to one another). Other conductor shapes and/or configurations may be used. In some embodiments, barrier layers, adhesion layers, antireflection coatings and/or the like (not shown) may be used with first and/or second conductors <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> to improve device performance and/or aid in device fabrication.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">As stated, other materials may be used to form reversible resistance-switching element <b>202</b>. For example, materials such as Ta, TaN, Nb, NbN, Al, AlN, Hf, HfN, V, VN, etc., may be similarly deposited over (and/or patterned and etched with) first conductor <b>206</b> and then oxidized to form layer <b>212</b>, which includes reversible resistance-switching element <b>202</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a simplified perspective view of a portion of a first memory level <b>214</b> formed from a plurality of memory cells <b>200</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. For simplicity, titanium-containing layer <b>210</b> and titanium oxide layer <b>212</b> are only shown on one of bottom conductors <b>206</b>. Memory array <b>214</b> is a “cross-point” array including a plurality of bit lines (second conductors <b>208</b>) and word lines (first conductors <b>206</b>) to which multiple memory cells are coupled (as shown). Other memory array configurations may be used, as may multiple levels of memory.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> is a simplified perspective view of a portion of a monolithic three dimensional array <b>216</b> that includes a first memory level <b>218</b> positioned below a second memory level <b>220</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, each memory level <b>218</b>, <b>220</b> includes a plurality of memory cells <b>200</b> in a cross-point array. It will be understood that one or more additional layers (e.g., an interlevel dielectric) may be present between first and second memory levels <b>218</b> and <b>220</b>, but are not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> for simplicity. Other memory array configurations may be used, as may additional levels of memory. In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, all diodes may “point” in the same direction, such as upward or downward depending on whether p-i-n diodes having a p-doped region on the bottom or top of the diode are employed, simplifying diode fabrication.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">In some embodiments, the memory levels may be formed, as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,952,030, “High-density three-dimensional memory cell” which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety for all purposes. For instance, the upper conductors of a first memory level may be used as the lower conductors of a second memory level that is positioned above the first memory level as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">In such embodiments, the diodes on adjacent memory levels preferably point in opposite directions as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/692,151, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,767,499, filed Mar. 27, 2007 and titled “Large Array Of Upward Pointing P-I-N Diodes Having Large And Uniform Current” (hereinafter “the '151 application”), which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety for all purposes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">For example, the diodes of first memory level <b>218</b> may be upward pointing diodes as indicated by arrow A<sub>1 </sub>(e.g., with p regions at the bottom of the diodes), while the diodes of second memory level <b>220</b> may be downward pointing diodes as indicated by arrow A<sub>2 </sub>(e.g., with n regions at the bottom of the diodes), or vice versa.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">A monolithic three dimensional memory array is one in which multiple memory levels are formed above a single substrate, such as a wafer, with no intervening substrates. The layers forming one memory level are deposited or grown directly over the layers of an existing level or levels. In contrast, stacked memories have been constructed by forming memory levels on separate substrates and adhering the memory levels atop each other, as in Leedy, U.S. Pat. No. 5,915,167, “Three dimensional structure memory.” The substrates may be thinned or removed from the memory levels before bonding, but as the memory levels are initially formed over separate substrates, such memories are not true monolithic three dimensional memory arrays.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross-sectional view of an exemplary embodiment of memory cell <b>200</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, memory cell <b>200</b> includes reversible resistance-switching element <b>202</b> (e.g., a portion of a layer of reversible resistivity-switching material, namely titanium oxide layer <b>212</b> in this embodiment), diode <b>204</b> and first and second conductors <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>. Reversible resistance-switching element <b>202</b> may be a portion of titanium oxide layer <b>212</b> that vertically overlies and/or overlaps with diode <b>204</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, reversible resistance-switching element <b>202</b> is formed by a selective growth process. For example, titanium oxide layer <b>212</b> may be selectively formed on titanium-containing layer <b>210</b> by oxidizing titanium-containing layer <b>210</b>. In this manner, only titanium-containing layer <b>210</b>, and not titanium oxide layer <b>212</b>, is etched, such as during the pattern and etch step(s) for first conductor <b>206</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">Titanium-containing layer <b>210</b> may be oxidized by any suitable process. For instance, titanium-containing layer <b>210</b> may be oxidized using thermal oxidation in oxygen, ozone, a combination of the same or another oxygen source (e.g., using rapid thermal oxidation). Alternatively or additionally, titanium-containing layer <b>210</b> may be oxidized using oxygen diffusion in a CVD chamber with an ozone or other oxygen source, using gaseous or liquid ozone cleaning, or using any other suitable oxidation process to form titanium oxide. As stated, other reversible resistance-switching materials may be similarly formed by oxidizing Ta, TaN, Nb, NbN, Al, AlN, Hf, HfN, V, VN, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">In one exemplary embodiment, rapid thermal oxidation may be performed at a temperature of about 300° C. to about 800° C. for about one second to about 5 minutes at an oxygen flow rate of about 2 sccm to about 40 sccm, depending on the desired oxide thickness and/or other properties. Other oxidizing species, temperatures, times and/or flow rates may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">Oxidation by ozone diffusion in a CVD chamber may be performed at a temperature of about 300° C. to about 800° C., more preferably at a temperature of about 350° C. to about 450° C., for about 2 minutes to about 4 hours, more preferably for about 15 to 25 minutes, at a suitable ozone flow rate, such as between about 10 and 60 sccm, depending on the desired oxide thickness and/or other properties. Other oxidizing species, temperatures, times and/or flow rates may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">In each of the above cases, only titanium-containing layer <b>210</b> is patterned and etched, and the need for etching of titanium oxide layers is eliminated. Memory cell fabrication is thereby significantly simplified. Further, any desired thickness of titanium oxide may be formed. In some embodiments, a titanium oxide layer thickness of about 500 angstroms or less, and more preferably about 300 angstroms or less, is employed for reversible resistance-switching element <b>202</b> (although other thickness ranges may be used).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">As stated, diode <b>204</b> may be a vertical p-n or p-i-n diode, which may either point upward or downward. In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> in which adjacent memory levels share conductors, adjacent memory levels preferably have diodes that point in opposite directions such as downward-pointing p-i-n diodes for a first memory level and upward-pointing p-i-n diodes for an adjacent, second memory level (or vice versa).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">In some embodiments, diode <b>204</b> may be formed from a polycrystalline semiconductor material such as polysilicon, a polycrystalline silicon-germanium alloy, polygermanium or any other suitable material. For example, diode <b>204</b> may include a heavily doped n+ polysilicon region <b>302</b>, a lightly doped or an intrinsic (unintentionally doped) polysilicon region <b>304</b> above n+ polysilicon region <b>302</b> and a heavily doped, p+ polysilicon region <b>306</b> above intrinsic region <b>304</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">In some embodiments, a thin (e.g., a few hundred angstroms or less) germanium and/or silicon-germanium alloy layer (not shown), with about 10 at % or more of germanium when using a silicon-germanium alloy layer, may be formed on n+ polysilicon region <b>302</b> to prevent and/or reduce dopant migration from n+ polysilicon region <b>302</b> into intrinsic region <b>304</b>, as described, for example, in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/298,331, filed Dec. 9, 2005, and titled “Deposited Semiconductor Structure To Minimize N-Type Dopant Diffusion And Method Of Making” (hereinafter “the '331 application”), which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety for all purposes. It will be understood that the locations of the n+ and p+ regions may be reversed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">In some embodiments, a barrier layer <b>308</b> such as titanium nitride, tantalum nitride, tungsten nitride, etc., may be formed between titanium oxide layer <b>212</b> and n+ region <b>302</b> (e.g., to prevent and/or reduce migration of metal atoms into the polysilicon regions). Use of such a metal barrier layer may form an unwanted rectifying contact between barrier layer <b>308</b> and titanium oxide layer <b>212</b>. Accordingly, in some embodiments, a thin conductive layer (not shown), such as titanium, nickel, other conductive materials, etc., may be formed between titanium oxide layer <b>212</b> and barrier layer <b>308</b> (e.g., for work function tuning, to reduce or prevent formation of a rectifying contact).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">When diode <b>204</b> is formed from deposited silicon (e.g., amorphous or polycrystalline), a silicide layer <b>310</b> may be formed on diode <b>204</b> to place the deposited silicon in a low resistivity state, as fabricated. Such a low resistivity state allows for easier programming of memory cell <b>200</b> as a large voltage is not required to switch the deposited silicon to a low resistivity state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">For example, a silicide-forming metal layer <b>312</b> such as titanium or cobalt, may be deposited on p+ polysilicon region <b>306</b>. During a subsequent anneal step (described below) employed to crystallize the deposited silicon that forms diode <b>204</b>, silicide-forming metal layer <b>312</b> and the deposited silicon of diode <b>204</b> interact to form silicide layer <b>310</b>, consuming all or a portion of silicide-forming metal layer <b>312</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">As described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,176,064, “Memory Cell Comprising a Semiconductor Junction Diode Crystallized Adjacent to a Silicide,” which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, silicide-forming materials such as titanium and cobalt react with deposited silicon during annealing to form a silicide layer. The lattice spacings of titanium silicide and cobalt silicide are close to that of silicon, and it appears that such silicide layers may serve as “crystallization templates” or “seeds” for adjacent deposited silicon as the deposited silicon crystallizes (e.g., silicide layer <b>310</b> enhances the crystalline structure of silicon diode <b>204</b> during annealing). Lower resistivity silicon thereby is provided. Similar results may be achieved for silicon-germanium alloy and/or germanium diodes.</div>
