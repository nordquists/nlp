<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates generally to semiconductor memories. More specifically, controlled localized defect paths for resistive memories are described.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Nonvolatile memories are memories that retain their contents even when unpowered. Nonvolatile memories have a variety of uses, from storage for portable devices to rewriteable memories in embedded systems. Several types of nonvolatile memories are commonly available, including electronically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM)-type memories such as flash memory. These memories can be slow and are therefore of limited utility as the throughput requirements of devices using nonvolatile memories increase.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Resistive random access memory (ReRAM) is an emerging memory type that is nonvolatile but potentially fast enough to replace both memories that are currently nonvolatile (e.g., flash memories), and random access memories (e.g., dynamic RAM) that currently use volatile memory technologies. ReRAM is a memory element that changes resistance when a voltage is applied across the element. One voltage (e.g., a “set” voltage V<sub>set</sub>) is used to switch to a low resistance state, while another voltage (e.g., a “reset” voltage V<sub>reset</sub>) is used to switch to a high resistance state. Another voltage can be applied to determine the resistance of the memory element, thereby reading the contents of the memory element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">In addition to set and reset voltages, various other operating parameters (e.g., on and off current ratios, forming voltages, etc.) of a ReRAM memory element can affect the performance of the memory element. For example, it may be desirable to use a ReRAM memory element that has low set, reset, and forming voltages, while having a high on and off current ratio. Thus, what is needed is a ReRAM memory element that has improved control over critical operating parameters.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">A detailed description of one or more embodiments is provided below along with accompanying figures. The detailed description is provided in connection with such embodiments, but is not limited to any particular example. The scope is limited only by the claims and numerous alternatives, modifications, and equivalents are encompassed. Numerous specific details are set forth in the following description in order to provide a thorough understanding. These details are provided for the purpose of example and the described techniques may be practiced according to the claims without some or all of these specific details. For the purpose of clarity, technical material that is known in the technical fields related to the embodiments has not been described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the description.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">According to various embodiments, a resistive switching nonvolatile memory including controlled localized defect paths is described. Switching parameters of the memory can be improved and greater control exerted thereover by forming localized defect paths in a metal oxide layer of the ReRAM memory element. In some embodiments of the invention, the localized defect paths can be created by selectively altering the metal oxide layer, for example using ion implantation or another doping process (e.g. co-sputtering, alloy sputtering, ALD deposition, etc.). A metal oxide layer of the memory element can be altered using masking techniques to form the localized paths in some areas of the metal oxide layer, while other areas of the metal oxide layer are not altered. The localized defect paths can enhance the operation of a ReRAM element using any type of conduction mechanism: percolation paths, filamentary, ion transport, trap modulated space charge limited current (SCLC), etc. In addition, localized defect paths in the metal oxide layers can be tailored to gain greater control over a variety of characteristics of the memory element, including improvements in set and reset voltages, on/off current ratio, forming voltages, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0006">I. Memory Structure</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a memory array <b>100</b> of resistive switching memory elements <b>102</b>. Memory array <b>100</b> may be part of a memory device or other integrated circuit. Memory array <b>100</b> is an example of potential memory configurations; it is understood that several other configurations are possible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">Read and write circuitry may be connected to memory elements <b>102</b> using signal lines <b>104</b> and orthogonal signal lines <b>106</b>. Signal lines such as signal lines <b>104</b> and signal lines <b>106</b> are sometimes referred to as word lines and bit lines and are used to read and write data into the elements <b>102</b> of array <b>100</b>. Individual memory elements <b>102</b> or groups of memory elements <b>102</b> can be addressed using appropriate sets of signal lines <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>. Memory element <b>102</b> may be formed from one or more layers <b>108</b> of materials, as is described in further detail below. In addition, the memory arrays shown can be stacked in a vertical fashion to make multi-layer 3-D memory arrays.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">Any suitable read and write circuitry and array layout scheme may be used to construct a non-volatile memory device from resistive switching memory elements such as element <b>102</b>. For example, horizontal and vertical lines <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> may be connected directly to the terminals of resistive switching memory elements <b>102</b>. This is merely illustrative.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">If desired, other electrical devices may be associated (i.e., be one or more of the layers <b>108</b>) with each memory element <b>102</b> (see, e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>). These devices, which are sometimes referred to as current steering elements, may include, for example, diodes, p-i-n diodes, silicon diodes, silicon p-i-n diodes, transistors, Schottky diodes, etc. Current steering elements may be connected in series in any suitable locations in memory element <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0007">II. Memory Operation</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0008">A. Basic Operation</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">During a read operation, the state of a memory element <b>102</b> can be sensed by applying a sensing voltage (i.e., a “read” voltage) to an appropriate set of signal lines <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>. Depending on its history, a memory element that is addressed in this way may be in either a high resistance state or a low resistance state. The resistance of the memory element therefore determines what digital data is being stored by the memory element. If the memory element has a low resistance, for example, the memory element may be said to contain a logic one (i.e., a “1” bit). If, on the other hand, the memory element has a high resistance, the memory element may be said to contain a logic zero (i.e., a “0” bit). During a write operation, the state of a memory element can be changed by application of suitable write signals to an appropriate set of signal lines <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a logarithm of current (I) versus voltage (V) plot <b>200</b> for a memory element <b>102</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> illustrates the set and reset operations to change the contents of the memory element <b>102</b>. Initially, memory element <b>102</b> may be in a high resistance state (“HRS”, e.g., storing a logic zero). In this state, the current versus voltage characteristic of memory element <b>102</b> is represented by solid line HRS <b>202</b>. The high resistance state of memory element <b>102</b> can be sensed by read and write circuitry using signal lines <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>. For example, read and write circuitry may apply a read voltage V<sub>READ </sub>to memory element <b>102</b> and can sense the resulting “off” current I<sub>OFF </sub>that flows through memory element <b>102</b>. When it is desired to store a logic one in memory element <b>102</b>, memory element <b>102</b> can be placed into its low-resistance state. This may be accomplished by using read and write circuitry to apply a set voltage V<sub>SET </sub>across signal lines <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>. Applying V<sub>SET </sub>to memory element <b>102</b> causes memory element <b>102</b> to switch to its low resistance state, as indicated by dashed line <b>206</b>. In this region, the memory element <b>102</b> is changed so that, following removal of the set voltage V<sub>SET</sub>, memory element <b>102</b> is characterized by low resistance curve LRS <b>204</b>. As is described further below, in one embodiment the change in the resistive state of memory element <b>102</b> may be trap-mediated in a metal oxide material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">The low resistance state of memory element <b>102</b> can be sensed using read and write circuitry. When a read voltage V<sub>READ </sub>is applied to resistive switching memory element <b>102</b>, read and write circuitry will sense the relatively high “on” current value I<sub>ON</sub>, indicating that memory element <b>102</b> is in its low resistance state. When it is desired to store a logic zero in memory element <b>102</b>, the memory element can once again be placed in its high resistance state by applying a reset voltage V<sub>RESET </sub>to memory element <b>102</b>. When read and write circuitry applies V<sub>RESET </sub>to memory element <b>102</b>, memory element <b>102</b> enters its high resistance state HRS, as indicated by dashed line <b>208</b>. When the reset voltage V<sub>RESET </sub>is removed from memory element <b>102</b>, memory element <b>102</b> will once again be characterized by high resistance line HRS <b>204</b>. Unipolar and bipolar voltage pulses can be used in the programming of the memory element <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">A forming voltage V<sub>FORM </sub>is a voltage applied to the memory element <b>102</b> to ready the memory element <b>102</b> for use. Some memory elements described herein may need a forming event that includes the application of a voltage greater than or equal to the set voltage or reset voltage. Once the memory element <b>102</b> initially switches, the set and reset voltages can be used to change the resistance state of the memory element <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">The bistable resistance of resistive switching memory element <b>102</b> makes memory element <b>102</b> suitable for storing digital data. Because no changes take place in the stored data in the absence of application of the voltages V<sub>SET </sub>and V<sub>RESET</sub>, memory formed from elements such as element <b>102</b> is non-volatile. As can be appreciated, it is desirable for memory element <b>102</b> to have a large difference between off current and on current (i.e., a high I<sub>ON</sub>/I<sub>OFF </sub>ratio), which causes the on and off states of the memory element to be more discrete and easily detectable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a current (I) versus voltage (V) plot <b>220</b> for a memory element <b>102</b> that demonstrates a resistance state change. The plot <b>220</b> shows a voltage ramp applied to the memory element <b>102</b> along the x-axis and the resulting current along a y-axis. The line <b>222</b> represents the response of an Ohmic material when the ramped voltage is applied. An Ohmic response is undesirable, since there is no discrete voltage at which the set or reset occurs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">Generally, a more abrupt response like graph <b>224</b> is desired. The graph <b>224</b> begins with an Ohmic response <b>224</b> <i>a</i>, and then curves sharply upward <b>224</b> <i>b</i>. The graph <b>224</b> may represent a set operation, where the memory element <b>102</b> switches from the HRS <b>202</b> to the LRS <b>204</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0009">B. Conduction Mechanisms</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">Conduction paths can be formed in metal oxide layers of a metal-insulator-metal (MIM)-style resistive-switching memory element. As used herein, MIM-style resistive-switching memory elements can also include those containing conductive semiconductor layers (e.g. metal-insulator-semiconductor or MIS structures). Conduction paths can be used to increase the conductivity of a resistive-switching memory element during a set operation, thereby reducing the resistance and changing the value stored by the memory element. Various conduction mechanisms can be used with the embodiments described herein, including percolation paths, filaments, ion transport, and trap-modulated SCLC. The embodiments are not limited to any specific conduction mechanism, and tailored defect paths, including tailoring spatial location, can be used to enhance the aforementioned types of conduction mechanism.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">Some embodiments can use percolation paths to change the resistance of the memory element. In some embodiments, and without being bound by theory, non-metallic percolation paths are formed during a set operation and broken during a reset operation. For example, during a set operation, the memory element <b>102</b> switches to a low resistance state. The percolation paths that are formed by filling traps which would otherwise impeded current flow increase the conductivity of the metal oxide, thereby reducing (i.e., changing) the resistivity. The voltage represented by <b>224</b> <i>b </i>is the set voltage. At the set voltage, the traps are filled and there is a large jump in current as the resistivity of the metal oxide decreases. Percolation paths are illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">The set voltage shown here is very discrete (i.e., vertical), which is desirable to ensure the switching of the memory element occurs at a repeatable voltage. Additionally, a high ratio of on current to off current (i.e., a high I<sub>ON</sub>/I<sub>OFF </sub>ratio), for example 10 or greater, is desirable because it indicates a large difference in the resistivity of the metal oxide when in the HRS and LRS, making the state of the memory element easier to determine. Finally, it is desirable to have low set, reset, and switching voltages in order to avoid damage to the memory elements and to be compatible with complementary device elements such as diodes and/or transistors in series with the memory element <b>102</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">In some embodiments, the percolation paths can be described as non-metallic. With metallic materials, resistivity decreases with lower temperature. The memory elements <b>102</b> described herein demonstrate an increase in resistance (e.g., the LRS) with decreases in operating temperatures. In other embodiments, metallic filaments, ion transport (e.g., using ion reservoirs) can be enhanced by localized defect path formation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0010">III. Memory Element Including Localized Defect Paths</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">As is described further below, native and introduced defects in a metal oxide layer of an MIM-style memory element can be exploited to form a working ReRAM element. Defects, such as traps (i.e., electrically active defects), can form charge imbalances in a crystal structure of a metal oxide material. Traps can be filled and emptied by applying set and reset voltages to change the resistivity of the metal oxide layer, thereby changing the value stored by the memory element. The memory element <b>102</b>, as described above, is connected to signal lines <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>, and includes multiple layers <b>108</b>. The layers <b>108</b> can include metal and insulator layers in an MIM structure, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3E</figref> illustrates the formation of a memory element <b>102</b> according to various embodiments described herein. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flowchart describing a process <b>400</b> for forming the memory element <b>102</b>. The memory element <b>102</b> described herein is an MIM-style nonvolatile memory element that exhibits changes in resistance when voltage is applied across the electrodes of the memory element <b>102</b>. It is believed that the formation of conduction paths such as percolation paths, trap-modulated SCLC, filaments, or ion transport paths can be used to effect the change in resistivity of a metal oxide insulator. To help form and exert greater control over the conduction paths, defect paths can be created using the techniques described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> illustrates a signal line <b>106</b>, an electrode <b>304</b>, and a metal oxide layer <b>306</b> that may form a portion of the memory element <b>102</b>. The signal line <b>106</b> may be tungsten or another conductor and may be a bit line or a word line in a memory array, for example. The electrode <b>304</b> is a conductive layer (e.g., one of the layers <b>108</b>) in the memory element <b>102</b>, and may comprise any electrode material such as titanium nitride, doped silicon, doped polysilicon, tungsten, tungsten nitride, molybdenum nitride, tantalum nitride, molybdenum oxide, cobalt silicide, nickel silicide, palladium silicide, platinum silicide, titanium silicide, other silicides, nickel, platinum, iridium, iridium oxide, ruthenium, or ruthenium oxide. According to certain embodiments, and as described further below (see e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>), the electrode <b>304</b> may have a different work function than the other electrode in the memory element <b>102</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the work function of one electrode can be 0.1 to 2.0 eV, 0.1 to 1.0 eV, 0.4 to 0.6 eV, etc. greater than the work function of the other electrode. An example can be a memory element <b>102</b> that includes an n-type polysilicon electrode (work function=4.1 to 4.15 eV) and a titanium nitride electrode (work function=4.5 to 4.65 eV).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">The memory element <b>102</b> can use unipolar or bipolar switching voltages. In some embodiments, for example, bipolar switching voltages are used and a positive reset pulse (relative to a common electrical reference) is applied to the higher work function electrode, and a negative set pulse (relative to the common electrical reference) is applied to the higher work function electrode. However, in other embodiments, a negative reset pulse and a positive set pulse can be applied to the higher work function electrode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">In operation <b>402</b>, the electrode <b>304</b> is formed. The electrode <b>304</b> can be formed on a substrate, for example, a silicon substrate that may include one or more layers already formed thereon. The electrode <b>304</b> may be formed over the signal line <b>106</b>. The electrode <b>304</b> can be titanium nitride, doped silicon, doped polysilicon, tungsten, tungsten nitride, molybdenum nitride, tantalum nitride, molybdenum oxide, cobalt silicide, nickel silicide, palladium silicide, platinum silicide, titanium silicide, other silicides, nickel, platinum, iridium, iridium oxide, ruthenium, ruthenium oxide, or other appropriate materials. In one example, a titanium nitride electrode is formed using PVD or another process described above. For example, the electrode <b>304</b> can be sputtered by using a metal target at 150-500 W with a pressure of 2-10 mTorr for a deposition rate of approximately 0.5-5 {acute over (Å)}/s. These specifications are given as examples, the specifications can vary greatly depending on the material to be deposited, the tool used to deposit the material, and the desired speed of deposition. The duration of the sputtering can determine the thickness of the electrode. Other processing techniques, such as atomic layer deposition (ALD), pulse laser deposition (PLD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), plasma enhanced CVD (PECVD), plasma enhanced ALD (PEALD), evaporation, etc. can also be used to deposit the electrode <b>304</b>. The electrode <b>304</b> may have a thickness of, but not limited to, for example 10 Å-2000 Å</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">The metal oxide layer <b>306</b> is an insulator layer in the MIM-style stack. The metal oxide layer <b>306</b> may include one or more layers of metal oxide material, including one or more of hafnium oxide, titanium oxide, aluminum oxide, zirconium oxide, niobium oxide, hafnium titanium oxide, hafnium aluminum oxide, lanthanum oxide, and molybdenum oxide. In some embodiments, and as is further explained below, it may be desirable to use a metal oxide layer having a bandgap greater than 4 electron volts (eV), which can be scalable and have other benefits. In some embodiments the metal oxide layer <b>306</b> may include multiple layers of different metal oxide materials. The metal oxide layer <b>306</b> may comprise multiple layers; for example layer <b>306</b>-<b>2</b> and either or both of layers <b>306</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>306</b>-<b>3</b>. The layers <b>306</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>306</b>-<b>3</b> may be modified portions of the base layer <b>306</b>-<b>2</b>. For example, the metal oxide layer <b>306</b> may be a deposited hafnium oxide layer, and the layers <b>306</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>306</b>-<b>3</b> include other materials created through doping by diffusion. In other embodiments, the layers <b>306</b>-<b>1</b> and/or <b>306</b>-<b>3</b> may be separately deposited layers, and may therefore include different metal oxide materials (e.g., titanium oxide with hafnium oxide). The thicknesses of the layers <b>306</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>306</b>-<b>2</b>, and <b>306</b>-<b>3</b> may differ depending on the design of the memory element <b>300</b>. For example, the thickness of the entire metal oxide layer <b>306</b> may range from 50-1000 Å, while the layers <b>306</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>306</b>-<b>3</b> may be 5-50 Å. See the description of FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>C for more details on multiple layer and material systems. It is understood that any resistive switching memory elements can be used with the embodiments described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3E</figref> and <b>4</b>, including all of those described elsewhere herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">In operation <b>404</b>, the metal oxide layer <b>306</b> is formed. The metal oxide layer similarly can be deposited using wet or dry techniques such as those described above. The metal oxide layer <b>306</b> can be deposited monolithically or as separate layers of different metal oxide materials depending on the design of memory element <b>300</b>. For example, the metal oxide layer <b>306</b> may be a 5-500 Å hafnium oxide layer formed using reactive sputtering with a metal hafnium target, a power of 100-1000 Watts (W), and a 20-60% oxygen atmosphere for a deposition rate of 0.1-1.0 {acute over (Å)}/s. It is understood that the specifications for sputtering can vary greatly depending on tool used and desired deposition rate, and that these specifications are given as examples. In other embodiments a hafnium oxide target can be used, and different thicknesses can be formed. In a further embodiment, ALD can be used, for example to form a hafnium oxide layer using hafnium precursors such as tetrakis (diethylamido) hafnium (TDEAHf), tetrakis (dimethylamido) hafnium (TDMAHf), tetrakis (ethylmethylamido) hafnium (TEMAHf) or hafnium chloride (HfCl<sub>4</sub>) and a suitable oxidant such as water, oxygen plasma, or ozone. Other deposition techniques, such as PLD, CVD, PECVD, PEALD, or evaporation can also be used. These deposition techniques can also be used to deposit other metal oxides (e.g., titanium oxide, tantalum oxide, aluminum oxide, etc.) described herein. Specifications for depositing these materials depend on the tool used and the material to be deposited.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> illustrates the memory element <b>102</b> include a masking material <b>308</b> deposited thereon. In operation <b>406</b>, the metal oxide layer <b>306</b> is masked to create concealed regions <b>310</b> <i>a </i>and exposed regions <b>310</b> <i>b </i>of the metal oxide layer <b>306</b>. The exposed regions <b>310</b> <i>b </i>are areas of the surface of the metal oxide layer <b>306</b> that are directly exposed to processing, and the concealed regions <b>310</b> <i>a </i>are areas of the surface of the metal oxide layer <b>306</b> that are covered by the masking material <b>308</b>, thereby blocking processing such as ion implantation. The masking can be accomplished using the masking material <b>308</b> such as a photoresist, a selective masking material, or other materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">If the masking material <b>308</b> is photoresist, for example, the masking can be performed using known photolithographic techniques. For example, in one known photolithographic technique, a layer of photoresist is deposited on the metal oxide layer <b>306</b>. The photoresist is then exposed to light through a mask such that certain portions of the photoresist are exposed to light and become soluble. The solubilized portions of the photoresist are then removed using an etch process, and the remaining photoresist material covers the concealed regions <b>310</b> <i>a </i>of the metal oxide layer <b>306</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">Having concealed regions <b>310</b> <i>a </i>of the metal oxide layer <b>306</b> allows the targeted creation of defect paths in the metal oxide layer <b>306</b> beneath the exposed regions <b>310</b> <i>b</i>. For example, the defect paths can be created in operation <b>408</b> by altering the exposed regions <b>310</b> <i>b </i>of the metal oxide layer <b>106</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> illustrates the alteration of the metal oxide layer <b>306</b> according to an embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">Alterations <b>312</b> can include, for example, ion implantation. The ion implantation is performed over the entire surface area of the metal oxide layer <b>306</b> and the masking material <b>308</b> absorbs the ions implanted over the concealed regions <b>310</b> <i>a</i>, while ions are implanted into the metal oxide layer <b>306</b> beneath the exposed regions <b>310</b> <i>b</i>, thereby creating targeted, localized defect paths. The thickness of the masking layer <b>308</b> can be selected so that it is sufficient to absorb the ions and not allow them to penetrate into the metal oxide layer <b>306</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">Ion implantation energy, dose, and other variables can affect the depth of penetration of implanted ions. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> illustrates the bombardment of ions <b>502</b> into a crystal structure <b>504</b>. The crystal structure <b>504</b> may be, for example, the metal oxide layer <b>306</b>. The ions <b>502</b> disrupt atoms <b>506</b> in the crystal structure to create defects in the lattice. For example, various types of defects can include metal interstitials (Me<sup>+</sup>), metal substitionals (e.g. Al<sub>Hf</sub>), oxygen interstitials (O<sub>I</sub>″), and oxygen vacancies (V<sub>O</sub>″).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">Metal interstitials can be created by implanting metal ions, for example metal ions comprising a same metal as the metal of the metal oxide layer. Hafnium (Hf<sup>+4</sup>) ions can be implanted into hafnium oxide to create hafnium interstitials (Hf<sub>I</sub> <sup>+4</sup>). The hafnium interstitials create a +4 charge imbalance in the metal oxide layer, thereby forming part of a defect path that can be used to create a percolation path with the application of a set voltage. In other embodiments, ion transport and filamentary mechanisms can also be enhanced or enabled by these techniques. For example, the defects can form part of a filament.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">Other ions that can be implanted to create defects and defect paths include oxygen ions, different metal ions (e.g., Al<sup>+3 </sup>into hafnium oxide), negatively charged ions (e.g. halide ions such as F<sup>−</sup>, Cl<sup>−</sup>, etc.), which can be used to create more charge imbalances in the metal oxide layer <b>306</b>. Without being bound by theory, the defects serve as traps which can modulate current flow in a trap-mediated SCLC mechanism whereby unfilled traps impede current flow. The traps can be filled during a set operation to reduce the resistivity of the metal oxide layer <b>306</b>, thereby changing the stored value. Ion implantation serves to create a higher density of spatially distributed traps of desired energy levels. The energy levels can affect retention I<sub>ON</sub>/I<sub>OFF </sub>ratios, and programming voltages. Higher densities of traps can cause greater changes in resistivity when they are filled, increasing the on and off current ratio, thereby increasing the distinction between the on and off states of the memory element <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">Implant energy can be selected to vary the depth that ions penetrate the memory element <b>102</b>. For example, using a higher implant power can result in implanted ions penetrating through the entire thickness of the masking layer <b>308</b> and into the concealed regions <b>310</b> <i>a </i>of the metal oxide layer <b>306</b>. In some embodiments, the implant power can be selected to avoid implantation into the concealed regions <b>310</b> <i>a</i>. In another embodiment, the implant energies are chosen to control the extent of the implantation through the metal oxide layer <b>306</b>. For example, the energies can be chosen to only implant through the layer <b>306</b>-<b>1</b>, or through layers <b>306</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>306</b>-<b>2</b>, or through the entire metal oxide layer <b>306</b>, or some other desired amount of implantation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> illustrates ion stopping distribution and vacancies produced when implanting into a metal oxide layer. For example, the distribution graphs <b>520</b>, <b>530</b>, and <b>540</b> show the depth of implantation of 9 keV, 22.5 keV, and 55 keV hafnium ions, respectively, into a 350 Å hafnium oxide layer. Using the graphs <b>520</b>-<b>570</b> or similar graphs for hafnium oxide or other materials, and appropriate implant energy can be chosen. Additionally, an appropriate thickness of photoresist or other masking material can be chosen using similar data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">The x-axis of the graphs <b>520</b>, <b>530</b>, and <b>540</b> represents the depth of the target (i.e., the depth of the hafnium oxide layer (e.g., the layer <b>306</b>) and the electrode), and the y-axis of the graphs <b>520</b>, <b>530</b>, and <b>540</b> represents the density of implanted ions in the hafnium oxide layer per dose of ion implantation (defined as the number of ions implanted per unit area of the surface film). The lines <b>522</b>, <b>532</b>, and <b>542</b> represent the interface between the bottom electrode and the hafnium oxide layer (i.e., 350 Å). Using these graphs, for example, an implantation energy can be chosen that yields the desired ion penetration into a metal oxide layer. Although hafnium implantation into hafnium oxide is shown here, it is understood that similar profiles can be created for other ion and metal oxide combinations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">The graphs <b>550</b>, <b>560</b>, and <b>570</b> show the number of vacancies at a given depth in the hafnium oxide layer. The x-axis of the graphs represents the depth of the target, and the y-axis represents a number of vacancies in the crystal lattice. The lines <b>552</b>, <b>562</b>, and <b>572</b> represent the interface between the bottom electrode and the hafnium oxide layer (i.e., 350 Å).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">Within the range from the minimum available implant energy to this maximum energy one may tailor the profile of the implanted ions (e.g., using the graphs <b>520</b>, <b>530</b>, and <b>540</b>) and the vacancies (e.g., using the graphs <b>550</b>, <b>560</b>, and <b>570</b>) produced by changing the energy of the implantation and the dose of ions implanted as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. That is to say, the lower the ion implantation energy, the greater the localization of the implanted ions and vacancies produced is near the upper interface, and the lower the total number of vacancies produced is. Furthermore, increasing the dose of the implantation increases the number of implanted ions along with the number of vacancies produced. In another embodiment, it is desirable to have the defects (or traps) homogenously produced within the exposed regions <b>310</b> <i>b </i>of the metal oxide layer <b>306</b>. Plasma immersion implantation can also be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">Alterations <b>312</b> can also include annealing in operation <b>410</b>. Any type of anneal can be used, for example, rapid thermal annealing (RTA) at a temperature of between 100° and 1000° Celsius. Other anneals can include rapid thermal oxidation (RTO), which can fill oxygen vacancies, forming gas annealing (e.g., annealing in mixture of H<sub>2 </sub>and N<sub>2 </sub>gas), vacuum annealing, etc. The anneal can further alter existing defects or create new defects. The anneal can, in some embodiments, lower the forming voltage of the memory element <b>102</b>. Annealing can also create stresses within the metal oxide layer <b>306</b>, which can create or change defects within the metal oxide layer <b>306</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">After the annealing is completed in operation <b>410</b>, a localized channel has been formed in operation <b>412</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref> illustrates the memory element <b>300</b> once the masking material <b>308</b> has been removed and localized channel or localized defect paths <b>314</b> have been formed underneath the exposed regions <b>310</b> <i>b</i>. The defect paths <b>314</b> include higher concentrations of defects than the surrounding regions of the metal oxide layer <b>306</b>. The defect paths <b>314</b> can be used to tailor the switching properties of the memory element <b>300</b>. For example, the defect paths <b>314</b> create localized regions in the metal oxide layer <b>306</b> that allow for the creation of conduction paths (e.g., percolation paths, filaments, ion transport) and greater control over set, reset, and forming voltages. It is believed that by localizing the conduction paths, greater conductivity changes can be made with smaller voltages, thereby reducing set and reset voltages and increasing on and off current ratios.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">In operation <b>414</b>, an electrode <b>316</b> is deposited. The electrode <b>316</b> can be any appropriate electrode material, for example titanium nitride, doped silicon, doped polysilicon, tungsten, tungsten nitride, molybdenum nitride, tantalum nitride, molybdenum oxide, cobalt silicide, nickel silicide, palladium silicide, platinum silicide, titanium silicide, other silicides, nickel, platinum, iridium, iridium oxide, ruthenium, or ruthenium oxide. In some embodiments, as described above, one electrode has a higher effective work function than the other. For example, the electrode <b>316</b> can be platinum, while the electrode <b>304</b> is titanium nitride, or the electrode <b>316</b> can be titanium nitride while the electrode <b>304</b> is appropriately doped polysilicon.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0011">IV. Switching Material Properties</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">Material properties and switching mechanisms of several types of resistive-switching memory elements are described below. For example, a memory element that uses bulk-mediated switching and non-metallic percolation paths is described. It is understood, however, that the technique of forming localized channels and defect paths as described above can be used with any type of resistive switching memory element using any switching mechanism (e.g., percolation path, filament, ion transport, etc.). It is further understood that some memory elements may also be controlled by interface-mediated effects, or by some combination of bulk and interface effects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0012">A. Bulk-Mediated Switching</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">In its most basic form, the layers <b>108</b> of the memory element <b>102</b> include two electrodes (each having one or more materials and/or layers) and one or more layers of one or more metal oxides disposed in between. The memory element <b>102</b> generally has a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitor structure, although other structures such as metal-insulator-insulator-metal (MIIM) and metal-insulator-insulator-insulator-metal (MIIIM) can be used as described herein. In other embodiments, additional conductors can be added to the structure, for example to form metal-insulator-metal-insulator-metal (MIMIM) or other capacitor structures. In some embodiments, one or both of the metal layers can be conductive semiconductors (e.g. doped silicon).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">In some embodiments, and without being bound by theory, the memory element <b>102</b> uses a switching mechanism that is mediated in the bulk of the metal oxide. In one embodiment, the switching mechanism uses non-metallic conductive paths rather than filamentary or metallic conductive paths (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>). In other embodiments, however, any switching mechanism may be used, including metallic filaments or ion transport. Generally, defects are formed in, already exist in the deposited metal oxide, and existing defects can be enhanced by additional processes. Defects may take the form of variances in charge in the structure of the metal oxide. For example, some charge carriers may be absent from the structure (i.e. vacancies), additional charge carriers may be present (i.e. interstitials), or one species (e.g. element) can substitute for another via aliovalent doping (i.e. substitional). Therefore, by applying a voltage to the memory element <b>102</b>, the defects, such as traps, can either be filled or emptied to alter the resistivity of a metal oxide and resistive switching memory elements can be formed using these principles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">The metal oxides have any phase (e.g., crystalline and amorphous) or mixtures of multiple phases. The deposited metal oxides can have impurities (i.e., substitional defects) such as an aluminum atom where a hafnium atom should be, vacancies (missing atoms), and interstitials (extra atoms). Amorphous-phase metal oxides may have increased resistivity, which in some embodiments can lower the operational currents of the device to reduce potential damage to the memory element <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0013">B. Defects</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">The metal oxide includes electrically active defects (also known as traps) in the bulk. It is believed that the traps can be filled by the application of the set voltage, and emptied by applying the reset voltage. Traps can be inherent in the metal oxide (i.e., existing from formation of the metal oxide) or created by doping, and enhanced by doping and other processes. For example, a hafnium oxide layer may include oxygen or hafnium vacancies or oxygen or hafnium interstitials that may form traps which can be used to create percolation paths and alter the conductivity of the hafnium oxide layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">A metal oxide may include defects that are the result of the process used to form the metal oxide. In other words, the defects may be inherent in the metal oxide. For example, physical vapor deposition (PVD) processes and atomic layer deposition (ALD) processes deposit layers that will always have some imperfections or flaws. These imperfections can generally be referred to as defects in the structure of the metal oxide. The defects can be used to create localized charge variances that can be filled and emptied by applying voltage pulses to the metal oxides. Defects can also be created by doping, which is explained in more detail below. Other processes (e.g., annealing) can be used to change and/or enhance defects of a metal oxide to improve resistive switching characteristics.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0015">A. Design Considerations</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">Described in this section is one example of desirable characteristics of a resistive-switching memory element that uses bulk-mediated switching and percolation paths. However, this example is not limiting, and other conduction mechanisms can also be used with the embodiments described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067">Generally, as described above, a resistive-switching memory element switches from a low resistance state to a high resistance state and vice versa. Also as described above, a desirable resistive-switching memory element in some embodiments has low set and reset voltages and a high I<sub>ON</sub>/I<sub>OFF </sub>ratio. A materials system for achieving these goals includes a metal oxide that:
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000"> <ul> <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0067">1. Exhibits bulk-mediated switching</li> <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0068">2. Includes a base metal oxide that has a bandgap of greater than 4 electron volts (eV)</li> <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0069">3. Has a set voltage of at least one volt per one hundred angstroms of thickness of the base metal oxide</li> <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0070">4. Has a leakage current density of less than 40 amps per square centimeter measured at 0.5 V per twenty angstroms of thickness of the base metal oxide in an off state of the memory element</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068">Other design considerations may include using more than one metal oxide in a single layer (co-deposition) or multiple layers (stacked), using electrodes that have different work functions, using at least one noble or near-noble metal electrode, using different metal oxides having different bandgaps, and using low leakage materials. The off current is related to the leakage of the material and the size of the device. Generally, the leakage should be low enough that the off current remains low enough to provide adequate separation between the on and off currents (i.e., a sufficiently high I<sub>ON</sub>/I<sub>OFF </sub>ratio). Leakage is related to I<sub>OFF</sub>, and the 40 A/cm<sup>2 </sup>measured at 0.5 V per 20 Å of oxide thickness in an off state of the memory element described herein gives an off current that is low enough to give a reliably high I<sub>ON</sub>/I<sub>OFF </sub>ratio.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0016">B. Materials</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0017">I. Metal Oxides</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">Specific metal oxides for use as a base layer in a memory element and that use bulk-mediated switching mechanisms according to embodiments of the invention include hafnium oxide, aluminum oxide, tantalum oxide, zirconium oxide, and yttrium oxide. These metal oxides have a bandgap that is greater than 4 eV, indicating that they are more insulating and therefore have a higher resistivity. In some embodiments, higher bandgap (i.e., greater than 4 eV) metal oxides also allow for scaling of set voltage as related to metal oxide thickness (e.g. aliovalently).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0070">These oxides can be doped with each other and additionally, for example, scandium oxide, yttrium oxide, and nickel oxide. Other dopants may include rare earth metals such as lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, gadolinium, erbium, ytterbium, and lutetium and their oxides. Additional dopants may include hafnium, hafnium oxide, titanium oxide, niobium oxide, oxygen, silicon, silicon oxide, nitrogen, fluorine, chromium, and chromium oxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">Dopants can be selected by considering probable oxidation states that can create defects. For example, hafnium atoms can have a +4 (Hf<sup>+4</sup>) oxidation state, and aluminum atoms can have a +3 (Al<sup>+3</sup>) oxidation state. Aluminum oxide can be doped into hafnium oxide creating charge imbalances by creating substitutional defects where aluminum atoms replace hafnium atoms (i.e., Al<sub>Hf</sub> <sup>−1</sup>) and vice versa (i.e., Hf<sub>Al</sub> <sup>+1</sup>). These defects allow for the formation of percolation paths in the bulk of the metal oxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0072">Another criterion for selecting dopants can be the difference between the valence (e.g., for a p-type dopant) or conduction (e.g., for an n-type dopant) band of the dopant and the valence or conduction band of the metal oxide. In some embodiments, a difference between the valence bands that is greater than 50 meV can provide deep-level dopants. A deeper trap energy depth can enable higher I<sub>ON</sub>/I<sub>OFF </sub>ratios and/or improve retention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0073">According to some embodiments, the dopant may be the same metal as the metal oxide into which the dopant is doped. For example, a hafnium oxide layer can be doped with hafnium ions. The doping can be performed using implantation, for example. Implantation energy may generally be in the range of 0.5 keV to 10 keV depending on the ion being implanted and the thickness of the metal oxide. This doping can improve yield of the memory elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0074">Doping can be performed either isovalently or aliovalently, and can be performed by interdiffusion, implantation, or co-deposition. For example, doping can be performed by interdiffusion by depositing two layers of metal oxides (e.g., hafnium oxide and aluminum oxide or hafnium oxide and titanium oxide). These layers can then be thermally treated by, for example, rapid thermal anneal (RTA), rapid thermal oxidation (RTO) or a forming gas anneal. The thermal treatment causes interdiffusion of defect species between the materials, creating localized charge differences which can serve as trap states.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0075">Another criterion for selecting a metal oxide can be to have a metal nitride electrode and a metal oxide adjacent to the metal nitride electrode. The metal to form the metal oxide and the metal nitride are the same. For example, a memory element can be formed having a titanium nitride electrode and a titanium oxide layer adjacent to the titanium nitride electrode. This serves to stabilize the interface, for example. The memory element can also include other metal oxides (e.g., aluminum oxide or hafnium oxide) in a stacked or co-deposited manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0076">In another embodiment, two metal oxides can be stacked in layers to adjust the effective on current of the memory element <b>102</b>. The first metal oxide can have a smaller on current than the second metal oxide material and the second metal oxide material can have a lower off current than the first metal oxide material. In these embodiments, the memory element <b>102</b> can have the lower off current of the second metal oxide material and the lower on current of the first metal oxide material to make the memory element <b>102</b> compatible with other device elements, for example a diode or transistor in series with the memory elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0018">2. Electrodes</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0077">Electrode materials may include titanium nitride, doped silicon, doped polysilicon, tungsten, tungsten nitride, molybdenum nitride, tantalum nitride, molybdenum oxide, cobalt silicide, nickel silicide, palladium silicide, platinum silicide, titanium silicide, other silicides, nickel, platinum, iridium, iridium oxide, ruthenium, or ruthenium oxide. Electrodes can also be alloys such as a ruthenium-titanium alloy or a nickel-titanium alloy. According to some embodiments, one electrode may be a higher work function material, and the other electrode may be a lower work function material. For example, in one embodiment, at least one electrode is a high work function material such as a noble or near noble metal (i.e., a metal with a low absolute value free energy change (|ΔG|) of oxide formation). Noble or near noble metals may include nickel, iridium, iridium oxide, platinum, ruthenium, and ruthenium oxide. The other electrode may be a lower work function material such as titanium nitride, or may also be a noble or near noble material. In other embodiments, one material can be a conductive doped silicon (e.g. n+ doped polysilicon), and the other material can be a higher work function material (e.g. titanium nitride). In some embodiments, the reset pulse at the electrode having the higher work function is a positive pulse (i.e., the higher work function electrode is the anode of the memory element), and in other embodiments, the reset pulse at the higher work function electrode is negative.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0078">In other embodiments, the electrodes can be multi-layer electrodes that can include one or more different materials. For example, an electrode can include a layer of ruthenium and ruthenium oxide, or a layer of iridium, iridium oxide, or platinum with a capping layer of tungsten, tungsten carbonitride, or tungsten carbon. Another potential multi-layer electrode is a tantalum nitride/nickel/tantalum nitride stack. The multi-layer electrodes can be used to improve adhesion properties and performance of memory elements in some configurations and embodiments.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0087">In some embodiments, bipolar switching can be used where the set and reset voltages have different polarities relative to a common electrical reference. For example, a signal line (e.g. the signal line <b>104</b>) is connected to a “second” electrode <b>316</b>, and the signal line is configured to provide switching voltages to the second electrode <b>316</b>. In some embodiments, the second electrode <b>316</b> has a higher work function than the first electrode <b>304</b>, and the signal line <b>104</b> is configured to provide a negative set voltage relative to a common electrical reference, and a positive reset voltage relative to the common electrical reference. The embodiments may include those using a lower work function first electrode <b>304</b> (e.g. titanium nitride) and a higher work function second electrode such as platinum or ruthenium. For example, the common electrical reference may be ground (i.e. 0V), the set voltage would then be a negative voltage (e.g. −2V), and the reset voltage would be a positive voltage (e.g. 2V). The common electrical reference can be any voltage, however, such as +2V or −2V.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0088">In other embodiments, the second electrode <b>316</b> also has a higher work function than the first electrode <b>206</b>, and the signal line <b>104</b> is configured to provide a positive set voltage and a negative reset voltage relative to a common electrical reference. For example, in a memory element having a doped silicon first electrode <b>304</b> (e.g. n-type polysilicon) and a higher work function second electrode <b>316</b> (e.g. titanium nitride), the reset voltage can be negative at the second electrode <b>316</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0089">Generally, in some embodiments, one switching voltage (e.g. the reset voltage) of the memory element can have a first polarity (e.g. a positive polarity) relative to the common electrical reference, and the other switching voltage (e.g. the set voltage) can have a negative polarity relative to the common electrical reference so that the memory element uses bipolar switching. In other embodiments, the switching voltages have the same polarity relative to a common reference and are referred to as unipolar switching. Additionally, the switching voltages can be voltage pulses (e.g. square wave pulses) having a limited duration, for example less than 1 ms, less than 50 μs, less than 1 μs, less than 50 ns, etc. The bipolar switching polarities and materials described here can be used with any of the memory elements described herein, including those shown in FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0023">4. Hafnium Oxide System</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0090">One system that meets the criteria of low set, reset, and forming voltages and a high on/off current ratio is a single layer hafnium oxide memory element <b>102</b>-<b>46</b>A. One example is a system including a hafnium oxide base layer <b>306</b>, a titanium nitride, silicide, or silicon electrode <b>304</b>, and a noble or near noble metal (e.g., platinum, nickel, iridium, iridium oxide, ruthenium, ruthenium oxide, tantalum nitride, ruthenium titanium alloys, nickel titanium alloys, or multi-layer electrodes described above) electrode <b>404</b>. The layers <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>, and <b>316</b> can be deposited using any deposition technique, such as physical vapor deposition (PVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), or evaporation. ALD may be used to deposit very thin conformal layers in some embodiments. Other embodiments may include a doped silicon electrode <b>304</b> (e.g. n-type polysilicon) and a titanium nitride electrode <b>316</b>, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0091"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6B and 6C</figref> are distribution graphs <b>620</b> and <b>640</b> showing off current <b>622</b> and on current <b>624</b> and set voltage <b>642</b> and reset voltage <b>644</b> for a number of memory elements that were prepared. The traps in deposited hafnium oxide are filled to form percolation paths in response to a set voltage and are emptied (e.g. eliminating the percolation paths) in response to a reset voltage. Memory elements including a 50 Å thick hafnium oxide layer <b>406</b> were prepared.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0092">The memory elements are a 50 Å hafnium oxide layer between 1000 Å titanium nitride and 800 Å platinum electrodes. The hafnium oxide layer was deposited using reactive sputtering with a hafnium target in an oxygen and argon containing atmosphere at 500 W and 5 mTorr. The devices were annealed at 750° Celsius (° C.). The I<sub>ON</sub>/I<sub>OFF </sub>ratio for these devices shows good separation with low set and reset voltages.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0024">5. Other Single Layer Memory Elements</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0093">Other metal oxides <b>306</b> may include high bandgap materials such as zirconium oxide, aluminum oxide, yttrium oxide, and tantalum oxide. The metal oxide <b>306</b> can also be a binary metal oxide such as a co-deposited hafnium oxide and aluminum oxide layer, a co-deposited hafnium oxide and titanium oxide layer, a co-deposited aluminum oxide and titanium oxide layer, or any combination of the materials described above. The metal oxide <b>306</b> may further be a ternary, quaternary, etc. metal oxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0025">D. Oxide Stacks</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0026">1. Design</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0094">Memory elements <b>102</b> can also be constructed using multiple layers of oxides or “stacks.” The combination of oxides can be used to impart desired characteristics to memory elements. Three types of layers: a base layer, a doping layer, and a defect access layer are described below. The oxide stack is formed in between two electrodes (i.e., an MIIM or MIIIM structure). The stack may also optionally include another electrical device such as a current steering element, described previously. As described above, the metal oxides used for memory elements <b>102</b> can be deposited using any appropriate technique including dry (CVD, ALD, PVD, PLD, evaporation) and wet (electroless deposition, electrochemical deposition) techniques.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0095">The operation of the memory elements <b>102</b> that include multiple layers of metal oxide is generally the same as that described for a single metal oxide layer memory element. For example, the set and reset pulses and percolation paths described above apply equally to both single layer metal oxide embodiments and multiple layer metal oxide embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0096">Generally, oxide stacks can be used to impart desired characteristics to a memory element. For example, a defect access layer can increase the effective work function of an adjacent electrode, thereby allowing a lower work function electrode to be used. In some instances, stacking oxides can improve reset voltage distribution and site yield (i.e., the number of working memory elements <b>102</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0027">i. Base Layer</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0097">The base layer is the metal oxide layer in which defects are present and in which the bulk-mediated switching takes place. The base layer is, in some embodiments, a high-bandgap (e.g., greater than 4 eV) material that preferably has leakage of less than 40 A/cm<sup>2 </sup>in the off state measured at 0.5 V per 20 {acute over (Å)} of thickness of the metal oxide, and the memory element has a set voltage of at least one volt per 100 Å of the base layer. In other embodiments, an increase in the thickness of the metal oxide of 100 Å can result in an increase of the set voltage of 1 V.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0098">Doping into the base layer to create defects including traps can generally be isovalent or aliovalent and performed using a variety of techniques, for example: interdiffusion (using, for example, a doping layer and an anneal), implantation, and co-deposition. Aliovalent doping is described in further detail in the section regarding the doping layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0099">Co-deposition describes techniques where multiple materials are deposited in one layer. For example, a hafnium oxide layer with an aluminum oxide dopant can be co-deposited. In one example, using reactive sputtering, an aluminum target and a hafnium target are bombarded in an oxygen and argon atmosphere. The concentration of the dopant in the layer can be determined by the power used on the dopant target. Other co-deposition techniques, including ALD co-injection can also be used. For example, with ALD co-injection, two sources metals are co-injected with an oxidant. Another embodiment utilizes the relative number of ALD deposition cycles of the dopant to the base metal oxide to adjust the effective doping concentration (e.g., nanolaminates).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0100">Implantation such as ion implantation can be used to introduce dopants into metal oxides. If doping is performed using ion implantation, dopants may be the metals listed above, rather than their oxides.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0028">ii. Doping Layer</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0101">A doping layer is another metal oxide layer adjacent to the base layer. The doping layer diffuses into the base layer or interdiffuses with the base layer when the stack is annealed or otherwise thermally treated (e.g., rapid thermal anneal (RTA), rapid thermal oxidation (RTO), rapid thermal forming gas anneal (RTF)). For example, using an aluminum oxide base layer, a titanium oxide doping layer can be deposited between the cathode and the base layer to create additional defects including substitional defects in the base layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0102">The doping layer can be chosen to aliovalently dope into the base layer. For example, the base layer may be hafnium oxide and the doping layer can be aluminum oxide. A typical defect species of hafnium oxide is Hf<sup>+4</sup>, and a typical defect species of aluminum oxide is Al<sup>+3</sup>. Al<sup>+3 </sup>ions displace Hf<sup>+4 </sup>ions in the hafnium oxide layer, thereby creating defects and traps. In some embodiments, a doping layer (e.g., titanium oxide) may have the same most common oxidation state (e.g., +4) as the base layer. In these cases, aliovalent doping may still occur when other species having different oxidation states (e.g., Ti<sup>+3</sup>) diffuse into the base layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0029">iii. Defect Access Layer</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0103">A defect access layer is a layer between a positive electrode (e.g., the electrode <b>316</b>) of the memory element <b>102</b> and the base layer. The defect access layer is a thin layer (i.e., 25% as thick as the base layer or less) that allows the electrode to “see” and access the defects in the base layer while in some embodiments reducing currents because of the increased resistivity of the defect access layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0104">In some embodiments, one electrode has a higher work function that the other electrode. In these embodiments, the defect access layer is adjacent to the high work function electrode. The defect access layer can increase the effective work function of the adjacent electrode, thereby allowing the use of less noble or non-noble electrodes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0105">Additionally, depending on the materials chosen, the electrode <b>304</b> may better adhere to the metal oxide of the defect access layer <b>722</b> than the metal oxide of the base layer <b>702</b>. Therefore, the defect access layer <b>722</b> can be used in materials systems to promote physical integrity of the memory element <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0106">In another embodiment, the defect access layer can be a thin (e.g., less than 50 {acute over (Å)} or less than 20 {acute over (Å)}) stable oxide such as aluminum oxide. This facilitates the use of non-noble electrodes for the higher work function electrode (e.g., the electrode <b>316</b>). In other embodiments, the defect access layer <b>722</b> can be zirconium oxide or titanium oxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0030">2. Structural Examples</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0107"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> illustrates a memory element <b>102</b>-<b>7</b>A using a stacked oxide system according to various embodiments.

The base layer <b>702</b> may, in some embodiments, be a transition metal oxide with a bandgap greater than 4 eV such as hafnium oxide, aluminum oxide, tantalum oxide or other materials described herein. The doping layer <b>704</b> is another material such as titanium oxide, scandium oxide, yttrium oxide, niobium oxide, or other doping materials described herein. In some embodiments, the doping layer <b>704</b> can be chosen so that the metal of the doping layer <b>704</b> has a different most common oxidation state than the metal of the base layer <b>702</b> (e.g., the base layer may be hafnium oxide with a Hf<sup>+4 </sup>oxidation state and the doping layer can be aluminum oxide with an Al<sup>+3 </sup>oxidation state). The doping layer <b>704</b> can have any appropriate thickness, and in some embodiments can be approximately as thick as the base layer <b>702</b>, or can be between 25-200% as thick as the base layer, 10-500% as thick as the base layer, etc. as is appropriate for a specific materials system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0108">The memory element <b>102</b>-<b>7</b>A includes an interdiffused region <b>706</b>. The interdiffused region <b>706</b> can be formed by annealing the memory element <b>102</b>-<b>7</b>A, for example at 300-1000° Celsius (° C.) for ten seconds (s) to four hours or more. The annealing causes the migration of charged species within the crystalline structure thereby forming or deepening defects and traps which can be used to form percolation paths.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0109"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> illustrates a memory element <b>102</b>-<b>7</b>B that includes a defect access layer <b>722</b>. The defect access layer <b>722</b> is a thin layer of material (e.g., less than 25% the thickness of the base layer <b>702</b>) that can be used to provide access to the defects in the base layer <b>702</b> and increase the effective work function of the electrode <b>316</b>. The material for the defect access layer <b>722</b> may be selected from the same group as the doping materials, such as titanium oxide, niobium oxide, rare earth oxides, etc. For example, the base layer <b>702</b> may be a 50 Å hafnium oxide or aluminum oxide layer, while the defect access layer <b>722</b> is a 10 Å titanium oxide layer. The defect access layer <b>722</b> can also serve to dope the base layer <b>702</b> in a similar fashion as the doping layer <b>704</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0031">3. Materials Systems Examples</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0032">i. Hafnium Oxide and Aluminum Oxide</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0111">According to one embodiment, a memory element <b>102</b>-<b>7</b>A can be created using a first electrode <b>304</b> that is titanium nitride, silicon, silicide, or a noble metal, a hafnium oxide base layer <b>702</b>, an aluminum oxide doping layer <b>704</b>, and a second electrode <b>316</b> that is a noble or near-noble metal such as platinum, iridium, iridium oxide, ruthenium, or ruthenium oxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0112">In this system, additional defects are created by interdiffusion and aliovalently doping aluminum substitutionally into the hafnium oxide layer. The different oxidation states of hafnium and aluminum create traps, which mediate the bulk-mediated switching mechanism.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0033">ii. Hafnium Oxide and Titanium Oxide</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0113">According to another embodiment, a memory element <b>102</b>-<b>7</b>A can be created using a first electrode <b>304</b> that is titanium nitride, silicon, silicide, or a noble or near-noble metal, a hafnium oxide base layer <b>702</b>, a titanium oxide doping layer <b>704</b>, and a second electrode <b>404</b> that is a noble or near-noble metal such as platinum, iridium, iridium oxide, ruthenium, or ruthenium oxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0114">In this system, the resistivity of the titanium oxide doping layer <b>704</b> is greater than the resistivity of the hafnium oxide base layer <b>702</b>. The increased resistivity of the titanium oxide doping layer <b>704</b> reduces the effective on current of the memory element <b>102</b>-<b>7</b>A, which in some systems can protect the memory element and any current steering devices (e.g., transistors or diodes).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0034">iii. Aluminum Oxide and Titanium Oxide</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0115">According to one embodiment, a memory element <b>102</b>-<b>7</b>B can be created using a titanium nitride, silicon, silicide, or noble or near-noble metal electrode <b>304</b>, an aluminum oxide base layer <b>702</b>, a titanium oxide defect access layer <b>722</b>, and a platinum, iridium, iridium oxide, ruthenium, ruthenium oxide or other noble or near-noble metal electrode <b>316</b>. Alternatively, the electrode can be a non-noble material such as titanium nitride or tantalum nitride. The titanium oxide defect access layer <b>722</b> increases the effective work function of the electrode <b>316</b>, thereby enabling a less noble electrode <b>316</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0116">According to another embodiment, a memory element <b>102</b>-<b>7</b>C can be created using the same configuration above and adding a titanium oxide doping layer <b>704</b>. This memory element includes both doping using the doping layer <b>704</b> and access to defects and lower effective work function using the defect access layer <b>722</b>. According to a further embodiment, a memory element <b>102</b>-<b>7</b>A can be created using an aluminum oxide base layer <b>702</b> and a titanium oxide doping layer <b>704</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0035">iv. Doped Silicon Examples</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0117">In some embodiments, a memory element <b>102</b> can include a doped silicon electrode (e.g. n-type polysilicon) and a higher-work function electrode (e.g. TiN). The higher-work function electrode may have a work function that, for example, between 0.1 and 1.5 eV, 0.1 and 1.0 eV, or 0.4 and 0.6 eV greater than the lower-work function electrode. The memory element can take any form <b>102</b>-<b>7</b>A, <b>102</b>-<b>7</b>B, or <b>102</b>-<b>7</b>C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0118">In one example, a memory element of the form <b>102</b>-<b>7</b>B has a doped silicon electrode <b>304</b> and a titanium nitride electrode <b>316</b>. The base layer <b>702</b> is a higher-bandgap material such as hafnium oxide, tantalum oxide, zirconium oxide, yttrium oxide, or aluminum oxide. The defect access layer <b>722</b> is a material such as titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, or aluminum oxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0036">v. Other Materials Systems</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0119">Various other combinations of materials can be created by using complementary materials. For example, the base layer can be any transition metal oxide having a bandgap greater than 4 eV, a set voltage of greater than 1V per 100 Å of thickness, and a leakage current density less than 40 A/cm<sup>2 </sup>at 0.5 V per 20 {acute over (Å)} of metal oxide in the off state. Examples include hafnium oxide, aluminum oxide, tantalum oxide, and zirconium oxide. The other layers can also be transition metal oxides, such as titanium oxide or niobium oxide. The other layers can be chosen because they are materials that exhibit high resistivity or other desirable characteristics. Some other examples include titanium oxide/hafnium oxide/titanium oxide stacks, hafnium oxide/yttrium oxide stacks, and yttrium oxide/hafnium oxide/yttrium oxide stacks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0120">Other characteristics can also be used to determine the composition of the memory element. For example, a memory element <b>102</b>-<b>7</b>A can have a base layer <b>702</b> of one metal oxide and a doping layer <b>704</b> of a different metal oxide. For example, the base layer <b>702</b> can have a bandgap greater than four electron volts, and the doping layer <b>704</b> can aliovalently dope into the base layer <b>702</b>. Another consideration when selecting metal oxide can be the electron affinity of the metal oxide. For example, the base layer <b>702</b> can have a higher electron affinity than the doping layer <b>704</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0121">Although the foregoing examples have been described in some detail for purposes of clarity of understanding, the invention is not limited to the details provided.
