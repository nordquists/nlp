<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 13/139,542, filed on Jun. 14, 2011 (the U.S. national stage of PCT/JP2010/050999), claims benefit of the filing date of that application under 35 U.S.C. §120, and claims benefit under 35 U.S.C. §119 of Japanese patent applications 2009-026698 and 2009-293212, filed February 6 and Dec. 24, 2009, respectively.

<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">1. Technical Field</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The present invention relates to a photoelectric conversion device, a manufacturing method thereof, and a camera.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">2. Background Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2007/0108371 discloses a PMOS pixel structure in which a p-type buried storage layer is arranged under an n-type pinning layer formed on a surface, and an n-type well is arranged under the p-type buried storage layer. The pinning layer in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2007/0108371 is connected to an n-type isolation implant which is spread under and beside an STI (Shallow Trench Isolation) region as an element isolation region. With this structure, holes, which are generated by and stored in the buried storage layer, are transferred to a floating diffusion via a transfer gate and are read out.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">In the PMOS pixel structure described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2007/0108371, the cathode of a photodiode is formed by the n-type well. However, the present invention adopts an approach which forms the cathode of a photodiode by an n-type buried layer. Note that a channel stopper region which covers the lower portion of an element isolation region is formed in a shallow region, while the buried layer is formed in a deep region. The channel stopper region has a boundary regulation which largely influences miniaturization, while the buried layer should give a broadly distributed potential barrier. The present invention has been made in consideration of such difference between the channel stopper region and buried layer.</div>
<heading>DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">The present invention provides a photoelectric conversion device having a novel structure in which the cathode of a photodiode is formed by an n-type buried layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">One of the aspect of the present invention provides a photoelectric conversion device comprising a p-type region, an n-type buried layer formed under the p-type region, an element isolation region, and a channel stop region which covers at least a lower portion of the element isolation region, wherein the p-type region and the buried layer form a photodiode, and a diffusion coefficient of a dominant impurity of the channel stop region is smaller than a diffusion coefficient of a dominant impurity of the buried layer.</div>

<heading>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">Embodiments of the present invention will be described hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic view showing the arrangement of an image sensing device <b>200</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. The image sensing device <b>200</b> is formed on a semiconductor substrate, and can be called, for example, a solid-state image sensor, MOS image sensor, CMOS sensor, or the like. The image sensing device <b>200</b> is one mode of a photoelectric conversion device according to the present invention, and the photoelectric conversion device according to the present invention includes, for example, a linear sensor and light quantity sensor in addition to an image sensor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">The image sensing device <b>200</b> according to the embodiment of the present invention includes a pixel array <b>210</b> in which pixels are two-dimensionally arranged to form a plurality of rows and a plurality of columns The image sensing device <b>200</b> can also include a row selecting circuit <b>240</b> which selects a row in the pixel array <b>210</b>, a column selecting circuit <b>230</b> which selects a column in the pixel array <b>210</b>, and a readout circuit <b>220</b> which reads out a signal of the column selected by the column selecting circuit <b>230</b> in the pixel array <b>210</b>. The row selecting circuit <b>240</b> and column selecting circuit <b>230</b> can include, for example, shift registers, but they may also be configured to randomly access rows and columns.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a circuit diagram showing an example of the arrangement of a pixel unit PU in the pixel array <b>210</b>. In this arrangement example, the pixel unit PU includes two pixels. However, the pixel unit PU may form a single pixel or may include three or more pixels as other embodiments. The pixel unit PU is configured to read out a hole of an electron and hole generated by photoelectric conversion as a signal. The pixel array <b>210</b> is formed by two-dimensionally laying out pixel units PU each including at least one pixel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">In the arrangement example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the pixel unit PU can include two photodiodes PD<b>1</b> and PD<b>2</b>, two transfer transistors TT<b>1</b> and TT<b>2</b>, one amplifier transistor SF, and one reset transistor RT. The amplifier transistor SF and reset transistor RT are shared by the photodiodes PD<b>1</b> and PD<b>2</b> and the transfer transistors TT<b>1</b> and TT<b>2</b>. Each of the transfer transistor TT (TT<b>1</b>, TT<b>2</b>), amplifier transistor SF, and reset transistor RT is formed as a PMOS transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">The transfer transistors TT<b>1</b> and TT<b>2</b> are enabled when an active pulse (low pulse) is applied to transfer signal lines Tx<b>1</b> and Tx<b>2</b> connected to their gates. Then, holes stored in storage regions (p-type regions) of the photodiodes PD<b>1</b> and PD<b>2</b> are transferred to a floating diffusion FD. Note that the photodiodes PD<b>1</b> and PD<b>2</b> are arranged to form different rows, and an active pulse is applied to the transfer signal lines Tx<b>1</b> and Tx<b>2</b> at different timings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">The amplifier transistor SF forms a source-follower circuit together with a constant current source CCS which supplies a constant current to a vertical signal line (column signal line) VSL. The amplifier transistor SF amplifies, by a source-follower operation, a signal (potential change) which appears in the floating diffusion FD as a result of transfer of a hole to the floating diffusion FD via the transfer transistor TT, and outputs the amplified signal onto the vertical signal line VSL. The signal output onto the vertical signal line VSL is read out by the readout circuit <b>220</b>. The reset transistor RT is enabled to reset the floating diffusion FD when an active pulse (low pulse) is applied to a reset signal line RES connected to its gate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">In the arrangement example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a row is selected by controlling a potential VFDC applied to the drain electrode of the reset transistor RT. A row in which the potential of the floating diffusion FD is reset to a potential that does not enable the amplifier transistor SF is set in a non-selecting state. On the other hand, a row in which the potential of the floating diffusion FD is reset to a potential that enables the amplifier transistor SF is set in a selecting state. As another embodiment, a selecting transistor used to select a row may be arranged in series with the amplifier transistor SF between the ground potential and the vertical signal line VSL. The selecting transistor may be arranged, for example, between the ground potential and the amplifier transistor SF or between the amplifier transistor SF and the vertical signal line VSL.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a layout view showing an example of the arrangement of the pixel unit PU which forms the pixel array <b>210</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a sectional view taken along a line A-A′ in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a sectional view taken along a line B-B′ in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a sectional view taken along a line C-C′ in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">In this embodiment, the photodiode PD (PD<b>1</b>, PD<b>2</b>) is formed by a p-type region PR and an n-type buried layer <b>10</b> formed under the p-type region PR. The p-type region PR serves as the anode, and the buried layer <b>10</b> serves as the cathode. The p-type region PR includes a p-type first region <b>15</b> and a p-type second region <b>1</b>′, at least a portion of which is arranged between the first region <b>15</b> and the n-type buried layer <b>10</b>. The first region <b>15</b> serves as a principal charge storage region. A p-type impurity concentration of the second region <b>1</b>′ can be the same as, for example, that of a p-type silicon substrate (semiconductor substrate) <b>1</b>. A p-type impurity concentration of the first region <b>15</b> is higher than that of the second region <b>1</b>′. The p-type region PR is preferably formed under an n-type surface region <b>18</b>. In this case, the buried photodiode PD is formed by the n-type surface region <b>18</b>, p-type region PR, and n-type buried layer <b>10</b>. It is known that the buried photodiode suffers less noise generated by a dark current.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">The diffusion coefficient of a dominant impurity of the n-type surface region <b>18</b> is preferably smaller than that of a dominant impurity of the buried layer <b>10</b>. For example, it is preferable that the dominant impurity of the n-type surface region <b>18</b> is arsenic (As) and that of the buried layer <b>10</b> is phosphorus (P). Since the diffusion coefficient of arsenic (As) is smaller than that of phosphorus (P), forming the surface region <b>18</b> using arsenic (As) is advantageous for miniaturization since it is easy to settle its boundary. On the other hand, since it is easy to make phosphorus (P) enter to a deeper position of the semiconductor substrate than arsenic (As), forming the buried layer <b>10</b> using phosphorus (P) is to allow to form the buried layer <b>10</b> in the deeper position, and is advantageous for sensitivity enhancement. Since the diffusion coefficient of phosphorus (P) is larger than that of arsenic (As), forming the buried layer <b>10</b> using phosphorus (P) is advantageous in formation of a broadly distributed potential barrier. Since the ion radius of phosphorus (P) is larger than the lattice constant of the silicon substrate <b>1</b>, the lattices of the silicon substrate <b>1</b> are distorted by implanting phosphorus (P) into the silicon substrate <b>1</b>, thus advantageously causing a gettering effect of an impurity metal element. This contributes to improvement of point defects. The buried layer <b>10</b> can be formed by ion-implanting phosphorus (P) into the semiconductor substrate <b>1</b> using a channeling phenomenon. In the present invention, impurities to be implanted or doped are not limited to arsenic (As) and phosphorus (P), and other impurities may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">The floating diffusion FD is a p-type third region. On a region between the p-type first region <b>15</b>, which forms a portion of the photodiode PD, and the floating diffusion FD (p-type third region), a gate <b>105</b> of the transfer transistor TT (TT<b>1</b>, TT<b>2</b>) is arranged. In other words, the transfer transistor TT is formed by the p-type first region <b>15</b>, floating diffusion FD (p-type third region), and gate <b>105</b>. The transfer transistor TT transfers holes stored in the p-type regions (regions <b>15</b> and <b>1</b>′) of the photodiode PD to the floating diffusion FD. In this embodiment, the transfer transistor TT is a PMOS transistor. The gate <b>105</b> of the transfer transistor TT can be formed by polysilicon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">The p-type second region <b>1</b>′ can be arranged to surround the p-type first region <b>15</b> in a section. The element isolation region side of the p-type first region <b>15</b> may contact a channel stop region (to be described later). In this case, the p-type second region <b>1</b>′ surrounds the p-type first region <b>15</b> except for the element isolation region side of the p-type first region <b>15</b>. The second region <b>1</b>′ and the floating diffusion FD (third region) are isolated by an n-type region <b>16</b>, and the channel of the transfer transistor TT is formed in the n-type region <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">Element isolation regions <b>9</b> are arranged to isolate active regions where the photodiode PD, transfer transistor TT, amplifier transistor SF, and reset transistor RT are to be formed. The active regions correspond to the surface region <b>18</b>, the floating diffusion FD, and diffusion regions <b>104</b>, <b>108</b>, and <b>110</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and regions other than those can be the element isolation regions <b>9</b>. Formation of the element isolation regions <b>9</b> can typically use an STI (Shallow Trench Isolation) technique or LOCOS (Local Oxidation Of Silicon) technique. Alternatively, diffusion isolation may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">Channel stop regions <b>8</b> are formed in regions that cover at least lower portions (lower side surfaces and bottom surfaces) of the element isolation regions <b>9</b>. The diffusion coefficient of a dominant impurity of each channel stop region <b>8</b> is preferably smaller than that of a dominant impurity of the buried layer <b>10</b>. For example, it is preferable that the dominant impurity of the channel stop region <b>8</b> is arsenic (As), and that of the buried layer <b>10</b> is phosphorus (P). As described above, since the diffusion coefficient of arsenic (As) is smaller than that of phosphorus (P), forming the channel stop regions <b>8</b> using arsenic (As) is advantageous for miniaturization. The dominant impurity of the channel stop region <b>8</b> can be the same as that of the surface region <b>18</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">A potential bather <b>11</b> is formed between the photodiodes PD. The potential barriers <b>11</b> can also be formed between the photodiodes PD, amplifier transistor SF, and reset transistor RT, as needed. In a photoelectric conversion device of a single pixel or an image sensing device having a large inter-pixel interval, a potential barrier between the photodiodes is not required. When the element isolation regions <b>9</b> are formed to sufficiently deep positions, potential barriers between the photodiodes PD, amplifier transistor SF, and reset transistor RT are not required. In this embodiment, formation of the potential barrier <b>11</b> settles the p-type region <b>1</b>′ surrounded by the potential barrier <b>11</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">A gate <b>107</b> of the amplifier transistor SF is electrically connected to the floating diffusion FD. The gate <b>107</b> of the amplifier transistor SF can be formed by polysilicon. In this embodiment, the gate <b>107</b> of the amplifier transistor SF is electrically connected to the floating diffusion FD via a contact plug <b>102</b>. Note that the contact plug <b>102</b> is preferably a shared contact plug in terms of improvement of an aperture ratio or pixel density. The shared contact plug is a contact plug which electrically connects the diffusion region (source or drain) of one transistor to the gate of the other transistor via one contact plug. Note that the gate <b>107</b> of the amplifier transistor SF may be connected via one contact plug which is electrically connected to the gate <b>107</b>, another contact plug which is electrically connected to the floating diffusion FD, and at least one conductive pattern.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">The amplifier transistor SF is a PMOS transistor containing the gate <b>107</b> which is electrically connected to the floating diffusion FD, and the diffusion regions <b>104</b> and <b>108</b>. The reset transistor RT is a PMOS transistor containing the gate <b>106</b> which is connected to the reset signal line RES, the floating diffusion FD, and the diffusion region <b>110</b>. The gate of the reset transistor RT can be formed by polysilicon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">The amplifier transistor SF preferably has a buried channel structure. This is because the amplifier transistor SF having the buried channel structure can reduce 1/f noise (1/f noise is inversely proportional to the product of a channel width and channel length). On the other hand, the reset transistor RT and transfer transistor TT (and a selecting transistor used to select a row when such row selecting transistor is included) (especially, the reset transistor RT) preferably have a surface channel structure. This is because an OFF state of a transistor is important to suppress leakage of holes to the floating diffusion FD. A buried channel type transistor is readily set in a normally ON state, and is difficult to be set in an OFF state. In order to miniaturize a pixel, it is effective to miniaturize the reset transistor RT and transfer transistor TT (and a selecting transistor used to select a row when such row selecting transistor is included), and the surface channel type is advantageous for this purpose.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">Preferred structures of the reset transistor RT and amplifier transistor SF will be examined below with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, reference symbol WAR denotes an interval between the element isolation regions <b>9</b> in the channel width direction of the reset transistor RT; and WCR, a channel width of the reset transistor RT. When no channel stop region <b>8</b> exists, the interval WAR and the channel width WCR match. However, due to the existence of the channel stop regions <b>8</b>, the channel width WCR becomes smaller than the interval WAR. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, reference symbol WAS denotes an interval between the element isolation regions <b>9</b> in the channel width direction of the amplifier transistor SF; and WCS, a channel width of the amplifier transistor SF. When no channel stop region <b>8</b> exists, the interval WAS and the channel width WCS match. However, due to the existence of the channel stop regions <b>8</b>, the channel width WCS becomes smaller than the interval WAS. In this specification, the channel width means a dimension in consideration of the channel stop regions. Note that in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, reference numeral <b>201</b> denotes a gate insulating film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">In order to form the amplifier transistor SF to have the buried channel structure and the reset transistor RT to have the surface channel structure, the channel width WCS of the amplifier transistor SF is preferably larger than the channel width WCR of the reset transistor RT. As a method of implementing the buried channel structure, a method of executing channel doping at a predetermined depth position from an interface between a gate insulating film and substrate is available. An impurity to be channel-doped has the same conductivity type as that of a source-drain region, and its concentration is set to be lower than the source-drain region. When the channel width is small, the width of a region to be channel-doped becomes small. Furthermore, since the conductivity type of an impurity of each channel stop region <b>8</b> is a conductivity type opposite to that of the channel-doped region, the impurity of the channel stop region <b>8</b> may be diffused into a region to be channel-doped. In such case, the impurity concentration of the channel-doped region lowers, and the buried channel structure is hardly formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">That is, in order to realize the amplifier transistor SF having the buried channel structure and the reset transistor RT having the surface channel transistor SF, the channel width WCS of the amplifier transistor SF is preferably larger than the channel width WCR of the reset transistor RT. Note that the channel width WCS of the amplifier transistor SF is preferably larger than 1 μm, and the channel width WCR of the reset transistor RT is preferably smaller than 0.1 μm. This channel width is that of a region where a threshold remains unchanged in the amplifier transistor, and is that of a region where a threshold begins to rise in the reset transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">A method of manufacturing the image sensing device <b>200</b> according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention will be exemplified below with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A to 7D</figref>, <b>8</b>A to <b>8</b>C, <b>9</b>A to <b>9</b>C, <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B, <b>11</b>A, and <b>11</b>B. In a process shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, a p-type silicon substrate <b>1</b> is prepared. A silicon oxide film having a thickness of 10 to 200 Å is formed on the surface of the silicon substrate <b>1</b>. After that, a polysilicon film having a thickness of 400 to 600 Å and a silicon nitride film having a thickness of 150 to 200 Å are formed in turn, and these films are patterned to form a mask.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">In a process shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, opening portions of the mask formed in the process shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> are etched to form trenches <b>6</b> to form the element isolation regions <b>9</b>. In a process shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, arsenic (As) is implanted in the bottom portions and lower side portions of the trenches <b>6</b> at 150 to 200 KeV to form channel stop regions <b>8</b>. In a process shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>, element isolation regions (STI) <b>9</b> are formed in the trenches <b>6</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">In a process shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, phosphorus (P) is implanted in a deep portion of the p-type silicon substrate <b>1</b> at 4,000 to 8,000 KeV to form an n-type buried layer <b>10</b>. In this case, it is preferable to implant phosphorus (P) in a deep portion as much as possible using the channeling phenomenon. In a process shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, potential bathers <b>11</b> are formed between photodiodes PD, and between the photodiodes PD, an amplifier transistor SF, and a reset transistor RT, as needed. The potential barriers <b>11</b> can be formed by implanting, for example, phosphorus (P) in the silicon substrate <b>1</b> at 2,000 to 2,500 KeV, then implanting phosphorus (P) at 1,000 to 1,500 KeV, and also implanting arsenic (As) at 700 to 750 KeV.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">In a process shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, ions are implanted in prospective formation regions of the amplifier transistor SF and reset transistor RT to form target potential structures. For example, this ion implantation process includes, for example, channel doping. As described above, it is preferable to form the potential structures so that the amplifier transistor SF has a buried channel structure, and the reset transistor RT has a surface channel structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">In a process shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, a gate oxide film and polysilicon electrodes are formed, and are patterned to form gates <b>105</b> and <b>107</b> (and <b>106</b> (not shown)). In a process shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, boron (B) is implanted in a region of the photodiode PD at 50 to 150 KeV to form a first region <b>15</b> which forms a portion of a p-type region PR. In a process shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref>, phosphorus (P) is implanted in a region which extends from a portion below the transfer transistor TT toward the floating diffusion FD side at 50 to 150 KeV to form an n-type region <b>16</b>.</div>

The same reference numerals denote portions having the same functions as in the structure of the aforementioned embodiment, and a detailed description thereof will not be repeated. A difference of the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> from the aforementioned embodiment lies in a direction of incidence of light.

A support substrate <b>1303</b> is arranged on the upper portion of the interconnection layer <b>1302</b>, that is, on the side opposite to the substrate <b>1301</b> when viewed from the interconnection layer <b>1302</b>, for the purpose of mainly assuring a high mechanical strength of the image sensing device.

In this manner, the image sensing device according to the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> has the back-side illumination structure which receives light from the side opposite to the formation side of the interconnection layer, that is, the back side.</div>

On the peripheral circuit region <b>1308</b>, a well <b>1310</b> for a peripheral circuit transistor is arranged. The peripheral circuit region <b>1308</b> includes a readout circuit <b>220</b>, column selecting circuit <b>230</b>, and row selecting circuit <b>240</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">On an interface of the second principal surface side (back surface side) of the semiconductor substrate <b>1301</b>, an n<sup>+</sup>-type semiconductor region <b>1309</b> is arranged. The n<sup>+</sup>-type semiconductor region <b>1309</b> is a region corresponding to a buried layer <b>10</b>. The n<sup>+</sup>-type semiconductor region <b>1309</b> can also serve as a layer used to suppress a dark current at an interface of the oxide film <b>1304</b>. That is, in case of the back-side illumination type, a dark current suppression layer is formed on the first and second principal surfaces. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the n<sup>+</sup>-type semiconductor region <b>1309</b> is arranged on the entire surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>1301</b>, but it may be arranged only on the pixel region <b>1308</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">The diffusion coefficient of a dominant impurity of an n-type surface region <b>18</b> is preferably smaller than that of a dominant impurity of the n<sup>+</sup>-type semiconductor region <b>1309</b> as the buried layer. For example, the dominant impurity of the n-type surface region <b>18</b> is preferably arsenic (As), and that of the n<sup>+</sup>-type semiconductor region <b>1309</b> is preferably phosphorus (P). Since the diffusion coefficient of arsenic (As) is smaller than that of phosphorus (P), forming the surface region <b>18</b> using arsenic (As) is advantageous for miniaturization since it is easy to settle its boundary. On the other hand, since it is easy to make phosphorus (P) enter to a deeper position of the semiconductor substrate than arsenic (As), forming the n<sup>+</sup>-type semiconductor layer <b>1309</b> using phosphorus (P) is to allow to form the n<sup>+</sup>-type semiconductor layer <b>1309</b> in the deeper position, and is advantageous for sensitivity enhancement. Since the diffusion coefficient of phosphorus (P) is larger than that of arsenic (As), forming the n<sup>+</sup>-type semiconductor layer <b>1309</b> using phosphorus (P) is advantageous in formation of a broadly distributed potential barrier. Since the ion radius of phosphorus (P) is larger than the lattice constant of the semiconductor substrate <b>1301</b>, the lattices of the semiconductor substrate <b>1301</b> are distorted by implanting phosphorus (P) into the semiconductor substrate <b>1301</b>, thus advantageously causing a gettering effect of an impurity metal element. This contributes to improvement of point defects. The n<sup>+</sup>-type semiconductor layer <b>1309</b> can be formed by ion-implanting phosphorus (P) into the semiconductor substrate <b>1301</b> using a channeling phenomenon. In the present invention, impurities to be implanted or doped are not limited to arsenic (As) and phosphorus (P), and other impurities may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a schematic block diagram showing the arrangement of a camera according to an embodiment of the present invention. Note that the concept of a camera includes not only an apparatus primarily intended to photographing but also an apparatus which secondarily includes a photographing function (for example, a personal computer or portable terminal). A camera <b>400</b> includes a solid-state image sensor <b>1004</b> represented by the aforementioned image sensing device <b>200</b>. An optical image of an object is formed on an image sensing surface of the solid-state image sensor <b>1004</b> via a lens <b>1002</b>. On the outer side of the lens <b>1002</b>, a barrier <b>1001</b> which serves as a protection function of the lens <b>1002</b> and a main switch is arranged. A stop <b>1003</b> used to adjust the amount of light that emerges from the lens <b>1002</b> may be arranged for the lens <b>1002</b>. An image sensing signal output from the solid-state image sensor <b>1004</b> undergoes processing such as various kinds of correction and clamping by an image sensing signal processing circuit <b>1005</b>. The image sensing signal output from the image sensing signal processing circuit <b>1005</b> is analog-to-digital converted by an A/D converter <b>1006</b>. Image data output from the A/D converter <b>1006</b> undergoes signal processing such as correction and data compression by a signal processor <b>1007</b>. The solid-state image sensor <b>1004</b>, image sensing signal processing circuit <b>1005</b>, A/D converter <b>1006</b>, and signal processor <b>1007</b> operate according to timing signals generated by a timing generator <b>1008</b>.</div>

The camera <b>400</b> also includes a memory unit <b>1010</b> used to temporarily store image data, and a recording medium control interface unit <b>1011</b> used to record or read out an image in or from a recording medium.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">The operation of the camera <b>400</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> will be described below. In response to an opening action of the barrier <b>1001</b>, a main power supply, a power supply of a control system, and that of image sensing system circuits including the A/D converter <b>1006</b> are turned on in turn. The overall control/arithmetic unit <b>1009</b> sets the stop <b>1003</b> to have a full aperture value in order to control an exposure amount. A signal output from the solid-state image sensor <b>1004</b> is supplied to the A/D converter <b>1006</b> through the image sensing signal processing circuit <b>1005</b>. The A/D converter <b>1006</b> A/D-converts that signal, and outputs digital data to the signal processor <b>1007</b>. The signal processor <b>1007</b> processes that data and provides the processed data to the overall control/arithmetic unit <b>1009</b>, which executes arithmetic operations required to decide an exposure amount. The overall control/arithmetic unit <b>1009</b> controls the stop based on the decided exposure amount.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">Next, the overall control/arithmetic unit <b>1009</b> extracts high-frequency components from the signal, which is output from the solid-state image sensor <b>1004</b> and is processed by the signal processor <b>1007</b>, and calculates a distance to the object based on the high-frequency components. After that, the overall control/arithmetic unit <b>1009</b> drives the lens <b>1002</b> to check whether or not an in-focus state is attained. If it is determined that an in-focus state is not attained, the overall control/arithmetic unit <b>1009</b> drives the lens <b>1002</b> again to calculate a distance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">After an in-focus state is confirmed, main exposure is started. Upon completion of exposure, an image sensing signal output from the solid-state image sensor <b>1004</b> undergoes correction and the like in the image sensing signal processing circuit <b>1005</b>, is A/D-converted by the A/D converter <b>1006</b>, and is processed by the signal processor <b>1007</b>. Image data processed by the signal processor <b>1007</b> is stored in the memory unit <b>1010</b> by the overall control/arithmetic unit <b>1009</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">After that, the image data stored in the memory unit <b>1010</b> is recorded in the recording medium <b>1012</b> via the recording medium control I/F under the control of the overall control/arithmetic unit <b>1009</b>.
