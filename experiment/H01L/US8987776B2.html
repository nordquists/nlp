The semiconductor light-emitting stack <b>110</b> formed on the upper surface of the substrate <b>100</b> includes an n-type semiconductor layer <b>112</b>, a p-type semiconductor layer <b>114</b>, and an active layer <b>113</b> interposed therebetween. In some embodiments, the arrangements of the n-type and p-type semiconductor layers <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> can be interchanged.
