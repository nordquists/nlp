<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This application claims the benefit of Taiwan application Serial No. 99130565, filed Sep. 9, 2010, and U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 61/430,808, filed Jan. 7, 2011, the subject matter of which is incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The present invention relates to the field of semiconductor packaging, and, more particularly, to semiconductor packaging in wireless devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Wireless communication devices, such as cell phones, require antennas for transmitting and receiving signals. Conventionally, a wireless communication device includes therein an antenna and a communication module (e.g., a semiconductor package with RF communication capability), each disposed on different parts of a circuit board. Under the conventional approach, the antenna and the communication module are separately manufactured and electrically connected after being placed on the circuit board. Since separate sets of equipment are separately manufactured, higher manufacturing costs are incurred. Moreover, the conventional approach makes it more difficult to achieve a compact product design.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Furthermore, since antenna signals are high-frequency signals, electromagnetic interference (EMI) may easily occur. EMI may interrupt, obstruct, or otherwise degrade or limit the effective performance of the circuit. As is known in the art, electromagnetic interference protection can be achieved using an electromagnetic interference shielding frame disposed on the circuit board.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">The substrate <b>111</b> includes an upper surface <b>111</b> <i>u</i>, a lower surface <b>111</b> <i>b </i>opposite to the upper surface <b>111</b> <i>u</i>, and a lateral surface <b>111</b> <i>s </i>at a periphery of the substrate <b>111</b>. The lateral surface <b>111</b> <i>s </i>extends between the upper surface <b>111</b> <i>u </i>and the lower surface <b>111</b> <i>b</i>, and circumscribes the substrate <b>111</b>. The substrate <b>111</b> may be a multi-layered organic substrate or a ceramic substrate, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">In this embodiment, the semiconductor device <b>112</b> <i>a </i>is coupled to the upper surface <b>111</b> <i>u </i>of the substrate <b>111</b> in a “face-down” orientation and electrically connected to the substrate <b>111</b> via a plurality of solder balls. This configuration is sometimes referred to as “flip-chip”. In other embodiments, the semiconductor device <b>112</b> <i>a </i>may be coupled to the substrate <b>111</b> in a “face-up” orientation, and electrically connected to the substrate <b>111</b> via a plurality of conductive bond wires.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">The first conformal shielding film <b>131</b> is directly formed on the upper surface <b>120</b> <i>u </i>of the package body <b>120</b> and includes an opening. When the antenna element <b>150</b> is a patch antenna, the first conformal shielding film <b>131</b> can be used as a grounding structure for the antenna element <b>150</b>. The first conformal shielding film <b>131</b> may include aluminum, copper, chromium, tin, gold, silver, nickel, stainless steel or any other suitable metal or alloy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">The grounding element <b>132</b> covers the lateral surface <b>120</b> <i>s </i>of the package body <b>120</b> and electrically connects the first conformal shielding film <b>131</b> and the substrate <b>111</b>, wherein the grounding element <b>132</b> is a second electromagnetic interference shielding film.

The dielectric structure <b>140</b> covers the first conformal shielding film <b>131</b> and the grounding element <b>132</b> and includes an upper surface <b>140</b> <i>u</i>. The dielectric structure <b>140</b> can be formed by a material such as a package body, a dielectric material (e.g., epoxy), or a prepreg lamination. The lateral surface <b>140</b> <i>s </i>of the dielectric structure <b>140</b> is substantially flush or coplanar with the lateral surface <b>111</b> <i>s </i>of the substrate <b>111</b>.</div>

The antenna element <b>150</b> has several embodiments. The antenna element can be formed on a part of the upper surface of the dielectric structure <b>140</b>, and the feeding element <b>160</b> can be partly or completely overlapped by the antenna element. In addition, the antenna element <b>150</b> and the semiconductor device <b>112</b> <i>a </i>or the passive component <b>112</b> <i>b </i>can be located on positions at different height levels, so that the required area of the upper surface <b>111</b> <i>u </i>of the substrate <b>111</b> is reduced, and the required dimensions of the entire semiconductor package <b>100</b> are reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">The feeding element <b>160</b> in the present embodiment of the invention passes through the package body <b>120</b> and the dielectric structure <b>140</b>. The feeding element <b>160</b> electrically connects the antenna element <b>150</b> and a feeding point <b>111</b> <i>a </i>of the substrate <b>111</b>. For example, the feeding element <b>160</b> of the present embodiment of the invention is a conductive pillar disposed in a grounded through hole providing electromagnetic interference protection. The feeding element <b>160</b> can also be realized by a conductive film, a conductive layer or a combination of the conductive layer and a resin (e.g., wherein the resin covers the conductive layer and fills up a space surrounded by the conductive layer, as hereinafter described).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">The feeding point <b>111</b> <i>a </i>can be realized by a pad, a solder point, a bump or a wire layer exposed from the substrate <b>111</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a cross-sectional view of a feeding element according to another embodiment of the invention is illustrated.

The first feeding sub-element <b>260</b> <i>a </i>and the second feeding sub-element <b>260</b> <i>b </i>can be separately formed in different manufacturing processes. Although the lower end area of the second feeding sub-element <b>260</b> <i>b </i>is shown substantially smaller than the upper end area of the first feeding sub-element <b>260</b>, it is to be understood that the lower end area of the second feeding sub-element <b>260</b> <i>b </i>can be substantially larger than, or substantially equal to, the upper end area of the first feeding sub-element <b>260</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">The first feeding sub-element <b>260</b> <i>a </i>and the second feeding sub-element <b>260</b> <i>b </i>can be structurally different.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a cross-sectional view of a feeding element according to another embodiment of the invention is illustrated.
