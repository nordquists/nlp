<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of application Ser. No. 13/626,456 filed Sep. 25, 2012, which in turn is a division of application Ser. No. 12/872,665 filed Aug. 31, 2010, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,283,742 issued Oct. 9, 2012, each of which is hereby fully incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates generally to integrated circuit (IC) current sensors and more particularly to IC current sensors fabricated according to a thin-wafer manufacturing process.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Desired properties of galvanically isolated integrated circuit (IC) current sensors include high magnetic sensitivity; high mechanical stability and reliability; low stress influence to Hall sensor elements near chip borders; high thermal uniformity and low thermal gradients; high isolation voltage; and low manufacturing costs. Conventional current sensors can include one or more features or be manufactured in ways that aim to address these desired properties.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, some current sensors use the leadframe as a current lead. Others also include a magnetic core. Such sensors, however, can be expensive to manufacture.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Other current sensors include additional layers, such as special magnetic layers on top of the silicon die or a thick metal layer formed on the isolation layer. These sensors are also expensive, and the former can be sensitive to disturbance fields and can suffer from drawbacks related to the positioning of the current leading wire outside of the IC.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, there is a need for a galvanically isolated IC current sensor having desired properties while minimizing drawbacks.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY</heading>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">Embodiments relate to IC current sensors fabricated using thin-wafer manufacturing technologies. Such technologies can include processing in which dicing before grinding (DBG) is utilized, which can improve reliability and minimize stress effects. While embodiments utilize face-up mounting, face-down mounting is made possible in other embodiments by via through-contacts or other contacts to the surface of the chip coupled to an isolation layer. IC current sensor embodiments can present many advantages while minimizing drawbacks often associated with conventional IC current sensors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an embodiment of an IC current sensor <b>100</b> comprises a current conductor <b>102</b>, an isolation layer <b>104</b> formed thereupon, and a thin-wafer chip <b>106</b> coupled to a signal pin <b>108</b> by a bond wire <b>110</b>. In an embodiment, thin-wafer chip <b>106</b> is manufactured according to a thin-wafer manufacturing process, which can include wafer dicing before grinding and optional backside etching and will be discussed in more detail below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">Magnetic sensor elements <b>112</b>, such as Hall effect elements in an embodiment, are arranged on a surface of thin-wafer chip <b>106</b>. In an embodiment, current conductor <b>102</b> includes one or more slots <b>114</b> which can help to define a current flow path through current conductor <b>102</b>. When sensor elements <b>102</b> are positioned relative to slots <b>114</b>, each slot <b>114</b> can strategically concentrate current flow lines to maximize a magnetic field in the vicinity of each sensor element <b>112</b>. Applicants also refer to co-owned U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 12/630,596, 12/711,471 and 12/756,652, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">Utilizing a thin-wafer process, thin-wafer chip <b>106</b> can have a thickness much less than 200 μm, such as about 50 μm or less or even about 20 μm or less in embodiments. Such thicknesses are much smaller than those of conventional thick wafers, reducing the vertical (with respect to the orientation of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> on the page) distance d between sensor elements <b>112</b> and current conductor <b>102</b>. This can improve the accuracy of sensor <b>100</b> by avoiding stress effects due to the smaller ratio of chip thickness d to edge distance e. For example, e can be about 75 μm and d in a range of about 25 μm to about 65 μm in thin wafer fabrication embodiments. While all chips experience some degree of stress, homogenous stress across the chip is better than having areas of inhomogeneous stress. In embodiments, inhomogeneous areas occur near the edge of chip <b>100</b>. Thus, edge distance e is a critical stress distance, particularly if e is less than d. With sensor elements <b>112</b> positioned closer to the edge because of the thinner wafer, more area of chip <b>106</b> is homogenous rather than inhomogeneous because distance e is not smaller or comparable to chip thickness d. Further, it is desired to position sensor elements <b>112</b> near slots <b>114</b> but also to have slots <b>114</b> spaced farther apart from one other without increasing the chip size. Thus, sensor <b>100</b> enables a more efficient use of chip space because of the more homogenous stress and the related positioning advantages the more homogenous stress presents. A significant advantage of smaller distance d is also an increased sensitivity of sensor <b>100</b> given the smaller distance between sensor elements <b>112</b> and current that flows through current conductor <b>102</b>. Further, the smaller thickness of chip <b>106</b> compared to the thickness of current conductor <b>102</b> can provide more uniform and/or smaller temperature gradients and better compensation of circuits on chip, along with higher accuracy. Thin-wafer manufacturing also provides cleaner, smoother edges of chip <b>106</b>, with fewer chips and other defects, and later-developing cracks, that can affect reliability, increase stress and otherwise reduce the lifetime performance of sensor <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, an embodiment of a thin-wafer manufacturing process <b>200</b> is illustrated. At <b>202</b>, a silicon wafer is partially, such as half-cut in an embodiment, diced. At <b>204</b>, laminating tape is applied to one side of the silicon wafer before back grinding to thin the wafer at <b>206</b>. At <b>208</b>, dicing tape is applied to the wafer, on the side without the laminating tape, which is then removed from the wafer at <b>210</b>. An over-etching process is then carried out at <b>212</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">Another embodiment is depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. Process <b>201</b> illustrates an additional plasma etch <b>207</b> between back grinding at <b>206</b> and frame or tap mounting at <b>208</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">Compared with other manufacturing processes, thin-wafer process <b>200</b> includes dicing before grinding, i.e., <b>202</b> before <b>206</b>. Further, the dicing at <b>202</b> is partial-cut dicing, compared with conventional processes which saw through the entire thickness of the wafer. Dicing before grinding, as in process, <b>200</b> results in a thin-wafer that has smoother edges, free of the chipping, cracking and other defects associated with other methods. This can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which depicts images of a standard process (on the left) and a thin-wafer process using dicing before grinding and a plasma etch (on the right). In the standard process wafer image, chips and cracking caused by the saw blade as it cuts through the silicon wafer extend about 40 μm into the wafer from the sawing gap.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">In contrast, the dicing before grinding wafer image shows chips extending only about 10 μm or less into the edge of the wafer from the sawing gap. In general, current sensors are very sensitive to stress caused by piezo-effects that change the alter the sensitivity of the sensing elements, more so than other sensors. While a thin die is desired, thin dies have stress challenges. Using over-etching as part of the dicing before grinding thin wafer process further refines and improves the chip edges such that a thin-wafer is suitable for use in a current sensor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">Another embodiment of a thin-wafer current sensor <b>400</b> is depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Sensor <b>400</b> is similar to sensor <b>100</b> but is mounted to a printed circuit board (PCB) <b>416</b> on top of thin-wafer chip surface <b>106</b>. PCB <b>416</b> includes a copper trace <b>418</b> on the bottom side of PCB <b>416</b>, and solder bumps <b>420</b> couple thin-wafer chip surface <b>106</b> to trace <b>418</b> of PCB <b>416</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a thin-wafer current sensor <b>500</b> is mounted face-down to a copper trace <b>518</b> of a PCB <b>516</b> by a via through-hole <b>522</b>. Through-hole <b>522</b> can be easily accommodated by embodiments of a thin-wafer manufacturing process as discussed herein and do not require the conductor to be smaller than the die as in conventional face-down mounting because embodiments permit formation of contacts from the rear side of the die. Sensor <b>500</b> can therefore have an increased magnetic field signal because of the smaller distance d<b>2</b> between sensor elements <b>512</b> and current conductor <b>502</b> due to the face-down mounting of chip <b>506</b>. Sensor elements <b>512</b> are depicted here arranged on a bottom surface of thin-wafer chip <b>506</b> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">In another face-down mounting embodiment depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a thin-wafer current sensor <b>600</b> comprises a via through-hole <b>622</b> coupled to a signal pin <b>608</b> by a bond wire <b>610</b>. Similar to sensor <b>500</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, sensor <b>600</b> can provide an increased magnetic field signal because of the smaller distance d<b>2</b> between sensor elements <b>612</b> and current conductor <b>602</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">In another embodiment, a thin-wafer semiconductor chip is coupled to a carrier or signal-conducting layer comprising, for example, glass or ceramic. This carrier layer is substantially thicker, such as at least twice as thick, than the thin-wafer semiconductor chip.</div>
