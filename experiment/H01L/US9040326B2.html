<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">This invention relates to light emitting diodes (LEDs) and more particularly to high light extraction efficiency gallium nitride based LEDs via surface roughening.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">(Note: This application references a number of different publications as indicated throughout the specification by one or more reference numbers within brackets, e.g., [x]. A list of these different publications ordered according to these reference numbers can be found below in the section entitled “References.” Each of these publications is incorporated by reference herein.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Gallium nitride (GaN) based wide band gap semiconductor LEDs have been available for almost 15 years. The progress of LED development has brought about great changes in LED technology, with the realization of full-color LED displays, LED traffic signals, white LEDs, and so on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">High efficiency white LEDs have gained much interest as possible replacements for fluorescent lamps - the luminous efficacy of white LEDs (130-150 lumens/watt [1]) already surpasses that of ordinary fluorescent lamps (75 lumens/watt). Nevertheless, current commercially available wurzite nitride based LEDs are characterized by the presence of polarization-related electric fields inside multi-quantum wells (MQWs), for their [0001] c-polar growth orientation. The discontinuities in both spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization at the heterointerfaces result in internal electric fields in quantum wells which cause carrier separation (quantum confined Stark effect (QCSE)) and reduce the radiative recombination rate within quantum wells [2-5].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">To decrease these polarization-related effects, growing III-nitride devices on the nonpolar planes, viz, the (1-100) m-plane or the (11-20) a-plane, has been demonstrated [6-7]. Another approach to reduce, and possibly eliminate those effects, is to grow III-nitride devices on crystal planes that are inclined with respect to the c-direction, i.e., semipolar planes. Devices grown on different semipolar planes, including (10-1-1), (10-1-3), (11-22) and others, have also been demonstrated [8-10]. These planes have reduced polarization discontinuity in heterostructures compared with the c-plane III-nitride materials; and for semipolar planes oriented ˜45 degree from the c-plane, there is no polarization discontinuity in InGaN/GaN heterostructures [5]. Recently, with the advent of high quality freestanding GaN substrates, high performance nonpolar and semipolar LEDs with peak emission wavelengths ranging from 407 nm to 513 nm on nonpolar m-plane, semipolar (10-1-1), and (11-22) freestanding GaN substrates have been reported. The performance highlights of those LEDs are summarized in Table 1 [11-15]. Those devices show greatly reduced polarization-related electric fields in the quantum wells, which enables one to employ thicker quantum wells inside an LED, which is believed to be crucial for devices operating under high currents. Therefore, LEDs grown on nonpolar and semipolar oriented GaN substrates hold great promise for commercially useful solid-state lighting applications and could be commercially viable as high quality freestanding GaN substrates become more available.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">Current techniques to improve the efficiency of an LED fall under two distinct categories: increasing the internal quantum efficiency or the extraction efficiency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">Increasing the internal quantum efficiency, determined by crystal quality and epitaxial layer structure, could be rather difficult. A typical internal quantum efficiency value for blue LEDs is more than 70% [16] and an ultraviolet (UV) LED grown on a low-dislocation GaN substrate has recently exhibited an internal quantum efficiency as high as 80% [17]. There might be little room for improvement over these values, especially for nonpolar and semipolar oriented devices grown on high quality freestanding GaN substrates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">On the other hand, there is plenty of room for improving the light extraction efficiency. For a bare chip nitride based LED, because of the rather huge difference between the refractive indices of GaN (n=2.5) and air (n=1), the angle of the light escape cone is only 23 degrees, which leads to a meager light extraction efficiency that is as low as 4.18% [18]. The light outside the escape cone is reflected repeatedly inside the device and eventually absorbed by the active region or the electrodes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">Surface roughening procedures could be used to significantly reduce internal loss of light and encourage light escape from the device. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional illustration of a surface roughened LED, comprising an n-type electrode <b>10</b>, n-type III-nitride layer <b>11</b>, III-nitride active region <b>12</b>, p-type III-nitride layer <b>13</b> and p-type electrode <b>14</b> that is bonded to a silicon sub-mount <b>16</b> via a gold tin bonding <b>15</b>. A photo-enhanced chemical (PEC) etching is used to roughen the backside <b>17</b> of the n-type layer <b>11</b>, which is a nitrogen-face (N-face) GaN surface. The arrow <b>18</b> indicates a possible trajectory for light emitted by the LED. A 130% increase in output power was measured for a surface roughened LED compared with a smooth surface and otherwise identical device [19].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">Although surface roughening by PEC etching is a sine qua non for improving light extraction from a nitride based LED, the effectiveness of this technique by and large hinges on the crystal orientation and polarity of the to-be-roughened surface, particularly, the nitrogen face of a c-polar [0001] GaN [21]. As a result, PEC etching could not be applied to surfaces of other GaN crystal orientations and polarity, including a-face (11-20), nonpolar m-face (1-100), and most of the semipolar surfaces. The lack of means for surface roughening has become a major hurdle for nonpolar and semipolar LEDs to achieve higher extraction efficiency and hence higher overall efficiency, and therefore improved roughening techniques are needed to address this issue.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">The present invention describes a method of increasing the light extraction efficiency from a nitride based LED, which involves photolithography and plasma-assisted chemical dry etching. Through increasing light extraction, subsequent improvement of efficiency is thus expected. One most noticeable advantage of the present invention is that it significantly increases the light extraction efficiency from a nitride-based LED, including films that are grown along nonpolar and semipolar orientations. In addition, this invention is more straightforward compared to other light extraction enhancement techniques, such as using a photonic crystal. More important, unlike photo-enhanced chemical etching that is also a simple light extraction enhancement technique, the present invention is more versatile as it could be applied to any nitride semiconductor surface regardless of its crystal structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">Therefore, to overcome the limitations in the prior art described above, and to overcome other limitations that will become apparent upon reading and understanding the present specification, the present invention describes a method for fabricating a III-nitride LED, comprising texturing at least one surface of a semipolar or nonpolar plane of a III-nitride layer of the LED to form a textured surface, wherein the texturing step is performed by plasma assisted chemical etching. The texturing step may be performed by photolithography followed by the etching, or the textured surface may be formed using nano-imprinting followed by the etching. Light emitted by an active region of the LED is mostly extracted from the textured surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">The texturing step may further comprise: (1) creating at least one feature with at least one sidewall that reflects and transmits at least one light ray incident from inside the feature; and inclining the sidewall such that each time the ray is reflected, an angle of incidence of the ray relative to a surface normal of the sidewall decreases, such that when the angle of incidence of the ray is smaller than a critical angle, the ray's transmission through the sidewall is increased, and when the angle of incidence of the ray is at least equal to the critical angle, the ray is reflected by the sidewall.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">The present invention further discloses a method for emitting light from a III-nitride LED, comprising emitting the light from at least one textured surface of a semipolar or nonpolar plane of a III-nitride layer of the LED, wherein the texturing is performed by plasma assisted chemical etching.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">The present invention further discloses a III-nitride LED, comprising n-type III-nitride; p-type III-nitride; a III-nitride active layer, that emits light, formed between the n-type III-nitride and p-type III-nitride; a III-nitride light extraction surface on the n-type III-nitride and forming an interface with an external medium, wherein the III-nitride light extraction surface has features with at least one sloped sidewall which transmits the light into external medium air at the interface and reflects the light at the interface, wherein: (1) the reflected light, after undergoing subsequent reflections inside the features, has an increased incidence angle relative to the interface and consequently an increased chance of being transmitted to the external medium, and (2) the n-type III-nitride, p-type III-nitride, and III-nitride active layer are semi-polar or non-polar layers. The external medium may be a medium with a smaller refractive index than III-nitride, for example air or a vacuum.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">In the following description of the preferred embodiment, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration a specific embodiment in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">Technical Description</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">The present invention describes a technique for increasing the light extraction efficiency from a nitride based LED, which involves photolithography and plasma-assisted chemical dry etching. Through increasing light extraction, subsequent improvement of efficiency is thus expected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">In one embodiment of the present invention, the freestanding GaN substrate surface of the opposite side of the LED growth front is roughened. After the device is fabricated, the LED is then placed within a shaped optical element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a schematic representation of a surface roughened LED packaged in a suspended geometry according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention. The LED is comprised of a p-type metal electrode <b>20</b>, semi-transparent p-type electrode <b>21</b>, p-type III-nitride layer <b>22</b>, III-nitride active region <b>23</b>, n-type III-nitride layer <b>24</b>, double-side-polished freestanding GaN substrate <b>25</b> on which surface roughening is performed by plasma-assisted chemical etching, metal header <b>26</b>, metal wire <b>27</b> (connecting to the p-electrode <b>20</b>), metal wire <b>28</b> (connecting to the n-type metal electrode <b>29</b>), and a silicone cone mold <b>30</b> into which the LED chip encapsulates. The arrows <b>31</b> indicate possible trajectories for light emitted by the LED.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">Plasma-assisted chemical etching is performed on the backside surface <b>32</b> of the GaN substrate <b>25</b> after etching masks are defined. With a certain proportion of different corrosive gases, including, but not limited to, chlorine and fluorine based gases, and other gases, under certain chamber pressure and plasma powers, plasma-assisted chemical etching defines the unmasked area with features that are characterized by sloped sidewalls. As a result, the surface <b>32</b> is roughened through the formation of conical features that tile up most of the surface <b>32</b>. Concavity that resembles a meteorite crater might be formed on top of each conical feature as a result of a combination of appropriate etching conditions, etching time, and the use of material of the etching masks. Etching conditions of an exemplary roughening procedure, performed by an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etcher, include a certain ratio of chlorine-based and fluorine-based gases (10:1 to 150:1), appropriate ICP power, ranging from 100 Watt to 1000 Watt, desirable bias power, ranging from 10 Watt to 500 Watt, and suitable chamber pressure (1-50 Pascal).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> <i>a </i>is an SEM image of a GaN surface after a 30 minute treatment of the exemplary roughening procedure with the use of circular etching masks (2 micron in diameter and 8 micron apart from center to center), and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> <i>b </i>is a cross-sectional SEM image of the same sample. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref> <i>a </i>and <b>3</b> <i>b </i>illustrate how the surface is roughened through the formation of conical features <b>33</b> (with sloped sidewalls <b>34</b>) that tile up most of the surface, and how a concavity <b>35</b> might be formed on top of each conical feature <b>33</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">Conical features (or truncated conical features) are believed to be beneficial to light extraction [20]. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates the process of light escaping from such a conical feature <b>40</b>, <b>33</b>. Light rays <b>41</b> incident at the feature-air boundary <b>42</b> are either transmitted through the nitride semiconductor-air interface (or feature-air boundary <b>42</b>) (dashed arrows <b>43</b>), or reflected by the boundary <b>42</b> (solid arrows <b>44</b>). Most of the reflected rays <b>44</b>, after undergoing subsequent reflections <b>45</b> inside the feature <b>40</b> that leads to an increase of incidence angle (90°-θ) at the semiconductor-air interface (or feature-air interface <b>42</b>), can eventually escape <b>46</b> from the cone <b>40</b> by a near normal incidence at the feature-air interface <b>42</b>. In the above, the feature-air boundary <b>42</b> and semiconductor-air interface are equivalent. Light rays <b>41</b> originate from the active region, for example, and the feature <b>40</b> typically has an interface <b>47</b> with an n-type layer of the nitride.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an optical microscopy image of a roughened surface. The discolored and dark surface, resulting from the roughening procedure, can be ascribed to the light scattering at the boundary of air and GaN, and such surface in general has better light extraction characteristics than a smooth and “mirror-like” counterpart [19].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">Geometries of the roughened features <b>60</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, including the sidewall inclination angle <b>61</b>, cone diameters <b>62</b> and <b>63</b>, and the height of the cone <b>64</b>, as well as the number density of those conical features <b>60</b>, could be tailored for optimal light extraction with the use of appropriate etching masks and suitable etching conditions. It should be noted that plasma assisted chemical etching is a non-equilibrium process, therefore this roughening procedure can be applied on any nitride semiconductor surfaces, regardless of their crystal orientations and polarity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">With such a design, light generated within the active region is able to escape effectively from both sides of the die; and the extraction efficiency of the light propagating toward the substrate can be considerably increased because of the surface roughening. As a result, an improvement over the output power is expected.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">One most noticeable advantage of the present invention is that it significantly increases the light extraction efficiency from a nitride-based LED, including LEDs that are grown along nonpolar and semipolar orientations. In addition, this invention is more straightforward compared to other light extraction enhancement techniques, such as using a photonic crystal. More importantly, unlike PEC etching, which is also a simple light extraction enhancement technique, this invention is more versatile as it could be applied to any nitride semiconductor surface(s) regardless of their crystal structures. The present invention will enable high power and high efficiency LEDs.</div>
