<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">Disclosed is an image sensor that has one or more pixels within a pixel array, each pixel comprising a photodetector and a transfer switch that connects the photodetector to a sense node. The sense node is connected to a vertical signal line via a reset switch. An output transistor is connected to couple an output signal to a vertical OUT line from the sense node. The pixel array may be coupled to a control circuit and to one or more subtraction circuits. The control circuit may cause the output transistor to provide a first reference output signal, a common reset output signal, and a first sense-node reset output signal. The transfer switch is in a triode region when the common reset output signal is provided. The reset switch is in a triode region when the first reference output signal is provided. Both the reset and transfer switches are switched off when the first sense-node reset output signal is provided. A subtraction circuit may sample the common reset output signal, the first sense-node reset output signal and the first reference output signal. A subtraction circuit may form a weighted difference between the sampled common reset output signal, the sampled first sense-node reset output signal and the sampled first reference output signal to create a noise signal. The control circuit may cause the pixel to provide a second sense-node reset output signal, a light response output signal and a second reference output signal. The transfer switch is in a triode region when the light response output signal is provided. The reset switch is in a triode region when the second reference output signal is provided. Both the reset and transfer switches are switched off when the second sense-node reset output signal is provided. A subtraction circuit may sample the second sense-node reset output signal, the light response output signal and the second reference output signal. The light response output signal corresponds to an image that is to be captured by the sensor. A subtraction circuit may form a weighted difference between the sampled second sense-node reset output signal, the sampled second reference output signal and the sampled light response output signal to create a normalized light response signal. The noise signal may be subtracted from the normalized light response signal to generate a de-noised signal of the sensor. A DC offset may be further subtracted to form the de-noised signal. An image capture system may comprise the image sensor and a processor that form the de-noised signal. One or more of the steps may be performed on the processor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">A subtraction circuit may provide a noise signal by sampling and subtracting the common reset output signal and the first sense-node reset output signal from the first reference output signal, each scaled by a respective signed scaling factor. The subtraction circuit may provide a normalized light response signal by sampling and subtracting the light response output signal and the second sense-node reset output signal from the second reference output signal, each having been scaled by a respective signed scaling factor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">The noise signal may be subtracted from the normalized light response signal on the image sensor to form a de-noised signal. Alternately, the noise signal and the normalized light response signal may be transferred to an external processor where the noise signal is subtracted from the normalized light response signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">Alternately, the noise signal and/or the normalized light response signal may be partly formed in the subtraction circuit on the image sensor and partly on the processor. The noise signal may be stored in a memory, and retrieved from the memory subsequently to be subtracted from the normalized light response signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">A pre-calibrated offset signal may be further subtracted from the normalized light response signal to form the de-noised image signal. The pre-calibrated offset signal may be retrieved from a memory, for instance a non-volatile memory such as a flash memory.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">The noise signal may be formed in one of several mutually equivalent methods, referred to in the following as noise methods.

The second noise difference is a result of subtracting the sampled first sense-node reset output signal from the sampled first reference output signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">In a second noise method, a third noise difference is subtracted from the first noise difference, each having been scaled by a respective signed scaling factor. The first noise difference is as described above. The third noise difference is a result of subtracting the first sense-node reset output signal from the common reset output signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">In a third noise method, the third noise difference is subtracted from the second noise difference, each having been scaled by a respective signed scaling factor. The second and third noise differences are as described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">In a fourth noise method, the noise signal is formed directly from the first reference output signal, the first sense-node output signal, and the common-reset output signals, each having been scaled by a signed scaling factor, without forming the first, second, or third noise differences.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">There are other possible methods to form the noise signal from the common reset output signal, the first sense-node reset output signal, and the first reference output signal by manipulating the terms according to the rules of algebra, as one skilled in the art can recognize as being equivalent or equivalent to within a multiplying factor and/or an additive constant.</div>

In step <b>300</b> a first reference signal is driven onto the sense node <b>111</b> via the IN line <b>120</b> and then a first reference output signal is output by the output transistor <b>116</b> and stored in the light reader <b>16</b> as a sampled first reference output signal. Referring to the schematic in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> and timing diagram in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, this can be accomplished by switching the RST(n) <b>118</b>, TF(n) <b>121</b>, and IN <b>120</b> lines from a low voltage to a high voltage to turn on the reset switch <b>112</b> and into a triode region. The transfer switch <b>117</b> may be switched on at the same time to transmit the first reference signal to the photodetector <b>100</b> by driving the TF(n) line <b>121</b> high. The RST(n) line <b>118</b> and TF(n) line <b>121</b> are driven high for an entire row. The IN line <b>120</b> is driven high for an entire column.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">The RST[n] line <b>118</b> and the TF[n] line <b>121</b> may each be connected to be driven by a tri-state buffer <b>374</b> whose output enters a tri-state after driving to a high level from 0 volt. Subsequently, when the IN line <b>120</b> is switched to a high state from a low state, capacitive coupling (due to gate-to-channel capacitance of reset switch <b>112</b>, and to a capacitance of the capacitor <b>126</b>) causes gate voltages of the reset switch <b>112</b> and the transfer switch <b>117</b> to each rise further to hold the reset switch <b>112</b> and transfer switch <b>117</b> respectively in a triode region. With the reset switch <b>112</b> and the transfer switch <b>177</b> in their respective triode region, the voltages at the storage node <b>115</b> and the sense node <b>111</b> are driven to the voltage level on the IN line <b>120</b>. Providing a higher gate voltage high enough for the reset switch <b>112</b> and the transfer switch <b>117</b> to simultaneously remain in triode region allows the photodetector to be reset to a higher level, thus permitting a larger range of voltage swing on the OUT line <b>124</b> to support a larger dynamic range in the output signal output from the pixel <b>14</b>.</div>

The triple-sampling light reader <b>16</b>″ comprises a plurality of triple-sampling circuits <b>150</b>″, each comprising a first pair of capacitors <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> and a second pair of capacitors <b>153</b>, <b>155</b>. The first pair of capacitors <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> comprises a first capacitor <b>152</b> and a second capacitor <b>154</b> that each has a first capacitance. The second pair of capacitors <b>153</b>, <b>155</b> comprises a third capacitor <b>153</b> and a fourth capacitor <b>155</b> that each has a second capacitance. A ratio between the first capacitance and the second capacitance may be varied. By way of example, the ratio may be determined in accordance with a calibration procedure executed on the image sensor <b>10</b>″ or on the external processor <b>72</b> under one of the calibration procedures described later in this description. Within each pair, one capacitor is electrically coupled to a positive terminal “+” of an amplifier <b>180</b> while the other capacitor to a negative terminal “−” of the amplifier <b>180</b>. Together, each pair, the amplifier <b>190</b>, and a pair of feedback capacitors <b>190</b> connected between output terminals and input terminals of the amplifier <b>180</b> can perform a subtraction between two voltage signals sampled onto the capacitors within the pair. The light reader <b>150</b>″ may perform a first subtraction to subtract a second voltage on the second capacitor from a first voltage on the first capacitor, a second subtraction to subtract a fourth voltage on the fourth capacitor from a third voltage on the third capacitor, and a third subtraction to subtract a second difference resulting from the second subtraction from a first difference resulting from the first subtraction, by closing switches <b>170</b>, <b>171</b>, and <b>182</b> to <b>184</b> and opening switches <b>190</b>, each of the first and second differences given a weight equal to the first and second capacitances, respectively. When switches <b>170</b>, <b>171</b> are both closed, the triple-sampling light reader <b>16</b>″ effectively performs the first to third subtractions all at once, without having to form intermediate signals for the first or second differences. Thus the triple-sampling light reader <b>16</b>″ is able to perform any one of the first to third noise methods without forming all of the first to third noise differences under the respective noise method. Likewise, the triple-sampling light reader <b>16</b>″ is able to perform any one of the first to third normalizing methods without forming all of the first to third normalizing differences under the respective normalizing method. Thus it is clear that the light reader <b>16</b>″ is able to perform the fourth noise method which calls for a subtraction among the three constituent component signals of the noise signal, and the fourth normalizing method which calls for a subtraction among the three constituent component signals of the normalized light response signal without having to generate the intermediate noise/normalizing differences. Of the three constituent signals that combine to form the noise signal, a first signal that is sampled by only a capacitor from the first pair of capacitors has a weight of the first capacitance, a second signal that is sampled by a capacitor from the first pair of capacitors and a capacitor from the second pair of capacitors has a weight of either a sum or difference between the first and second capacitances, and a third signal that is sampled by only a capacitor from the second pair of capacitors has a weight of the second capacitance. Likewise is true for the three constituent signals that combine to form the normalized light response signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">Although a single amplifier <b>180</b> is shown and described, it is to be understood that more than one amplifier can be used in the light reader circuit <b>16</b>″.</div>

This performs effectively a first subtraction between the sampled output signals stored on the first <b>152</b> and second <b>154</b> capacitors, a second subtraction between the sampled output signals stored on the third <b>153</b> and fourth <b>155</b> capacitors, and a third subtraction between the results of the first and second subtractions, the results of the first and second subtractions given unsigned scaling factors (or weights) of the first and second capacitances, respectively, like the flowchart of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref> except the intermediate first and third noise and normalizing differences need not be formed.

In a similar manner, the light reader <b>16</b> may sample the second sense-node reset output signal onto the first capacitor <b>152</b> and the light response output signal onto the second capacitor <b>154</b>, output a negated third normalizing difference from the amplifier <b>180</b> to the ADC <b>24</b>, sample the second reference output signal onto the first capacitor <b>152</b> and the light response output signal onto the second capacitor <b>154</b>, and output the first normalizing difference to the ADC <b>24</b>. The third and first normalizing differences are digitized. The digitized normalizing differences may be transmitted to the external processor <b>72</b> to be combined to form the normalized light response signal according to the first normalizing method.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0150" num="0149">Note that the negated third normalizing difference may be provided to the ADC <b>24</b> instead of the unnegated third normalizing difference, or vice versa, by interchanging the signals sampled by the first <b>152</b> and second <b>154</b> capacitors, to provide a signal polarity better suited to the input range of the ADC <b>24</b>, as is well known to one skilled in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0150">In the fourth embodiment, the light reader <b>16</b> may form any two noise differences among the first to third noise differences and any two normalizing differences among the first to third normalizing differences, and transmit the differences to the ADC <b>24</b> to be digitized then either transmitted to the external processor <b>72</b> or to be processed on the image sensor <b>11</b> to form the noise signal and the normalized light response signal according to the corresponding noise and normalizing method, respectively, then subtract the noise signal from the normalized light response signal to form the de-noised signal or to form the de-noised signal with those two pairs of noise and normalizing differences directly.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0016" num="0000">Other Alternate Embodiments and Operations</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0158">Other alternate embodiments of the image sensor are possible. For example, the ADC(s) in each of the first to sixth embodiments may be located outside of the image sensor, for example on a different semiconductor substrate than a semiconductor substrate that supports the image sensor. The light readers <b>16</b>, <b>16</b>′, <b>16</b>″, the analog gain circuits <b>17</b>, and the analog subtractor <b>21</b> may likewise be located outside the image sensor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0159">Other alternate modes of operations are possible. A first variation is that the second reference level may have an offset (hereinafter “reference offset”) down from a voltage level that is transmitted on the IN line immediately before the reset switch <b>112</b> switches from a triode region to an OFF state for the common reset (hereinafter “first springboard level”) (e.g. in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref> the first springboard level is also the first reference level). By way of example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17F</figref>, the second reference level may be at the VPH2 level, selected by switching DIN(1:0) to “01”, whereas the first reference level takes the VPH0 level, selected by switching DIN(1:0) to “11”. The reference offset may be in a same direction and by a similar amount as the common reset level is offset from the first springboard level (which is also the first reference level), for example within 50 mV of the common reset level. Having a nonzero reference offset has a benefit of minimizing a DC offset in the light response output signal, as such DC offset under high gain can saturate the amplifier <b>180</b> in the light reader. The reference offset may be chosen to be between 50 mV to 300 mV, preferably 150 mV. A separate DC offset in the noise signal due to a difference between the first and second reference levels may be reduced subsequently in the digital domain within the combiner <b>50</b> or in the external processor <b>72</b>. Alternately, the separate DC offset in the noise signal may be removed in the analog domain prior to digitizing by the ADC <b>24</b> by any one of the analog DC signal subtraction methods and circuits known in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0160">Still other variations are possible, as described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0161">In a second variation, the IN line <b>120</b> is driven to a higher first springboard level than the first reference level. By way of example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17H</figref> shows a higher first springboard level after the first reference output signal is sampled in step <b>300</b> and before step <b>302</b>. By way of example, the first springboard level may be provided by switching DIN(1:0) to “11” to select the VPH0 level, whereas the first reference level by switching DIN(1:0) to “10” to select the VPH1 level. The offset of the first springboard level above the first reference level (hereinafter “first springboard offset”) can in part cancel the storage-node and sense-node voltage drop during the common reset in step <b>302</b>, so that an offset between the first reference level and the common reset level (hereinafter “reset offset”), and concomitantly a DC offset in the noise signal, is reduced. The first springboard offset may be between 50 mV to 300 mV, preferably 150 mV. In this method, the second reference level may be same as the first reference level, since the storage node reset level is brought essentially close to the first reference level, such as within 100 mV, so that a DC offset in the normalized light response signal is likewise reduced when the second reference level is select to be equal to the first reference level.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0162">In a third variation, the virtual ground GND1 signal <b>156</b> in the light reader that connects to the capacitors <b>152</b> to <b>154</b> has a voltage that varies between a first GND1 level when the first reference output signal is sampled and a second GND1 level when the common-reset output signal is sampled, a difference (hereinafter “GND1 step”) between 50 mV and 300 mV, preferably 150 mV. By way of example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17I</figref> shows voltage level changes on the storage node and the GND1 signal <b>156</b>. The second GND1 level is offset in a same direction as the common reset level is offset from the first reference level, which is also the first springboard level in this example. The GND1 signal <b>156</b> takes the second GND1 level during the sampling of the common reset output signal, the first and second sense-node reset output signals and the light response output signal, whereas during samplings of the first and second reference output signals it takes the first GND1 level. The GND1 step thus partially cancels a DC offset between the common reset level and the first reference level and, concomitantly also a DC offset between the light response level and the second reference level. The second reference level may be same as the first reference level, for example the VPH1 level selected by DIN(1:0)=“10”. An analog signal driver for the GND1 signal <b>156</b> may have two or more output levels, selectable by a digital input, similar to that for the IN line driver <b>17</b>, and may be controlled by a logic circuit constructed according to a similar technique of construction like the logic circuit for generating the DIN(1:0) signals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0163">The third variation essentially uses a technique of analog offset cancellation or DC subtraction in the light reader. Different alternatives on this technique are possible, as is known in the art. In one alternative, instead of varying the GND1 signal <b>156</b>, a pair of offset-cancelling capacitors (not shown) may be connected to the “+” and “−” inputs of the amplifier <b>180</b> to perform the offset cancellation. These offset-cancelling capacitors can be charged to given voltages, their capacitances may be same as the sampling capacitors <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> or different. When a sampling circuit <b>150</b>, <b>150</b>′ or <b>150</b>″ of the light reader is connected to the amplifier <b>180</b> to transfer charges, the offset-cancelling capacitors are also charged to the given voltages then connected to transfer charges to the feedback capacitors <b>190</b> to effect the offset cancellation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0164">Another alternative on this technique is to precharge the feedback capacitors <b>190</b> to a suitable differential voltage (hereinafter “precharge voltage”) prior to each transfer of charges from a sampling circuit <b>150</b>, <b>150</b>′ or <b>150</b>″. The precharge voltage has an opposite direction than the reset offset in the sense that the precharge voltage partially cancels an output change of the amplifier <b>180</b> that arises due to the reset offset. The precharge voltage may be increased in magnitude for an increase in a gain of the amplifier <b>270</b> (i.e. the amplifier <b>180</b> together with the feedback capacitors <b>190</b>) when the feedback capacitors <b>190</b> take a smaller capacitance value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0165">In a fourth variation, the second reference level is provided on the IN line <b>120</b> and the corresponding second reference output signal sampled not after the light response output signal is sampled but before the switching OFF of the reset switch <b>112</b> in step <b>310</b> that precedes the second sense-node reset output signal. By way of example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17G</figref> shows the corresponding sense-node and storage node voltage levels. A step <b>309</b> is inserted immediately before the step <b>310</b> of the flowchart. In step <b>309</b>, the reset switch <b>112</b> is in a triode region, the transfer switch <b>117</b> is in an OFF state, and the IN line <b>120</b> is driven to the second reference level. The corresponding second reference output signal on the OUT line <b>124</b> is sampled by a SAM1 signal and stored as the sampled second reference output signal. Although <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17G</figref> shows a separate second springboard level is driven onto the sense node <b>111</b> between the second reference level and the sense-node reset, one skilled in the art can recognize that the second springboard level may take a same voltage level as the second reference level or different.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0167" num="0166">Various combinations and permutations of the above embodiments, variations and techniques are possible, as one skilled in the art would readily be enabled to perform.

The logic may include a plurality of comparators <b>350</b> with one input connected to a counter <b>352</b> and another input connected to hardwired signals that contain a lower count value and an upper count value. The counter <b>352</b> sequentially generates a count. The comparators <b>350</b> compare the present count with the lower and upper count values. If the present count is between the lower and upper count values the comparators <b>350</b> output a logical 1. The lower and upper count values for each of the control signals may be modified to support different timings than displayed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, as one skilled in the art would readily recognize.

Calibration
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0181" num="0180">Calibration may be performed to find a suitable set of signed scaling factors for the noise and normalizing methods chosen, for example, signed scaling factors COEF<b>1</b>, COEF<b>2</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, or the first and second capacitances of the triple-sampling circuit <b>150</b>″ for the triple-sampling light reader <b>16</b>″ of the image sensor <b>10</b>″ of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, or equivalent thereof for the other embodiments. Below describes a calibration procedure to find a suitable set of signed scaling factors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0182" num="0181">For each pixel among a plurality of pixels that share a layout and orientation, form a difference between a pair of de-noised signals, each de-noised signal arising from forming a noise signal followed by a normalized light response signal then subtracting the noise signal from the normalized light response signal. The difference has a residual temporal noise but none of the mean of the de-noised signal. Form squares of the differences across the plurality of pixels and a sum of the squares. Since residual temporal noises of different pixels are independent, the sum of the squares is a good approximation of a multiple of a variance of the residual noise of each pixel, namely 2Nσ<sup>2</sup>, where N is the number of pixels and σ<sup>2 </sup>is the variance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0183" num="0182">For the plurality of pixels, find the sum of the squares for each of two different sets of signed scaling factors. Normalized each sum by dividing it by a square of a number that is directly proportional to a de-noised signal that would result under the corresponding set of signed scaling factors given a predetermined exposure duration and illumination of the pixels. The set that gives a lesser normalized sum of the squares is preferred. This procedure may be performed for more than two sets of signed scaling factors to identify a suitable set of signed scaling factors to use to form the de-noised signal for the plurality of pixels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0184" num="0183">By way of example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a layout arrangement of pixels of two different layout orientations in an array. In odd columns, the photodiodes and transfer switches assume one orientation whereas in even columns they assume a different orientation. Due to the asymmetry between these two different groups of pixels, a systematic mismatch tends to exist in capacitances and other electrical characteristics between the groups. Within each group, on the other hand, the likeness among pixels helps to minimize mismatches. Therefore calibration should be performed to produce a set of signed scaling factors suitable for each group, and each group may use the set that is suitable for itself in the noise and normalizing methods.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0185" num="0184"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows another example of layout arrangement of pixels of two different layout orientations in an array. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> corresponds to a three-by-two array of the photodiodes <b>100</b> <i>a</i>, <b>100</b> <i>b </i>and transfer switches <b>117</b> <i>a</i>, <b>117</b> <i>b </i>corresponding to the schematic of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> where two photodiodes <b>100</b> <i>a</i>, <b>100</b> <i>b </i>share a sense node <b>111</b> through transfer switches <b>117</b> <i>a</i>, <b>117</b> <i>b</i>, respectively. Each pixel comprises a photodiode <b>100</b> <i>a </i>or <b>100</b> <i>b </i>and a transfer switch <b>117</b> <i>a </i>or <b>117</b> <i>b</i>, and two pixels share a reset switch <b>112</b>, an output transistor <b>116</b> and a select switch <b>114</b>. In odd rows, the photodiodes and transfer switches assume one orientation whereas in the even rows they assume a different orientation. For the same reason as above, a calibration may be performed to produce a set of signed scaling factors suitable for each group, and each group may use the set that is suitable for itself in the noise and normalizing methods.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0186" num="0185">Alternately, from the same pixel, more than two de-noise signals may be formed, a plurality of pairs among the de-noised signals are differenced and squared, the squares summed together to form a sum-of-squares. Such sums-of-squares across a plurality of similar pixels may be further summed together to form a final-sum-of-squares. This procedure is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, each q designates a different set of signed scaling factors, each p designates a different group of similar pixels, there being Z different sets of signed scaling factors and P different pixel layouts. For each combination of p and q, the process illustrated by the flowchart of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is executed. In the flowchart of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, N+1 de-noised signals are formed for each pixel in the pixel group p. Each successive pair of de-noised signals from each pixel in the group are differenced and squared. The N squares are summed, and may be further summed across the pixels within the group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0187" num="0186">Below describes an alternate procedure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0188" num="0187">To compare two different sets of signed scaling factors, repeatedly capture first and second images, with the image sensor kept in the dark or under a sufficiently dim lighting such that exposure to light either causes negligible light response output signal compared with a reset noise from a pixel <b>14</b> in the pixel array <b>12</b> or causes a negligible change in the light response output signal, for example due to a shot noise, compared with the reset noise. For each of one or more pixels, form a de-noised signal from each pair of a number of pairs of first and second images, preferably 9 or more pairs. Normalize each de-noised signal by dividing by a number that is directly proportional to a de-noised signal that is free of DC offset that would result under the same set of signed scaling factors if given a predetermined non-negligible illumination of the pixel(s). Find a variance among the normalized de-noised signals. The set of signed scaling factors that gives a lesser variance is preferred. This procedure may be repeated for more than two sets of signed scaling factors to find a set of signed scaling factors suitable for forming a de-noised signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0189" num="0188">The image sensor may have a circuit to control repeated captures of first and second images and adjustments of the signed scaling factors applied in the noise and normalizing methods. Alternately, the signed scaling factors may be adjusted under a control from an external controller (not shown) or computer (not shown).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0190" num="0189">Any of these calibration procedures may be completely performed on the image sensor, or partially on the image sensor and partially on the external processor. Alternately, a part of this procedure may be performed on a separate computer and/or under a control of the separate computer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0191" num="0190">A data that corresponds to a set of gain factors may be written into a nonvolatile memory or as a configuration of fuses or antifuses in the image sensor or a separate device that is or is to be included in the image capture system, for example the external processor <b>72</b> or a memory card such as commonly known flash memory cards.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0193" num="0192">For example, although interleaving techniques involving entire lines of an image are shown and described, it is to be understood that the data may be interleaved in a manner that involves less than a full line, or more than one line.
