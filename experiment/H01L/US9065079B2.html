After that, a hole transmission layer <b>28</b> is formed on the first hole injection layer <b>261</b>, the second hole injection layer <b>262</b>, and the third hole injection layer <b>263</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a first fine metal mask is used to form a first organic light-emitting layer <b>30</b> in the first sub-pixel region <b>21</b>, and a second fine metal mask is used to form a second organic light-emitting layer <b>32</b> in the second sub-pixel region <b>22</b> and the third sub-pixel region <b>23</b>. The first organic light-emitting layer <b>30</b> includes a first organic light-emitting material <b>30</b>A, and the second organic light-emitting layer <b>32</b> includes a second organic light-emitting material <b>32</b>A and a third organic light-emitting material <b>32</b>B. The first organic light-emitting material <b>30</b>A is a blue light-emitting material. The second organic light-emitting material <b>32</b>A and the third organic light-emitting material <b>32</b>B can be respectively selected from one of a red light-emitting material and a green light-emitting material, and there is no limitation of the stacking order of the red light-emitting material and the green light-emitting material. The first organic light-emitting layer <b>30</b> and the second organic light-emitting layer <b>32</b> may be formed through an evaporation process respectively, but not limited thereto. In this embodiment, the second organic light-emitting layer <b>32</b> is a composite organic light-emitting layer, and the formation of the second organic light-emitting layer <b>32</b> may include the following processes: performing an evaporation process by using a second fine metal mask to form the second organic light-emitting material <b>32</b>A in the second sub-pixel region <b>22</b> and the third sub-pixel region <b>23</b>; and performing another evaporation process by using the same second fine metal mask to form the third organic light-emitting material <b>32</b>B in the second sub-pixel region <b>22</b> and the third sub-pixel region <b>23</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an electron transmission layer <b>34</b> is formed on the first organic light-emitting layer <b>30</b> and the second organic light-emitting layer <b>32</b>. Then, a first cathode <b>361</b>, a second cathode <b>362</b>, and a third cathode <b>363</b> are respectively formed in the first sub-pixel region <b>21</b>, the second sub-pixel region <b>22</b>, and the third sub-pixel region <b>23</b> of the substrate <b>20</b> to complete the fabrication of the pixel structure of an electroluminescent display panel <b>40</b> of this embodiment. The electroluminescent display panel of this embodiment is a top emission type electroluminescent display panel, so that the first cathode <b>361</b>, the second cathode <b>362</b>, and the third cathode <b>363</b> may be transflective electrodes, such as thin film metal electrodes, but not limited thereto. When the electroluminescent display panel is a bottom emission type electroluminescent display panel, the first cathode <b>361</b>, the second cathode <b>362</b>, and the third cathode <b>363</b> may be reflective electrodes, such as thick metal electrodes. The first cathode <b>361</b>, the second cathode <b>362</b>, and the third cathode <b>363</b> may be electrically connected to each other and be driven by being applied with a common voltage. Alternatively, the first cathode <b>361</b>, the second cathode <b>362</b>, and the third cathode <b>363</b> may be electrically separated and applied with different voltages. In the first sub-pixel region <b>21</b>, a first micro cavity <b>381</b> is formed between the first anode <b>241</b> and the first cathode <b>361</b>; in the second sub-pixel region <b>22</b>, a second micro cavity <b>382</b> is formed between the second anode <b>242</b> and the second cathode <b>362</b>; and in the third sub-pixel region <b>23</b>, a third micro cavity <b>383</b> is formed between the third anode <b>243</b> and the third cathode <b>363</b>. Since the first hole injection layer <b>261</b>, the second hole injection layer <b>262</b>, and the third hole injection layer <b>263</b> have different thickness, the first micro cavity <b>381</b>, the second micro cavity <b>382</b>, and the third micro cavity <b>383</b> have different cavity lengths, resulting in that a first primary color light L<b>1</b>, a second primary color light L<b>2</b>, and a third primary color light L<b>3</b> can be generated in the first sub-pixel region <b>21</b>, the second sub-pixel region <b>22</b>, and the third sub-pixel region <b>23</b> respectively. In this embodiment, the thickness of the first hole injection layer <b>261</b> is less than the thickness of the second hole injection layer <b>262</b> and the thickness of the second hole injection layer <b>262</b> is less than the thickness of the third hole injection layer <b>263</b>, such that the cavity length of the first micro cavity <b>381</b> is less than the cavity length of the second micro cavity <b>382</b> and the cavity length of the second micro cavity <b>382</b> is less than the cavity length of the third micro cavity <b>383</b>. The cavity lengths of the first micro cavity <b>381</b>, the second micro cavity <b>382</b>, and the third micro cavity <b>383</b> may be modified to be different based on the spectra of wavelength of the first primary color light L<b>1</b>, the second primary color light L<b>2</b>, and the third primary color light L<b>3</b>. Specifically, the greater the wavelength is, the greater the cavity length is. When displaying, due to micro cavity effect, the first primary color light (blue light) L<b>1</b> generated by the first organic light-emitting layer <b>30</b> can emit out from the first sub-pixel region <b>21</b>, the second primary color light (green light) L<b>2</b> generated by the second organic light-emitting layer <b>32</b> can emit out from the second sub-pixel region <b>22</b> but cannot emit out from the third sub-pixel region <b>23</b>, and the third primary color light (red light) L<b>3</b> generated by the second organic light-emitting layer <b>32</b> can emitted out from the third sub-pixel region <b>23</b> but cannot emit out from the second sub-pixel region <b>22</b>. As a result, the total amount of the fine metal masks used in the fabrication method of the pixel structure of an electroluminescent display panel of this embodiment can be reduced and the light-mixing ratio is lowered. Furthermore, a high aperture ratio and high resolution of the pixel structure of the electroluminescent display panel <b>40</b> can be preserved. In addition, due to micro cavity, the first primary color light L<b>1</b>, the second primary color light L<b>2</b>, and the third primary color light L<b>3</b> generated in the pixel structure of the electroluminescent display panel <b>40</b> have distinct spectra of wavelength so that the color purity and color saturation can be improved, wherein no color filter is needed in the pixel structure. Furthermore, the pixel structure of the electroluminescent display panel <b>40</b> of this embodiment may at least comprise a first sub-pixel region <b>21</b>, a second sub-pixel region <b>22</b>, and a third sub-pixel region <b>23</b>, or may consist of a first sub-pixel region <b>21</b>, a second sub-pixel region <b>22</b>, and a third sub-pixel region <b>23</b>.</div>
