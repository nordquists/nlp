<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to light-emitting elements utilizing organic electroluminescence (EL) (hereinafter, also referred to as organic EL elements).</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Organic EL elements have been keenly studied and developed (see, Patent Documents 1 and 2 and Non-Patent Document 1). In a fundamental structure of the organic EL element, a layer containing a light-emitting organic compound (hereinafter also referred to as light-emitting layer) is interposed between a pair of electrodes. The organic EL element has attracted attentions as a next-generation flat panel display element owing to characteristics such as feasibility of being thinner and lighter, high speed response to input signals, and capability of direct current low voltage driving.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">In addition, a display using such a light-emitting element has a feature that it is excellent in contrast and image quality, and has a wide viewing angle. Further, since an organic EL element is a plane light source, it is considered that the light-emitting element is applied as a light source such as a backlight of a liquid crystal display and a lighting device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">The light-emission mechanism of organic EL elements is a carrier-injection system. That is, by application of voltage with a light-emitting layer interposed between electrodes, electrons and holes injected from the electrodes are recombined to make a light-emitting substance excited, and light emitted when the excited state returns to a ground state. There are two types of the excited states which are possible: a singlet excited state (S*) and a triplet excited state (T*). In addition, the statistical generation ratio thereof in a light-emitting element is considered to be S*:T*=1:3.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, the ground state of a light-emitting organic compound is a singlet state. Thus, light emission from the singlet excited state (S*) is referred to as fluorescence because it is caused by electron transition between the same spin multiplicities. On the other hand, light emission from a triplet excited state (T*) is referred to as phosphorescence where electron transition occurs between different spin multiplicities. Here, in a compound emitting fluorescence (hereinafter referred to as fluorescent compound), in general, phosphorescence is not observed at room temperature, and only fluorescence is observed. Accordingly, the internal quantum efficiency (the ratio of generated photons to injected carriers) in a light-emitting element using a fluorescent compound is assumed to have a theoretical limit of 25% based on S*:T*=1:3.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">On the other hand, when a compound emitting phosphorescence (hereinafter referred to as phosphorescent compound) is used, an internal quantum efficiency of 100% can be theoretically achieved. In other words, higher emission efficiency can be obtained than that when a fluorescent compound is used. Therefore, the light-emitting element using a phosphorescent compound has been actively developed in recent years in order to achieve a highly efficient light-emitting element. As the phosphorescent compound, in particular, an organometallic complex that has iridium or the like as a central metal has particularly attracted attentions because of its high phosphorescence quantum yield; for example, an organometallic complex that has iridium as a central metal is disclosed as a phosphorescent material in Patent Document 1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">When a light-emitting layer of a light-emitting element is formed using a phosphorescent compound described above, in order to inhibit concentration quenching or quenching due to triplet-triplet annihilation in the phosphorescent compound, the light-emitting layer is often formed such that the phosphorescent compound is dispersed in a matrix of another compound. Here, the compound forming the matrix is called host, and the compound dispersed in the matrix, such as a phosphorescent compound, is called guest (or a dopant).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition, Patent Document 2 or Non-Patent Document 1 describes a method for forming a light-emitting layer with use of a mixture of a material with a high electron-transport property and a material with a high hole-transport property. For example, in Non-Patent Document 1, a light-emitting device is proposed, in which two materials of a tris(8-quinolinolato)aluminum complex (abbreviation: Alq<sub>3</sub>) with a high electron-transport property and 4,4′-bis[N-(1-naphthyl)-N-phenylamino]biphenyl (abbreviation: NPB) with a high hole-transport property and methylquinacridon (abbreviation: mqa) as a guest (dopant) are used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">In the light-emitting layer having such a structure, two kinds of hosts have separate functions, so that electrons and holes can be transferred with good balance. In other words, electrons are transferred by Alq<sub>3 </sub>and holes are transferred by NPB and the electrons and holes reach mqa, so that mqa can be excited. Only fluorescence is emitted from mqa, but in Patent Document 2 discloses that light emission from a triplet excited state can be obtained by using a phosphorescent compound as a guest.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0013">Iridium is a rare element (or minor metal) (Clarke number is 1×10<sup>−7</sup>%) and the deposit of iridium near the earth's surface is smaller than the deposits of platinum (Clarke number is 5×10<sup>−7</sup>%) and gold (Clarke number is 5×10<sup>−7</sup>%) which are more expensive than iridium. Thus, there is a concern about the steady supply of iridium, and the use amount is desired to be small.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0014">However, in general, when a phosphorescent compound is a guest and the concentration of the guest is extremely lowered, the emission efficiency is decreased. This is explained as follows. There are considered to be roughtly two processes in making a guest molecule excited. One is a direct recombination process in which an electron and a hole are injected into a guest molecule so that the guest molecule is excited. The other is an energy transfer process in which a state of an excited host molecule is transferred to a guest molecule.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0015">In order to increase the ratio of the direct recombination process, the concentration of guests should be high. Accordingly, if the concentration of guests is decreased, the recombination probability is also decreased and thus the emission efficiency is decreased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0016">On the other hand, as for the energy transfer process, there are proposed two theories: Förster mechanism and Dexter mechanism.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0017">Förster mechanism (also referred to as Förster resonance energy transfer) does not require direct contact between molecules for energy transfer. It is considered that through a resonant phenomenon of dipolar oscillation between a host molecule and a guest molecule, energy is transferred. By the resonant phenomenon of dipolar oscillation, a host molecule provides energy to a guest molecule, and thus, the host molecule is put in a ground state and the guest molecule is put in an excited state. The rate constant k<sub>h*→g </sub>of Förster mechanism is expressed by Formula (1).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0023">In general, the possible distance of energy transfer due to Dexter mechanism is about 1 nm or less, while the possible distance of energy transfer due to Förster mechanism is about 10 nm or less. Therefore, when the concentration of guests is small and the distance between a guest molecule and an excited host molecule is large, the energy transfer efficiency is extremely decreased. For that reason, the concentration of guests needs to be 3% or higher.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0024">As described above, in consideration of an elementary process from carrier recombination to formation of an excited guest, the concentration of guests should be high in order to put a guest in an excited state efficiently. However, if the concentration of guests is high, a decrease in emission efficiency due to clumping of guests, that is, concentration quenching occurs and thus the emission efficiency of the element is decreased as a result, even if the guests are put in excited states efficiently. In other words, if the concentration of guests is low, the generation efficiency of excited guests is low, whereas if the concentration of guests is high, concentration quenching occurs. In either case, there is a dilemma that the emission efficiency is decreased.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0039">In addition, it is found that energy is transferred more easily from a host molecule to a guest molecule, as the absorptive power of the guest molecule at the emission peak of the host molecule is higher.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0040">In other words, the energy level of an excited state of a host molecule and the energy level of an excited state of a guest molecule are set to be substantially equal and the transition probability of the guest molecule into an excited state is increased, thereby contributing to easier energy transfer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0041">However, under this condition, when a single material is used as a host in a conventional manner, the energy of an excited guest molecule is easily transferred to a host molecule in a ground state, which leads to a decrease of emission efficiency as a result.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0042">This problem can be solved with use of an exciplex. Exciplex will be described now. The exciplex (excited complex) is formed by an interaction between dissimilar molecules in excited states. The exciplex is generally known to be easily formed between a material having a relatively deep LUMO (LUMO: Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) level and a material having a relatively shallow HOMO (HOMO: Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) level.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0043">Here, the HOMO levels and LUMO levels of a first organic compound and a second organic compound used in one embodiment of the present invention are different from each other. Specifically, the energy levels are higher in the following order: HOMO level of a first organic compound&lt;HOMO level of a second organic compound&lt;LUMO level of the first organic compound&lt;LUMO level of the second organic compound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0044">However, even if this condition is satisfied, an exciplex is not necessarily formed, for example, Alq<sub>3 </sub>and NPB in Non-Patent Document 1 do not form an exciplex. Note that the following effects cannot be obtained when no exciplex is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0045">When an exciplex is formed by a first organic compound and a second organic compound, the LUMO level and the HOMO level of the exciplex originate from the first organic compound and the second organic compound, respectively. Therefore, the energy difference of the exciplex is smaller than the energy difference of the first organic compound and the energy difference of the second organic compound. In other words, the emission wavelength of the exciplex is located on the longer wavelength side than the emission wavelengths of the first organic compound and the second organic compound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0046">The formation process of the exciplex is considered to be roughly classified into the following two processes. A first process is formation of an electroplex. In this specification, the term “electroplex” means that a first organic compound in the ground state and a second organic compound in the ground state directly form an exciplex. Specifically, when an anion of a first organic compound and a cation of a second organic compound are adjacent, the both form an exciplex.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0047">From the above relation, in the case where the first organic compound is a compound having an electron-trapping property and the second organic compound is a compound having a hole-trapping property, an electroplex is formed directly from an anion of the first organic compound and a cation of the second organic compound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0048">The emission spectrum of the electroplex formed is located on the longer wavelength side than the emission wavelength of each of the first and second organic compounds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0049">The overlap between the emission spectrum of the electroplex and the absorption spectrum of the phosphorescent compound is larger than the overlap between the emission spectrum of the first organic compound (or the second organic compound) and the absorption spectrum of the phosphorescent compound. The light-emitting element in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention transfers energy by utilizing the overlap between the emission spectrum of the exciplex and the absorption spectrum of the phosphorescent compound as a guest and thus has high energy transfer efficiency. Therefore, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a light-emitting element having high external quantum efficiency can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0050">As described above, in general, when an electron and a hole are recombined in a host material, excitation energy is transferred from the host molecule in an excited state to a guest molecule, whereby the guest molecule is put in an excited state to emit light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0051">At this time, before the excitation energy is transferred from the host molecule to the guest molecule, the host molecule itself emits light in a non-desired wavelength or the excitation energy turns into thermal energy, which leads to partial loss of the excitation energy (deactivation). In particular, when the host molecule is in a singlet excited state, excitation life is shorter than that when it is in a triplet excited state, which easily leads to deactivation of a singlet exciton. The deactivation of exciton is one of causes for decrease in lifetime of a light-emitting element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0052">However, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, an electroplex is formed from a first organic compound and a second organic compound having carriers (cation or anion); therefore, formation of a singlet exciton having a short excitation lifetime can be suppressed. In other words, there can be a process where an exciplex is directly formed without formation of a singlet exciton. Thus, deactivation of the singlet exciton can be inhibited. Accordingly, a light-emitting element having a long lifetime can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0053">It is a novel concept to obtain a light-emitting element having high emission efficiency by suppressing the generation of the singlet excited state of a host and transferring energy from an electroplex to a guest molecule, in this manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0054">As another process, there is thought to be an elementary process where one of first and second organic compounds serving as hosts forms a singlet exciton and then interacts with the other in the ground state to form an exciplex. Unlike an electroplex, a singlet exciton of the host is temporarily generated in this case, but this is rapidly converted into an exciplex, and thus, deactivation of the single exciton can be inhibited.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0055">The experiment result below also shows that the singlet exciton of a host is converted into an exciplex rapidly. Thus, deactivation of the host can be inhibited. Accordingly, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a light-emitting element having a long lifetime can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0056">Also in this case, the emission spectrum of the exciplex formed is located on the longer wavelength side than the emission wavelength of each of the first and second organic compounds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0057">The overlap between the emission spectrum of the exciplex and the absorption spectrum of the phosphorescent compound is larger than the overlap between the emission spectrum of the first organic compound (or the second organic compound) and the absorption spectrum of the phosphorescent compound. The light-emitting element in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention transfers energy by utilizing the overlap between the emission spectrum of the exciplex and the absorption spectrum of the phosphorescent compound and thus has high energy transfer efficiency. Therefore, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a light-emitting element having high external quantum efficiency can be provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0058">Note that in accordance with the above relation, the first organic compound is a compound having an electron-trapping property, while the second organic compound is a compound having a hole-trapping property. When the differences in HOMO level and LUMO level between the compounds are large (specifically, 0.3 eV or more), an electron preferentially enters the first organic compound and a hole preferentially enters the second organic compound. In this case, it is considered that the process where an electroplex is formed takes precedence over the process where an exciplex is formed through a singlet exciton.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0059">In addition, there can be a concept that an exciplex has an energy level only in its excited state. Therefore, the molecules forming an exciplex are two or more independent molecules in ground states and the molecules do not form any complex in their ground states.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0060">For example, when energy is transferred from an exciplex in an excited state to a guest molecule in a ground state and the guest molecule is put in an excited state, if the guest molecule tries to excite another molecule, the molecule to be excited is only the first organic compound or the second organic compound in one embodiment of the present invention. If the guest molecule in an excited state tries to excite the first organic compound or the second organic compound, the energy of the guest molecule in an excited state is not adequate, and thus the excitation cannot occur.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0061">In other words, it is considered that a deactivation phenomenon of the guest molecule before light emission (that is, loss of emission efficiency) because energy of the excited state of the guest molecule is transferred to the exciplex reversely, does not occur in principle. This also contributes to improvement of emission efficiency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0062">As described above, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the energy differences between the excited states and the ground states of molecules between which energy is transferred are preferably substantially equal. In other words, the excitation energy level of the exciplex and the excitation energy level of the guest are substantially equal. On the other hand, the excitation energy levels of the first organic compound and the second organic compound which form the exciplex are higher than the excitation energy level of the exciplex.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0063">In other words, if the guest molecule in an excited state tries to excite the first organic compound or the second organic compound, the energy is not adequate and thus the probability of energy transfer from the guest molecule to another molecule is extremely low. Thus, the emission efficiency is increased in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. In addition, thermal deactivation can be inhibited, so that the light-emitting element can have a longer lifetime, deteriorate less and have a higher reliability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0064">In addition, as described above, an exciplex is formed from a singlet exciton of the first organic compound or the second organic compound in some cases. In other words, a possible elementary process of formation of an exciplex is that one of the first and second organic compounds forms a singlet exciton and then interacts with the other in the ground state. This process seems to be done very rapidly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0065">A singlet exciton has a short excitation lifetime (small τ). Thus, there is a problem in that part of excitation energy is lost (through light emission in a non-desired wavelength or thermal deactivation) before the excitation energy is transferred from a singlet exciton of a host to a guest material (Φ<sub>ET </sub>tends to be small in Formula (3)).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0066">However, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, such deactivation of excitation energy can be inhibited because the singlet exciton of a host rapidly forms an exciplex. Furthermore, the exciplex has a relatively long excitation lifetime, which is considered to increase the energy transfer efficiency Φ<sub>ET</sub>. Accordingly, it is possible to inhibit the deactivation of the singlet exciton of a host that may affect not only the efficiency of an element but also the lifetime thereof, so that a light-emitting element with a long lifetime can be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0067">In addition, it is preferable that the excitation energy of the exciplex is sufficiently transferred to the phosphorescent compound, and that light emission from the exciplex is not substantially observed from the element. Therefore, energy is preferably transferred to the phosphorescent compound through the exciplex of the host so that the phosphorescent compound emits phosphorescence.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0068">According to the above-described concept of energy transfer, it is effective when at least one of the first and second organic compounds is a fluorescent compound (i.e., a compound which is likely to undergo light emission or thermal deactivation from the singlet excited state). Therefore, at least one of the first and second organic compounds is preferably a fluorescent compound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0069">Note that in the case where a phosphorescent compound is used as an organic compound (first organic compound and/or second organic compound) serving as a host material, the organic compound itself is likely to emit light and unlikely to allow energy to be transferred to a guest material. In this case, it is favorable if the organic compound could emit light efficiently, but it is difficult to achieve high emission efficiency because the organic compound serving as a host causes the problem of concentration quenching. For this reason, it is preferable that the organic compound is a fluorescent compound and energy transfer is achieved with the above-described composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0070">Note that the above-described effect can be obtained when an exciplex is formed from the first organic compound and the second organic compound. For example, no exciplex is formed by the method disclosed in Non-Patent Document 1, and thus a guest molecule can be excited through a direct recombination process, and the emission efficiency is not sufficiently high.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0071">Note that in general, the use of an exciplex for a light-emitting layer of a light-emitting element has a value such as being capable of controlling the emission color, but usually causes a significant decrease in emission efficiency. Therefore, the use of an exciplex has been considered unsuitable for obtaining a highly efficient light-emitting element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0072">However, the present inventors have found that the use of an exciplex as a medium for energy transfer to a phosphorescent compound enables, on the contrary, emission efficiency to be maximized as shown in one embodiment of the present invention. This technical idea conflicts with the conventional fixed idea.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0073">In addition, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the excitation energy level of an exciplex and the energy level of a guest in an excited state are set to be substantially equal, and the transition probability of the guest to an excited state is increased, whereby the probability of energy transfer process is increased. As a result, sufficient energy transfer can be achieved even when the concentration of guests is from 0.1% to 2.5%, preferably from 0.1% to 1.5%, more preferably from 0.1% to 0.5%. With such concentrations, concentration quenching can be inhibited, and thereby the emission efficiency can be maximized.</div>

<heading id="h-0007">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0103">Embodiments will now be described with reference to drawings in detail. Note that the present invention is not limited to the following description, and it will be easily understood by those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Therefore, the present invention should not be construed as being limited to the description in the following embodiments. Note that in the structures of the present invention described below, the same portions or portions having similar functions are denoted by the same reference numerals in different drawings, and description of such portions is not repeated.</div>
<heading id="h-0008">Embodiment 1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0104">In this embodiment, a light-emitting element in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention will be described. The light-emitting element of this embodiment includes a light-emitting layer including a guest as a light-emitting substance and a host in which the guest is dispersed. Specifically, a phosphorescent compound is used as the guest and a first organic compound and a second organic compound are used as hosts. In addition, the combination of the first organic compound and the second organic compound forms an exciplex.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0105">In this embodiment, preferably, the level of a triplet excitation energy (T* level) of each of the organic compounds used as hosts is higher than that of the guest. This is because, when the T* level of the host is lower than that of the guest, the triplet excitation energy of the guest, which is to contribute to light emission, is quenched by the host and accordingly the emission efficiency is decreased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0106">As described above, when the T* level of the guest is substantially equal to the T* level of an exciplex, the T* level of the guest is lower than the T* level of the first organic compound (or the second organic compound). For that reason, the problem can often be overcome.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0107">The first organic compound and the second organic compound serving as the hosts form an exciplex. When the exciplex formed emits light, the emission wavelength thereof is located on the longer wavelength side than the emission wavelength (fluorescent wavelength) of each of the first and second organic compounds. In other words, by formation of the exciplex, the fluorescent spectrum of the first organic compound and the fluorescent spectrum of the second organic compound can be converted into an emission spectrum which is located on the longer wavelength side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0108">Therefore, even when the fluorescent spectrum of the first organic compound (or the second organic compound) is located on the shorter wavelength side than the absorption band of the phosphorescent compound which is located on the longest wavelength side, and does not have an overlap with the absorption band, the fluorescent spectrum is converted into an emission spectrum with a long wavelength by forming an exciplex so as to have a large overlap with the absorption band.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0109">The light-emitting element in this embodiment transfers energy from the exciplex to the phosphorescent compound with use of the overlap of an emission spectrum of the exciplex with an absorption spectrum of the phosphorescent compound, and thus sufficient energy transfer efficiency can be provided even when the concentration of guests is from 0.1% to 2.5%, preferably from 0.1% to 1.5%, more preferably from 0.1% to 0.5%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0110">To make the emission spectrum of the exciplex and the absorption spectrum of the guest material sufficiently overlap each other, the difference between the energy of a peak of the emission spectrum and the energy of a peak of the absorption band on the lowest energy side in the absorption spectrum is preferably 0.3 eV or less. The difference is more preferably 0.2 eV or less, even more preferably 0.1 eV or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0111">The light emitting element in this embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0112"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates a light-emitting element having an EL layer <b>102</b> between a first electrode <b>101</b> and a second electrode <b>103</b>. The light-emitting element in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> includes a hole-injection layer <b>111</b>, a hole-transport layer <b>112</b>, a light-emitting layer <b>113</b>, an electron-transport layer <b>114</b>, and an electron-injection layer <b>115</b> which are stacked over the first electrode <b>101</b> in this order and the second electrode <b>103</b> provided over the electron-injection layer <b>115</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0113">For the first electrode <b>101</b>, a metal, an alloy, an electrically conductive compound, a mixture thereof, or the like which has a high work function (specifically, a work function of 4.0 eV or more) is preferably used. Specific examples include indium oxide-tin oxide (ITO: indium tin oxide), indium oxide-tin oxide containing silicon or silicon oxide, indium oxide-zinc oxide (indium zinc oxide), indium oxide containing tungsten oxide and zinc oxide (IWZO), and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0114">Such conductive metal oxide films are usually formed by a sputtering method, but may also be formed by a sol-gel method or the like. For example, a film of indium oxide-zinc oxide can be formed by a sputtering method using a target in which zinc oxide is added to indium oxide at 1 wt % to 20 wt %. An IWZO film can be formed by a sputtering method using a target in which 0.5 wt % to 5 wt % of tungsten oxide and 0.1 wt % to 1 wt % of zinc oxide are added to indium oxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0115">Other examples are graphene, gold, platinum, nickel, tungsten, chromium, molybdenum, iron, cobalt, copper, palladium, nitrides of metal materials (e.g., titanium nitride), and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0116">Note that, in the case where in the EL layer <b>102</b>, a layer formed in contact with the first electrode <b>101</b> is formed using a composite material in which an organic compound and an electron acceptor (an acceptor) which are described later are mixed, the first electrode <b>101</b> can be formed using any of various types of metals, alloys, and electrically-conductive compounds, a mixture thereof, and the like regardless of the work function. For example, aluminum (Al), silver (Ag), an alloy containing aluminum (e.g., Al—Si), or the like can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0117">The first electrode <b>101</b> can be formed by, for example, a sputtering method, an evaporation method (including a vacuum evaporation method), or the like.</div>

Then, the substrate was fixed to a holder provided in an evaporation chamber in the vacuum evaporation apparatus so that the surface provided with ITSO faced downward.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0211" num="0211">The pressure in the evaporation chamber was reduced to about 10<sup>−4 </sup>Pa.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0246" num="0246">In this example, a light-emitting element 7, a light-emitting element 8, and a light-emitting element 9 with different concentrations of guests were fabricated, and the characteristics thereof were compared.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0247" num="0247">First, a glass substrate over which indium tin oxide including silicon (ITSO) with a thickness of 110 nm was formed as the first electrode <b>101</b> serving as an anode was prepared. A surface of the ITSO was covered with a polyimide film so that an area of 2 mm×2 mm of the surface was exposed. The electrode area was 2 mm×2 mm. As a pretreatment for forming the light-emitting element over the substrate, the surface of the substrate was washed with water and baked at 200° C. for one hour, and then a UV ozone treatment was performed for 370 seconds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0248" num="0248">After that, the substrate was transferred into a vacuum evaporation apparatus whose pressure was reduced to about 10<sup>−4 </sup>Pa, vacuum baking at 170° C. for 30 minutes was performed in a heating chamber of the vacuum evaporation apparatus, and then the substrate was cooled down for about 30 minutes. Then, the substrate was fixed to a holder provided in an evaporation chamber in the vacuum evaporation apparatus so that the surface provided with ITSO faced downward.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0249" num="0249">The pressure in the evaporation chamber was reduced to about 10<sup>−4 </sup>Pa.
