<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a U.S. National Stage application of International Patent Application No. PCT/JP2012/006455 filed on Oct. 9, 2012, and is based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2011-262055 filed on Nov. 30, 2011 and 2012-191627 filed on Aug. 31, 2012, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a semiconductor device having a vertical semiconductor element.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, a semiconductor device having a vertical semiconductor element used for a power circuit such as an inverter or a DC-DC converter of an EHV has been known. In this semiconductor device, an IGBT is used as a vertical semiconductor element. In order to reduce a loss in a semiconductor device having an IGBT, an element structure called a field stop (hereinafter referred to as the FS) has been proposed and put to practical use. Specifically, a back surface of a substrate where an element is formed is shaved, and then an annealing process is performed after ion implantation of impurities such as phosphorus (P) or selenium (Se) into the back surface is performed. Thus, a FS layer having an impurity concentration greater than a raw material concentration of the substrate is formed. Such a FS layer reduces an extension of an electric field, prevents a breakdown voltage from being degraded in spite of the thinning, and reduces a loss.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">However, when the FS layer is formed by ion implantation of phosphorus, it is formed at a shallow depth and sensitive to damage on the back side because the implantation depth is shallow. Therefore, if the damage extends to a depth greater than the FS layer, collector leakage occurs, and fabrication yield decreases. In contrast, when the FS layer is formed by ion implantation of selenium, the implantation depth is deep, and fabrication yield is improved. However, since selenium is not used in a normal IC manufacturing process, special equipment for handling selenium is required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">In this situation, the patent document 1 has proposed a technique for forming a deep FS layer by performing an annealing process after performing a doping process with proton using an accelerator. Further, the patent document 2 has proposed a technique for forming a FS layer by ion implantation of phosphorus in addition to proton. Furthermore, the patent documents 3 and 4 have proposed a technique for forming a FS layer with a multilayer structure by performing implantation of proton multiple times.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">However, when proton is used as proposed in the patent documents 1-4, the activation ratio significantly decreases with an increase in the dose amount. Therefore, a long irradiation time is required to obtain practical concentration, and productivity is reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a diagram showing the peak concentration and the activation ratio with respect to the dose amount of proton when a doping with proton is performed at an accelerating voltage of 4.3 MeV. As shown in this diagram, the activation ratio of proton significantly decreases with an increase in the dose amount of proton. In particular, at a high impurity concentration of about 1×10<sup>15 </sup>cm<sup>−3 </sup>necessary to form a FS layer, since the activation ratio is low, a proton irradiation time becomes long. For this reason, if a FS layer is formed by simply using proton, the manufacturing cost increases due to low productivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">In the method disclosed in the patent document 2, a FS layer is formed by using phosphorus in addition to proton. However, the dose amount of proton is constant regardless of whether phosphorus is implanted or not, and the doping is performed so that the proton concentration peaks at a deep position. Therefore, the problem of the long proton irradiation time is not solved, and an electric field concentration occurs at a boundary between a FS layer and a drift layer, so that a breakdown voltage is reduced. Further, a surge is likely to occur at the time of the switching. Therefore, it is desired to reduce a switching surge without an increase in the manufacturing cost.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">The above explanation is made by taking an IGBT as an example of a vertical semiconductor element. However, the same problems as discussed above can occur in a freewheeling diode (FWD), DMOS, and the like where a FS layer can be formed.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">In view of the above, it is an object of the present disclosure to provide a semiconductor device having a vertical semiconductor element in which an increase in a manufacturing cost is prevented, a breakdown voltage is ensured, and a switching surge is reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a first aspect of the present disclosure, in a semiconductor device having a vertical semiconductor element configured to pass an electric current between an upper electrode and a lower electrode, a FS layer includes a phosphorus/arsenic layer doped with phosphorus or arsenic and a proton layer doped with proton. The phosphorus/arsenic layer is formed from a back side of a semiconductor substrate to a predetermined depth. The proton layer is deeper than the phosphorus/arsenic layer. An impurity concentration of the proton layer peaks inside the phosphorus/arsenic layer and gradually, continuously decreases at a depth greater than the phosphorus/arsenic layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">As described above, the FS layer includes the phosphorus/arsenic and the proton layer, and the impurity concentration of the proton layer gradually decreases. Thus, as compared to when the FS layer is made of only proton, the impurity concentration of the proton layer can decrease. Accordingly, as compared to when the FS layer is formed by implantation of proton only, productivity is improved so that an increase in the manufacturing cost can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">Further, the impurity concentration of the proton layer gradually, continuously decreases at a depth greater than the phosphorus/arsenic layer from a back side of a drift layer. Thus, a difference in an n-type impurity concentration at a boundary between the proton layer and the drift layer becomes small. Therefore, it is possible to relieve an electric field concentration, ensure a breakdown voltage, and reduce a switching surge.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">According to a second aspect of the present disclosure, a depth of the proton layer is defined as x, a concentration ratio of the proton layer with respect to the raw material concentration is defined as y, and x and y satisfy the following relationship: (formula 1) y≧19.061×10<sup>−0.00965x</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">When the depth of the proton layer and the concentration ratio of the proton layer with respect to the raw material concentration are set to satisfy the relationship, the amount of a decrease in the breakdown voltage can be reduced, and breakdown-voltage yield can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">According to a third aspect of the present disclosure, the depth of the proton layer is 20 μm or less, and the concentration ratio of the proton layer with respect to the raw material concentration is three times or more. Thus, the amount of the decrease in the breakdown voltage can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">According to a fourth aspect of the present disclosure, the depth of the proton layer is 20 μm or less, and the concentration ratio of the proton layer with respect to the raw material concentration is four times or more. Thus, the amount of the decrease in the breakdown voltage can be further reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">According to a fifth aspect of the present disclosure, the depth of the proton layer is 15 μm or less, and the concentration ratio of the proton layer with respect to the raw material concentration is four times or more. Thus, the amount of the decrease in the breakdown voltage can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">According to a sixth aspect of the present disclosure, the depth of the proton layer is 15 μm or less, and the concentration ratio of the proton layer with respect to the raw material concentration is seven times or more. Thus, the amount of the decrease in the breakdown voltage can be further reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">According to a seventh aspect of the present disclosure, the depth of the proton layer is 10 μm or less, and the concentration ratio of the proton layer with respect to the raw material concentration is seven times or more. Thus, the amount of the decrease in the breakdown voltage can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">According to an eighth aspect of the present disclosure, the depth of the proton layer is 10 μm or less, and the concentration ratio of the proton layer with respect to the raw material concentration is ten times or more. Thus, the amount of the decrease in the breakdown voltage can be further reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">According to a ninth aspect of the present disclosure, the depth of the proton layer is 7 μm or less, and the concentration ratio of the proton layer with respect to the raw material concentration is ten times or more. Thus, the amount of the decrease in the breakdown voltage can be reduced.</div>

<heading id="h-0009">First Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">A first embodiment of the present disclosure is described. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1(</figref> <i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) show a semiconductor device having an IGBT as a vertical semiconductor element. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref> <i>a</i>) is a diagram illustrating its top layout view, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref> <i>b</i>) is a diagram illustrating its cross-sectional view taken along the line IB-IB in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref> <i>a</i>). <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2(</figref> <i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) are graphs showing impurity concentrations in a cross-section taken along the line IIA-IIA, IIB-IIB in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref> <i>b</i>). <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref> <i>a</i>) shows a designed impurity concentration profile, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref> <i>b</i>) shows a finished impurity concentration profile.

That is, the cell region is located in a central part of a chip which provides the semiconductor device, and the outer voltage-breakdown resistant region is located around the cell region, i.e., located on an outer part of the chip.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref> <i>b</i>), in the semiconductor device according to the present embodiment, the IGBT <b>100</b> is formed in a semiconductor substrate which provides an n<sup>−</sup>-type drift layer <b>1</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">Further, the n<sup>+</sup>-type impurity region <b>5</b> and the p-type channel region <b>4</b> <i>a </i>are electrically connected to an upper electrode <b>10</b> corresponding to the emitter electrode through contact holes <b>9</b> <i>a </i>of an interlayer dielectric <b>9</b>. Although not shown in the drawings, a passivation film covering the upper electrode <b>10</b> and wires are formed.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">An n-type region (hole stopper (HS) layer) <b>12</b> is located in the middle of the p-type region <b>4</b> <i>b </i>in the thickness direction of the p-type region <b>4</b> <i>b </i>and connects adjacent trenches <b>6</b>. Because of the n-type region <b>12</b>, when the IGBT portion performs the IGBT action, carriers can be accumulated in the p-type region <b>4</b> <i>b </i>at a position below the n-type region <b>12</b>. If there is no n-type region <b>12</b>, holes flows toward the upper electrode <b>10</b> through the p-type region <b>4</b> <i>b</i>, so that an ON-voltage will be increased. To reduce the ON-voltage, it is preferable that as many holes as possible be accumulated at the time of the IGBT action so that conductivity modulation can occur.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">The semiconductor device having the IGBT <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment is structured in a manner described above. Next, a method of manufacturing the semiconductor device is described. Since the semiconductor device according to the present embodiment can be manufactured by almost the same method as a conventional semiconductor device, the description is focused on different parts from the conventional semiconductor device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">Firstly, a semiconductor substrate as a raw material for the n<sup>−</sup>-type drift layer <b>1</b> is prepared, and a surface treatment, such as polishing, for surface planarization is performed as a raw material treatment process. Then, an ion implantation and thermal diffusion process for forming the p-type region <b>4</b>, a process for forming the trench <b>6</b>, a process for forming the gate insulation layer <b>7</b> and the gate electrode <b>8</b>, and an ion implantation and thermal diffusion process for forming the p-type body region <b>4</b> <i>c </i>and the n<sup>+</sup>-type impurity region <b>5</b> are performed. Then, a process for forming the contact hole <b>9</b> <i>a </i>is performed after the interlayer dielectric <b>9</b> is formed. Further, the upper electrode <b>10</b> is formed by patterning an electrode material such as aluminum. Then, although not shown in the drawings, the passivation film made of polyimide or the like is formed. In this way, a manufacturing process for a front side of the substrate is finished.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">Next, the back side of the semiconductor substrate, which provides the n<sup>−</sup>-type drift layer <b>1</b>, is grinded to a desired thickness. If necessary, an etching process is performed for surface planarization. Then, a phosphorus ion implantation process for forming the phosphorus FS layer <b>2</b> <i>a </i>and a boron ion implantation process for forming the p<sup>+</sup>-type impurity region <b>3</b> are performed. Then, a local thermal treatment, which does not affect the front side, is performed by laser annealing to diffuse the implanted ions. Then, the lower electrode <b>11</b> is formed by depositing an electrode material such as aluminum. Then, a process for forming the proton FS layer <b>2</b> <i>b </i>including a proton irradiation process and a low-temperature annealing process is performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">For example, in the proton irradiation process of the process for forming the proton FS layer <b>2</b> <i>b</i>, proton doping is performed using an accelerator under conditions that the accelerating voltage is 4 MeV and the dose amount is 1×10<sup>13 </sup>cm<sup>−2 </sup>or more. When the proton FS layer <b>2</b> <i>b </i>is formed at such an accelerating voltage, the impurity concentration of the proton FS layer <b>2</b> <i>b </i>peaks inside the phosphorus FS layer <b>2</b> <i>a </i>and gradually, continuously decreases at a depth greater than the phosphorus FS layer <b>2</b> <i>a </i>from the back side of the n<sup>−</sup>-type drift layer <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">For example, a full width at half-maximum ΔR(μm) and a range Rp with respect to a proton accelerating voltage (MeV) can be represented as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref> <i>a</i>), and a depth (range) Rp and a proton concentration N can have a relationship as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref> <i>b</i>). Therefore, the width of the proton FS layer <b>2</b> <i>b </i>can be determined based on the accelerating voltage. Further, the peak depth Rp can be adjusted by adjusting a thickness of an absorber (absorbing agent).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">As described above, in the semiconductor device according to the present embodiment, the FS layer <b>2</b> includes the phosphorus FS layer <b>2</b> <i>a </i>and the proton FS layer <b>2</b> <i>b</i>, and the impurity concentration of the proton layer (<b>2</b> <i>b</i>) gradually decreases. Thus, as compared to when the FS layer <b>2</b> is made of only proton, the impurity concentration of the proton FS layer <b>2</b> <i>b </i>can decrease. Accordingly, as compared to when the FS layer <b>2</b> is formed by implantation of proton only, productivity is improved so that an increase in the manufacturing cost can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">Further, the impurity concentration of the proton FS layer <b>2</b> <i>b </i>gradually, continuously decreases at a depth greater than the phosphorus FS layer <b>2</b> <i>a </i>from the back side of the n<sup>−</sup>-type drift layer <b>1</b>. Thus, a difference in a n-type impurity concentration at a boundary between the proton FS layer <b>2</b> <i>b </i>and the n<sup>−</sup>-type drift layer <b>1</b> becomes small. Therefore, it is possible to relieve an electric field concentration, ensure a breakdown voltage, and reduce a switching surge.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">Further, in the semiconductor device according to the present embodiment, for example, the FS layer <b>2</b> is formed such that the proton FS layer <b>2</b> <i>b </i>has the diffusion depth of 15 μm or less and has the n-type impurity concentration of 3×10<sup>14 </sup>cm<sup>−3 </sup>or more. These values are set based on the examination results which have been conducted to evaluate the breakdown voltage observed when a defect occurs in the phosphorus FS layer <b>2</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref> show results of simulations conducted to evaluate a relationship between the n-type impurity concentration of the proton FS layer <b>2</b> and the breakdown voltage by keeping the raw material concentration at 0.75×10<sup>14 </sup>cm<sup>−3 </sup>while changing a depth Xj of the proton FS layer <b>2</b> <i>b</i>, a peak depth Rp of the proton FS layer <b>2</b> <i>b</i>, and the width of the defect in the phosphorus FS layer <b>2</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>, basically, the breakdown voltage of the semiconductor device depends on the n-type impurity concentration of the proton FS layer <b>2</b> <i>b</i>, specifically, depends on a concentration ratio of the proton FS layer <b>2</b> <i>b </i>with respect to a raw material concentration, and the breakdown voltage increases with an increase in the concentration ratio. When there is no defect (defect width=0 μm), the breakdown voltage of from 1400V to 1500V can be obtained irrespective of the depth Xj of the proton FS layer <b>2</b> <i>b </i>and the peak depth Rp (i.e., the distance from the outermost surface of the back side of the semiconductor substrate) of the proton FS layer <b>2</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">However, when the defect occurs, the breakdown voltage decreases depending on the defect width.

Even when the concentration ratio of the proton FS layer <b>2</b> <i>b </i>with respect to the raw material concentration is small, the amount of the decrease becomes smaller as the depth Xj is larger.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">Specifically, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, if the depth Xj of the proton FS layer <b>2</b> <i>b </i>is 15 μm, and the peak depth Rp of the proton FS layer <b>2</b> <i>b </i>is 0 μm, the amount of the decrease in the breakdown voltage of the semiconductor device can be reduced to about half the maximum amount of the decrease when the impurity concentration of the proton FS layer <b>2</b> <i>b </i>is 3×10<sup>14 </sup>cm<sup>−3 </sup>or more. That is, assuming that an intended breakdown voltage is 1500V, the breakdown voltage decreases up to 900V, and the maximum amount of the decrease is 600V. Since the amount of the decrease is about the half (300V), the breakdown voltage can be 1200V or more. In this case, since the raw material concentration is 0.75×10<sup>14 </sup>cm<sup>−3 </sup>or more, the decrease in the breakdown voltage can be reduced to about half the maximum amount of the decrease when the concentration ratio of the proton FS layer <b>2</b> <i>b </i>with respect to the raw material concentration is four times or more.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">Likewise, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, if the depth Xj of the proton FS layer <b>2</b> <i>b </i>is 7 μm, and the peak depth Rp of the proton FS layer <b>2</b> <i>b </i>is 0 μm, the amount of the decrease in the breakdown voltage of the semiconductor device can be reduced to about half the maximum amount of the decrease when the impurity concentration of the proton FS layer <b>2</b> <i>b </i>is 7×10<sup>14 </sup>cm<sup>−3 </sup>or more.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">A range where the amount of the decrease in the breakdown voltage can be reduced by half is defined as an effective range for a breakdown-voltage yield improvement, and a range where the amount of the decrease in the breakdown voltage can be reduced by more than half is defined as a more preferable range for the breakdown-voltage yield improvement. The effective range and the more preferable range for the breakdown-voltage yield improvement can be represented as approximate curves shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The approximate curves can be expressed by the following formulas 1 and 2. In the formulas 1 and 2, x represents the depth Xj of the proton FS layer <b>2</b> <i>b</i>, and <i>y </i>represents values on boundaries of the effective range and the more preferable range for the breakdown-voltage yield improvement.

<i>y=</i>25.939×10<sup>−0.0892x</sup>  (Formula 2)
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">Therefore, when the concentration ratio of the proton FS layer <b>2</b> <i>b </i>with respect to the raw material concentration is greater than y given by the formula 1, the breakdown-voltage yield can be effectively improved. Further, when the concentration ratio is greater than y given by the formula 2, the breakdown-voltage yield can be more effectively improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">To examine the effective range for the breakdown-voltage yield improvement shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a recovery ratio of a contact leakage failure, i.e., a leakage failure due to the defect in the phosphorus FS layer <b>2</b> <i>a </i>was measured while the dose amount of proton was changed. The experiment was conducted under conditions that the raw material concentration is 7×10<sup>13 </sup>cm<sup>−3 </sup>and the depth Xj of the proton FS layer <b>2</b> <i>b </i>ranges from about 10 to 13 μm. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a result of the experiment indicates that when the dose amount of proton was 4×10<sup>13 </sup>cm<sup>−2 </sup>or more, almost 100% of the contact leakage failure was recovered. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the peak concentration of the proton FS layer <b>2</b> <i>b </i>indicates a peak value of the impurity concentration in the proton FS layer <b>2</b> <i>b </i>when the dose amount of proton is a predetermined value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">Further, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, since a scale of the dose amount of proton can be replaced with a scale of the peak concentration of the proton FS layer <b>2</b> <i>b </i>when the raw material concentration is 7×10<sup>13 </sup>cm<sup>−3</sup>, a relationship between this peak concentration and the recovery ratio of the contact leakage failure. The following result can be obtained by plotting this in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> according to the depth Xj of the proton FS layer <b>2</b> <i>b</i>. The recovery ratio is very low, 0% or 20% outside the effective range for the breakdown-voltage yield improvement, and the recovery ratio is relatively high, 40% close to the effective range, but slightly outside the effective range. As shown in the drawing, the recovery ratio is high within the effective range and 100% within the more preferable range.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">As described above, it has been shown that the contact leakage failure is recovered within the effective range for the breakdown-voltage yield improvement. From this, it can be seen that the amount of the decrease in the breakdown voltage can be reduced by designing the depth Xj and the concentration of the proton FS layer <b>2</b> <i>b </i>within the effective range for the breakdown-voltage yield improvement.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">In the above, the breakdown voltage is defined on the basis of the concentration ratio of the proton FS layer <b>2</b> <i>b </i>with respect to the raw martial concentration. This is because since a breakdown voltage design depends basically on a raw material concentration, the breakdown voltage depends on the concentration ratio of the proton FS layer <b>2</b> <i>b </i>with respect to the raw martial concentration. Therefore, even if the raw martial concentration varies, the amount of the decrease in the breakdown voltage can be reduced by selecting the concentration ratio of the proton FS layer <b>2</b> <i>b </i>with respect to the raw martial concentration in the same manner as described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">Further, when the proton FS layer <b>2</b> <i>b </i>is formed in the manner as described in the present embodiment, He-ray irradiation near the FS layer can be omitted. This is explained with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10(</figref> <i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">Normally, lifetime control is performed by performing the He-ray irradiation from the back side of the substrate after the element is formed. A reason for performing the He-ray irradiation from the back side of the substrate is to prevent the gate insulation layer <b>7</b> and the like on the front side of the substrate from being damaged by the He-ray irradiation. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref> <i>a</i>), if the FS layer <b>2</b> is made of an impurity other than proton, the He-ray irradiation is applied to a region (He-ray irradiation region <b>1</b>) of the n<sup>−</sup>-type drift layer <b>1</b> near the p-type region <b>4</b> and applied to a region (He-ray irradiation region <b>2</b>) inside the FS layer <b>2</b>. In contrast, proton becomes a donor and can be used to form the FS layer <b>2</b>. Further, since proton has a function as a lifetime killer, lifetime control can be performed by proton. Therefore, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref> <i>b</i>), there is no need to apply the He-ray irradiation to the region inside the FS layer <b>2</b>, and the lifetime control can be simplified.</div>
