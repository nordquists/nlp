<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Organic light emitting display devices are devices that have a structure in which an emission layer is formed between a cathode, through which an electron is injected, and an anode through which a positive hole is injected, and use the principle in which, when the electron generated from the cathode and the positive hole generated from the anode are injected into the emission layer, the injected electron and positive hole are combined to generate an exciton, and the exciton is shifted from an excited state to a ground state to emit light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Hereinafter, a related art organic light emitting display device will be described with reference to the drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a circuit diagram of a pixel configuring a related art organic light emitting display device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the pixel configuring the related art organic light emitting display device includes a gate line GL, a data line DL, a high power line VDD, a reference line Ref, a switching thin film transistor (TFT) T<b>1</b>, a driving TFT T<b>2</b>, a sensing TFT T<b>3</b>, a capacitor C, and an organic light emitting diode OLED.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">The switching TFT T<b>1</b> is turned on according to a gate signal supplied through the gate line GL, and supplies a data voltage, supplied from the data line DL, to the driving TFT T<b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">The driving TFT T<b>2</b> is turned on with the data voltage supplied from the switching TFT T<b>1</b>, and generates a data current from power supplied from the high power line VDD to supply the data current to the organic light emitting diode OLED.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">The sensing TFT T<b>3</b> is for sensing a threshold voltage deviation of the driving TFT T<b>2</b> that causes a degradation in a quality of an image, and sensing of the threshold voltage deviation is performed in a sensing mode. The sensing TFT T<b>3</b> supplies a current of the driving TFT T<b>2</b> to the reference line Ref in response to a sensing control signal supplied through the gate line GL.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">The capacitor C holds the data voltage supplied to the driving TFT T<b>2</b> during one frame, and is connected to a gate electrode and a source electrode of the driving TFT T<b>2</b>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">In the pixel of the related art organic light emitting display device, an error can occur due to various causes. For example, a dark spot error can occur when a line or an electrode is disconnected, such that black is always displayed because a pixel is not driven; and a hot spot error can occur when a line or an electrode is short-circuited, such that white is always displayed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">Because a quality of a displayed image is degraded due to the dark spot error or the hot spot error, a method of repairing a defect of a pixel is needed.</div>

In the following description, when a detailed description of well-known functions or configurations related to this document is determined to unnecessarily cloud a gist of the invention, the detailed description thereof will be omitted. The progression of processing steps and/or operations described is an example; however, the sequence of steps and/or operations is not limited to that set forth herein and may be changed as is known in the art, with the exception of steps and/or operations necessarily occurring in a certain order. Like reference numerals designate like elements throughout. Names of the respective elements used in the following explanations are selected only for convenience of writing the specification and may be thus different from those used in actual products.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">In the description of embodiments, when a structure is described as being positioned โon or aboveโ or โunder or belowโ another structure, this description should be construed as including a case in which the structures contact each other as well as a case in which a third structure is disposed therebetween.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">Hereinafter, embodiments will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a circuit diagram of an organic light emitting display device according to an embodiment. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a unit pixel that may include four pixels respectively arranged on first to fourth columns, which may be provided on each of a first row and a second row. A pixel of the first row may be disposed over a pixel of the second row with respect to a first sensing control line SCL<b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">As seen in the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> example, an organic light emitting display device according to an embodiment may include a substrate <b>100</b>, first and second gate lines GL<b>1</b> and GL<b>2</b>, first and second sensing control lines SCL<b>1</b> and SCL<b>2</b>, first to fourth data lines DL<b>1</b> to DL<b>4</b>, first and second high power lines VDD<b>1</b> and VDD<b>2</b>, a reference line Ref, a switching TFT T<b>1</b>, a driving TFT T<b>2</b>, a sensing TFT T<b>3</b>, a capacitor C, an organic light emitting diode OLED, and a repair line <b>210</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">A pixel of a first column may be formed between the first high power line VDD<b>1</b> and the first data line DL<b>1</b>, a pixel of a second column may be formed between the second data line DL<b>2</b> and the reference line Ref, a pixel of a third column may be formed between the reference line Ref and the third data line DL<b>3</b>, and a pixel of the fourth column may be formed between the fourth data line DL<b>4</b> and the second high power line VDD<b>2</b>. Also, a plurality of pixels respectively arranged on the first to fourth columns may include a pixel of a first row that may include the first gate line GL<b>1</b>, the first sensing control line SCL<b>1</b>, and the organic light emitting diode OLED; and a pixel of a second row that may include the second gate line GL<b>2</b>, the second sensing control line SCL<b>2</b>, and the organic light emitting diode OLED. According to an embodiment, as described above, four pixels respectively arranged on the first to fourth columns may be provided by using two the high power lines VDD<b>1</b> and VDD<b>2</b> and the reference line Ref, and thus, the total number of lines may be reduced. That is, because one power line, one reference line, one data line, one gate line, and one sensing control line are generally used to form one pixel of the related art, each of the lines is used four times by the related art for forming four pixels. However, according to an embodiment, two power lines, one reference line, four data lines, four gate lines, and four sensing control lines are used to form four pixels, and thus, the total number of power lines and the total number of reference lines are reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">The switching TFT T<b>1</b>, the driving TFT T<b>2</b>, the sensing TFT T<b>3</b>, the capacitor C, and the organic light emitting diode OLED may be included in each of the plurality of pixels. The unit pixel may include four pixels, which may include a pixel emitting red (R) light, a pixel emitting white (W) light, a pixel emitting blue (B) light, and a pixel emitting green (G) light, but embodiments are not limited thereto. An example configuration of each of the pixels will now be described in detail.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">The substrate <b>100</b> may be formed of glass or transparent plastic, but embodiments are not limited thereto.

The second sensing control line SCL<b>2</b> may be arranged between the second gate line GL<b>2</b> and a third gate line (not shown). The first sensing control line SCL<b>1</b> and the second sensing control line SCL<b>2</b> may be connected to the sensing TFT T<b>3</b> included in each pixel.</div>

The first data line DL<b>1</b> and the second data line DL<b>2</b> may be arranged adjacent to each other, and thus, another line may not be formed therebetween in the second direction. The third data line DL<b>3</b> and the fourth data line DL<b>4</b> may be arranged adjacent to each other, and thus, another line may not be formed therebetween in the second direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">The first data line DL<b>1</b>, the second data line DL<b>2</b>, the third data line DL<b>3</b>, and the fourth data line DL<b>4</b> may be connected to the switching TFT T<b>1</b> included in each pixel.</div>

The first high power line VDD<b>1</b> may be disposed adjacent to the pixel of the first column, and thus may be easily connected to the driving TFT T<b>2</b> included in the pixel of the first column. However, because the first high power line VDD<b>1</b> may not be disposed adjacent to the pixel of the second column, it may be difficult to connect the first high power line VDD<b>1</b> to the driving TFT T<b>2</b> included in the pixel of the second column, and for at least this reason, the first high power line VDD<b>1</b> may be connected to the driving TFT T<b>2</b> (included in the pixel of the second column) through a separate power connection line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">The second high power line VDD<b>2</b> may be connected to the driving TFT T<b>2</b> included in each of the pixel of the third column and the pixel of the fourth column. The second high power line VDD<b>2</b> may be disposed adjacent to the pixel of the fourth column, and thus may be easily connected to the driving TFT T<b>2</b> included in the pixel of the fourth column. However, because the second high power line VDD<b>2</b> may not be disposed adjacent to the pixel of the third column, it may be difficult to connect the second high power line VDD<b>2</b> to the driving TFT T<b>2</b> included in the pixel of the third column, and for at least this reason, the second high power line VDD<b>2</b> may be connected to the driving TFT T<b>2</b> (included in the pixel of the third column) through a separate power connection line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">The reference line Ref may be arranged in the second direction (for example, the height or vertical direction) on the substrate <b>100</b>. The reference line Ref may be arranged between the second data line DL<b>2</b> and the third data line DL<b>3</b>. The reference line Ref may be connected to the sensing TFT T<b>3</b> included in each of the pixels of the first to fourth columns. The reference line Ref may be disposed adjacent to the pixel of the second column and the pixel of the third column, and thus may be easily connected to the sensing TFT T<b>3</b> included in each of the pixel of the second column and the pixel of the third column. However, because the reference line Ref may not be disposed adjacent to the pixel of the first column and the pixel of the fourth pixel, it may be difficult to connect the reference line Ref to the sensing TFT T<b>3</b> included in the pixel of the first column and in the pixel of the fourth pixel. For at least this reason, the reference line Ref may be connected to the sensing TFT T<b>3</b> (included in the pixel of the first column and in the pixel of the fourth pixel) through a separate reference connection line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">The switching TFT T<b>1</b> may be turned on according to a gate signal supplied through the gate lines GL<b>1</b> to GL<b>2</b>, and may supply a data voltage (supplied from a corresponding data line among the data lines DL<b>1</b> to DL<b>4</b>) to the driving TFT T<b>2</b>. The driving TFT T<b>2</b> may be turned on with the data voltage supplied from the switching TFT T<b>1</b>, and may generate a data current from power supplied from the appropriate high power line VDD<b>1</b> or VDD<b>2</b> to supply the data current to the organic light emitting diode OLED.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">The sensing TFT T<b>3</b> may sense a threshold voltage deviation of the driving TFT T<b>2</b> which may cause a degradation in a quality of an image, and sensing of the threshold voltage deviation may be performed in a sensing mode. The sensing TFT T<b>3</b> may supply a current of the driving TFT T<b>2</b> to the reference line Ref in response to a sensing control signal supplied through the appropriate sensing control line SCL<b>1</b> or SCL<b>2</b>. The capacitor C may hold the data voltage supplied to the driving TFT T<b>2</b> during one frame, and may be connected to a gate electrode of the driving TFT T<b>2</b> at one end and to a node N that is also connected to a source electrode of the driving TFT T<b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">The organic light emitting diode OLED may emit light with the data current supplied from the driving TFT T<b>2</b>. The organic light emitting diode OLED may include a first electrode, an emission layer, and a second electrode. The first electrode may be connected to the source electrode of the driving TFT T<b>2</b>, and the second electrode may be connected to a low power line VSS. The first electrode may act as an anode, and the second electrode may act as a cathode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">The repair line <b>210</b> may extend from the organic light emitting diode OLED (included in the pixel of the second row) to the driving TFT T<b>2</b> included in the pixel of the first row. For example, one end of the repair line <b>210</b> may be connected to the first electrode of the organic light emitting diode OLED included in the pixel of the second row, and the other end of the repair line <b>210</b> may extend to the source electrode of the driving TFT T<b>2</b> included in the pixel of the first row. That is, the other end of the repair line <b>210</b> may overlap the source electrode of the driving TFT T<b>2</b>, and a passivation layer of an inorganic insulator may be formed between the other end of the repair line <b>210</b> and the source electrode of the driving TFT T<b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">Therefore, for example, when it is determined that the pixel of the first row is defective, the passivation layer between the other end of the repair line <b>210</b> and the source electrode of the driving TFT T<b>2</b> may be broken by a laser beam, and thus, the other end of the repair line <b>210</b> may be electronically connected to the source electrode of the driving TFT T<b>2</b>. Therefore, the first electrode of the organic light emitting diode OLED (included in the pixel of the second row) may be electrically connected to the source electrode of the driving TFT T<b>2</b> (included in the pixel of the first row) through repair line <b>210</b>. Thus, when the pixel of the second row is driven, the pixel of the first row may be driven along with the pixel of the second row. That is, when a current flows in the first electrode of the organic light emitting diode OLED included in the pixel of the second row, the current may also flow in the first electrode of the organic light emitting diode OLED connected to the source electrode of the driving TFT T<b>2</b> of the first row, and thus, the organic light emitting diode OLED included in the pixel of the second row and the organic light emitting diode OLED included in the pixel of the first row may be simultaneously driven. Accordingly, because the defective pixel of the first row may be driven simultaneously with the pixel of the second row, a dark spot error or a hot spot error may not occur in the pixel of the first row.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">However, embodiments are not limited to details illustrated in the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. For example, the one end of the repair line <b>210</b> may be connected to the first electrode of the organic light emitting diode OLED included in the pixel of the first row, and the other end of the repair line <b>210</b> may extend to on the source electrode of the driving TFT T<b>2</b> included in the pixel of the second row. Therefore, when the pixel of the second row is defective, the pixel of the second row may be driven simultaneously with the pixel of the first row.</div>
