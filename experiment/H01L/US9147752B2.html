<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a Continuation application of now allowed, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/251,637 filed on Oct. 3, 2011, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to semiconductor devices, and more particularly to devices with a gate structure with reduced gate resistance and methods for fabricating the same.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventional top-gated field effect transistors (FET) include a number of associated parasitics. With continuous gate-length scaling associated with denser device layouts, FET gate resistance increases. As a result, maximum oscillating frequency (f<sub>MAX</sub>) performance of complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) FETs has improved little beyond the 45 nm node. With conventional CMOS fabrication techniques, gate resistance can only be reduced by using multiple fingers, decreasing device width or employing a double-contacted gate structure. In such devices, additional metal layers (with lower resistance than poly-silicon) can make contact with a gate node only outside of the device area to reduce parasitic capacitances to make the device operable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Top-gated devices may include a mushroom gate structure having an upper portion that extends over adjacent active regions. The mushroom-like gate structure attempts to reduce gate resistance by adding material to the gate electrode, but may in some instances contribute to capacitance parasitics with surrounding metal structures.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">In accordance with the present principles, gate structures, devices and methods for fabrication are provided having reduced gate resistance without additional capacitive parasitics. Particularly useful embodiments include an embedded gate structure. The embedded gate structure includes a structure where a conductive channel layer is formed over the gate structure. The channel layers include graphene, carbon nanotubes, or any kind of semiconducting material, preferably a material that is transferable. In one embodiment, the gate structures are formed, followed by the conductive/semi-conductive channel layer, and then source and drain regions are formed on the channel layer. The gate structure includes additional material and may take the form of an inverted “T” shape, although other shapes like an “L” shape, etc. may be employed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">In one embodiment, the conductive channel layer includes an electrically conductive carbon material (which may be transferable over the gate structure) to be formed over the embedded gate structures. For the gate structures, in accordance with the present principles, capacitance between gate and the drain/source terminals is reduced with respect to conventional top-gate configurations. The use of different dielectrics and dielectric thicknesses for the embedded gate and the device itself permits further reduction in capacitance and optimizes a balance between resistance reduction and parasitic capacitance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">It is to be understood that the present invention will be described in terms of a given illustrative architecture employing a semiconductor wafer substrate; however, other architectures, structures, substrate materials and process features and steps may be varied within the scope of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">It will also be understood that when an element such as a layer, region or substrate is referred to as being “on” or “over” another element, it can be directly on the other element or intervening elements may also be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being “directly on” or “directly over” another element, there are no intervening elements present. It will also be understood that when an element is referred to as being “connected” or “coupled” to another element, it can be directly connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being “directly connected” or “directly coupled” to another element, there are no intervening elements present.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">The present embodiments may include a design for an integrated circuit chip, which may be created in a graphical computer programming language, and stored in a computer storage medium (such as a disk, tape, physical hard drive, or virtual hard drive such as in a storage access network). If the designer does not fabricate chips or the photolithographic masks used to fabricate chips, the designer may transmit the resulting design by physical means (e.g., by providing a copy of the storage medium storing the design) or electronically (e.g., through the Internet) to such entities, directly or indirectly. The stored design is then converted into the appropriate format (e.g., GDSII) for the fabrication of photolithographic masks, which typically include multiple copies of the chip design in question that are to be formed on a wafer. The photolithographic masks are utilized to define areas of the wafer (and/or the layers thereon) to be etched or otherwise processed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">Methods as described herein may be used in the fabrication of integrated circuit chips. The resulting integrated circuit chips can be distributed by the fabricator in raw wafer form (that is, as a single wafer that has multiple unpackaged chips), as a bare die, or in a packaged form. In the latter case, the chip is mounted in a single chip package (such as a plastic carrier, with leads that are affixed to a motherboard or other higher level carrier) or in a multichip package (such as a ceramic carrier that has either or both surface interconnections or buried interconnections). In any case, the chip is then integrated with other chips, discrete circuit elements, and/or other signal processing devices as part of either (a) an intermediate product, such as a motherboard, or (b) an end product. The end product can be any product that includes integrated circuit chips, ranging from toys and other low-end applications to advanced computer products having a display, a keyboard or other input device, and a central processor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring now to the drawings in which like numerals represent the same or similar elements and initially to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a device structure <b>8</b> includes a substrate <b>10</b> and a dielectric layer <b>12</b> formed on the substrate <b>10</b> in accordance with one illustrative embodiment. The substrate <b>10</b> may include a semiconductor substrate, e.g., silicon, GaAs, silicon on insulator or may include lower level metal layers in interlevel dielectric materials. The substrate <b>10</b> may include an electrically semiconducting material, an insulating material, a conductive material, devices or structures made of these materials or any combination thereof (e.g., a lower level of an interconnect structure). When the substrate <b>10</b> is comprised of a semiconducting material, any semiconductor such as Si, SiGe, SiGeC, SiC, Ge alloys, GaAs, InAs, InP and other III/V or II/VI compound semiconductors, or organic semiconductors may be employed. In addition to these listed types of semiconducting materials, substrate <b>10</b> may also be a layered semiconductor, such as, for example, Si/SiGe, Si/SiC, silicon-on-insulators (SOIs) or silicon germanium-on-insulators (SGOIs). These semiconductor materials may form a device, devices or structures, which may be discrete or interconnected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">When the substrate <b>10</b> includes a semiconducting material, one or more semiconductor devices such as, for example, complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) devices or other field effect transistors (FETs), strained silicon devices, carbon-based (carbon nanotubes and/or graphene) devices, phase-change memory devices, magnetic memory devices, magnetic spin switching devices, single electron transistors, quantum devices, molecule-based switches and other switching or memory devices that can be part of an integrated circuit, can be fabricated thereon. When the substrate <b>10</b> is an electrical insulating material, the insulating material can be an organic insulator, an inorganic insulator or a combination thereof including multilayers. When the substrate <b>10</b> is an electrically conducting material, the substrate may include, for example, polysilicon, an elemental metal, an alloy including at least one elemental metal, a metal silicide, a metal nitride, etc. or combinations thereof including multilayers. These devices and device structures may be for computation, transmission, storage or display of information, such as logic devices, memory devices, switches or display devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">The dielectric layer <b>12</b> may be formed on the surface of substrate <b>10</b> utilizing a conventional deposition process such as, for example, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD), chemical solution deposition (such as spin coating), or evaporation. The dielectric layer <b>12</b> may include any suitable dielectric material such as, for example, SiC, SiN, SiO<sub>2</sub>, a carbon doped oxide, a nitrogen and hydrogen doped silicon carbide SiC(N,H) or multilayers thereof. Dielectric layer <b>12</b> may be a continuous layer or a discontinuous layer. Dielectric layer <b>12</b> may have its material and thickness selected to provide reduced capacitance parasitics with nearby conductive structures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the dielectric layer <b>12</b> is subjected to a lithography process to form an etch mask (not shown). The etch mask is employed to etch the dielectric layer <b>12</b> to form a trench <b>14</b> therein. The trench <b>14</b> is preferably formed by employing a reactive ion etch (RIE) or similar process. Depending on the underlying layers (substrate <b>10</b>), a sufficient amount of dielectric material should remain in dielectric layer <b>12</b> below the trench <b>14</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a deposition of a conductive material <b>16</b> is performed. Conductive material <b>16</b> may include copper, aluminum, tungsten, titanium, doped polysilicon or any other useful conductive material or alloys/combinations thereof. The conductive material <b>16</b> may be deposited using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or other deposition techniques. The deposition may be followed by a chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP) process to remove excess conductive material and to confine the conductive material <b>16</b> to the trench <b>14</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, another dielectric layer <b>18</b> is deposited over the conductive material <b>16</b> in the trench <b>14</b> and over the dielectric layer <b>12</b> outside the trench <b>14</b>. The dielectric layer <b>18</b> may be formed utilizing a conventional deposition process such as, for example, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD), chemical solution deposition (such as spin coating), or evaporation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">The dielectric layer <b>18</b> may include any suitable dielectric material such as, for example, SiC, SiN, SiO<sub>2</sub>, a carbon doped oxide, a nitrogen and hydrogen doped silicon carbide SiC(N,H) or multilayers thereof. The dielectric layer <b>18</b> need not be the same material as dielectric layer <b>12</b>, but may be the same. The use of different dielectric materials and dielectric thicknesses for the dielectric layer <b>12</b> and the dielectric layer <b>18</b> permits further reduction in capacitance and optimizes a balance between resistance reduction in a gate structure and parasitic capacitance with conductive or semiconductive structures and the gate structure. Dielectric layer <b>18</b> may be a continuous layer or a discontinuous layer. The thicknesses for layers <b>12</b> and <b>18</b> may be, e.g., from several hundred nanometers to several micrometers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the dielectric layer <b>18</b> is subjected to another lithography process to form an etch mask (not shown). The etch mask is employed to etch the dielectric layer <b>18</b> to form a trench <b>20</b> therein. The trench <b>20</b> is preferably formed by employing a reactive ion etch (RIE) or similar process. The dielectric material should be removed down to the conductive material <b>16</b>. It should be understood that the conductive material <b>16</b> may be large enough to form a plurality of trenches over a single section of conductive material <b>16</b>. This enables the formation of a plurality of conductive fingers as illustratively depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a deposition of a conductive material <b>22</b> is performed. Conductive material <b>22</b> may include copper, aluminum, tungsten, titanium, doped polysilicon or any other useful conductive material or alloys/combinations thereof. The conductive material <b>22</b> may be deposited using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or other deposition techniques. The deposition may be followed by a chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP) process to remove excess conductive material and to confine the conductive material <b>22</b> to the trench <b>20</b>. Conductive material <b>22</b> need not be the same material as conductive material <b>16</b>, but preferably is the same material to prevent the formation of an interface between conductive layers <b>16</b> and <b>22</b>. Preferably, there should be little or no electrical resistance between conductive materials <b>16</b> and <b>20</b>. The thicknesses of layers <b>16</b> and <b>20</b> can be from, e.g., about 50 nm to several hundred nanometers for 45 nm node technology. It should be understood that larger or smaller technologies are contemplated in accordance with the present principles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">Conductive materials <b>16</b> and <b>20</b> formed an inverted “T” shape that will be employed as an embedded gate structure <b>24</b>. It should be understood that other shapes may be employed for structure <b>24</b>. For example, structure <b>24</b> may include other configurations, such as an “L” shape, a rectangular shape, a U or inverted U-shape, etc. The conductive material <b>16</b> may have a gap between portions thereof that is connected or bridged by conductive material <b>22</b>, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">It should be understood that the conductive material <b>16</b> preferably extends laterally beyond the boundaries of the conductive material <b>22</b> in at least one direction. In accordance with one aspect of the present principles, a single-sheet bottom-gate structure (e.g., conductive material <b>16</b> being a sheet) offers the minimum resistance possible for a given device size. A single-sheet gate structure (<b>16</b>) in a top-gated device would lead to significantly higher gate to drain and gate to source capacitances.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a gate dielectric layer <b>26</b> is deposited over the gate structure <b>24</b>. The gate dielectric layer <b>26</b> may include a high-k dielectric material. High-k dielectric materials may include hafnium silicate, zirconium silicate, hafnium dioxide, zirconium dioxide, etc. The gate dielectric layer <b>26</b> may be deposited using atomic layer deposition or other suitable process. The gate dielectric layer <b>26</b> may have a thickness of about 1 nm to about 50 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a channel layer <b>28</b> is provided on the gate dielectric layer <b>26</b>. While the channel layer <b>28</b> may include any suitable semiconductor material, in a particularly useful embodiment, a graphene material is employed. Graphene material may include a chemical vapor deposited (CVD) layer, an epitaxially grown layer, a solution based deposited layer (dipping), a mechanically exfoliated layer (transferred layer), etc. The process by which graphene is formed on the gate dielectric layer <b>26</b> may vary with the material of the layer <b>26</b>, expense and/or other factors. For example, a mechanically exfoliated or CVD grown graphene can be deposited on an oxide based layer <b>26</b>. The graphene material may be roughly formed in terms of coverage on the gate dielectric layer <b>26</b> and shaped later. For example, the graphene material may be transferred to the gate dielectric layer <b>26</b> and lithographically patterned to form the channel layer <b>28</b>. The graphene material <b>28</b> may be formed with between about 1 to about 10 graphene layers. Although additional layers may be useful, a single layer of graphene is preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">Channel layer <b>28</b> may include other materials as well. For example, carbon nanotubes may be employed. Carbon nanotubes and graphene are strong candidates for channel materials, especially for high speed electronic devices. Gate resistance may become one of the main radio frequency (RF) performance limiting factors in such devices. A change of only, e.g., 2 Ohms in gate resistance can degrade maximum oscillating frequency, f<sub>MAX</sub>, by ˜30% or more depending on capacitive parasitics. A conventional top-gated graphene FET that employs an enlarged gate to reduce gate resistance would ultimately be limited by capacitive parasitics due to the proximity of the gate structure to upper level metal structure and adjacent source and drain regions (especially for self-aligned devices).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, top electrodes <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> are formed, respectively for a source (S) and a drain (D) of device <b>50</b>. Electrodes <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> are preferably formed of a highly conductive material. Electrodes <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> may include, e.g., copper, aluminum, tungsten, titanium, doped polysilicon or any other useful conductive material or alloys/combinations thereof. Electrodes <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> may also include highly doped semiconductor materials. Electrodes <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> may be deposited using a CVD or other deposition process followed by a lithography and etch process or a lift-off process to remove the electrode materials from the channel layer <b>28</b>. The electrodes <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> may be formed completely on the channel layer <b>28</b> or a portion of channel layer <b>28</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">In accordance with the present principles, gate resistance is reduced by the large gate structure <b>24</b> (e.g., inverted T-shape). Capacitive parasitics are reduced between the gate structure <b>24</b> and the source (S) and drain (D), and between the gate structure <b>24</b> and any conductive contacts, interlevel metallization, or another other conductive materials. The gate structure <b>24</b> is buried in or below dielectric layers <b>12</b> and <b>18</b> and is located a fair distance from other conductive structures. This reduces the capacitive parasitics considerably especially in small (nm-sized) designs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a device <b>55</b> is illustratively shown in accordance with another embodiment. As described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, trench <b>20</b> may have included a plurality of trenches or other patterns. When conductive material <b>22</b> is deposited, material <b>22</b> is deposited in all trenches <b>20</b> to form multiple fingers <b>42</b>. A gate sheet <b>40</b> is formed to be wide enough to provide contact with corresponding fingers <b>42</b>. Gate sheet <b>40</b> and fingers <b>42</b> form a gate structure <b>46</b> for device <b>55</b>. The dielectric layer <b>26</b> is formed over fingers <b>42</b>. Each finger <b>42</b> corresponds to a portion of the channel layer <b>28</b>. In this embodiment, electrodes <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> include two source (S) electrodes and two drain (D) electrodes. Other configurations are also possible and contemplated in accordance with the present principles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">Devices <b>50</b> and <b>55</b> are then further processed to form contacts and upper metal layers using known methods. The channel layer <b>28</b> will have a dielectric material (not shown) formed thereon. This material may be the same material employed for interlevel dielectric layers.</div>

It should also be noted that, in some alternative implementations, the functions noted in the blocks may occur out of the order noted in the figures. For example, two blocks shown in succession may, in fact, be executed substantially concurrently, or the blocks may sometimes be executed in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality involved.</div>

In an alternate embodiment, a trench need not be formed. Instead, a conductive material/sheet can be patterned on the first dielectric material. In block <b>108</b>, a second dielectric material is deposited on the first dielectric material and the conductive sheet. The second dielectric material covers the conductive material/sheet.

The conductive sheet extends beyond at least one or the conductive fingers in a lateral direction. In block <b>114</b>, a gate dielectric layer is deposited on the one or more conductive fingers.
