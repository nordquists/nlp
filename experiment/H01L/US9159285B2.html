<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from and the benefit under 35 U.S.C. §119(d) of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2013-0148487, filed Dec. 2, 2013, which is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a display device having a transistor structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">At least one transistor for image displaying is disposed at each pixel of a display panel for a display device such as a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD), an Organic Light Emitting Display (OLED), etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Because such a transistor within each pixel of the display panel is manufactured through various processes, the transistor does not normally operate due to minute foreign substances generated during the processes, so that a problem may occur in which the corresponding pixel is lightened or blackened.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">The lightened or blackened defective pixel degrades fabrication yield and increases manufacturing costs of the display panel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, in the related art, a repair process is performed in which the defective pixel lightened due to the impure materials generated during the processes is blackened and does not operate as a normal pixel so as not to be visually recognized well.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">However, when the number of the blackened pixels increases due to the related repair process, the display panel may not be used so that the display panel is discarded. Further, a particularly effective repair process cannot be currently performed with respect to the blackened defective pixel.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">In such a background, an aspect of the present invention is to provide a display device with a repair structure which makes a defective pixel operate as a normal pixel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">Further, another aspect of the present invention is to provide a display device in which a luminance of the defective pixel is compensated after a repair process which makes the defective pixel operate as a normal pixel.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">The welding pattern may be formed at the drain node or the source node of the second transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">In one approach, at least the drain node and the source node of the first transistor is cut, and a connection pattern is formed on the welding pattern to enable the second transistor to conduct current.</div>

In designating elements of the drawings by reference numerals, the same elements will be designated by the same reference numerals although they are shown in different drawings. Further, in the following description of the present invention, a detailed description of known functions and configurations incorporated herein will be omitted when it may make the subject matter of the present invention rather unclear.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">In addition, terms, such as first, second, A, B, (a), (b) or the like may be used herein when describing components of the present invention. These terms are merely used to distinguish one element from another element, and do not limit a true nature, a sequence, an order, the number, etc. of the corresponding element. In the case that it is written that one component “is connected to”, “is coupled with”, or “is in contact with” another component, it should be interpreted that a third component may “be interposed” between the one component and the another component or the one component may “be connected to”, “be coupled with”, or “be in contact with” the another component through the third component although the one component may be directly connected to or be in direct contact with the another component.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically illustrates a system of a display device <b>100</b> to which embodiments are applied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the display device <b>100</b> to which embodiments are applied includes a display panel <b>110</b> in which a plurality of data lines DL<b>1</b> to DLm and a plurality of gate lines GL<b>1</b> to GLn are formed so as to define a plurality of pixels, a data driving unit <b>120</b> for supplying a data voltage to the plurality of data lines DL<b>1</b> to DLm, a gate driving unit <b>130</b> for supplying a scan signal to the plurality of gate lines GL<b>1</b> to GLn, a timing controller <b>140</b> for controlling driving timing of the data driving unit <b>120</b> and the gate driving unit <b>130</b>, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">Although such a display device <b>100</b> may correspond to an LCD, an OLED, etc., each pixel of the display device <b>100</b> may necessarily include one or more transistor, regardless of a type of the display device <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">In the present embodiments, each pixel includes a first transistor T<b>1</b>, and further includes a second transistor T<b>2</b> disposed with the first transistor T<b>1</b> in a “series structure” or in a “parallel structure”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">In the present embodiments, that the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b> are disposed in the “series structure” or in the “parallel structure” implies that the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b> are connected to each other in series or in parallel on a circuit, or, in some cases, that although the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b> are not fully connected to each other in series or in parallel on a circuit, the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b> are disposed to be partially connected to each other while a part of the circuit is disconnected or opened.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">In the present embodiments, when both of the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b> within each pixel are in a normal state, both of the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b> operate or one of the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b> operates. Further, when a problem occurs in one of the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b> so that the corresponding pixel becomes a defective pixel, the other one of the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b> operates so that the corresponding pixel is repaired from the lightened or blackened defective pixel to a normal pixel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">In more detail, in a case where the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b> are disposed in the series structure, when both of the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b> operate as a switching element and a problem then occurs in the first transistor T<b>1</b>, only the second transistor T<b>2</b> operates as a switching element so that the corresponding pixel is repaired from the defective pixel to a normal pixel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">Further, in a case where the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b> are disposed in the parallel structure, when a total current supplied to the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b> is conducted only to the first transistor T<b>1</b> and a problem then occurs in the first transistor T<b>1</b>, the total current is conducted only to the second transistor T<b>2</b> so that the corresponding pixel is repaired from the defective pixel to a normal pixel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">Thus, it can be seen that one of the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b> is substituted for both or the other one of the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b>. In particular, when the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b> are disposed in the parallel structure, the second transistor T<b>2</b> corresponds to a redundancy transistor of the first transistor T<b>1</b>, which completely performs a function performed by the first transistor T<b>1</b> before the problem occurs, instead of the first transistor T<b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">Hereinafter, referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a repair transistor structure will be described by which a defective pixel is repaired to a normal pixel when a problem (situation where a circuit does not operate or malfunctions according to short or circuit-disconnection caused by impure materials generated during the manufacturing processes, etc.) occurs in one of the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b> causing the corresponding pixel to be defective (e.g., lightened or blackened).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">The “repair transistor structure” in the present embodiments implies a “transistor structure” by which a defective pixel can be repaired to a normal pixel.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, part (A), in the repair transistor structure according to an embodiment, a gate node G<b>1</b> of the first transistor T<b>1</b> and a gate node G<b>2</b> of the second transistor T<b>2</b> are integrally connected to each other, and a source node S<b>1</b> of the first transistor T<b>1</b> and a drain node D<b>2</b> of the second transistor T<b>2</b> are connected to each other, so that the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b> are disposed in a series structure. Herein, the source nodes and the drain nodes of the transistors T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> may be reversely configured according to types (N-type or P-type) of transistors or characteristics of the circuit.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, part (A), the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b> which are connected to each other in series may be represented as an equivalent transistor T. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, part (A), a G node, a D node and an S node correspond to a gate node, a drain node and a source node of the equivalent transistor T, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, part (B) illustrates a repair transistor structure according to another embodiment, which corresponds to a transistor structure in which the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b> are disposed in a parallel structure.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">Meanwhile, a drain node D (herein also referred to as a “supply node D”) is connected to a drain node D<b>1</b> of the first transistor T<b>1</b>, and is connected to a drain node D<b>2</b> of the second transistor T<b>2</b> through a small capacitor C. A point where such a capacitor C is formed refers to a Welding Point (WP).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">Herein, the source nodes and the drain nodes of the transistors T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> may be reversely configured according to types (N-type or P-type) of transistors or characteristics of the circuit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, part (B), even when a gate signal is simultaneously applied to the gate node G<b>1</b> of the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the gate node G<b>2</b> of the second transistor T<b>2</b>, only the first transistor T<b>1</b> operates as a normal switching element for conducting a current Ib from the supply node D to the source node S (herein also referred to as an “output node S”) of the equivalent transistor T, due to the capacitor C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">Thus, the transistors T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> may be represented as the first transistor T<b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">Meanwhile, as long as only the first transistor T<b>1</b> operates as a normal switching element for conducting the current Ib from the supply node D to the output node S, locations and the number of the small capacitors C may be determined in any manner that prevents the second transistor T<b>2</b> from conducting current. For example, the small capacitor C may be formed between the drain node D<b>2</b> of the second transistor T<b>2</b> and the supply node D of the equivalent transistor T, between the source node S<b>2</b> of the second transistor T<b>2</b> and the output node S of the equivalent transistor T, or at both places.</div>

The initial step of the sensing operation for compensating for the luminance decrease of the repaired pixel corresponds to a step of initializing a voltage of each node.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0202" num="0201">In such an initial step, in order to read a sampling voltage Vsam in the ADC, the sampling switch SAM for enabling or disabling connection between the ADC and the sensing node Ns is turned off.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0205" num="0204">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> corresponding to the operation circuit diagram of the program step, the program step corresponds to a step of charging a storage capacitor Cstg connected between a gate node and a source node of a driving transistor DT.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0206" num="0205">In the program step, in order to charge the storage capacitor Cstg, when the data voltage Vdata is applied, the scan signal SCAN having a low level is changed to have a high level so as to turn on the switching transistor SWT, so that a constant-voltage Vdata is applied to the gate node of the driving transistor DT.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0207" num="0206">At this time, since a signal level of the sensing signal SENSE is changed to a high level and the sensing transistor SENT is then turned on in a state in which the switch SPRE is turned on, a constant voltage Vpre (also, referred to as a reference voltage Vref) is applied to the source node of the driving transistor DT.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0209" num="0208">While the storage capacitor Cstg is charged, because the constant voltage Vpre or the basis voltage EVSS is regulated such that a potential difference (|Vpre−EVSS|) between the constant voltage Vpre applied to the source node of the driving transistor DT and the basis voltage EVSS is not higher than a threshold voltage of the organic light emitting diode. Therefore, a current does not flow to the organic light emitting diode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0210" num="0209">After the storage capacitor Cstg is charged, the scan signal SCAN having a high level is changed to have a low level so that the switching transistor SWT is turned off, and the sensing signal SENSE having a high level is changed to have a low level so that the sensing transistor SENT is turned off. Thereafter, at an end of the program step, the switch SPRE is turned off so that the constant voltage Vpre is not applied to the source node of the driving transistor DT.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0211" num="0210">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> illustrated is the operation circuit diagram of the standby step. The standby step corresponds to a step of changing a voltage of the sensing node Ns for luminance sensing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0212" num="0211">At a starting point of the standby step, a constant potential difference (Vdata−Vpre) is formed between the gate node and the source node of the driving transistor DT, so that the driving transistor Dt is turned on, and all of the switching transistor SWT, the sensing transistor SENT, the switch SPRE and the sampling switch SAM are turned off. Further, at a starting point of the standby step, a current does not flow to the organic light emitting diode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0213" num="0212">After the standby step starts, the sensing signal SENSE is changed to have a high level so that the sensing transistor SENT is turned on during the standby step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0214" num="0213">Accordingly, current flows from the supply port of the driving voltage EVDD, via the driving transistor DT and the sensing transistor SENT being turned on, to a sensing capacitor Csense of which one side is grounded, so that the sensing capacitor Csense is charged and the sampling voltage Vsam of the sensing node Ns is continuously boosted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0215" num="0214">In this way, when the sampling voltage Vsam of the sensing node Ns is boosted, a source voltage of the driving transistor DT is boosted together.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0216" num="0215">In order to sense the sampling voltage of the sensing node Ns, a signal level of the sensing signal SENSE is changed to have a low level, so that the sensing transistor SENT is turned off.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0218" num="0217">Thereafter, the compensation unit <b>1720</b> can perform a luminance decrease compensation process by calculating a luminance of each pixel based on the sampling voltage Vsam sensed by each pixel and by supplying, to the repaired pixel, a data voltage (compensation data voltage) obtained by adding a voltage value corresponding to the luminance difference to a data voltage to be supplied to the repaired pixel, in order to compensate for a luminance difference between the repaired pixel and the not-repaired pixel.</div>
