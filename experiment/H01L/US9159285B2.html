<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from and the benefit under 35 U.S.C. ยง119(d) of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2013-0148487, filed Dec. 2, 2013, which is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a display device having a transistor structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">At least one transistor for image displaying is disposed at each pixel of a display panel for a display device such as a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD), an Organic Light Emitting Display (OLED), etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Because such a transistor within each pixel of the display panel is manufactured through various processes, the transistor does not normally operate due to minute foreign substances generated during the processes, so that a problem may occur in which the corresponding pixel is lightened or blackened.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">The lightened or blackened defective pixel degrades fabrication yield and increases manufacturing costs of the display panel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, in the related art, a repair process is performed in which the defective pixel lightened due to the impure materials generated during the processes is blackened and does not operate as a normal pixel so as not to be visually recognized well.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">However, when the number of the blackened pixels increases due to the related repair process, the display panel may not be used so that the display panel is discarded. Further, a particularly effective repair process cannot be currently performed with respect to the blackened defective pixel.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">The welding pattern may be formed at the drain node or the source node of the second transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">In one approach, at least the drain node and the source node of the first transistor is cut, and a connection pattern is formed on the welding pattern to enable the second transistor to conduct current.</div>

In designating elements of the drawings by reference numerals, the same elements will be designated by the same reference numerals although they are shown in different drawings. Further, in the following description of the present invention, a detailed description of known functions and configurations incorporated herein will be omitted when it may make the subject matter of the present invention rather unclear.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">In addition, terms, such as first, second, A, B, (a), (b) or the like may be used herein when describing components of the present invention. These terms are merely used to distinguish one element from another element, and do not limit a true nature, a sequence, an order, the number, etc. of the corresponding element. In the case that it is written that one component โis connected toโ, โis coupled withโ, or โis in contact withโ another component, it should be interpreted that a third component may โbe interposedโ between the one component and the another component or the one component may โbe connected toโ, โbe coupled withโ, or โbe in contact withโ the another component through the third component although the one component may be directly connected to or be in direct contact with the another component.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically illustrates a system of a display device <b>100</b> to which embodiments are applied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the display device <b>100</b> to which embodiments are applied includes a display panel <b>110</b> in which a plurality of data lines DL<b>1</b> to DLm and a plurality of gate lines GL<b>1</b> to GLn are formed so as to define a plurality of pixels, a data driving unit <b>120</b> for supplying a data voltage to the plurality of data lines DL<b>1</b> to DLm, a gate driving unit <b>130</b> for supplying a scan signal to the plurality of gate lines GL<b>1</b> to GLn, a timing controller <b>140</b> for controlling driving timing of the data driving unit <b>120</b> and the gate driving unit <b>130</b>, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">Although such a display device <b>100</b> may correspond to an LCD, an OLED, etc., each pixel of the display device <b>100</b> may necessarily include one or more transistor, regardless of a type of the display device <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">In the present embodiments, each pixel includes a first transistor T<b>1</b>, and further includes a second transistor T<b>2</b> disposed with the first transistor T<b>1</b> in a โseries structureโ or in a โparallel structureโ.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">In the present embodiments, that the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b> are disposed in the โseries structureโ or in the โparallel structureโ implies that the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b> are connected to each other in series or in parallel on a circuit, or, in some cases, that although the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b> are not fully connected to each other in series or in parallel on a circuit, the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b> are disposed to be partially connected to each other while a part of the circuit is disconnected or opened.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">In the present embodiments, when both of the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b> within each pixel are in a normal state, both of the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b> operate or one of the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b> operates. Further, when a problem occurs in one of the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b> so that the corresponding pixel becomes a defective pixel, the other one of the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b> operates so that the corresponding pixel is repaired from the lightened or blackened defective pixel to a normal pixel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">In more detail, in a case where the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b> are disposed in the series structure, when both of the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b> operate as a switching element and a problem then occurs in the first transistor T<b>1</b>, only the second transistor T<b>2</b> operates as a switching element so that the corresponding pixel is repaired from the defective pixel to a normal pixel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">Further, in a case where the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b> are disposed in the parallel structure, when a total current supplied to the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b> is conducted only to the first transistor T<b>1</b> and a problem then occurs in the first transistor T<b>1</b>, the total current is conducted only to the second transistor T<b>2</b> so that the corresponding pixel is repaired from the defective pixel to a normal pixel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">Thus, it can be seen that one of the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b> is substituted for both or the other one of the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b>. In particular, when the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b> are disposed in the parallel structure, the second transistor T<b>2</b> corresponds to a redundancy transistor of the first transistor T<b>1</b>, which completely performs a function performed by the first transistor T<b>1</b> before the problem occurs, instead of the first transistor T<b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">Hereinafter, referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a repair transistor structure will be described by which a defective pixel is repaired to a normal pixel when a problem (situation where a circuit does not operate or malfunctions according to short or circuit-disconnection caused by impure materials generated during the manufacturing processes, etc.) occurs in one of the first transistor T<b>1</b> and the second transistor T<b>2</b> causing the corresponding pixel to be defective (e.g., lightened or blackened).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">The โrepair transistor structureโ in the present embodiments implies a โtransistor structureโ by which a defective pixel can be repaired to a normal pixel.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">Meanwhile, a drain node D (herein also referred to as a โsupply node Dโ) is connected to a drain node D<b>1</b> of the first transistor T<b>1</b>, and is connected to a drain node D<b>2</b> of the second transistor T<b>2</b> through a small capacitor C. A point where such a capacitor C is formed refers to a Welding Point (WP).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">Herein, the source nodes and the drain nodes of the transistors T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> may be reversely configured according to types (N-type or P-type) of transistors or characteristics of the circuit.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">Thus, the transistors T<b>1</b> and T<b>2</b> may be represented as the first transistor T<b>1</b>.</div>

For example, the small capacitor C may be formed between the drain node D<b>2</b> of the second transistor T<b>2</b> and the supply node D of the equivalent transistor T, between the source node S<b>2</b> of the second transistor T<b>2</b> and the output node S of the equivalent transistor T, or at both places.</div>
