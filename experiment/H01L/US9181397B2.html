<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a curable resin composition and a cured product thereof.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Materials having heat resistance of 150° C. or higher are demanded so as to cover (coat) semiconductor elements in semiconductor devices of high heat resistance and high breakdown voltage. Among them, materials (encapsulants) for covering optical materials such as optical semiconductor elements require excelling not only in heat resistance, but also in other properties such as transparency and flexibility. Phenylsilicones are now mainly used as encapsulants typically in backlight units of liquid crystal displays.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Patent Literature (PTL) 1 discloses a resin composition for optical element encapsulation, where the resin composition excels in transparency, ultraviolet resistance, and thermal coloration resistance. The resin composition for optical element encapsulation contains, as a resin component, at least one silsesquioxane selected from the group consisting of a liquid cage-structure silsesquioxane containing an aliphatic carbon-carbon unsaturated bond and containing no H—Si bond; and a liquid cage-structure silsesquioxane containing an H—Si bond and containing no aliphatic carbon-carbon unsaturated bond. The resin composition containing such a cage silsesquioxane, however, gives a cured product that is relatively hard, has poor flexibility, and is disadvantageously susceptible to cracking and fracture.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">PTL 2 discloses a curable composition that contains a triallyl isocyanurate or another organic compound containing at least two carbon-carbon double bonds per molecule, where the carbon-carbon double bonds are reactive with SiH group; a chain and/or cyclic polyorganosiloxane or another compound containing at least two SiH groups per molecule; and a hydrosilylation catalyst as essential components. These materials, however, are still insufficient in properties such as cracking resistance.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">Technical Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">An encapsulant for an optical semiconductor element generally requires not only the heat resistance, transparency, and flexibility, but also such properties as to resist degradation even when heat at a high temperature is applied in a reflow process in optical semiconductor device production. Specifically, the properties upon the reflow process are such that the encapsulant is resistant to cracking and does not cause disadvantages such as separation from a package. The properties are hereinafter also generically referred to as “reflow resistance”. In addition, the property of the encapsulant as to be resistant to cracking is herein also referred to as “cracking resistance”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">The encapsulant for an optical semiconductor element also requires high barrier properties to a corrosive gas such as a SOx gas. This is because metal materials typically for electrodes in an optical semiconductor device are readily corroded by the corrosive gas; and the corrosion disadvantageously degrades electrical properties (e.g., electrical properties in a high-temperature environment) of the semiconductor device with time. The phenylsilicone encapsulants now widely used as encapsulants for optical semiconductor elements disadvantageously have insufficient barrier properties to the corrosive gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a curable resin composition capable of forming a cured product which has excellent heat resistance, transparency, and flexibility and which excels particularly in reflow resistance (e.g., cracking resistance in a reflow process and adhesion to a package) and barrier properties to a corrosive gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Another object of the present invention is to provide a cured product which has excellent heat resistance, transparency, and flexibility and which excels particularly in reflow resistance and barrier properties to a corrosive gas.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0160">The curable resin composition according to the embodiment of the present invention may contain the ladder-type silsesquioxane(s) (B) in a content (blending quantity) not critical, but preferably from 10 to 90 percent by weight, more preferably from 1.5 to 75 percent by weight, and furthermore preferably from 20 to 60 percent by weight, based on the total amount (100 percent by weight) of the curable resin composition. The curable resin composition, if containing the ladder-type silsesquioxane(s) (B) in a content of less than 10 percent by weight, may cause the cured product to have insufficient hardness. This is because the cured product is insufficiently cured due to a low SiH content. In contrast, the curable resin composition, if containing the ladder-type silsesquioxane(s) (B) in a content of greater than 90 percent by weight, may cause the cured product to be not sufficiently cured due to a low content of carbon-carbon double bond.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0161">Other Ladder-Type Silsesquioxane</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0162">The curable resin composition according to the embodiment of the present invention may employ, as a ladder-type polyorganosilsesquioxane, another ladder-type silsesquioxane (hereinafter also referred to as an “other ladder-type silsesquioxane”) than the ladder-type silsesquioxanes (A) and the ladder-type silsesquioxanes (B). The other ladder-type silsesquioxane is particularly preferably used in combination with the ladder-type silsesquioxane(s) (A) and/or the ladder-type silsesquioxane(s) (B). Of the other ladder-type silsesquioxanes, particularly preferred are a ladder-type silsesquioxane (S1) and a ladder-type silsesquioxane (S2). The “ladder-type silsesquioxane (S1)” refers to a ladder-type silsesquioxane that is solid at 25° C. and has an aliphatic carbon-carbon double bond. The “ladder-type silsesquioxane (S2)” refers to a ladder-type silsesquioxane that is solid at 25° C. and has a hydrosilyl group. The curable resin composition according to the embodiment of the present invention, when including the ladder-type silsesquioxane (S1) and/or (S2), may particularly readily give a cured product by curing, where the cured product has better barrier properties to a corrosive gas and better toughness (particularly, better cracking resistance).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0163">The ladder-type silsesquioxane (S1) may have the aliphatic carbon-carbon double bond in a number not critical, but preferably 2 or more (e.g., from 2 to 50) and more preferably from 2 to 30 per molecule (in one molecule). The ladder-type silsesquioxane (S1) may have the aliphatic carbon-carbon double bond(s) at any position not limited, such as in a side chain and/or at a terminal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0164">The ladder-type silsesquioxane (S2) may have the hydrosilyl group in a number not critical, but preferably 2 or more (e.g., from 2 to 50) and more preferably from 2 to 30 per molecule (in one molecule). The ladder-type silsesquioxane (S2) may have the hydrosilyl group(s) at any position not limited, such as in a side chain and/or at a terminal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0165">The ladder-type silsesquioxanes (S1) and (S2) may each have a weight-average molecular weight (Mw) not critical, but preferably from 2000 to 800000 and more preferably from 6000 to 100000. The ladder-type silsesquioxanes (Si) and (S2), if having a weight-average molecular weight of less than 2000, may cause the cured product to have insufficient barrier properties to a corrosive gas. In contrast, the ladder-type silsesquioxanes (S1) and (S2), if having a weight-average molecular weight of greater than 800000, may have insufficient compatibility with another component. The weight-average molecular weight can be determined typically by calculation from a molecular weight in terms of a polystyrene standard as measured by gel permeation chromatography.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0167" num="0166">The ladder-type silsesquioxanes (S1) and (S2) may each be produced by a known or common method for producing a ladder-type silsesquioxane. The method is exemplified by a sol-gel process using a trifunctional silane compound as a material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0167">The curable resin composition may contain the ladder-type silsesquioxane (S1) in a content not critical, but preferably from 0.1 to 80 percent by weight, more preferably from 1 to 50 percent by weight, and furthermore preferably from 1 to 40 percent by weight, based on the total amount (100 percent by weight) of the curable resin composition. The curable resin composition, if containing the ladder-type silsesquioxane (S1) in a content of less than 0.1 percent by weight, may fail to help the cured product to have better cracking resistance and/or better barrier properties to a corrosive gas. In contrast, the curable resin composition, if containing the ladder-type silsesquioxane (S1) in a content of greater than 80 percent by weight, may become nonuniform upon its preparation because of inferior compatibility of the ladder-type silsesquioxane (S1) with another component. The curable resin composition in this case may have an excessively high viscosity and may be handled uneasily. The content of the ladder-type silsesquioxane (S2) is also preferably controlled within the range.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0170" num="0169">The curable resin composition according to the embodiment of the present invention may further include a cyclic siloxane (C). As used herein the term “cyclic siloxane (C)” refers to a cyclic siloxane having two or more aliphatic carbon-carbon double bonds per molecule (in one molecule). The cyclic siloxane (C) may be any siloxane compound not limited, as long as having two or more aliphatic carbon-carbon double bonds per molecule and having a cyclic structure formed by a Si—O bond. The cyclic siloxane (C) is exemplified by a compound represented by Formula (6) and having a group including an aliphatic carbon-carbon double bond. It should be noted, however, that the cyclic siloxane (C) does not include ladder-type polyorganosilsesquioxanes (e.g., the ladder-type silsesquioxanes (A) and the ladder-type silsesquioxanes (B)). Formula (6) is expressed as follows:</div>

Each of different cyclic siloxanes (C) may be used alone or in combination. Among them, 1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-1,3,5,7-tetravinylcyclotetrasiloxane is particularly preferred as the cyclic siloxane (C).

Each of different cyclic siloxanes (D) may be used alone or in combination. Among them, 1,3,5,7-tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane is particularly preferred, because the compound may advantageously readily help the curable resin composition to have a lower initial viscosity and help the cured product to have better barrier properties to a corrosive gas.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0187" num="0186">The curable resin composition according to the embodiment of the present invention may further include a silane coupling agent. The curable resin composition according to the embodiment of the present invention, particularly when containing the silane coupling agent, may readily help the cured product to have better adhesion to an adherend. In addition, the silane coupling agent may particularly help the isocyanurate compound such as the monoallyl diglycidyl isocyanurate compound to have better compatibility with another component. This is because the silane coupling agent has good compatibility both with the isocyanurate compound (e.g., the monoallyl diglycidyl isocyanurate compound) and the ladder-type silsesquioxane (A). Specifically, when the monoallyl diglycidyl isocyanurate compound is used as the isocyanurate compound, it is preferred that the monoallyl diglycidyl isocyanurate compound is blended with the silane coupling agent to form a composition in advance before being blended with other components. This may readily give a homogeneous resin composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0188" num="0187">The silane coupling agent for use herein can be any of known or common silane coupling agents without limitations. The silane coupling agent is exemplified by epoxy-containing silane coupling agents such as 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, 2-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl)ethyltrimethoxysilane, 3-glycidoxypropylmethyldiethoxysilane, and 3-glycidoxypropyltriethoxysilane; amino-containing silane coupling agents such as N-2-(aminoethyl)-3-aminopropylmethyldimethoxysilane, N-2-(aminoethyl)-3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, N-2-(aminoethyl)-3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, 3-triethoxysilyl-N-(1,3-dimethyl-butylidene)propylamine, N-phenyl-3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, N-(vinylbenzyl)-2-aminoethyl-3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane hydrochloride, and N-(β-aminoethyl)-γ-aminopropylmethyldiethoxysilane; and other silane coupling agents such as tetramethoxysilane, tetraethoxysilane, methyltriethoxysilane, dimethyldiethoxysilane, methyltriethoxysilane, vinyltriethoxysilane, vinyltrimethoxysilane, vinyltris(methoxyethoxysilane), phenyltrimethoxysilane, diphenyldimethoxysilane, vinyltriacetoxysilane, γ-(meth)acryloxypropyltriethoxysilane, γ-(meth)acryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, γ-(meth)acryloxypropylmethyldimethoxysilane, γ-(meth)acryloxypropylmethyldiethoxysilane, mercaptopropylenetrimethoxysilane, and mercaptopropylenetriethoxysilane. Among them, epoxy-containing silane coupling agents are preferably usable, of which 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane is particularly preferred. Each of different silane coupling agents may be used alone or in combination.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0189" num="0188">The curable resin composition may contain the silane coupling agent in a content not critical, but preferably from 0.01 to 15 percent by weight, more preferably from 0.1 to 10 percent by weight, and furthermore preferably from 0.5 to 5 percent by weight, based on the total amount (100 percent by weight) of the curable resin composition. The curable resin composition, if containing the silane coupling agent in a content of less than 0.01 percent by weight, may fail to contribute to satisfactory adhesion to an adherend. This curable resin composition may also fail to allow the isocyanurate compound such as the monoallyl diglycidyl isocyanurate compound to exhibit sufficient advantageous effects when the compound is dissolved (mixed) with another component. In contrast, the curable resin composition, if containing the silane coupling agent in a content of greater than 15 percent by weight, may undergo curing insufficiently and thereby cause the cured product to have inferior toughness, heat resistance, and/or barrier properties.</div>

In contrast, the curable resin composition, if having a viscosity of greater than 20000 mPa·s, may be prepared and/or handled uneasily and may cause bubbles to readily remain in the cured product. The viscosity of the curable resin composition can be measured typically by the procedure for the measurement of the viscosity of the ladder-type silsesquioxane (A).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0012" num="0000">Cured Product</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0202" num="0201">The curable resin composition according to the embodiment of the present invention, when cured by hydrosilylation, can give a cured product. The cured product is hereinafter also referred to as “cured product according to the embodiment of the present invention”. The curing (hydrosilylation) may be performed under conditions that are not critical and can be suitably selected from among customarily known conditions. Typically, the curing may be performed at a temperature (curing temperature) of from 25° C. to 180° C. (more preferably from 60° C. to 150° C.) for a time (curing time) of preferably from 5 to 720 minutes. The cured product according to the embodiment of the present invention excels in properties such as heat resistance, transparency, and flexibility, further excels in reflow resistance such as cracking resistance in a reflow process and adhesion to a package, and has excellent barrier properties to a corrosive gas such as a SO<sub>x </sub>gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0013" num="0000">Encapsulating Agent</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0203" num="0202">The encapsulating agent according to an embodiment of the present invention is an encapsulating agent including the curable resin composition according to the embodiment of the present invention as an essential component. The encapsulating agent according to the embodiment of the present invention, when cured, gives an encapsulant (cured product). The encapsulant excels in properties such as heat resistance, transparency, and flexibility and also excels in reflow resistance and barrier properties to a corrosive gas. For this reason, the encapsulating agent according to the embodiment of the present invention is advantageously usable typically as an encapsulating agent for a semiconductor element in a semiconductor device; and particularly as an encapsulating agent for an optical semiconductor element in an optical semiconductor device. Of such optical semiconductor elements, the encapsulating agent is more advantageously applicable to an optical semiconductor element for emitting light with a high intensity and a short wavelength. The encapsulating agent according to the embodiment of the present invention, when used in encapsulation of a semiconductor element (particularly, an optical semiconductor element), can give a semiconductor device (particularly, an optical semiconductor device) having excellent durability and quality.</div>

Next, the aluminum case was placed in an oven (model number “DN-64” supplied by Yamato Scientific Co., Ltd.), and whether and how a silver electrode in the LED) package was corroded was visually observed 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours later. The degree of corrosion of the electrode was evaluated on a scale of A, B, and C [A: the electrode had the same color as before the test, and no corrosion was observed; B: the electrode became dark brown, and corrosion was detected; and C: the electrode became black entirely, indicating that the electrode was fully corroded]. The results are indicated in Table 3.</div>
