<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The following description relates to an organic light-emitting display device and a method of manufacturing the organic light-emitting display device, and more particularly, to an organic light-emitting display device that is simple to manufacture and includes a pad portion with increased corrosion-resistance and reduced resistance, and a method of manufacturing the organic light-emitting display device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Flat panel displays such as organic light-emitting display devices and liquid crystal displays (LCDs) are manufactured on a substrate on which a pattern including a thin film transistor (TFT), a capacitor, and wiring connecting the TFT to the capacitor is formed. In general, to form a fine pattern including the TFT and the like, the fine pattern is transferred to a substrate used to manufacture a flat panel display, by using a mask on which the fine pattern is drawn.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">However, in a process of transferring a pattern by using a mask, a mask on which a necessary pattern is drawn is first prepared. Thus, as the number of processes using a mask increases, the manufacturing costs for preparing for the use of masks increases. Moreover, the manufacturing process is complicated due to the above-described complicated processes, and a manufacturing time is increased, leading to an increase in manufacturing costs.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">The storage region <b>300</b> includes the capacitor Cst.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">The light-emitting region <b>100</b> includes the OLED. The OLED emits light by a current supplied to both electrodes of the OLED.

Although not shown, the pad electrode <b>410</b> may be electrically connected to the TFT or the OLED via wiring. The pad electrode <b>410</b> is electrically connected to a driver integrated circuit (IC) which supplies a current, in order to drive the organic light-emitting display device <b>1</b>. Accordingly, the pad electrode <b>410</b> receives the current from the driver IC and transmits the current to the TFT or the OLED both located in the display area DA (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) via the wiring. The pad electrode <b>410</b> includes a first pad electrode <b>414</b>, a second pad electrode <b>415</b> formed on an upper surface of the first pad electrode <b>414</b>, and a third pad electrode <b>416</b> formed on an upper surface of the second pad electrode <b>415</b>. The first pad electrode <b>414</b> is formed of the same material as that used to form the lower gate electrode <b>214</b>, in the same layer as that where the lower gate electrode <b>214</b> is formed. The second pad electrode <b>415</b> is formed of the same material as that used to form the upper gate electrode <b>215</b>, in the same layer as that where the upper gate electrode <b>215</b> is formed. The third pad electrode <b>416</b> includes a transparent conductive oxide (TCO). The third pad electrode <b>416</b> may be formed of polycrystal indium tin oxide (p-ITO).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">According to an embodiment of the present invention, the pad electrode <b>410</b> includes a first pad electrode <b>414</b>, a second pad electrode <b>415</b>, and a third pad electrode <b>416</b> sequentially stacked on top of one another, wherein the first pad electrode <b>414</b> includes a transparent conductive oxide, the second pad electrode <b>415</b> includes a low-resistance metal, and the third pad electrode <b>416</b> includes p-ITO. According to this structure, a voltage is applied to the display area DA of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> via the second pad electrode <b>415</b> having low resistance, thereby improving resistance saturation and reducing the entire resistance during voltage application. In addition, since the third pad electrode <b>416</b>, which is resilient to corrosion and difficult to etch, exists on an upper surface of the second pad electrode <b>415</b>, it protects the second pad electrode <b>415</b> that is corroded more easily than the third pad electrode <b>416</b>, thereby increasing the corrosion resistance of the pad region <b>400</b>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">First, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an auxiliary layer <b>11</b> is formed on the first substrate <b>10</b>. The first substrate <b>10</b> may be formed of a transparent glass material containing SiO<sub>2 </sub>as a main component. However, the first substrate <b>10</b> is not limited thereto. The first substrate <b>10</b> may be any substrate formed of various materials, for example, a transparent plastic, a metal, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">The auxiliary layer <b>11</b>, for example, a barrier layer, a blocking layer, and/or a buffer layer, may be formed on an upper surface of the first substrate <b>10</b> to reduce or prevent diffusion of impurity ions and penetration of moisture or external air and to planarize the upper surface of the first substrate <b>10</b>. The auxiliary layer <b>11</b> may be formed using, for example, SiO<sub>2 </sub>and/or SiN<sub>x</sub>, according to any of various suitable deposition methods, for example, plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), atmospheric pressure CVD (APCVD), and/or low pressure CVD (LPCVD).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the active layer <b>212</b> of the TFT and the lower capacitor electrode <b>312</b> are formed on an upper surface of the auxiliary layer <b>11</b>. In detail, an amorphous silicon layer is first formed on the upper surface of the auxiliary layer <b>11</b> and then crystallized to generate a polycrystalline silicon layer. Amorphous silicon may be crystallized using any of various methods such as rapid thermal annealing (RTA), solid phase crystallization (SPC), excimer laser annealing (ELA), metal induced crystallization (MIC), metal induced lateral crystallization (MILC), and sequential lateral solidification (SLS). The polycrystalline silicon layer is patterned to form the active layer <b>212</b> of the TFT and the lower capacitor electrode <b>312</b> by using a mask process using a first mask.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">Although the active layer <b>212</b> and the lower capacitor electrode <b>312</b> are separated from each other in the present embodiment, the active layer <b>212</b> and the lower capacitor electrode <b>312</b> may be integrally formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the first insulation layer <b>13</b>, a first conductive layer <b>14</b>, a second conductive layer <b>15</b>, and a third conductive layer <b>16</b> are sequentially formed on the entire surface of the first substrate <b>10</b> on which the active layer <b>212</b> and the lower capacitor electrode <b>312</b> have been formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">The first insulation layer <b>13</b> may be obtained by depositing an inorganic insulation material such as SiN<sub>x </sub>or SiO<sub>x</sub>, according to a suitable method such as PECVD, APCVD, and/or LPCVD. The first insulation layer <b>13</b> is disposed between the active layer <b>212</b> and the gate electrode <b>210</b> of the TFT to serve as a gate insulation layer of the TFT, and between the upper capacitor electrode <b>310</b> and the lower capacitor electrode <b>312</b> to serve as a dielectric layer of the capacitor Cst.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">The first conductive layer <b>14</b> may include at least one selected from among transparent materials such as ITO, IZO, ZnO, and In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Thereafter, the first conductive layer <b>14</b> may be patterned to form the pixel electrode <b>114</b>, the lower gate electrode <b>214</b>, the first upper capacitor electrode <b>314</b>, and the first pad electrode <b>414</b>. Since the organic light-emitting display device <b>1</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention is a bottom emission type that emits light toward a substrate, the pixel electrode <b>114</b> needs to be formed as a transparent electrode. Accordingly, the first conductive layer <b>14</b> used to form the pixel electrode <b>114</b> may be formed of TCO.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">The second conductive layer <b>15</b> may include at least one selected from among silver (Ag), magnesium (Mg), aluminum (Al), platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), gold (Au), nickel (Ni), neodymium (Nd), iridium (Ir), chromium (Cr), lithium (Li), calcium (Ca), molybdenum (Mo), titanium (Ti), tungsten (W), MoW, and copper (Cu). The second conductive layer <b>15</b> may have a three-layered structure, namely, a Mo—Al—Mo structure. Then, the second conductive layer <b>15</b> may be patterned to form the upper gate electrode <b>215</b> and the second pad electrode <b>415</b>. According to an embodiment of the present invention, since the gate electrode <b>210</b> and the pad electrode <b>410</b> need to smoothly transmit a current, the formation of the gate electrode <b>210</b> and the pad electrode <b>410</b> from only the first conductive layer <b>14</b> having relatively high resistance may be a problem. Accordingly, the second conductive layer <b>15</b> formed of a low-resistance metal having smaller resistance than a low-resistance metal used to form the first conductive layer <b>14</b> should be formed to allow the TFT and the pad electrode <b>410</b> to perform their respective functions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">The third conductive layer <b>16</b> may include at least one selected from among transparent materials such as ITO, IZO, ZnO, and In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Then, the third conductive layer <b>16</b> may remain in only the pad electrode <b>410</b> and thus may be patterned to form the third pad electrode <b>416</b>. The third conductive layer <b>16</b> may be formed of amorphous ITO (a-ITO), and then may be transformed into p-ITO by annealing. Annealing may be performed using heat, ultraviolet rays (UV), and/or a laser. Even when annealing is not performed, the a-ITO may be crystallized via thermal treatment and UV treatment during the manufacturing of the organic light-emitting display device <b>1</b>. Due to the transformation of the third conductive layer <b>16</b> into p-ITO, a specific resistance value of the third conductive layer <b>16</b> is reduced to be between about 250 Ωcm and about 300 Ωcm, as compared with the a-ITO having a specific resistance value greater than about 1,000 Ωcm. The etching speed of the p-ITO is reduced to about 1/10 or less of the etching speed of the a-ITO. The etching speed of the p-ITO is reduced not only with respect to an aqueous solution of HCl and HNO<sub>3 </sub>used as etchants for wet-etching ITO, but also with respect to an aqueous fluoric acid (HF) solution, an aqueous nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>) solution and an aqueous acetic acid (CHCHOOH) solution. In other words, a third pad electrode including p-ITO may be used as an etching stopper during the manufacturing of the organic light-emitting display device <b>1</b>, and is not easily eroded even when it is exposed to light after the process.</div>
