<heading id="h-0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is directed to a heterostructure Field-Effect Transistor (“FET”). More particularly, the present invention is directed to a heterostructure FET having a superlattice structure with a plurality of Two-Dimensional Electron Gas (2DEG) channels, all of which are capable of being turned “off” by the application of a relatively low gate voltage. The present invention is equally applicable to superlattice structures having a plurality of Two-Dimensional Hole Gas (2DHG) channels. The present invention finds particular utility as a normally-on RF switch.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Background Information</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">A high-quality RF switch is ideally designed to minimize the on-resistance, R<sub>on</sub>, while also minimizing the off-capacitance, C<sub>off</sub>. An ideal RF switch, when “on”, passes a signal without attenuation, distortion or insertion loss (all of which being a function of on-resistance) and, when “off”, isolates the signal and prevents it from leaking through the switch (leakage being a function of the off-capacitance).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to be able to use an RF switch in as many applications as possible, it is desirable that the RF switch has a large bandwidth, which is proportional to the Figure of Merit for RF switches, the RF switch cut-off frequency. The formula for the RF switch cut-off frequency F<sub>CO </sub>is as follows:
<br/>
<i>F</i> <sub>CO</sub>=1/(2π<i>R</i> <sub>on</sub> <i>C</i> <sub>off</sub>)  [Equation 1].
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">In conventional FET designs, any attempt to lower the on-resistance, such as by increasing the periphery of the device, generally causes the off-capacitance to increase proportionately. Given the inversely-proportional relationship between on-resistance and off-capacitance, it is difficult to improve (e.g., lower) insertion loss while not adversely impacting (e.g., lowering) the isolation simultaneously.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">The prior art has attempted to reduce on-resistance by fabricating, in a laboratory setting, heterostructure FETs having a plurality of 2DEG channels. The term “heterostructure” (also, “hetero-junction”) refers to a structure having two distinct layers of dissimilar material in intimate contact with each other. A superlattice structure is formed by manufacturing a plurality of periodically-repeated heterojunctions one on top of the other in a stacked relationship.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Certain heterostructure materials, such as Aluminum Gallium Nitride (AlGaN) and Gallium Nitride (GaN), create an electron well (i.e., a sheet of electrons) at the interface between the two dissimilar materials resulting from the piezoelectric effect and spontaneous polarization effect therebetween. The resulting sheet of electrons that forms at this interface is typically referred to as a Two-Dimensional Electron Gas (“2DEG”) channel. FETs that operate by generating and controlling the electrons in the 2DEG channel are conventionally referred to as high electron mobility transistors (“HEMTs”).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">By stacking a plurality of these two-material heterostructures, and with the addition of appropriate doping in the layers to maintain the presence of the 2DEG channels when stacking a plurality of heterostructure layers, the electron sheets are able to act in parallel, allowing for greater current flow through the superlattice device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">When this type of FET is “on”, the superlattice device has a lower on-resistance, relative to a single heterostructure-layer device, because the multiple 2DEG channels allow a proportionally higher current to flow between the source and drain, resulting in an overall reduction in on-resistance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">Coincidentally, the plurality of stacked heterostructure layers does not increase the off-capacitance proportional to the number of stacked layers. On-resistance is a two-dimensional measurement (i.e., between the source and drain), while off-capacitance is a three-dimensional measurement: off-state blocking voltages create three-dimensional fringing fields having a fringing-field capacitance and forming a significant portion of the off-state capacitance, which is a function of the spacing between the source and drain, as well as the volume and type of materials therebetween. Where the heterostructure layers are relatively thin, the volumetric material between source and drain is not proportionally increased. Thus, a thin-film, stacked heterostructure configuration decreases the on-resistance without proportionally impacting the off-capacitance, thereby allowing for a higher cut-off frequency and thus a larger bandwidth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">While the prior art has been able to fabricate, in a laboratory setting, stacked heterostructure FETs, the prior art devices exhibit excessively large leakage currents and are unable to be turned completely “off”, even with the application of relatively high gate voltages, rendering such devices to be of limited utility.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">Turning now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a side view of a preferred embodiment of the epitaxial structure of the present invention is illustrated. Epitaxial structure <b>100</b> preferably comprises base structure <b>102</b> and superlattice structure <b>110</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">Base structure <b>102</b> allows the growth, deposit or other formation of superlattice structure <b>110</b> thereon and can be part of a homoepitaxial process (i.e., the base material is the same as the superlattice material) or heteroepitaxial process (i.e., the base material is different from the superlattice material, and employing a buffer), as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, base structure preferably comprises substrate layer <b>104</b>, nucleation layer <b>106</b> and buffer layer <b>108</b> of silicon carbide (SiC), aluminum nitride (AlN) and aluminum gallium nitride (AlGaN), respectively. Optionally, the base structure can comprise a substrate layer of sapphire, a nucleation layer comprising a combination of a low-temperature GaN layer and a high-temperature GaN layer, and a buffer layer based on the material of the superlattice structure to be located thereon, if required. The base structure can alternatively comprise a substrate layer of (111)—orientated crystalline silicon, a nucleation layer comprising AlN and a buffer layer comprising a series of discrete AlGaN layers (typically between two and eight layers), each discrete layer having a different aluminum composition. Other base structures will be apparent to those skilled in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">In the preferred embodiment, the percentage of aluminum in the AlGaN buffer layer is preferably in the range of between 0% and about 10%.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">Superlattice structure <b>110</b> comprises a plurality of heterostructures, each heterostructure preferably comprising two layers of dissimilar materials designed to create a sheet of electrons (i.e. a 2DEG channel) or a sheet of holes (i.e., a 2DHG channel) at the interface between the two dissimilar materials. Various heterostructure materials are known to produce 2DEG and 2DHG channels at the interface therebetween, including but not limited to Aluminum Gallium Nitride (AlGaN) and Gallium Nitride (GaN), Aluminum Gallium Arsenide (AlGaAs) and Gallium Arsenide (GaAs), Indium Aluminum Nitride (InAlN) and Gallium Nitride (GaN), alloys of Silicon (Si) and Germanium (Ge), and noncentrosymmetric oxides. See, e.g., M. Myronov, et al., “Observation of two-dimensional hole gas with mobility and carrier density exceeding those of two-dimensional electron gas at room temperature in the SiGe heterostructures”, Appl. Phys. Lett. 91, 082108 (2007) [Reference 5]; and P. Shiv Halasyamati, et al., “Noncentrosymmetric Oxides”, Chem. Mater. 1998, 10, 2753-2769 [Reference 6].</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">In the preferred embodiment, superlattice structure <b>110</b> comprises a plurality of heterostructures, between 2 and N, wherein N is defined as the maximum number of heterostructures that can be grown, deposited or otherwise formed on each other without cracking or other mechanical failure in the layers or 2DEG channels. As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the value of N is a function of the specific heterostructure materials and thickness of each layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">Superlattice structure <b>110</b> is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as having six heterostructures, to with, layers <b>112</b>/<b>114</b>, <b>116</b>/<b>118</b>, <b>120</b>/<b>122</b>, <b>124</b>/<b>126</b>, <b>128</b>/<b>130</b> and <b>132</b>/<b>134</b>, comprising alternating layers of GaN (layers <b>112</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>128</b> and <b>132</b>) and AlGaN (layers <b>114</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>126</b>, <b>130</b> and <b>134</b>), each heterostructure forming a continuous 2DEG channel (not shown) at the interface within each heterostructure. The specific number of heterostructures within the superlattice structure and the heteromaterials can vary, and the relative positions of AlGaN and GaN may be reversed, as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">The percentage of aluminum in the AlGaN layers of the superlattice structure can range from about 0.1 to 100 percent. In the preferred embodiment, the percentage of aluminum in the AlGaN layers of the superlattice structure is preferably between about 20% and 100% aluminum-content aluminum gallium nitride (Al<sub>0.2</sub>Ga<sub>0.8</sub>N and AlN, respectively). Specific compositions will be apparent to one skilled in the art.</div>

In the preferred embodiment, each AlGaN layer within the superlattice structure is graded, the term “graded” being used to denote the process of gradually changing the percentage of aluminum to its specified percentage, relative to the percentage of gallium, as known in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">While the dimensional thickness of layers <b>112</b>-<b>134</b> is not critical, the preferred thickness of GaN layer <b>112</b> is at least about 30 nanometers, the preferred thickness of GaN layers <b>116</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>128</b> and <b>132</b> is between about 1 nanometer and about 50 nanometers, and the preferred thickness of AlGaN layers <b>114</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>126</b>, <b>130</b> and <b>134</b> is between about 1 nanometer and about 50 nanometers.

Similarly, a p-type dopant such as magnesium (Mg) would be introduced to induce a 2DHG channel in relevant heterostructures, as applicable. Other n-type and p-type dopants will be apparent to those skilled in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">In a single heterostructure, the dissimilar materials cause an imbalance stress in the system which allows polarization and/or piezoelectric effects to induce carriers to form in a potential well formed by the heterostructure, i.e., to create a 2DxG channel. In a superlattice structure where multiple heterostructures are stacked on top of each other, all heterostructures beneath the top heterostructure will become balanced and carriers that would otherwise induce in those potential wells will not be induced. Adding a doping layer near the interface where the potential well is formed will act to induce the carriers into that potential well, replacing the effect that would have occurred but for the balancing effect of multiple symmetric heterostructures. In the preferred embodiment, the delta-doping concentration is preferably between about 1E17 cm<sup>−3 </sup>and about 1E20 cm<sup>−3</sup>. Other delta-doping concentrations will be apparent to those skilled in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">Layer <b>136</b> can optionally be located on the top layer of the superlattice structure, either as a final passivation layer or as a dielectric for a MISFET (i.e., Metal Insulator Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor). In either case, layer <b>136</b> can comprise, for example, a nitride (e.g., SiN, Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>and AlN) or an oxides (e.g., SiO<sub>2</sub>, ZrO<sub>2</sub>, HfO<sub>2 </sub>and TiO<sub>2</sub>), and is preferably silicon nitride (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>or SiN<sub>x</sub>). While the dimensional thickness of the layer is not critical, its preferred thickness, when included, is between about 1 nanometer and about 200 nanometers, more preferably about 10 nanometers. Other layer materials and/or dimensions will be apparent to those skilled in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">While a preferred embodiment of the epitaxial structure of the present invention has been described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a field-effect transistor comprising a superlattice structure having a plurality of 2DEG channels has been heretofore difficult to control by using a planar gate between a source and drain. See, e.g., References 1 through 4.</div>
<heading id="h-0005">Example 1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">A normally-on field effect transistor was designed having a source, drain and gate deposited upon an epitaxy having a superlattice structure comprising six heterostructures, each heterostructure containing a 2DEG channel therewithin, each heterostructure formed by a layer of 40% graded AlGaN over a layer of GaN. The six AlGaN layers were each about 7.5 nanometers thick. The top five GaN layers were each about 8 nanometers thick, with the bottommost GaN layer being about 50 nanometers thick. A planar, Schottky gate was deposited thereon between source and drain. Various gate voltages were applied in an effort to determine the effective gate voltage required to turn “off” all 2DEG channels within the device. A gate voltage of −20V was shown to penetrate the superlattice structure to just below the second 2DEG channel, halting current flow through the top two 2DEG channels while allowing current to flow through the other four 2DEG channels therebelow. A gate voltage of −100V was shown to penetrate the upper four 2DEG channels, halting current flow therethrough but allowing current to flow unabated in the lowest two 2DEG channels. The experiment was thereafter discontinued based on the consensus that the application of a gate voltage in excess of −100V was commercially impractical.</div>

The length of each trench is variable, and can be as small as 0.01 microns or smaller, if tooling allows, and as large as the distance between source electrode <b>202</b> and drain electrode <b>204</b>. The width of each trench is also variable, and can be 0.01 microns or smaller, if tooling allows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">Each trench is formed by removing a portion of superlattice structure <b>110</b> from device <b>200</b>. While the superlattice structure can be formed with trenches <b>206</b> using masks, the trenches are preferably formed by an etching process. See, e.g., D. Paramanik, et al., “Formation of large-area GaN nanostructures with controlled geometry and morphology using top-down fabrication scheme”, J. Vac. Sci. Technol. B 30, 052202 (2012) [Reference 7], incorporated herein by reference. Other methods of forming trenches <b>206</b> into the superlattice structure will be apparent to one skilled in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">The number of trenches, the length and width of each trench, as well as the spacing between each trench, are a function of the desired device characteristics and the heterostructure materials comprising the superlattice structure. The spacing between each trench (i.e., the unetched portion of superlattice structure <b>110</b>) is also a function of the number of trenches to be etched, the width of each trench and the overall width of the device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">Specifying a given length and a given width for each trench is a trade-off between ease of manufacture and overall device characteristics, such as power handling capacity, insertion loss, isolation and threshold voltage to turn the device “off”. For example, while trenches having a longer L and a wider W are easier to manufacture, and thus allow for a higher yield, such dimensional choices result in decreased current flow through the superlattice structure and increased device resistance (since there is less superlattice structure remaining) Conversely, a shorter L and a narrower W result in improved current flow and decreased device resistance (since there is more superlattice structure remaining) but may be harder to manufacture, resulting in decreased yields. Similarly, as the spacing between the trenches increases, the resistance of the device decreases (since there is more superlattice structure remaining) but the pinch-off voltage increases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">For the AlGaN/GaN superlattice structure described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>: length L of each trench is preferably between about 0.1 and about 1 microns; width W of each trench is preferably between about 0.04 and about 0.1 microns; the spacing between trenches is preferably between about 0.04 and about 0.1 microns; and the number of trenches is preferably between one, with the upper limit on the number of trenches being dependent on the width of the source and drain electrodes (or, alternatively, the width of the device) and the cumulative width of all trenches.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">In the preferred embodiment, the dimensions of each trench, as well as the spacing therebetween, is the same for all trenches. Additionally, the trenches are preferably located between the leftmost edges of the source electrode and drain electrode on one end, and the rightmost edges of the source electrode and drain electrode on the other end, for reasons discussed below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">In an ideal manufacturing environment, angle <b>302</b>, defined as the angle between one of the sidewalls and the bottom of the trench, and angle <b>304</b>, defined as the angle between the other sidewall and the bottom of the trench, would be 90 degrees. Such an ideal environment is not currently available. During the trench etching process, the trench sidewalls are sloped in an obtuse manner, relative to the bottom of the trench. For the AlGaN/GaN superlattice structure described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, angles <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> are preferably less than about 110 degrees, and more preferably about 96 to about 98 degrees.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">Turning now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a top view of a first embodiment of the present invention is shown, with gate electrode <b>402</b> located on superlattice structure <b>110</b> and trenches <b>206</b>. The length of gate electrode <b>402</b> can be less than, equal to or greater than the length of trenches <b>206</b>. [As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the “length” is conventionally defined as that dimension perpendicular to the source and drain electrodes. Similarly, the “width” is typically defined as that dimension parallel to the source and drain electrodes.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">It is noted that the number of trenches shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> (i.e., 9 trenches) is less than the number of trenches shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> (i.e., 15 trenches), which was done in an effort to simplify <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>. It is to be understood, however, that <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> are to be interpreted as having the same number of trenches as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, despite not being depicted in their entirety. To that end, trench <b>206</b>-<b>1</b> and trench <b>206</b>-<i>n </i>shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-8</figref> correspond to the leftmost trench and the rightmost trench, respectively, shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">In the preferred embodiment, via <b>502</b> and via <b>504</b> are located within superlattice structure <b>110</b> under source electrode <b>202</b> and drain electrode <b>204</b>, respectively. Via <b>502</b> and via <b>504</b> are preferably included to provide low-resistance, ohmic contact between all 2DxG channels and source electrode <b>202</b> and drain electrode <b>204</b>, respectively. The vias can be formed by any of the methods used to form trenches <b>206</b>, as discussed above, and are preferably formed by etching into the superlattice structure, as discussed above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">The length, width and depth of the vias are variable.

This preferred depth of trench <b>206</b>-<i>x </i>allows the bottom surface of gate electrode <b>402</b> to be positioned below the lowermost 2DEG channel of superlattice structure <b>110</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, gate electrode <b>402</b> is located within all trenches <b>206</b>, while <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a cross-sectional view of the trenches without the gate electrode therein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, certain sections of the superlattice structure are preferably devoid of any operable 2DEG channels, specifically, the section between via <b>502</b> and the rightmost edge of the device, and the section between via <b>504</b> and the leftmost edge of the device. Similar sections are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, specifically, the section between leftmost trench <b>206</b>-<b>1</b> and the leftmost edge of the device, and the section between rightmost trench <b>206</b>-<i>n </i>and the rightmost edge of the device. The term “isolation regions” is defined herein as those sections of the superlattice structure specified hereinabove that are devoid of operable 2DEG channels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">Several methods are available to effectively eliminate and render non-operable those 2DEG channels contained in the isolation regions. For example, an ion-implantation technique can be used whereby helium atoms can be shot at a high velocity into the superlattice structure to disrupt its crystalline geometry, thereby eliminating the 2DEG channels within the targeted region. Alternatively, a mesa etch can be performed to achieve the same result. In the preferred embodiment, an ion-implantation technique is performed to create the isolation regions defined above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>, having a first and a second isolated implanted region on the left and right sides of the device (i.e., the section between leftmost trench <b>206</b>-<b>1</b> and the leftmost edge of the device, and the section between rightmost trench <b>206</b>-<i>n </i>and the rightmost edge of the device, respectively) eliminates the possibility that current will flow between the leftmost portions of the source and drain electrodes on one side, and between the rightmost portions of the source and drain electrodes on the other side, which would effectively bypass the trench area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">Similarly, with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>, having a third and a fourth isolated implanted region in the section between via <b>502</b> and the rightmost edge of the device, and the section between via <b>504</b> and the leftmost edge of the device, respectively, eliminates the possibility that current will flow around the device when multiple devices are manufactured in close proximity to each other on the same base structure. While these third and fourth isolated implanted regions may not be as critical as the first two isolated implanted regions, the preferred embodiment contains all four isolated implanted regions to cover all scenarios.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">Given a superlattice structure having a source electrode, a drain electrode, a plurality of trenches, a crenelated gate electrode located within each of the trenches and all four isolated implanted regions, each as discussed above, the crenelated gate electrode of the present invention is able to pinch off all current flowing between the source electrode and the drain electrode by application of conventional gate voltages.</div>
<heading id="h-0006">Example 2</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">A normally-on field effect transistor was designed as described with reference to Example 1, and further comprising about 1000 trenches, each trench having a length of 0.6 microns, a width of 0.05 microns and a depth below all six 2DEG channels, wherein the trenches were spaced 0.08 microns apart from each other. The angle of the trench sidewalls (i.e., angle <b>302</b> and angle <b>304</b>) was about 96 degrees. A gate electrode having a length of about 0.25 microns and a width of about 67 microns was deposited onto the superlattice structure and within each of the trenches such that the bottom portion of the gate electrode was also below all six 2DEG channels. The device had the following characteristics: drain current of 2.68 A/mm at 5 V<sub>d</sub>; R<sub>on </sub>was 0.49 ohms·mm; and C<sub>off </sub>was 0.2 pF/mm. Various gate voltages were applied in an effort to determine the effective gate voltage [V<sub>g</sub>] required to turn “off” all 2DEG channels within the device. Several devices were manufactured over time, and each experiment resulted in all six 2DEG channels being turned “off”, with no current leakage, upon the application of a gate voltage of between about −8V and about −14 V.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">Turning now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a top view of a second embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. Device <b>900</b> is substantially as described with reference to device <b>200</b> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-8</figref> above, with the exception of the length of gate electrode <b>902</b>, which is greater than the length of the trenches located therebeneath (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> as dotted lines for clarity purposes only). <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a sectional view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> taken at sectional lines <b>9</b>-<b>9</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the shorter the length of the trenches, the lower the device resistance. The lower the device resistance, the better the device performance. For example, a lower device resistance translates into a lower insertion loss (for RF switch applications) and higher current throughput and more power (for amplifier applications).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">One way to minimize the resistance of device <b>200</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and/or device <b>900</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) is to minimize the length of trenches <b>206</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The shorter this length, the relatively more expensive it may be to manufacture the gate electrode that fits within the trenches using current lithograph tools or e-beam technology. By manufacturing a gate electrode whose length is greater than the length of the trenches, one is able to use the relatively less expensive manufacturing techniques to manufacture the gate electrode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">As discussed above, neither device <b>200</b> nor device <b>900</b> includes optional layer <b>136</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) on superlattice structure <b>110</b>.</div>
