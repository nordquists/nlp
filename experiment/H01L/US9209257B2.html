<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">In recent years, development of display devices has rapidly progressed, and various display devices such as a liquid crystal display device and an EL display device have been extensively used for office automation equipment such as a personal computer and a word processor. These display devices have a sandwich structure in which a display element is disposed between transparent conductive films.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">A silicon-based semiconductor film is mainly used for a switching element that drives a display device. This is because a silicon-based thin film exhibits excellent stability, excellent workability, a high switching speed, and the like. A silicon-based thin film is generally formed by chemical vapor deposition (CVD).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">An amorphous silicon-based thin film has a problem in that a video or the like cannot be displayed at a high frame rate due to a relatively low switching speed. A crystalline silicon-based thin film achieves a relatively high switching speed, but requires a high temperature of 800° C. or more, laser heating, or the like for crystallization. Specifically, a large amount of energy and a large number of steps are required for producing a crystalline silicon-based thin film. A silicon-based thin film exhibits excellent performance as a voltage element, but shows a change in characteristics with time when causing a current to flow therethrough.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, use of a film other than a silicon-based thin film has been studied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">A transparent semiconductor thin film formed of indium oxide, gallium oxide, and zinc oxide, and a transparent semiconductor thin film formed of zinc oxide and magnesium oxide have been proposed as a transparent semiconductor film that exhibits excellent stability as compared with a silicon-based thin film, and has a light transmittance equal to that of an ITO film, and as a target used to produce such a transparent semiconductor film (e.g., Patent Document 1).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Patent Document 2 discloses a composition that includes indium oxide and gallium oxide as the main components, and contains an InGaO<sub>3 </sub>compound. Patent Document 2 relates to a transparent conductive film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Patent Document 3 discloses an In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>transparent conductive film that contains 1 to 10 atom % of gallium (Ga). The transparent conductive film disclosed in Patent Document 3 is produced by cosputtering in a state in which gallium metal is disposed on an In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>target.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Patent Document 4 discloses a sintered body composition for a transparent conductive film that has a Ga/(In+Ga) ratio of 0.35 or more and less than 1.0, and includes a (Ga,In)<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>phase. Patent Document 5 discloses an oxide sintered body for a transparent conductive film that has a Ga/(In+Ga) ratio of 0.65 or more and less than 1.0, and includes a (Ga,In)<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>phase.</div>

Patent Document 8 discloses an indium oxide-gallium oxide sintered body that contains 35 to 45 atom % of gallium, and Patent Document 9 discloses an indium oxide-gallium oxide sintered body that contains 15 to 49 atom % of gallium.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">However, a crystalline oxide semiconductor film formed of indium oxide and gallium oxide cannot be obtained when the gallium content is within the ranges disclosed in Patent Documents 6 to 9.

<heading id="h-0007">MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0045">An oxide sintered body according to one embodiment of the invention includes indium oxide and gallium solid-solved therein. The oxide sintered body contains indium and gallium in an amount of 80 atom % or more based on total metal atoms. The oxide sintered body has an atomic ratio “Ga/(In+Ga)” of 0.001 to 0.12. When the atomic ratio “Ga/(In+Ga)” is within this range, gallium is almost completely solid-solved in indium oxide. An element (e.g., gallium) other than indium is preferably introduced as an ion at the position of indium included in the crystal lattice of indium oxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0046">If the atomic ratio “Ga/(In+Ga)” is less than 0.001, the lattice constant of the indium oxide crystal may change to only a small extent, so that an effect may not be obtained by adding gallium. If the atomic ratio “Ga/(In+Ga)” exceeds 0.12, InGaO<sub>3 </sub>or the like may precipitate. The resulting oxide thin film may be crystallized to only a smaller extent when more InGaO<sub>3 </sub>or the like has precipitated, so that a crystalline thin film may not be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0047">The atomic ratio “Ga/(In+Ga)” is preferably 0.001 to 0.10, and more preferably 0.005 to 0.08. The atomic ratio “Ga/(In+Ga)” is still more preferably 0.01 to 0.05, and particularly preferably 0.02 to 0.04.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0048">The oxide sintered body according to one embodiment of the invention preferably has an In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>bixbyite structure. The oxide sintered body more preferably has a single-phase In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>bixbyite structure. In this case, since gallium (Ga) is completely solid-solved and dispersed in the In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>bixbyite structure, an abnormal discharge rarely occurs when using the oxide sintered body as a sputtering target. The bixbyite structure preferably accounts for 90% or more, more preferably 95% or more, and particularly preferably 97% or more, of the entire crystal structure. The ratio of crystal structures may be determined by identifying a crystal phase by EPMA analysis, and analyzing an image thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0049">In the oxide sintered body according to one embodiment of the invention, the bixbyite structure preferably has a lattice constant of 10.05 Å or more and less than 10.118 Å. The bixbyite structure may be determined by X-ray diffraction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0050">The oxide sintered body according to one embodiment of the invention preferably has a density of 6.5 to 7.2 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. If the oxide sintered body has a low density, the surface of a sputtering target formed of the oxide sintered body may blacken, for example. This may induce an abnormal discharge, so that the sputtering rate may decrease.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0051">The density of the sintered body may be increased by homogenously mixing raw materials having a particle size of 10 μm or less. If the particle size is too large, a reaction between the indium compound and the gallium compound may not proceed. If the raw materials are not homogenously mixed, the density of the sintered body may not increase due to the presence of unreacted particles or abnormally grown particles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0052">In the oxide sintered body according to one embodiment of the invention, gallium aggregates dispersed in indium oxide preferably have a diameter of less than 1 μm. The expression “gallium aggregates are dispersed in indium oxide” used herein means that gallium ions are solid-solved in the indium oxide crystal, or gallium compound particles are finely dispersed in indium oxide particles. A stable sputtering discharge occurs when gallium is finely dispersed. The diameter of gallium aggregates may be measured using an electron probe microanalyser (EPMA).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0053">The oxide sintered body according to one embodiment of the invention preferably has a bulk resistivity of 10 mΩcm or less. When gallium is not completely solid-solved (i.e., Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>or the like is observed), an abnormal discharge may occur. The oxide sintered body more preferably has a bulk resistivity of 5 mΩcm or less. There is no particular lower limit but the oxide sintered body need not have a bulk resistivity of less than 1 mΩcm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0054">The oxide sintered body according to one embodiment of the invention preferably has a content of metal ions having a positive valence of 4 or more (e.g., tin, titanium, zirconium, and germanium) of 100 ppm or less. If the content of metal ions having a positive valence of 4 or more exceeds 100 ppm, the resulting crystalline oxide thin film may exhibit conductivity instead of semiconductivity. The content of metal ions having a positive valence of 4 or more is more preferably 50 ppm or less, and still more preferably 30 ppm or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0055">The impurity content may be reduced to 100 ppm or less by utilizing a raw material having a purity of 99.99% or more.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0056">An indium oxide raw material may include metals having a positive valence of 4 or more (particularly tin) in an amount of 100 ppm or more. In this case, such metals may produce carriers in the resulting thin film, so that it may be impossible to use the thin film as a semiconductor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0057">The oxide sintered body according to one embodiment of the invention preferably has a content of metal ions (e.g., zinc, magnesium, copper, iron, nickel, and cobalt) having a positive valence of 2 or less of 100 ppm or less. If the content of metal ions having a positive valence of 2 or less is 100 ppm or more, the resulting oxide semiconductor may exhibit a low mobility.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0058">It is preferable that the content of metal ions having a positive valence of 4 be equal to or lower than the content of metal ions having a positive valence of 2.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0059">If the content of metal ions having a positive valence of 4 is higher than the content of metal ions having a positive valence of 2, the indium oxide crystal may be doped with metal ions having a positive valence of 4 so that the carrier density may increase. As a result, the resulting oxide thin film may exhibit high conductivity instead of semiconductivity. The content of metal ions having a positive valence of 2 or less is more preferably 50 ppm or less, and still more preferably 30 ppm or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0060">The oxide sintered body according to one embodiment of the invention preferably further includes one or two or more oxides selected from yttrium oxide, scandium oxide, aluminum oxide, and boron oxide. The oxide sintered body preferably has a content of such oxides of 0.01 to 5 atom %. If the oxide sintered body includes such oxides, a thin film obtained using the oxide sintered body as a sputtering target has a lattice constant smaller than that of a thin film formed only of indium oxide (i.e., the intermetallic distance decreases). This increases the mobility of a thin film transistor produced using such a thin film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0061">A method of producing an oxide sintered body according to one embodiment of the invention includes (a) mixing an indium (In) compound powder having an average particle size of less than 2 μm with a gallium (Ga) compound powder having an average particle size of less than 2 μm in an atomic ratio “Ga/(In+Ga)” of 0.001 to 0.12 (hereinafter may be referred to as “mixing step”); (h) shaping the resulting mixture to obtain a shaped product (hereinafter may be referred to as “shaping step”); and (c) firing the shaped product at 1200 to 1600° C. for 2 to 96 hours (hereinafter may be referred to as “sintering step”).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0062">The average particle size refers to a value measured in accordance with JIS R 1619.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0063">The indium compound and the gallium compound included in the raw material powders used in the mixing step are either an oxide or a compound (oxide precursor) that becomes an oxide due to firing. Examples of an indium oxide precursor and a tin oxide precursor include a sulfide, a sulfate, a nitrate, a halide (e.g., chloride and bromide), a carbonate, an organic acid salt (e.g., acetate, propionate, and naphthenate), an alkoxide (e.g., methoxide and ethoxide), an organic metal complex (e.g., acetylacetonate), and the like of indium or tin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0064">Among these, a nitrate, an organic acid salt, an alkoxide, or an organic metal complex is preferable since these compounds are completely pyrolyzed at a low temperature so that impurities do not remain. It is optimum to use oxides of the respective metals.</div>

If the purity of each raw material is 99.9 mass % (3N) or more, a deterioration in semiconductor properties due to impurities (e.g., metals having a positive valence of 4 or more, Fe, Ni, and Cu) does not occur, so that sufficient reliability can be achieved.

The oxide sintered body according to one embodiment of the invention may be used as a sputtering target.

It is preferable to adjust the partial pressure of oxygen during sputtering to 0.1 to 20%.

The oxide thin film preferably has an atomic ratio “Ga/(Ga+In)” of 0.001 to 0.10, and particularly preferably 0.005 to 0.08.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0089">Gallium oxide reduces the lattice constant (i.e., increases the mobility) of indium oxide. Gallium oxide has a high ability to bond to oxygen, and reduces oxygen deficiency of a polycrystallized indium oxide thin film. Gallium oxide has a site that is completely solid-solved in indium oxide, and completely integrated with crystallized indium oxide to reduce the lattice constant of indium oxide. When gallium oxide is added in an amount that exceeds the solid-solubility limit, precipitated gallium oxide may cause electron scattering, or may hinder crystallization of indium oxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0090">The oxide thin film according to one embodiment of the invention has a single-phase bixbyite structure, and the bixbyite structure preferably has a lattice constant of 10.01 Å or more and less than 10.118 Å (note that the lower limit of the lattice constant is not particularly limited). A small lattice constant means that the crystal lattice is reduced, and the intermetallic distance is short. The moving speed of electrons along the orbital of the metal increases due to a decrease in intermetallic distance, so that the mobility of the resulting thin film transistor increases. If the lattice constant is too large (i.e., is almost equal to that of the crystal lattice of indium oxide), the mobility is not improved.</div>

These oxides have a site that is completely solid-solved in indium oxide in the same manner as gallium oxide, and completely integrated with crystallized indium oxide to reduce the lattice constant of indium oxide. The degree of 5 s orbital overlap of indium in the crystal increases due to a decrease in lattice constant, so that the mobility is expected to be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0093">The oxide thin film according to one embodiment of the invention may be produced using the sputtering target according to one embodiment of the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0094">A sputtering target having a low gallium concentration is used when forming a crystalline film since a film having a low gallium concentration is easily crystallized. A sputtering target having a high gallium concentration is used when forming a non-crystalline film since a film having a high gallium concentration tends to become non-crystalline. Specifically, an amorphous film and a crystalline film can be formed when the Ga ratio is about 0.05 to 0.12, and a crystalline film is formed when the Ga ratio is about 0.05 or less. These thin films are formed by almost the same method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0095">A crystalline film is obtained when using a sputtering target having an atomic ratio “Ga/(In+Ga)” of less than 0.05 (i.e., low gallium concentration).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0096">Note that an amorphous film may be formed as follows using a sputtering target having an atomic ratio “Ga/(In+Ga)” of less than 0.05 in order to improve uniformity of the thin film. For example, an amorphous film may be formed by adjusting the sputtering conditions, such as setting the substrate temperature to a temperature equal to or lower than room temperature, adding steam to the sputtering gas at 0.1 Pa or less, or setting the sputtering gas pressure to 5 Pa or more. A crystalline film may be obtained by subjecting the amorphous film to an additional heating step described later.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0097">When forming a crystalline film using a sputtering target having an atomic ratio “Ga/(In+Ga)” of 0.05 or more and less than 0.12 (i.e., high gallium concentration), the substrate temperature during film formation is preferably set within the range from room temperature to 450° C. Specifically, cost increases when cooling the substrate to a temperature lower than room temperature, and the apparatus cost increases when heating the substrate to a temperature higher than 450° C. The substrate temperature during film formation is more preferably set within the range from room temperature (i.e., the substrate is not heated) to 200° C. When continuously performing the sputtering process, the substrate may be heated due to plasma during sputtering. In this case, it is preferable to cool the substrate to about room temperature during sputtering when using a film substrate or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0098">When the substrate is not heated during film formation, it is necessary to perform the additional heating step to effect crystallization. Note that the additional heating step may also be performed when heating the substrate during film formation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0099">When the substrate or the like on which the oxide thin film is formed is heated to 150 to 450° C., the thin film is crystallized, and exhibits semiconductor properties. If the heating temperature is lower than 150° C., the thin film may not be sufficiently crystallized. As a result, the insulating properties of the thin film may be impaired, so that leakage may occur. If the heating temperature is 450° C. or higher, the substrate may warp, or the thin film layers may be removed from each other when fabricating a semiconductor device. The heating temperature is more preferably 200 to 350° C., and still more preferably 240 to 300° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0100">The heating time is preferably 0.5 to 120 minutes. The oxide thin film is sufficiently crystallized by high-power heating (e.g., laser heating) within about 0.5 minutes. If the heating time is less than 0.5 minutes, the oxide thin film may not be sufficiently crystallized. If the heating time exceeds 120 minutes, cost may increase. The heating time is more preferably 0.5 to 90 minutes, and still more preferably 1 to 60 minutes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0101">The heating atmosphere is not particularly limited, but is preferably air, an oxygen atmosphere, a nitrogen atmosphere, or a low-vacuum atmosphere. Among these, air and an oxygen atmosphere are more preferable due to ease of carrier control. It is conjectured that excessive oxygen and water in a crystalline oxide semiconductor thin film are exchanged for oxygen in the atmosphere. Therefore, an oxygen-containing atmosphere is preferable in order to stabilize the semiconductor properties. Note that oxygen deficiency may completely disappear when heating the oxide thin film at a high temperature in pure oxygen, so that an insulator may be obtained. The oxygen concentration is preferably 19 to 50%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0102">The oxide thin film according to one embodiment of the invention may be used for a thin film transistor. In particular, the oxide thin film may be used as a channel layer. The oxide thin film may be used either directly or after heating.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0103">A thin film transistor according to one embodiment of the invention may be a channel-etch thin film transistor. The thin film according to one embodiment of the invention is crystalline, and has durability. Therefore, when producing a thin film transistor using the thin film according to one embodiment of the invention, it is possible to employ a photolithographic process that forms source/drain electrodes and a channel region by etching a metal (e.g., Al) thin film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0104">The thin film transistor according to one embodiment of the invention may be an etch-stopper thin film transistor. In this case, since a channel region formed of the semiconductor layer (i.e., the thin film according to one embodiment of the invention) can be protected by an etch stopper, and a large amount of oxygen can be introduced into the semiconductor film during film formation, it is unnecessary to externally supply oxygen through the etch stopper layer. Since the thin film is an amorphous film immediately after film formation, the source/drain electrodes and the channel region can be formed by etching a metal (e.g., Al) thin film while etching the semiconductor layer, so that the time required for the photolithographic process can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0105">A method of producing a thin film transistor according to one embodiment of the invention includes forming an oxide thin film using the sputtering target according to one embodiment of the invention, heating the oxide thin film in an oxygen atmosphere, and forming an oxide insulator layer on the oxide thin film that has been heated. The oxide thin film is crystallized by heating the oxide thin film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0106">The oxide insulator layer is preferably formed on the oxide thin film that has been heated in order to prevent deterioration in semiconductor properties with time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0107">The oxide thin film is preferably deposited using a film forming gas having an oxygen content of 10 vol % or more. A mixed gas of argon and oxygen is used as the film forming gas, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0108">The subsequent crystallization can be stabilized by adjusting the oxygen content in the film forming gas to 10 vol % or more. If the oxygen content in the sputtering gas is less than 10 vol %, it is necessary to externally supply oxygen required for crystallization, so that oxygen deficiency in the semiconductor may completely disappear. In the case where such a deficiency, the crystal may not be grown normally, and may include a scattering factor, so that a decrease in mobility may occur.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0109">The upper limit of the oxygen content in the film forming gas is not particularly limited. However, the sputtering rate may decrease when the oxygen content in the film forming gas is 100 vol %. Therefore, the oxygen content in the film forming gas is preferably adjusted to 50 vol % or less. The oxygen content in the film forming gas is more preferably 40 vol % or less, and still more preferably 30 vol % or less. A large amount of excessive oxygen introduced into the semiconductor is easily discharged to the outside during the subsequent crystallization step, so that an indium oxide crystal thin film with a small number of lattice deficiencies can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0110">The oxide thin film may be crystallized in the presence or absence of oxygen using a lamp annealing apparatus, a laser annealing apparatus, a thermal plasma apparatus, a hot-blast heating apparatus, a contact heating apparatus, or the like. In this case, it is preferable to employ a high temperature rise rate. If the temperature rise rate is low, the crystal particles may be abnormally grown. As a result, lattice shear may increase at the interface between the particles, and may cause scattering. It is possible to produce small crystal particles and reduce lattice shear by crystallizing the oxide thin film within a short time, so that the effect of improving the mobility is enhanced. Lattice shear may be considered to be a mismatch in crystal orientation at the interface between crystals that differ in crystal orientation. Scattering occurs to only a small extent when the crystal particles have similar crystal orientations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0111">The temperature rise rate is normally 40° C./min or more, preferably 70° C./min or more, more preferably 80° C./min or more, and still more preferably 100° C./min or more. The upper limit of the temperature rise rate is not particularly limited. When subjecting the oxide thin film to laser heating or thermal plasma heating, the temperature of the oxide thin film can be instantaneously increased to the desired heating temperature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0112">It is also preferable to employ a high cooling rate. However, if the cooling rate is too high, the substrate may break, or the electrical properties of the thin film may deteriorate due to residual internal stress. If the cooling rate is too low, the crystal may be abnormally grown due to an annealing effect. It is preferable to set the cooling rate in the same manner as the temperature rise rate (heating rate). The cooling rate is normally 5 to 300° C./min, preferably 10 to 200° C./min, and more preferably 20 to 100° C./min.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0113">The oxide thin film is preferably heated at 250 to 500° C. for 0.5 to 1200 minutes. If the heating temperature is lower than 250° C., the oxide thin film may not be crystallized. If the heating temperature exceeds 500° C., the substrate and the semiconductor film may be damaged. If the heating time is less than 0.5 minutes, the oxide thin film may not be crystallized because of too short heating time. It may take time to crystallize the oxide thin film when the heating time exceeds 1200 minutes.</div>
