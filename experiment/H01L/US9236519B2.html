<heading id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">An embodiment relates to a geiger-mode avalanche photodiode with a high signal-to-noise ratio and to a corresponding manufacturing process.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">As is known, in the technical field of photon detection, the need is felt to have devices that enable detection of electromagnetic radiation with a high sensitivity, and hence that enable detection of even a limited number, of photons associated with the electromagnetic radiation itself.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">For this purpose, the so-called “geiger-mode avalanche photodiodes” (GM-APDs) are known, which theoretically enable detection of individual photons.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">A geiger-mode avalanche photodiode, also known as single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD), is formed by an avalanche photodiode (APD), and hence comprises a junction made of semiconductor material, which has a breakdown voltage V<sub>B </sub>and is biased, in use, with a reverse-biasing voltage V<sub>A </sub>higher in absolute value than the breakdown voltage V<sub>B </sub>of the junction (which, as is known, depends upon the semiconductor material and upon the level of doping of the least doped region of the junction itself), typically higher than 10-20%. In this way, the junction has a particularly extensive depleted region, present in which is a non-negligible electrical field. Hence, the generation of a single electron-hole pair, caused by absorption within the depleted region of a photon incident on the SPAD within the depleted region, may be sufficient to trigger an ionization process. The ionization process in turn causes an avalanche multiplication of the carriers, with gains in the region of 10<sup>6</sup>, and consequent generation in short times (hundreds of picoseconds) of the so-called avalanche current, or more precisely of a pulse of the avalanche current.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">The avalanche current may be appropriately collected, typically by means of external circuitry coupled to the junction, for example by appropriate anode and cathode contacts, and represents an output signal of the SPAD, also referred to as “output current”. In practice, in principle, for each photon absorbed, a pulse of the output current of the SPAD is generated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">It is noted that, strictly speaking, present across the junction is an effective voltage V<sub>e</sub>, which coincides with the reverse-biasing voltage V<sub>A </sub>only in the absence of photons. In fact, in the presence of photons, and hence of current generated within the SPAD, the effective voltage V<sub>e </sub>across the junction is less, in absolute value, than the reverse-biasing voltage V<sub>A</sub>. However, in the present document it is assumed, except where otherwise explicitly stated, that the effective voltage V<sub>e </sub>across the junction coincides with the reverse-biasing voltage V<sub>A</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">It is likewise noted that, upon generation of the output current, or rather of corresponding pulses of the output current, there may concur not only both of the carriers of each electron-hole pair that has been generated following absorption of a photon within the depleted region, but also, given the reverse biasing of the junction, the minority carriers of the electron-hole pairs that have been generated following absorption of a photon outside the depleted region, hence in a quasi-neutral region, i.e., with a substantially zero electrical field. For example, assuming a junction of a PN type with the P region set, with respect to the direction of propagation of the photons, upstream of the N region, both the electrons of the electron-hole pairs generated in the non-depleted portion of the P region of the junction (also known as “dead layer”) and the holes of the electron-hole pairs generated in the non-depleted portion of the N region of the junction (generally known as “epilayer”) may contribute to the output current.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">In particular, the aforementioned minority carriers may cause generation of corresponding output current pulses in the case where they manage to diffuse as far as the depleted region before recombining.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">However, even though they may also contribute to photon detection, the minority carriers of the electron-hole pairs that have been generated outside the depleted region typically require, in order to be able to reach the depleted region, diffusion times ranging (according to the generation point and the level of doping) between hundreds of picoseconds and tens of nanoseconds; therefore, they may hence be collected at the anode and cathode terminals with considerable delays. In this way, a deterioration of the performance of the SPADs may occur, in terms of rapidity in generation of an output current pulse following absorption of a photon, i.e., in terms of the so-called response time (timing) of the SPAD. In particular, the generation, in the output current, of so-called “diffusion tails” may occur.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">That the reverse-biasing voltage V<sub>A </sub>is appreciably higher than the breakdown voltage V<sub>B </sub>causes the avalanche-ionization process, once triggered, to be self-sustaining. Consequently, once triggered, the SPAD is no longer able to detect photons, with the result that, in the absence of appropriate remedies, the SPADs described manage to detect arrival of a first photon, but not arrival of subsequent photons.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">In order to be able also to detect these subsequent photons, it is necessary to quench the avalanche current generated within the SPAD, stopping the avalanche-ionization process, and in particular lowering, for a period of time known as “hold-off time”, the effective voltage V<sub>e </sub>across the junction, so as to inhibit the ionization process and quench the avalanche current, as described hereinafter. Next, the initial conditions of biasing of the junction are restored, in such a way that the SPAD is again able to detect photons. In order to reduce the effective voltage V<sub>e </sub>across the junction after absorption of a photon, SPADs may adopt so-called “quenching circuits”, either of an active or passive type. In particular, in the case of quenching circuits of a passive type, it is common to use quenching resistors, as described for example in United States Patent Applications Publication Nos.: US2010/0271108 and US2010/0148040, which are incorporated by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">As is known, the gain and probability of detecting a photon, i.e., the sensitivity of the SPAD, are directly proportional to the value of the reverse-biasing voltage V<sub>A </sub>applied to the SPAD. In fact, the more the reverse-biasing voltage V<sub>A </sub>exceeds, in absolute value, the breakdown voltage V<sub>B</sub>, the higher the probability of occurrence of an avalanche generation of charge carriers, given that it entails a widening of the depleted region and of the electrical field present therein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">However, high reverse biasing voltages V<sub>A </sub>are such that, even in the absence of incident photons (a dark condition), a single charge carrier, generated, for example, by transfer of thermal energy, may be sufficient to trigger the avalanche-ionization process, generating a so-called “dark current”, which may adversely interfere with normal use of the SPAD.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">In particular, the generation of dark current may occur not only in the case where the aforementioned thermally generated carrier is generated within the depleted region, but also in the case where this thermally generated carrier is generated outside the depleted region and manages in any case to diffuse until it reaches the depleted region before recombining. In particular, given the reverse biasing of the junction of the SPAD, in addition to all the carriers generated thermally in the depleted region of the junction, also the minority carriers generated thermally outside the depleted region may contribute to the dark current, these latter minority carriers only in the aforesaid case where they manage to diffuse as far as the depleted region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">In practice, each of the aforementioned thermally generated minority carriers may generate a corresponding output current pulse, to which there does not correspond an effective detection of a photon. Under dark conditions, these output current pulses have a Poisson statistic, and the corresponding statistical mean value is known as “dark count rate” or “dark-noise rate”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">From a quantitative standpoint, the performance of a generic SPAD is quantified through the so-called quantum-detection efficiency (QDE), which is defined as the ratio between a first number of photons detected equal to the difference between the mean number of photons detected per unit time and the mean dark noise rate in said unit time, and a second number equal to the mean number of photons that effectively impinge on the SPAD in said unit time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">In greater detail, the quantum-detection efficiency QDE is equal to the product of a photon-absorption efficiency n and of an avalanche-triggering probability, the latter being defined as the probability of an electron-hole pair generated in the depletion region effectively triggering a self-sustaining avalanche-ionization process; in particular, this probability is not equal to unity, because there is a non-negligible probability of the carriers of the pair losing energy on account of lattice scattering, thus recombining in such a way that the avalanche-ionization process aborts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">As regards the photon-absorption efficiency η, to a first approximation (neglecting the contributions of the aforementioned minority carriers) it is given by
<br/>
η=(1−<i>R</i>)·<i>e</i> <sup>−αD</sup>·(1−<i>e</i> <sup>−αW</sup>)  (1)
<br/>
where: α is a coefficient of absorption of the photons by the semiconductor that forms the generic SPAD, and is inversely proportional to the wavelength of the photons; R is a power-reflection coefficient of an air-semiconductor interface or else an air-dielectric interface in the case where the photons, before impinging on the junction, impinge on one or more anti-reflection dielectric layers; W is the thickness of the depleted region; and D is the thickness of the non-depleted portion of the region of the junction that is located upstream with respect to the direction of propagation of the photons (in practice, the dead layer, i.e., the portion of semiconductor that the photons traverse before reaching the depleted region).
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">In order to improve the performance of SPADs, and in particular in order to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio, i.e., the ratio between an effective output current, which derives just from the absorption of photons, and the dark current, it is hence expedient to limit as much as possible the lattice defectiveness of the SPADs themselves. In fact, the main contribution to the dark count rate is given by the so-called phenomenon of Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) generation through the so-called generation-recombination (G-R) centers, which are located within the forbidden band of the semiconductor material that forms the junction of the SPAD and are caused by lattice imperfections. By reducing the dark count rate, the duration of the so-called quiescence interval, i.e., the mean time interval that elapses between two successive output current pulses (in conditions of dark), increases. Given that, during the quiescence interval, it is possible to detect correctly arrival of the photons, the lower the dark count rate, the higher the probability of absorbing photons and of triggering the avalanche-ionization process, thus improving the overall performance of the SPADs in terms of signal-to-noise ratio. In this connection, given the same dark count rate, the signal-to-noise ratio may, be improved by increasing the quantum-detection efficiency QDE.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">Traditionally, the junctions of SPADs of a known type are formed by means of direct ion-implantation processes, which entail the inevitable introduction of lattice imperfections, notwithstanding the execution of subsequent thermal treatments for the annealing of the defects and deactivation of the impurities.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition, principally on account of the aforementioned thermal treatments, the SPADs have respective junctions such that the corresponding dead layers have non-negligible thicknesses (up to a few hundreds of nanometers), with consequent decrease in the quantum-detection efficiency QDE, and hence decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio, in particular as regards highly energetic photons (for example, photons in the so-called “blue-near ultraviolet”). Again, the presence of dead layers with non-negligible thicknesses entails non-negligible dark currents, as well as possible deterioration in the performance in terms of response times, on account of the generation of diffusion tails.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">Similar considerations may be made for the so-called SPAD arrays, and in particular for the so-called “silicon photomultipliers” (SiPMs), used to improve the performance that may be obtained with individual SPADs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">In detail, an SiPM is a particular SPAD array, formed by an array of SPADs grown on one and the same substrate and provided with respective quenching resistors (for example, of a vertical type) integrated in the SPADs, these quenching resistors being uncoupled and independent of one another. In addition, the anode and cathode contacts of each SPAD are configured so that they may be coupled to a single voltage generator. Consequently, the SPADs of the SiPM may be biased at one and the same reverse-biasing′ voltage V<sub>A</sub>; in addition, the avalanche currents generated inside them are multiplexed together so as to generate an output signal of the SiPM equal to the summation of the output signals of the SPADs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">In practice, the SiPM is a device with a wide area and high gain, capable of supplying, on average, an electrical output signal (current) proportional to the number of photons that impinge on the SiPM; however, SiPMs may present the same drawbacks as do the SPADs that compose them.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an embodiment of a geiger-mode avalanche photodiode <b>1</b>. The photodiode <b>1</b> may belong, for example, to an array <b>220</b> of photodiodes <b>1</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, which also shows an external light source <b>200</b>, which may be constituted, for example, by a scintillator, as described hereinafter. The array <b>220</b> may comprise any number of photodiodes <b>1</b>, according to the application.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the photodiode <b>1</b> is integrated in a chip <b>100</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), which includes a substrate <b>2</b> made of semiconductor material, of a P++ type (for example doped with boron), having a bottom surface <b>2</b> <i>a </i>and a first thickness h<sub>2 </sub>ranging, for example, between approximately 300 microns (μm) and 500 μm. In addition, the photodiode <b>1</b> includes a first epitaxial layer <b>4</b>, of an N+ type (for example, doped with phosphorus), having a thickness h<sub>4 </sub>ranging, for example, between approximately 8 μm and 12 μm, and overlying the substrate <b>2</b>, in direct contact therewith; and a second epitaxial layer <b>6</b>, of an N− type, having a top surface <b>6</b> <i>a </i>and a thickness h<sub>6 </sub>ranging, for example, approximately between 3 μm and 5 μm, and overlying the first epitaxial layer <b>4</b>, in direct contact therewith.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">In greater detail, the substrate <b>2</b> may have a respective level of doping in the range between approximately 10<sup>19 </sup>cm<sup>−3 </sup>and 10<sup>20 </sup>cm<sup>−3</sup>, in such a way as to define a good bottom ohmic contact. The first epitaxial layer <b>4</b> may have a respective level of doping in the range between approximately 10<sup>16 </sup>cm<sup>−3 </sup>and 5·10<sup>16 </sup>cm<sup>−3</sup>. The second epitaxial layer <b>6</b> may have, instead, a respective level of doping in the range between approximately 1·10<sup>14 </sup>cm<sup>−3 </sup>and 3·10<sup>14 </sup>cm<sup>−3</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">The substrate <b>2</b>, and the first and the second epitaxial layers <b>4</b>, <b>6</b> form, in practice, a body <b>8</b> of semiconductor material, comprised between the bottom surface <b>2</b> <i>a </i>and the top surface <b>6</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">A top anode region <b>10</b>, of a P+ type (for example, doped with boron) and with a level of doping, for example, of approximately 2·10<sup>17 </sup>cm<sup>−3</sup>, faces the top surface <b>6</b> <i>a </i>and extends within the second epitaxial layer <b>6</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in greater detail and by way of example in the plan view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the top anode region <b>10</b> may comprise an external ring <b>12</b> with a rectangular shape and a thickness s. The external ring <b>12</b> may, in any case, have different shapes, such as, for example, a circular or polygonal shape; in addition, the external ring <b>12</b> may not necessarily have a closed shape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">In addition, the top anode region <b>10</b> comprises a plurality of strip regions <b>14</b> arranged, in top plan view, within the external ring <b>12</b>, to which they are ohmically coupled. The strip regions <b>14</b> and the external ring <b>12</b> extend within the second epitaxial layer <b>6</b> starting from the top surface <b>6</b> <i>a</i>, with a depth d<sub>r </sub>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) that may be between approximately 0.15 μm and 0.3 μm, for example approximately 0.2 μm. Pairs of adjacent strip regions <b>14</b> are separated by a respective gap <b>16</b>, which extends in the second epitaxial layer <b>6</b> starting from the top surface <b>6</b> <i>a</i>, with approximately the same depth as the strip regions <b>14</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown by way of example in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the strip regions <b>14</b>, and, consequently, also the gaps <b>16</b>, may have a shape, in top plan view, of a rectangle, with the strip regions each having a width of approximately d<sub>s </sub>(measured along the axis x of the reference system xyz shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>) of, for example, approximately 1 μm. In addition, the strip regions <b>14</b> may be the same as one another and parallel to one another; it is likewise possible that present between pairs of adjacent strip regions <b>14</b> are gaps <b>16</b> that are the same as one another.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">By way of example, and with particular reference to an embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, it may be possible for all the gaps <b>16</b> to have a rectangular shape, in top plan view, and a width of approximately d<sub>i </sub>that may be in the range between approximately 2.5 μm and 3.5 μm; for example, the width may be approximately 3 μm. It may be moreover possible to define a first gap <b>16</b> <i>a </i>and a second gap <b>16</b> <i>b</i>, which, strictly speaking, do not separate pairs of adjacent strip regions <b>14</b>, but rather separate from the external ring <b>12</b>, respectively, a first strip region <b>14</b> <i>a </i>and a second strip region <b>14</b> <i>b</i>, these first and second strip regions <b>14</b> <i>a</i>, <b>14</b> <i>b </i>being, among all the strip regions <b>14</b>, the strip regions closest, respectively, to a first side and a second side of the external ring <b>12</b>, which are opposite to one another and approximately parallel to the strip regions <b>14</b> themselves. Also the first and second gaps <b>16</b> <i>a</i>, <b>16</b> <i>b </i>may have a width of approximately d<sub>i</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">Similar considerations may be made in the case where the external ring <b>12</b> has, for example, a circular shape, in top plan view, in which case both the strip regions <b>14</b> and the gaps <b>16</b> may have the shape, in top plan view, of circular segments with two bases (e.g., two sides not coincident with the perimeter of the circle), whilst the first and second gaps may have the shape of a circular segment with one base (e.g., one side not coincident with the perimeter of the circle). Also in this case, as likewise in the case where, in general, the shape of the top anode region <b>10</b> is not regular, it may be, however, possible to define a maximum width d<sub>max</sub>, which indicates the maximum width, in absolute value, among the maximum widths of all the gaps <b>16</b> present within the top anode region <b>10</b>. An enriched anode-contact region <b>18</b>, of a P++ type (for example doped with boron), extends in the second epitaxial layer <b>6</b>, underneath, and in direct contact with, the external ring <b>12</b> of the top anode region <b>10</b>. For example, the enriched anode-contact region <b>18</b> may have approximately the same shape as the external ring <b>12</b> of the top anode region <b>10</b>, and may have a peak level of doping approximately equal to 5·10<sup>18 </sup>cm<sup>−3</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">An enriched region <b>20</b>, of an N type (for example, doped with phosphorus), extends in the second epitaxial layer <b>6</b>, underneath, and in direct contact with, the top anode region <b>10</b>. In top plan view, the enriched region <b>20</b> has a circular or polygonal shape, for example approximately equal to the shape of the external ring <b>12</b> of the top anode region <b>10</b>, inside which it is comprised (in top plan view). In greater detail, the enriched anode-contact region <b>18</b> extends in the second epitaxial layer <b>6</b> externally and contiguous to the enriched region <b>20</b>. In addition, at the gaps <b>16</b>, the enriched region <b>20</b> extends in the second epitaxial layer <b>6</b> directly starting from the top surface <b>6</b> <i>a</i>, hence filling the gaps <b>16</b> themselves. Again, the enriched region <b>20</b> may have a peak level of doping approximately equal to 4·10<sup>15 </sup>cm<sup>−3</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">For practical purposes, the top anode region <b>10</b> and the enriched anode-contact region <b>18</b> form an anode region of a first PN junction, which is designed to receive photons and to generate the avalanche current, as described hereinafter. In addition, this anode region is in electrical contact with an anode metallization <b>22</b>, by means of which it may be possible to bias the first PN junction; in particular, it may be possible to couple the anode metallization <b>22</b> to an external junction biasing circuit (not shown), as described hereinafter. By way of clarification, in use, the photons impinge upon the photodiode <b>1</b> with a direction opposite to the direction of the unit vector z shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in such a way that, with respect to the direction of propagation of the photons, the top surface <b>6</b> <i>a </i>is upstream of the bottom surface <b>2</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">A guard ring <b>24</b> of a circular or polygonal shape, of a P− type (for example, doped with boron), extends in the second epitaxial layer <b>6</b>, externally and contiguous to the enriched region <b>20</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">During the drive-in process, further processes of diffusion occur, such that the thicknesses of the first, second, third, and fourth thin layers <b>26</b>′, <b>20</b>′, <b>24</b>′ and <b>18</b>′ increase.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the patterned layer <b>110</b> is removed, by means of a dry etch with end point on the third protective-oxide layer <b>98</b>. Then, also the third protective-oxide layer <b>98</b> and the third bottom dielectric layer <b>99</b> are removed, by means of a timed wet etch. Next, the second dielectric layer <b>42</b> and the coating layer <b>44</b> are deposited, thus forming the anti-reflection coating <b>46</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">In order to provide the lateral insulation region <b>30</b>, a trench <b>120</b> is then formed (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>) having the same shape and dimensions as the lateral insulation region <b>30</b>, which are formed subsequently. In detail, the trench <b>120</b> may be provided by means of a photolithographic and dry-etching process, and using a sixth resist mask <b>122</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">Next (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>), the thin coating layer <b>36</b> is grown within the trench <b>120</b>, for example with a thermal process at approximately 900° C. and with the duration of approximately ten minutes. During this thermal process, the sinker region <b>26</b>, the enriched region <b>20</b>, the guard ring <b>24</b>, the enriched anode-contact region <b>18</b>, and the top anode region <b>10</b> are respectively obtained starting from the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth thin layers <b>26</b>′, <b>20</b>′, <b>24</b>′, <b>18</b>′ and <b>10</b>′, without however this thermal process altering appreciably the thicknesses of the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth thin layers <b>26</b>′, <b>20</b>′, <b>24</b>′, <b>18</b>′ and <b>10</b>′. A dielectric layer is then deposited, for example by means of a CVD technique, which forms both the third dielectric layer <b>48</b> and the thick coating layer <b>38</b>. In practice, the thin coating layer <b>36</b> coats only the internal edges and the bottom of the trench <b>120</b>, because the thermal oxide cannot grow above the coating layer <b>44</b>, which is made of silicon nitride (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>). Consequently, on the top surface <b>6</b> <i>a</i>, in addition to the aforesaid first and second dielectric layers <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, and to the coating layer <b>44</b>, only the third dielectric layer <b>48</b> is added. In addition, during the growth of the thin coating layer <b>36</b>, underneath the bottom surface <b>2</b> <i>a </i>a fourth bottom dielectric layer <b>124</b> is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the trench <b>120</b> is completely filled, via deposition by means of the CVD technique, with metal, for example tungsten, to form the metal region <b>34</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, after deposition of the metal, an etch is carried out, for example a dry etch, in order to remove the portion of metal deposited on top of the top surface <b>6</b> <i>a</i>. Next, the fourth dielectric layer <b>50</b>, for example made of TEOS oxide, is deposited so as to insulate the metal region <b>34</b> electrically.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">Next, a first window <b>130</b> and a second window <b>132</b> are formed, in view of formation of the cathode metallization <b>28</b> and anode metallization <b>22</b>. In particular, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, by means of a photolithographic and dry-etching process portions of the third and fourth dielectric layers <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> set above the active area <b>70</b> are selectively removed, leaving exposed the region of the double anti-reflection coating <b>46</b>, which, in use, enables passage of incident photons on the photodiode <b>1</b> towards the top anode region <b>10</b> and the enriched region <b>20</b>. In addition, portions of the third and fourth dielectric layers <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> set above the sinker region <b>26</b> are removed, i.e., where the first window <b>130</b> is to be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, a further photolithographic process is carried out, followed by a dry etch with end point on the second dielectric layer <b>42</b>, for removing the coating layer <b>44</b> in an area corresponding to the enriched anode-contact region <b>18</b> and the sinker region <b>26</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">Finally, a further wet-etching process is carried out for removing the second dielectric layer <b>42</b> in an area corresponding to the enriched anode-contact region <b>18</b> and to the sinker region <b>26</b>, thus forming, respectively, the second and first windows <b>132</b>, <b>130</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">In this way, in an area corresponding to the first and second windows <b>130</b>, <b>132</b>, the top surface <b>6</b> <i>a </i>is exposed, i.e., is not overlaid by any layer from among the coating layer <b>44</b>, and the first, second, third, and fourth dielectric layers <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>. Amongst other things, the wet etch also brings about removal of the fourth bottom dielectric layer <b>124</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">Next (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>), a step is carried out of deposition by means of the sputtering technique of a top metal layer (not shown), made for example of a ternary alloy of aluminium, silicon and copper, and having a thickness comprised, for example, between approximately 1 μm and 3 μm. A subsequent photolithographic process and process of wet etching of the top metal layer enables formation of the cathode metallization <b>28</b> and anode metallization <b>22</b>, respectively in an area corresponding to the first and second windows <b>130</b>, <b>132</b>. Next, on the bottom surface <b>2</b> <i>a </i>of the substrate <b>2</b>, using the sputtering technique, the first, second, and third bottom metal layers <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> are deposited in succession.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">Finally, a process of sintering at a low temperature and in an hydrogen-based environment is carried out in order to passivate possible dangling bonds at the interface between oxide regions and silicon regions, so as to reduce the Schockley-Read-Hall recombination rate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">The array <b>220</b> of photodiodes <b>1</b> may be used in a generic system <b>500</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, in which a power supply <b>510</b> supplies at least one array <b>220</b> of photodiodes <b>1</b> and at least one microcontroller <b>520</b> coupled to the array <b>220</b>. The microcontroller <b>520</b> processes the output signal of the array <b>220</b> of photodiodes <b>1</b>, and supplies a processed signal to a processor <b>320</b>, which enables analysis of the processed signal and display of the information associated with the processed signal on a screen <b>330</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">By way of example, the array <b>220</b> of photodiodes <b>1</b> may be used in the field of positron-emission tomography (PET), in which gamma rays are detected by using so-called scintillators, such as for example lutelium-orthosilicate (LSO) scintillators or lutelium-yttrium-orthosilicate (LYSO) scintillators. With reference, by way of example, to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the external light source <b>200</b> may be formed by one of these LSO or LYSO scintillators, which receive gamma rays and emit, in response to the gamma rays, photons in the blue and in the near ultraviolet. In this way, the photons generated by the scintillators may be effectively detected by the array <b>220</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">Possible advantages that an embodiment of a geiger-mode photodiode affords emerge clearly from the foregoing description. In particular, an embodiment of the photodiode presents simultaneously a low defectiveness and a dead layer with a thickness substantially smaller than that of SPADs of a traditional type.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">In greater detail, the substantial absence of the dead layer entails an increase in the quantum-detection efficiency QDE, in particular as regards highly energetic photons, which have higher probability of being absorbed in the proximity of the top surface of the SPAD, and hence within a hypothetical dead layer, with the risk that they do not trigger effectively corresponding avalanche-ionization processes, or else that they trigger them, but with long response times. In addition, the substantial absence of the dead layer reduces the possibility of minority carriers generated therein from contributing to the dark current.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">Even though all the types of doping may be reversed with respect to what has been described, embodiments described may be advantageous in the case of highly energetic photons, because the minority carriers that are generated following absorption of photons in the non-depleted portions of the top anode region <b>10</b> and that, once they have reached the depletion region, may trigger an avalanche-ionization process, are electrons and not holes. Consequently, given that the electrons, as compared to holes, have a higher impact-ionization rate and a lower recombination rate in the non-depleted portions of the top anode region <b>10</b>, the avalanche-triggering probability, and hence the quantum-detection efficiency QDE, are particularly high.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">In addition, the substantial absence of the dead layer and the presence of the bottom metallization may entail a reduction in the rate of thermal generation of minority carriers in regions set underneath the depleted region of the first PN junction, and hence a reduction in the dark current. In addition, for the same reason, a reduction of the diffusion tails may occur, thus improving the response times of the photodiode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">Finally, it is evident that modifications and variations may be made to an embodiment of a photodiode and to an embodiment of a process described above, without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">In particular, it may be possible for the photodiode to have a resistive layer, for example made of polysilicon, set between the coating layer <b>44</b> and the third dielectric layer <b>48</b>. The resistive layer may be appropriately doped and patterned, for example by means of a respective photolithographic and etching process, in such a way that it performs the electrical function of quenching resistor. Instead of the polysilicon, it likewise may be possible to use another material provided with an appropriate conductivity and an energy bandgap that is wider than that of the semiconductor that forms the body of the photodiode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">By way of example, the aforementioned resistive layer may be deposited, and subsequently patterned, between the steps described and shown respectively in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>. In addition, in, this case, the thermal budget used during the step of growth of the thin coating layer <b>36</b> may enable, simultaneously, activation of the impurities present in the resistive layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">It moreover may be possible for the body <b>8</b>, the anode region (top anode region <b>10</b> and enriched anode-contact region <b>18</b>), the guard ring <b>24</b>, and the enriched region <b>20</b> to be of an opposite type with respect to the one described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">Moreover possible may be embodiments without the second epitaxial layer <b>6</b> and/or the guard ring <b>24</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">In addition, embodiments may be possible without the enriched region <b>20</b> and/or the lateral insulation region <b>30</b>. Again, the channel-stopper region <b>32</b> may be formed by a single layer of insulating material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">Finally, instead of the strip regions <b>14</b>, the top anode region <b>10</b> may comprise regions or isles of a different shape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">From the foregoing it will be appreciated that, although specific embodiments have been described herein for purposes of illustration, various modifications may be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the disclosure. Furthermore, where an alternative is disclosed for a particular embodiment, this alternative may also apply to other embodiments even if not specifically stated.</div>
