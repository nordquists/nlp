<heading id="h-0006">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">Embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. The present invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, the embodiments are provided so that disclosure of the present invention will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the present invention to those skilled in the art. The principles and features of this invention may be employed in varied and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the present invention. In the drawings, the relative sizes of layers and regions may be exaggerated for clarity. The drawings are not to scale. Unless otherwise indicated, like reference numerals designate like elements throughout the drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">As used herein, the phrase “patterning process” or “patterned element” (where the “element” can be a particular layer, region, or element) means forming a predetermined pattern of the layer, region or element. Such a predetermined pattern can be obtained, for example, by using any combination of the following steps: at least one deposition step; at least one photomasking step; at least one etching step; and/or at least one photomask removing step. Two examples of a patterning process include the following combination of steps: (i) a deposition step, then a photomasking step, then an etching step, and then a photomask removing step; or (ii) a photomasking step, then a deposition step, and then a photomask removing step. In another example, the phrase “deposition and patterning” means a patterning process including at least a deposition step, a photomasking step, an etching step, and a photomask removing step. Multiple masking, deposition, and/or etching steps can be used to obtain the desired pattern of the particular layer, region, or element. Nonlimiting examples of deposition methods include PVD, CVD (including ALD), plating (e.g., electroplating and electroless plating), and coating (e.g., spin coating and spray coating).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">As used herein, the term “luminous” means light emitting. For example, the phrase luminous device means a light emitting device. Nonlimiting examples of luminous devices include a light emitting diode (“LED”) and a laser. Although all of the embodiments herein are described in view of an LED, all of the embodiments can be converted to a laser, e.g., an LED having a reflective first electrode and a semi-transparent mirror layer (also known as an output coupler) to the light emitting surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">As used herein, when an element or layer is referred to as being “on,” “connected to” and/or “coupled to” another element or layer, the element or layer may be directly on, connected and/or coupled to the other element or layer or intervening elements or layers may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being “directly on,” “directly connected to” and/or “directly coupled to” another element or layer, no intervening elements or layers are present. As used herein, the term “and/or” may include any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">Furthermore, although the terms first, second, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms may be used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer and/or section from another element, component, region, layer and/or section. For example, a first element, component, region, layer and/or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer and/or section without departing from the teachings of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">Spatially relative terms, such as “beneath,” “below,” “lower,” “above,” “upper” and the like may be used to describe an element and/or feature's relationship to another element(s) and/or feature(s) as, for example, illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use and/or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">The embodiments provided hereinafter generally provide luminous devices having a conductive substrate.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">One embodiment of the present invention is directed to a method of manufacturing a vertical-type luminous device using high throughput processes. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1H</figref> are cross-sectional views illustrating the method for a single luminous device.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">The method can utilize a pre-formed, multilayered, light-emitting heterostructure, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. The preformed heterostructure can be obtained according to desired specifications or manufactured. Examples of useful manufacturing processes for the heterostructures can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,777,350 issued to Nakmura et al. and titled “Nitride Semiconductor Light-Emitting Device,” U.S. Pat.

The preformed heterostructure typically includes at least a first substrate <b>100</b>, a first cladding layer <b>112</b> <i>a</i>, an active layer <b>114</b> <i>a</i>, and a second cladding layer <b>116</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">The first substrate <b>100</b> is typically a dielectric or a semiconductor. Examples of useful materials for the first substrate <b>100</b> include, but are not limited to, sapphire (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), ZnO, Si, SiC, GaAs, GaP, mixtures thereof, and alloys thereof. It is preferred to utilize a substrate that is a good lattice match with the first cladding layer <b>112</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">The first cladding layer <b>112</b> <i>a</i>, the second cladding layer <b>116</b> <i>a</i>, and the active layer <b>114</b> <i>a </i>typically include a form of GaN or InGaN, which can be expressed by the chemical formula In<sub>x</sub>Al<sub>y</sub>Ga<sub>(1-x-y)</sub>N, where 0≦x≦1 and 0≦y≦1. Accordingly, useful materials include, but are not limited to, AlGaN and InGaN. Other useful materials are illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. The cladding layers and the active layer can also be doped with various materials. For example, the first cladding layer <b>112</b> <i>a </i>can be a Si doped n-type InGaN and the second cladding layer <b>116</b> <i>a </i>can be a Mg doped p-type InGaN. Furthermore, the first cladding layer <b>112</b> <i>a </i>and the second cladding layer <b>116</b> <i>a </i>typically have opposite conductive types, and the conductivity types of the layers can be switched. For example, if the first cladding layer is n-type, the second cladding layer is p-type, and vice versa. For purposes of this embodiment, the first cladding layer <b>112</b> <i>a </i>will be designated as n-type and the second cladding layer <b>116</b> <i>a </i>will be designated as p-type.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">The active layer <b>114</b> <i>a </i>produces light by recombining an electron and a hole in a p-n junction. The frequency (or wavelength) of light emitted, and, therefore, its color, depends on the band gap energy of the materials forming the p-n junction and can be infrared, visible, or ultraviolet. The active layer includes at least one potential well and potential barrier, which form a Single Quantum Well. The active layer can also include a plurality of quantum wells to provide a Multiple Quantum Well. Light emitting characteristics can be adjusted by doping the potential barrier with a compound selected from the group consisting of B, Al, P, Si, Mg, Zn, Mn, Se, or a combination thereof. Preferred doping materials include Al, Si, or a combination thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">The first cladding layer <b>112</b> <i>a</i>, the active layer <b>114</b> <i>a</i>, and the second cladding layer <b>116</b> <i>a </i>can be sequentially formed on the first substrate <b>100</b> by any process known to the skilled artisan. For example, these layers can be formed on the substrate by MOCVD (metal organic chemical vapor deposition), liquid phase epitaxial growth, hydride vapor phase epitaxial growth, molecular beam epitaxial growth and/or metal organic vapor phase epitaxial growth. Thereafter, a heat treatment process can be performed to activate the p-type cladding layer. Typical heat treatment temperatures are at about 400° C. to about 800° C. For example, if the second cladding layer <b>116</b> <i>a </i>is In<sub>x</sub>Al<sub>y</sub>Ga<sub>(1-x-y)</sub>N doped with Mg, it is believed that the hydrogen associated with the Mg can be removed to provide better p-type characteristics. The resulting heterojunction (e.g., the p-n junctions regions formed by the first and second cladding layers in or near the active layer) provides for high injection efficiency at room temperature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">The multilayered, light-emitting hetero structure, illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, is subjected to a patterning process to form a luminous structure <b>110</b> having at least on side wall <b>113</b> and a top surface <b>115</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. The patterning process can include one or more masking and etching steps. It is preferable to pattern the luminous structure to have a shape which increases light emitting efficiency, e.g., by improving (i) internal reflections of photons, (ii) the escape angle/path of the photons after reflectance, or (iii) both. For example, at least one side wall surface <b>113</b> of the luminous structure illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is angled to improve light reflectance and emission. In particular, it is preferred to form an angle α between an imaginary line coinciding with the top surface <b>115</b> and the side wall surface <b>113</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, such that the surface area of the top surface <b>115</b> is less than the surface area of the active layer <b>114</b>. The angle α is preferably greater than about 30° but less than or equal to 90°, and more preferably between about 40° to about 70°. The angle α can be constant or vary continuously to form either partially or wholly concave or convex sidewall shapes. Further nonlimiting examples of patterned shapes for the luminous structure <b>110</b> include an inverted parabola, an inverted truncated parabola, a frustum of a cone (i.e., truncated cone), a frustum of a pyramid (i.e., truncated pyramid), and a combination thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">After forming the luminous structure, an insulating layer <b>120</b> (e.g., to provide electrical insulation) is formed on the luminous structure <b>110</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>. The insulating layer <b>120</b> can be conformally formed on the luminous structure <b>110</b> so as to prevent electrical shorts between the p-type and n-type regions via the first electrode <b>140</b>, described hereinafter. The insulating layer <b>120</b> is also believed to provide additional structural support for the luminous structure <b>110</b>. Insulating layer <b>120</b> is also preferably thermally conductive (e.g., by choice of materials or by utilizing a very thin layer) so that heat can be transferred to the first electrode layer <b>140</b> and away from the luminous structure <b>110</b>. The insulating layer is also preferably transparent, e.g., translucent enough to allow light to pass through it and be reflected by the later formed first electrode, described hereinafter. The transparency of the material used in the insulating layer will also depend on the thickness of the layer, e.g., a thinner layer will be more transparent, and the wavelength of the emitted light. Accordingly, the thickness of the insulating layer <b>120</b> is preferably from about 10 Å to about 1 μm, and more preferably from about 1000 Å to about 3000 Å, and wherein the thickness can be constant or vary depending on manufacturing processes and variations therein. It should be noted that step coverage of the inclined sidewall surface <b>113</b>. Useful materials for the insulating layer include, but are not limited to, SiO<sub>2</sub>, SiN<sub>x</sub>, ZnO, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, AlN, and combination thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">The insulating layer <b>120</b> can be formed by any method known in the art. In one example, the insulating layer <b>120</b> can be formed in a two step process. The first insulating layer, such as SiO<sub>2</sub>, can be utilized to as a gap filler. Then a second insulating layer having a higher etch selectivity than the first insulating layer can be formed on the first insulating layer. Thereafter, a patterning and etch process can be utilized to form a desired thickness and shape of the insulating layer <b>120</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">Alternatively, the insulating layer <b>120</b> can be formed in any manner to prevent electrical shorts between the p-type and n-type regions via the first electrode <b>140</b>, discussed hereinafter. For example, in an alternative embodiment, the insulating layer <b>120</b> can be formed to cover only the first cladding layer <b>112</b> and the exposed side surfaces of active layer <b>114</b>, e.g., by forming a patterned insulating layer. In still another alternative embodiment, the insulating layer <b>120</b> can be formed to cover only the portions on which the later formed first electrode will be formed. For example, a patterned insulating layer <b>120</b> can be formed only on the second cladding layer <b>116</b> and the exposed side surfaces of the active layer <b>114</b>, when a patterned first electrode <b>140</b> is formed on the patterned insulating layer. In still another alternative, the process step of forming the insulating layer can be skipped, if a patterned first electrode <b>140</b> (described hereinafter) is formed only on the second cladding layer <b>115</b>. In this embodiment, electrical shorts are prevented because the first electrode <b>140</b> does not contact either the active layer <b>114</b> or the first cladding layer. In this embodiment, the patterned first electrode <b>140</b> can be formed utilizing a photomask on the formed luminous structure <b>110</b> and then plating the first electrode <b>140</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">The insulation layer is formed to include at least one recess <b>121</b>, e.g., by a patterning process, to expose a portion of the surface of the second cladding layer <b>116</b>, thereby allowing electrical communication between the second cladding layer <b>116</b> and the later formed first electrode <b>140</b>, described hereinafter. Although <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> only illustrates one recess <b>121</b>, more than one recess can be formed, and the recess can have a variety of geometric shapes, e.g., a ring. Lastly, the recess <b>121</b> can be formed anywhere along the top surface <b>115</b> of luminous structure <b>110</b>, along the one or more sidewall surfaces <b>113</b> of the luminous structure <b>110</b> down to the active layer <b>114</b>, or any combination thereof. Increasing the available surface area for electrical communication between the second cladding layer <b>116</b> and the later formed first electrode <b>140</b> can be beneficial.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">The insulating layer is preferably transparent, e.g., translucent enough to allow light to pass through it and be reflected by the later formed first electrode, described hereinafter.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">After forming the insulating layer, a first electrode layer <b>140</b> is formed over the insulating layer <b>120</b> and in the recess <b>121</b> of the insulating layer, as partially illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>. It is believed that, since the first electrode layer <b>140</b> can be in thermal communication with the second cladding layer surface <b>115</b> and at least a portion of at least one side wall surface <b>113</b> of the luminous structure <b>110</b>, the first electrode layer <b>140</b> can provide improved conduction of heat away from the luminous structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">Alternatively, when the insulating layer <b>120</b> is formed in a manner to prevent electrical shorts between the p-type and n-type regions via the first electrode <b>140</b>, the first electrode layer <b>140</b> can be formed on the exposed portions of the second cladding layer <b>116</b> of the luminous structure <b>110</b> and optionally also on any portion of the insulating layer <b>120</b>. For example, when a patterned insulating layer <b>120</b> is formed over only the first cladding layer <b>112</b> and the exposed side surfaces of active layer <b>114</b>, the first electrode <b>140</b> can be formed on the second cladding layer <b>115</b> and optionally on any portion of the insulating layer <b>120</b>. Similarly, when a patterned insulating layer is formed only on the second cladding layer <b>116</b> and the exposed side surfaces of the active layer <b>114</b>, then a patterned first electrode <b>140</b> is formed on the patterned insulating layer <b>120</b>, e.g., the first electrode is not formed on the first cladding layer <b>112</b>. These alternative embodiments also improve heat conduction, since the first electrode <b>140</b> is in thermal communication with at least the second cladding layer surface <b>115</b> and at least a portion of the at least one side surface <b>113</b> of the luminous structure <b>110</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">The first electrode layer <b>140</b> can be any electrically conductive material. Nonlimiting examples of useful materials include ITO (Indium-Tin-Oxide), Cu, Ni, Cr, Ag, Al, Au, Ti, Pt, V, W, Mo, mixtures thereof, and alloys thereof. It is preferred, however, to utilize a reflective material for the first electrode layer <b>140</b> in order to reflect light through the insulation layer <b>120</b> and substantially increase the light emitting efficiency. Examples of useful reflective materials include, but are not limited to Ag, Al, Pt or alloys thereof to increase the light emitting efficiency. Accordingly, the continuous first electrode layer <b>140</b> can serve either or both of the following two additional functions: (1) an electrical contact and (ii) a reflector of light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">In an alternative embodiment, an ohmic layer <b>130</b> can be formed within the recess <b>121</b>, e.g., by patterned deposition, before forming the first electrode layer <b>140</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>.

Preferred materials for the ohmic layer include, but are not limited to Zn, Ni, Ag, Ti, W, Pt, ITO, mixtures thereof and alloys thereof. Furthermore, a heat treatment can be performed to activate the ohmic layer. Typically, the heat treatment can be conducted at about 400° C. before forming the first electrode layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">Although not illustrated, additional layers can be added onto the first electrode layer.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">After forming the first electrode layer <b>140</b>, an optional process step includes patterning (e.g., a combination of a masking and etching steps) the areas <b>111</b> separating each luminous structure <b>110</b> to provide separated luminous structures <b>110</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>. Accordingly, in the areas <b>111</b> surrounding the luminous structure <b>110</b>, the first electrode layer <b>140</b>, the insulation layer <b>120</b>, and the first cladding layer <b>112</b> are removed to expose the first substrate <b>100</b>. This patterning step, however, can be omitted or performed at a later time, e.g., after transfer to the second substrate or during separation of the second substrate. If patterning of the areas <b>111</b> around the luminous structure <b>110</b> is conducted after transfer to the second substrate <b>200</b>, the patterning will be conducted on the first cladding layer <b>112</b>, resulting in a local removal of at least the first cladding layer <b>112</b>. If patterning of the areas around the luminous structure <b>110</b> is conducted after transfer to the second substrate <b>200</b>, it is also preferably to further locally remove the insulating layer <b>120</b>, and the first electrode layer <b>140</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">After forming the first electrode layer (assuming the step of patterning the areas around the luminous structure is not conducted), at least a portion of the first electrode layer <b>140</b> (e.g., the outermost portions corresponding to the top surface <b>115</b> of the luminous structure) is bonded to a second substrate <b>200</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>. Any bonding method known in the art can be utilized. Nonlimiting examples of bonding methods include eutectic bonding (e.g., using Au, Sn, Ag, Pb, mixtures thereof, and alloys thereof), soldering, gold-silicon bonding, and adhesive bonding. Also useful are conductive adhesive layers, as described in U.S. Pat.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">The second substrate <b>200</b> is preferably conductive (typically p-type silicon for an n-type first cladding layer) to allow electrical communication with the second cladding layer <b>116</b>, e.g., via the first electrode and optionally the ohmic layer. Useful materials for the second substrate include, but are not limited to, Si, strained Si, Si alloy, Si—Al, SOI (silicon on insulator), SiC, SiGe, SiGeC, Ge, Ge alloy, GaAs, InAs, Group III-V semiconductors, Group II-VI semiconductors, combinations thereof, and alloys thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>, the second substrate <b>200</b> can also include a patterned conductive intermediate layer <b>210</b> to enhance the bond between the second substrate <b>200</b> and the first electrode layer <b>140</b>, e.g., compensate for the warpage in the first substrate and/or the second substrate. The patterned conductive intermediate layer <b>210</b> is formed on second substrate <b>200</b> before bonding the second substrate <b>200</b> to at least a portion of the first electrode layer <b>140</b> (e.g., the outermost portions corresponding to the top surface <b>115</b> of the luminous structure) to the second substrate <b>200</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>. The conductive intermediate layer <b>210</b> is patterned to substantially align and match with the bonding surface (or surfaces) of the first electrode layer <b>140</b>. The intermediate layer <b>210</b> (typically used for eutectic bonding) can have lower reflective characteristics than the first electrode. Useful materials for the intermediate layer <b>210</b> include, but are not limited to, Au, Ag, Pt, Ni, Cu, Sn, Al, Pb, Cr, Ti, W, combinations thereof, and alloys thereof. For example, when Au—Sn is used as the intermediate layer <b>210</b>, bonding can be conducted via a thermal process (e.g., at about 200° C. to about 400° C.) and optionally utilize pressure. Furthermore, the intermediate layer can be a single layer or multiple layers, e.g., each layer having a different material or alloy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">Another optional additional process step is thinning the second conductive substrate <b>200</b> to a desired thickness before removing the first substrate <b>100</b>, because it is difficult to thin the second conductive substrate after removing the first substrate <b>100</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">The transfer to the second substrate <b>200</b> is completed when the first substrate <b>100</b> is removed to expose the first cladding region <b>112</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1G</figref>. The first substrate can be removed using any method know to the skilled artisan. For example, a laser can be utilized to separate the first substrate, as provided in U.S. Pat.

In another example, the first substrate <b>100</b> can be removed using a chemical process, e.g., a chemical lift-off (CLO).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">In the embodiments illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, the vertical-type luminous device <b>1</b> includes (i) a multilayered, light-emitting luminous structure <b>110</b> having a first surface <b>109</b>, a second surface <b>115</b>, and at least one side surface <b>113</b>, (ii) an insulating layer <b>120</b> covering the second surface <b>115</b> and at least a portion of the at least one side surface <b>113</b> of the luminous structure <b>110</b>, (iii) first and second electrodes (<b>140</b>, <b>150</b> respectively) connected to the luminous structure <b>110</b>, and (iv) a conductive substrate <b>200</b> bound to the first electrode <b>140</b>. The luminous device <b>1</b> can further include an intermediate layer <b>210</b> between the first electrode <b>140</b> and the conductive substrate <b>200</b> in order to enhance the bond, e.g., compensate for the warpage in the conductive substrate <b>200</b>, and an ohmic region <b>130</b> situated to contact the second surface <b>115</b> of the luminous structure <b>110</b> and the first electrode <b>140</b>, e.g., the ohmic region can be placed in a recess within the insulating layer <b>120</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">The multilayered, light-emitting luminous structure <b>110</b> includes a first cladding layer <b>112</b>, an active layer <b>114</b>, and a second cladding layer <b>116</b>. The luminous structures of this embodiment are preferably shaped to increase light emitting efficiency, e.g., by improving (i) internal reflection of light, (ii) the escape angle/path of the light after reflectance, or (iii) both. For example, at least one side wall surface <b>113</b> of the luminous structure illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> can be angled to improve light reflectance. In particular, it is preferred to form an internal angle α between an imaginary line coinciding with the second surface <b>115</b> and the side wall surface <b>113</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, such that the top surface area of the first surface <b>109</b> is greater than the top surface area of the active layer <b>114</b>. The angle α is preferably greater than about 30° but less than or equal to 90°, and more preferably between about 40° to about 70°. The angle α can be constant or vary continuously to form either partially or wholly concave or convex sidewall shapes. Further nonlimiting examples of shapes for the luminous structure <b>110</b> include a parabola, a truncated parabola, an inverted frustum of a cone (i.e., truncated cone), an inverted frustum of a pyramid (i.e., truncated pyramid), and a combination thereof. For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> respectively illustrate a luminous structure <b>110</b> having the shape of an inverted frustum of a pyramid (e.g., having a substantially square base) and a frustum of an elongated pyramid (e.g., having a substantially rectangular base).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">The insulating layer prevents electrical shorts between the p-type and n-type regions via the first electrode <b>140</b>, described hereinafter. It is believed that the insulating layer also provides additional structural support for the luminous structure <b>110</b>. Insulating layer <b>120</b> is also preferably thermally conductive (e.g., by choice of materials or by utilizing a very thin layer) so that heat can be transferred to the first electrode layer <b>140</b> and away from the luminous structure <b>110</b>. The insulating layer is also preferably transparent, e.g., translucent enough to allow light to pass through it and be reflected by the later formed first electrode, described hereinafter.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the insulating layer <b>120</b> can cover second surface <b>115</b> and the entire side surface <b>113</b> of the luminous structure <b>110</b>.

In another embodiment, the insulating layer <b>120</b> can cover only the first cladding layer <b>112</b> and the exposed side surfaces of active layer <b>114</b>, e.g., by forming a patterned insulating layer <b>120</b>. In still another alternative, the insulating layer is optional and can be removed if the first electrode <b>140</b> only extends up the sides of the second cladding layer <b>116</b>, e.g., when the first electrode is not in electrical communication with the first cladding layer <b>112</b> or the active layer <b>114</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">The insulating layer also includes at least one recess <b>121</b> exposing the second cladding layer <b>116</b> of the luminous structure <b>110</b> to allow electrical communication through the insulating layer.

These alternative locations for recess <b>121</b> can be useful to improve current flow. The insulating layer <b>120</b> is preferably transparent, e.g., translucent enough to allow at least some light to pass through it.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">Accordingly, the first electrode <b>140</b> is electrically isolated from the active layer <b>114</b> and the first cladding layer <b>112</b>. Electrical isolation of the first electrode <b>140</b> can be obtained by having the first electrode extend along the side surface <b>113</b> but not reaching up to the active layer <b>114</b> of the heterostructure, e.g., only along second surface <b>115</b> or along second surface <b>115</b> and part of side surface <b>113</b> of the luminous structure <b>110</b>. Alternatively, electrical isolation can be obtained by utilizing an insulating layer, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and described hereinbefore in the description of the insulating layer for this embodiment and in the method of manufacturing section.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the first electrode <b>140</b> can cover any portion of the insulating layer as long as part of the first electrode is in electrical communication with the second cladding layer <b>116</b> through recess <b>121</b> of insulating layer <b>120</b>. For example, the first electrode <b>140</b> can cover substantially all of the insulating layer <b>120</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. It is believed that the insulating layer and the first electrode can provide further structural support to the luminous structure <b>110</b>. Alternatively, when a patterned insulating layer <b>120</b> covers only the first cladding layer <b>112</b> and the exposed side surfaces of active layer <b>114</b>, the first electrode <b>140</b> can be formed on the second cladding layer <b>115</b> and optionally on any portion of the insulating layer <b>120</b>. Similarly, when a patterned insulating layer covers only the second cladding layer <b>116</b> and the exposed side surfaces of the active layer <b>114</b>, then a patterned first electrode <b>140</b> covers the patterned insulating layer <b>120</b>, e.g., the first electrode is not formed on the first cladding layer <b>112</b>. In regard to the second electrode <b>150</b>, the size and shape are chosen to maximize current flow while minimizing interference with light emitted from the luminous structure <b>110</b>. Accordingly, the second electrode <b>150</b> can have various configurations to improve current spreading and/or decrease interference with emitted light. For example, the second electrode <b>150</b> can be formed (i) near at least one edge of the first cladding layer <b>112</b>, (ii) in the shape of a frame formed on the edge of the first cladding layer, (iii) to include a plurality of smaller electrodes, or a combination thereof. Although not illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1H</figref>, a conductive layer can also be added to the first surface <b>109</b> of the first cladding layer <b>112</b> in order to improve current spreading. It is preferred to use a transparent conductive layer, such as ITO (Indium-Tin-Oxide).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">The luminous device <b>1</b> further includes a conductive substrate <b>200</b> bound to at least a portion of the first electrode <b>140</b>, thereby allowing electrical communication with the second cladding layer <b>116</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">The conductive substrate <b>200</b> can also include a conductive intermediate layer <b>210</b> to enhance the bond with the first electrode <b>140</b>, e.g., compensate for the warpage in the first substrate and/or the second substrate.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">Further details (e.g., how to make and material constituents) about the luminous device <b>1</b> and its various parts (e.g., the luminous structure <b>110</b>, the first and second electrodes <b>140</b>, <b>150</b>, the conductive substrate <b>200</b>, etc.) can be found in the hereinbefore-described sections on the method of manufacturing a luminous device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it is believed that the luminous device <b>1</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> can significantly improve light emission, especially when a transparent insulation layer <b>120</b> and a reflective first electrode <b>140</b> are utilized. In addition to light rays directly emitted from the active area (e.g., light ray L<b>1</b>), the angled side surfaces <b>113</b> of the luminous device <b>1</b> allow at least once reflected light (e.g., light ray L<b>2</b>) and twice reflected light (e.g., light ray L<b>3</b>) to be emitted from the hetero structure. Accordingly, the directionality of the emitted light can be substantially controlled while substantially increasing the amount of total emitted light. Furthermore, it is believed that, since the first electrode layer <b>140</b> is in thermal communication with the second cladding layer surface <b>115</b> and at least a portion of at least one side wall surface <b>113</b> of the luminous structure <b>110</b>, the first electrode layer <b>140</b> can provide improved conduction of heat away from the luminous structure <b>110</b> and into the conductive substrate <b>200</b>. This cooling effect can be substantial, since the first electrode layer <b>140</b> also has a significant contact area with the conductive substrate <b>200</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">Another embodiment of the present invention is directed to a method of manufacturing a luminous device with the second electrode <b>150</b> (e.g., top electrode) provided in a location that does not interfere with light emitted from the heterostructure. Such a configuration can be obtained by forming a grooved luminous structure, as illustrated by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6C</figref>. This method is a variation of the hereinbefore described method for manufacturing a vertical-type luminous device. Accordingly, the general steps of the method are essentially the same and equally applicable to the present embodiment, except for specific changes described below. For example, the method of this embodiment also undergoes the following process steps: (i) forming the luminous structure; (ii) forming the insulation layer having a recess; (iii) forming the first electrode and optional ohmic layer; (iv) optional patterning of the areas around the luminous structure (which can be conducted at a later time); (v) bonding the first electrode surface to a second conductive substrate; (vi) removing the first substrate; (vii) forming a second electrode; and (viii) separating the second substrate into individual luminous devices. Similarly, all of the variations regarding the insulating layer <b>120</b> and the first electrode <b>140</b> described hereinbefore for the earlier embodiments (e.g., relating to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1H</figref>, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>) equally apply to this embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">In this embodiment, the pre-formed, multilayered, light-emitting heterostructure (illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) is subjected to a patterning process to form a luminous structure <b>110</b> having at least one groove <b>118</b> separating at least the second cladding layer <b>116</b> and the active layer <b>114</b> of the luminous structure <b>110</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. One portion of the groove defines side surface <b>113</b> <i>b </i>of a major portion <b>110</b> <i>a </i>of the luminous structure <b>110</b>, and another portion of the groove defines side surface <b>117</b> of a minor portion <b>110</b> <i>b </i>of the luminous structure <b>110</b>. At least a portion of the first cladding layer <b>112</b>, therefore, remains as a continuous layer to provide electrical communication between the minor portion <b>110</b> <i>b </i>and the major portion <b>110</b> <i>a </i>of the luminous structure. Side surface <b>113</b> <i>b </i>and/or side surface <b>117</b> can be angled as describe hereinbefore in relation to the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In this embodiment, only the major portion <b>110</b> <i>a </i>of the luminous structure emits light. Although <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6B</figref> illustrate a straight groove <b>118</b>, the groove can also be curved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">As illustrated by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6B and 6C</figref>, the remaining process steps of this embodiment are essentially the same (except for the formation of the second electrode) as process steps in the hereinbefore described method of manufacturing a luminous device, which method is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. For example, an insulating layer <b>120</b> (including a recess <b>121</b>) is formed to conform to the shape of the luminous structure, e.g., the insulating layer is also formed in groove <b>118</b>. The insulating layer <b>120</b> also includes a recess <b>121</b>, which can be formed by a patterning process. Thereafter, a first electrode layer <b>140</b> is formed on the insulating layer <b>120</b> (including the region corresponding to the groove) and in recess <b>121</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. Alternatively, an ohmic layer <b>130</b> can be formed in recess <b>121</b>, as also illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. Thereafter, a second conductive substrate <b>200</b> (which can optionally have a patterned conductive intermediate layer <b>210</b>) is bound to at least a portion of the first electrode layer <b>140</b>, and the first substrate <b>100</b> is removed, as partially illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>. Furthermore, the conductive substrate <b>200</b> can also include a patterned intermediate layer <b>210</b> to enhance the bond between the conductive substrate <b>200</b> and the first electrode layer <b>140</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">In contrast to the hereinbefore described method, however, the method of this embodiment forms the second electrode <b>150</b> on first cladding layer <b>112</b> of the minor portion <b>110</b> <i>b </i>of the luminous structure, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>. Accordingly, the second electrode <b>150</b> (disposed on the minor portion <b>110</b> <i>b</i>) does not interfere with light emitted from the major portion <b>110</b> <i>a </i>of the luminous structure <b>100</b>. Second electrode <b>150</b> can, therefore, be made of any conductive material suitable for first cladding layer <b>112</b> (e.g., can be a transparent material, opaque material, or a non-transparent material), and the second electrode <b>150</b> can extend across a portion or the entire surface of the first cladding layer of the minor portion of the luminous structure <b>110</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">Furthermore, although not illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, a conductive layer can also be added to the surface of the first cladding layer <b>112</b> of the major portion <b>110</b> <i>a </i>and optionally to the minor portion <b>100</b> <i>b </i>of the luminous structure <b>110</b> in order to improve current spreading, e.g., before attaching the second electrode <b>150</b>. It is preferred to use a transparent conductive layer, such as ITO (Indium-Tin-Oxide), since this conductive layer will cover the light-emitting major portion <b>110</b> <i>a </i>of the luminous structure <b>110</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">After forming the second electrode <b>150</b>, the second substrate <b>200</b> and the areas around the luminous structure can be separated to form at least one luminous device <b>2</b> including at least one luminous structure <b>110</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>.

Since the second electrode <b>150</b> is attached to the first cladding layer <b>112</b> in the minor portion of the luminous device <b>2</b>, electricity will flow along the continuous first cladding layer <b>112</b> (or along its surface) and distribute within the major portion of the luminous device <b>2</b>, where light will be produced.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">It is believed that the luminous device <b>2</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> can significantly improve light emission with the second electrode <b>150</b> placed in a non-interfering position, and especially when a transparent insulation layer <b>120</b> and a reflective first electrode <b>140</b> are utilized. In addition to light rays directly emitted from the active area (e.g., light ray L<b>1</b>), the angled side surfaces <b>113</b> of the luminous device <b>1</b> allow at least once reflected light (e.g., light ray L<b>2</b>) and twice reflected light (e.g., light ray L<b>3</b>) to be emitted from the heterostructure. Accordingly, the directionality of the emitted light can be substantially controlled while substantially increasing the amount of total emitted light. Furthermore, it is believed that, since the first electrode layer <b>140</b> is in thermal communication with the second cladding layer surface <b>115</b> and at least a portion of at least one side wall surface <b>113</b> of the major portion <b>110</b> <i>a </i>of the luminous structure <b>110</b>, the first electrode layer <b>140</b> can provide improved conduction of heat away from the luminous structure <b>110</b> and into the conductive substrate <b>200</b>.

In another variation of this embodiment, luminous device <b>3</b> can have more than one substantially-square minor portions (not shown), e.g., one on opposite corner quadrants, or one on each corner quadrant. In these alternative embodiments, the preformed, multilayered, light emitting heterostructure can be patterned to form a luminous structure having a plurality of grooves.</div>

In this embodiment, four grooves in a square formation (or a single groove in a circular formation) can be utilized to form the minor portion <b>110</b> <i>b </i>as an island in a central location of the luminous structure <b>110</b>. Since the second electrode <b>150</b> is formed on the minor portion <b>110</b> <i>b</i>, its central location can help to increase current distribution outward in a radial direction from the center to the outer light emitting major portion <b>110</b> <i>a </i>of the luminous structure <b>110</b>.

This method is a variation of the hereinbefore described methods for manufacturing a vertical-type luminous device and a vertical-type luminous device having a groove. In this embodiment, a portion of the first cladding layer is utilized to form the lens. It is believed that the curvature of the lens increases the light emitting efficiency by reducing the escape cone angle, which is a phenomena resulting from the difference in refractive indexes between the first cladding layer and air.</div>
