<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">Example embodiments are described below with reference to the accompanying drawings. Many different forms and embodiments are possible without deviating from the spirit and teachings of this disclosure and so the disclosure should not be construed as limited to the example embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these example embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will convey the scope of the disclosure to those skilled in the art. In the drawings, the sizes and relative sizes of layers and regions may be exaggerated for clarity. Like reference numbers refer to like elements throughout the description.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the embodiments. As used herein, the singular forms “a,” “an,” and “the” are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms “comprises,” “comprising,” “includes,” and/or “including,” when used in this specification, specify the presence of the stated features, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being “coupled,” “connected,” or “responsive” to, or “on,” another element, it can be directly coupled, connected, or responsive to, or on, the other element, or intervening elements may also be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being “directly coupled,” “directly connected,” or “directly responsive” to, or “directly on,” another element, there are no intervening elements present. As used herein the term “and/or” includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">It will be understood that although the terms “first,” “second,” etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another. Thus, a “first” element could be termed a “second” element without departing from the teachings of the present embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">Spatially relative terms, such as “beneath,” “below,” “lower,” “above,” “upper,” and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as “below” or “beneath” other elements or features would then be oriented “above” the other elements or features. Thus, the exemplary term “below” can encompass both an orientation of above and below. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein may be interpreted accordingly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">Example embodiments of the inventive concepts are described herein with reference to cross-sectional illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments (and intermediate structures) of example embodiments. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, example embodiments of the inventive concepts should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, an implanted region illustrated as a rectangle may have rounded or curved features and/or a gradient of implant concentration at its edges rather than a binary change from implanted to non-implanted region. Likewise, a buried region formed by implantation may result in some implantation in the region between the buried region and the surface through which the implantation takes place. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the actual shape of a region of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of example embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the inventive concepts belong. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and/or the present specification and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.</div>

The second conductive barrier film <b>32</b>B may be interposed between the metal plug <b>32</b>A and the insulating thin film <b>36</b>. In some embodiments, the second conductive barrier film <b>32</b>B may be omitted, and the metal plug <b>32</b>A may directly contact the insulating thin film <b>36</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">The metal plug <b>32</b>A may include a first metal, and each of the first conductive barrier film <b>34</b> and the second conductive barrier film <b>32</b>B may include a metal that is different from the first metal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, the metal plug <b>32</b>A may include Copper (Cu) or Tungsten (W). For example, the metal plug <b>32</b>A may include Cu, Copper-Tin (CuSn), Copper-Magnesium (CuMg), Copper-Nickel (CuNi), Copper-Zinc (CuZn), Copper-Palladium (CuPd), Copper-Gold (CuAu), Copper-Rhenium (CuRe), CuW, W, or W alloy, but is not limited thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">The second conductive barrier film <b>32</b>B surrounding the sidewall of the metal plug <b>32</b>A may be a single or multiple film including at least one material selected from W, Tungsten Nitride (WN), Tungsten Carbide (WC), Titanium (Ti), Titanium Nitride (TiN), Tantalum (Ta), Tantalum Nitride (TaN), Ruthenium (Ru), Cobalt (Co), Manganese (Mn), Nickel (Ni), and Nickel Boron (NiB). In some embodiments, the second conductive barrier film <b>32</b>B may be formed by using a physical vapor deposition (PVD) process or a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process. In other embodiments, the second conductive barrier film <b>32</b>B may be formed by using an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, the second conductive barrier film <b>32</b>B may have a uniform thickness along a lengthwise direction of the TSV structure <b>30</b>A. Herein, the lengthwise direction of the TSV structure <b>30</b>A refers to a direction of a shortest length from a first surface <b>20</b>T to a second surface <b>20</b>B, which is opposite the first surface <b>20</b>T, of the semiconductor structure <b>20</b>. In the present application, the phrases “a lengthwise direction of the via hole <b>22</b>” and “the lengthwise direction of the TSV structure <b>30</b>A” have the same meaning.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">The first conductive barrier film <b>34</b> may be a conductive layer having a relatively low interconnection line resistance. For example, the first conductive barrier film <b>34</b> may be a single or multiple film including at least one selected from W, WN, Ti, TiN, Ta, TaN, and Ru. For example, the first conductive barrier film <b>34</b> may be a multiple film formed of TaN/W, TiN/W, or WN/W. The first conductive barrier film <b>34</b> may have a thickness of about 50 to about 1000 Angstroms (Å). In some embodiments, the first conductive barrier film <b>34</b> may have a uniform thickness in the lengthwise direction of the TSV structure <b>30</b>A. The first conductive barrier film <b>34</b> may be formed by using an ALD process or a CVD process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">The insulating thin film <b>36</b> may have a cylindrically-shaped structure surrounding the conductive plug <b>32</b>. The insulating thin film <b>36</b> may be an oxide film, a nitride film, an insulating metal oxide film, a high-dielectric-constant film, a polymer, or a combination thereof. The insulating thin film <b>36</b> may be a high-density thin film having a uniform thickness along the lengthwise direction of the TSV structure <b>30</b>A. For example, the insulating thin film <b>36</b> may be a thin film obtained by performing an ALD process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">The insulating thin film <b>36</b> may be a high-dielectric-constant film having a higher dielectric constant than that of a silicon oxide film. For example, the insulating thin film <b>36</b> may have a dielectric constant of about 10 to about 25. In some embodiments, the insulating thin film <b>36</b> may include at least one material selected from hafnium oxide (HfO), hafnium silicon oxide (HfSiO), hafnium oxidation nitride (HfON), hafnium silicon oxidation nitride (HfSiON), lanthanum oxide (LaO), lanthanum aluminum oxide (LaAlO), zirconium oxide (ZrO), zirconium silicon oxide (ZrSiO), zirconium oxidation nitride (ZrON), zirconium silicon oxidation nitride (ZrSiON), tantalum oxide (TaO), titanium oxide (TiO), barium strontium titanium oxide (BaSrTiO), barium titanium oxide (BaTiO), strontium titanium oxide (SrTiO), yttrium oxide (YO), aluminum oxide (AlO), and lead scandium tantalum oxide (PbScTaO).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">The integrated circuit device <b>10</b>A may further include a via insulating film <b>40</b> interposed between the semiconductor structure <b>20</b> and the first conductive barrier film <b>34</b>. The via insulating film <b>40</b> may separate the semiconductor structure <b>20</b> from the TSV structure <b>30</b>A.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">The via insulating film <b>40</b> may be an oxide film, a nitride film, a carbide film, a polymer, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, a CVD process may be used to form the via insulating film <b>40</b>. The via insulating film <b>40</b> may be formed to have a thickness of about 500 to about 2500 Å.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">The insulating thin film <b>36</b> may be spaced apart from the via insulating film <b>40</b> with the first conductive barrier film <b>34</b> interposed therebetween. To minimize/reduce a resistance of the TSV structure <b>30</b>A, the insulating thin film <b>36</b> may be formed to have as small of a thickness as possible. In some embodiments, the thickness of the insulating thin film <b>36</b> may be smaller than the thickness of the via insulating film <b>40</b>. In some embodiments, the insulating thin film <b>36</b> may have a thickness of about 50 to about 1000 Å.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">A first conductive layer <b>52</b> contacting an end <b>32</b>T of the conductive plug <b>32</b> and an end <b>34</b>T of the first conductive barrier film <b>34</b> may be formed on the first surface <b>20</b>T of the semiconductor structure <b>20</b>. A second conductive layer <b>54</b> contacting another end <b>32</b>L of the conductive plug <b>32</b> and another end <b>34</b>L of the first conductive barrier film <b>34</b> may be formed on the second surface <b>20</b>B of the semiconductor structure <b>20</b>. The conductive plug <b>32</b> and the first conductive barrier film <b>34</b> may be mutually electrically connected to each other via each of the first conductive layer <b>52</b> and the second conductive layer <b>54</b>, in such a way that when a voltage is applied to the TSV structure <b>30</b>A, the conductive plug <b>32</b> and the first conductive barrier film <b>34</b> mutually have equipotential states.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">The first conductive layer <b>52</b> and the second conductive layer <b>54</b> may each include metal. Because the conductive plug <b>32</b> and the first conductive barrier film <b>34</b> are both connected to the first conductive layer <b>52</b> and the second conductive layer <b>54</b>, a voltage supplied by any conductive layer of the first conductive layer <b>52</b> and the second conductive layer <b>54</b> to the conductive plug <b>32</b> may be simultaneously supplied to the first conductive barrier film <b>34</b>, so that the conductive plug <b>32</b> and the first conductive barrier film <b>34</b> may be in an equipotential state. For example, when the conductive plug <b>32</b> includes a metal ion that easily diffuses due to a potential difference, such as a Cu ion, because the first conductive barrier film <b>34</b>, which has an equipotential state with respect to the conductive plug <b>32</b>, with the insulating thin film <b>36</b> interposed therebetween, surrounds the conductive plug <b>32</b>, diffusion of metal ions from the conductive plug <b>32</b> into the semiconductor structure <b>20</b> due to a potential difference may be electrically shielded against. Accordingly, problems caused by the diffusion of metal ions into the semiconductor structure <b>20</b> due to a potential difference, including, for example, problems of deterioration of operational characteristics of unit devices such as a transistor, and a decrease in reliability of the TSV structure <b>30</b>A, occurring when metal ions diffuse into the via insulating film <b>40</b>, may be prevented/reduced.</div>
