<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This non-provisional application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. §119(a) on Patent Application No. 2011-261590 filed in Japan on Nov. 30, 2011, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a surface treating agent which contains a silane modified with a polymer containing a fluorooxyalkylene group. More particularly, the present invention relates to a surface treating agent which forms a coating film being excellent in water- and oil-repellency and having a low coefficient of dynamic friction and also to an article finished with the surface treating agent. The surface treating agent according to the present invention is composed of, in a specific ratio, a silane modified with a polymer containing a fluorooxyalkylene group and/or a partial hydrolytic condensate thereof and a polymer containing a fluorooxyalkylene group having a higher weight average molecular weight.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">There has recently been an accelerated trend toward the replacement of displays on mobile phones by those of touch panel type. Unfortunately, the display of touch panel type has the disadvantage of becoming easily soiled with sebum etc. because it is usually bare and subject to direct contact with the fingers and cheeks of the user. Thus there is a growing demand for technologies to protect the display from soiling with fingerprints and to make the display easily cleanable, thereby improving appearance and visibility. This demand is fulfilled by any conventional water- and oil-repellent that forms an easy-to-clean film having good water- and oil-repellency. Such a conventional product, however, has the disadvantage of greatly varying in durability from one batch of film to another. Moreover, it involves difficulties in forming a smooth film due to agglomeration of particles therein. This has stimulated the development of a new surface treating agent and a method of invariably forming a high-performance coating film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">In the meantime, any compound containing fluorooxyalkylene groups generally exhibits water- and oil-repellency, chemical resistance, lubricity, releasability, and stain resistance on account of its very low surface free energy. Thanks to these properties, it finds a variety of industrial uses as water- and oil-repellent stain-resistant agents for paper and fiber, slip agents for magnetic recording media, oil protectants for precision machines, mold release agents, cosmetics, and protective film. On the other hand, the aforesaid properties imply nonadherence to substrates, and hence the aforesaid compound can be applied to the substrate surface but the resulting coating film does not firmly adhere to the substrate surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">By the way, among well-known agents to bind an organic compound to a substrate such as glass and cloth are silane coupling agents, which are in general use for coating on the surface of various substrates. Any silane coupling agent has organic functional groups and reactive silyl groups (usually alkoxysilyl groups) in one molecule. The alkoxysilyl groups undergo the self-condensation reaction induced by moisture in air, thereby forming a coating film. This coating film is durable and strong because of the chemical and physical bonding of alkoxysilyl groups to the surface of glass or metal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">One example of the coupling agents having the alkoxysilyl groups as mentioned above is disclosed in Patent Document 1 (JP-A 2003-238577). It is a silane modified with a polymer containing linear perfluorooxyalkylene groups represented by the formula below. This silane is used for surface treatment of glass and antireflective film. The treated glass or film is superior in slipperiness, releasability, and wear resistance, but lacks stable high-performance properties. The lack of durability is due to the presence of non-fluorine groups on the molecular terminals, the non-fluorine groups being liable to agglomeration during or after the coating process.</div>

<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0005">Technical Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention was completed in view of the foregoing. It is an object of the present invention to provide a fluorine-based surface treating agent for vapor deposition, which invariably forms a high-performance water- and oil-repellent film, and an article finished with the surface treating agent by vapor deposition.</div>
<heading id="h-0006">Solution to Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Conventional technologies that employ a fluorine-based surface treating agent having hydrolyzable groups involve a preliminary step of forming an SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer as a primer coating on the substrate prior to its application. The method for application in this case is vacuum vapor deposition rather than dipping, because the former is more suitable for durable coating than the latter as known well.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">As mentioned above, the present inventors had proposed a silane modified with a polymer containing linear perfluorooxyalkylene groups, the polymer having hydrolyzable groups on both terminals (See Patent Document 1: JP-A 2003-238577). The polymer-modified silane as a surface treating agent needs adequately controlled processing conditions so as to form high-performance coating film because its molecules are liable to agglomeration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">The polymer having the fluorooxyalkylene structure in the main chain and containing hydrolyzable groups on both terminals of the molecular chain, is liable to agglomeration induced by mutual reaction between alkoxysilyl groups. This agglomeration gives rise to surface irregularities larger than the thickness (at least 10 nm) of monomolecular layer, as proven by observations of a deposited film under an atomic force microscope. This holds true also in the case of a surface treating agent having functional groups only on one terminal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">In order to tackle the foregoing problems, the present inventors carried out a thorough investigation, which led to the finding that the fluorine-based surface treating agent containing a polymer which has hydrolyzable groups on its terminals and also has the fluorooxyalkylene structure in its main chain becomes free of agglomeration upon addition with a non-functional polymer. This finding is the basis of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">Thus, the present invention provides a fluorine-based surface treating agent for vapor deposition as defined below and an article finished with the surface treating agent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">More specifically, the present invention provides a fluorine-based surface treating agent for vapor deposition comprising (A) a hydrolyzable group-containing silane modified with a polymer containing a fluorooxyalkylene group and/or a partial hydrolytic condensate, and (B) a polymer containing a fluorooxyalkylene group having a higher weight average molecular weight than component (A), wherein components (A) and (B) are mixed in a weight ratio of from 6:4 to 9:1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">Preferably, the ratio between the weight average molecular weight of component (A) and the weight average molecular weight of component (B) ranges from 1:1.5 to 1:5.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">According to the present invention, the fluorine-based surface treating agent for vapor deposition may optionally contain, as component (A), a partial hydrolytic condensate of the above-mentioned silane modified with a polymer containing a fluorooxyalkylene group. This condensate is obtained by partially hydrolyzing the terminal hydrolyzable groups of the silane by any known method and subsequently condensing the resulting partial hydrolyzate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">According to the present invention, the fluorine-based surface treating agent for vapor deposition should contain, as component (B), a polymer containing a fluorooxyalkylene group. This polymer should be highly compatible with component (A) or the silane modified with a polymer containing a fluorooxyalkylene group and/or a partial hydrolytic condensate thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">Component (B) or the polymer containing a fluorooxyalkylene group protects component (A) or the silane modified with a polymer containing a fluorooxyalkylene group and/or a partial hydrolytic condensate thereof from bumping at the time of vapor deposition. This leads to stable depositing operation. Moreover, component (B) prevents component (A) from agglomeration after vapor deposition, and this ensures efficient and complete coating on the substrate. Incidentally, component (B) should preferably be one which is free of silicon atoms.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">Component (B) or the polymer containing a fluorooxyalkylene group has no terminal hydrolyzable groups and hence is incapable of reaction with the substrate. If it deposits earlier than component (A) or the silane modified with a polymer containing a fluorooxyalkylene group and/or a partial hydrolytic condensate thereof at the time of vapor deposition, the resulting coating film will be poor in durability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">This drawback can be removed if component (B) exceeds component (A) in weight average molecular weight by at least 1.5 times.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">According to the present invention, the polymer containing a fluorooxyalkylene group (as component (B)) should has a weight average molecular weight suitable for vapor deposition, which is larger than that of the silane modified with a polymer containing a fluorooxyalkylene group and/or a partial hydrolytic condensate thereof (as component (A)), by at least 1.5 times, preferably at least 1.5 times and up to 5 times, from the standpoint of miscibility of the two components, more preferably at least 1.5 times and up to 4 times from the standpoint of handleability of the solution at the time of coating.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">The weight average molecular weight of the polymer containing a fluorooxyalkylene group (as component (B)) is expressed in terms of that of polystyrene which is determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) that employs AK225 (made by ASAHI GLASS CO., LTD.) as an eluent. It is not specifically restricted within the foregoing range; however, it should preferably be 1,500 to 20,000, more preferably 2,000 to 10,000.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">According to the present invention, the fluorine-based surface treating agent for vapor deposition should be composed of component (A) (or a hydrolyzable group-containing silane modified with a polymer containing a fluorooxyalkylene group and/or a condensate of partial hydrolyzate thereof) and component (B) (or a polymer containing a fluorooxyalkylene group) in a mixing ratio of from 6:4 to 9:1, preferably from 8:2 to 9:1. With component (A) in an excessive amount, the surface treating agent is liable to suffer agglomeration of silane. With component (B) in an excessive amount, the surface treating agent will be poor in curability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">The surface treating agent of the present invention may contain a solvent capable of uniformly dissolving components (A) and (B). Typical examples of the solvent include fluorine-modified aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents (such as perfluoroheptane and perfluorooctane), fluorine-modified aromatic hydrocarbon solvents (such as 1,3-trifluoromethylbenzene), fluorine-modified ether solvents (such as methylperfluorobutylether, ethyl perfluorobutyl ether, and perfluoro(2-butyltetrahydrofuran)), fluorine-modified alkylamine solvents (such as perfluorotributylamine and perfluorotriphentylamine), hydrocarbon solvents (such as petroleum benzine, toluene, and xylene), and ketone solvents (such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, and methyl isobutyl ketone). Of these examples, fluorine-modified solvents are preferable from the standpoint of solubility and wetting properties. Particularly preferable among them are fluorine-modified ether solvents and fluorine-modified aromatic hydrocarbon solvents.</div>

Examples of such additives include those catalysts for hydrolysis and condensation which may be organotin compounds (such as dibutyltin dimethoxide and dibutyltin dilaurate), organotitanium compounds (such as tetra-n-butyl titanate), organic acids (such as fluorine-containing carboxylic acid, acetic acid, and methanesulfonic acid), and inorganic acids (such as hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid). Preferable among these examples are fluorine-containing carboxylic acid, acetic acid, tetra-n-butyl titanate, and dibutyltin dilaurate. They should be added in a catalytic amount, which is usually 0.01 to 5 parts by weight, particularly 0.1 to 1 part by weight, for 100 parts by weight of component (A).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">The surface treating agent of the present invention can be applied to the substrate by any known process for vapor deposition. Vapor deposition may be accomplished by resistance heating or electron beam heating. Vapor deposition should be followed by curing at room temperature to 200° C., depending on the curing method. Moreover, curing should preferably be carried out in a humid atmosphere for accelerated reaction. The conditions for vapor deposition should be adequately selected for individual substrates such that the resulting coating film has a thickness of 0.1 to 30 nm, particularly 5 to 20 nm.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0111">Each of the silane modified with a polymer containing a fluorooxyalkylene group and each of the polymer containing a fluorooxyalkylene group, both specified in Table 1, were mixed in a ratio of 9:1 by weight. The resulting mixture was dissolved in Novec 7200 (from 3M Company) such that it gives a solution having a concentration of 20 wt %. Thus there were obtained samples of the surface treating agent desired. Each sample was applied to a glass substrate having a 15-nm thick top coating of SiO<sub>2 </sub>(“Gorilla” made by Corning Inc.) by vacuum deposition at a pressure of 2.0×10<sup>−2 </sup>Pa and at a temperature of 700° C. The amount of coating was 5 μL. The coating step was followed by curing at 25° C. for 24 hours in an atmosphere of 50% RH. Thus there was obtained the cured coating film desired which has a thickness of about 10 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0112">Each specimen of the cured coating film mentioned above was examined in the following way. The results are shown in Table 1.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0124">It is noted from Table 1 that the surface treating agent according to Comparative Examples 1 to 5, which is based on only component (A), i.e., the silane modified with a polymer containing a fluorooxyalkylene group, gives a coating film having a surface roughness exceeding 10 nm owing to polymer agglomeration. By contrast, the surface treating agent according to Examples 1 to 11, which is composed of component (A) and component (B), i.e., the polymer containing fluorooxyalkylene groups (in an amount of 10 wt % of the total amount), prevents the polymers from agglomerating each other, thereby invariably giving a smooth water- and oil-repellent coating film. Incidentally, this effect cannot be produced in the case of the surface treating agent according to Comparative Examples 6 to 9, in which component (B), i.e., the polymer containing a fluorooxyalkylene group has a weight average molecular weight which is up to that of component (A), i.e., the silane modified with a polymer containing a fluorooxyalkylene group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0125">The cured coating film according to Examples 1 to 11, which has a smooth surface, keeps its surface characteristic almost unchanged after spraying with saline solution. By contrast, the cured coating film according to Comparative Examples 1 to 9, which has a rough surface, remarkably decreases in contact angle (formed by water) after spraying with saline solution. In the case of specimens according to Comparative Examples 1 to 9, the cured coating film has a thickness of 10 nm on average. However, it fluctuates in thickness, leaving the substrate partly uncovered, so that it permits the SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer (as the primer layer) to be attacked by saline solution. The complete covering of the SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer may be accomplished by increasing the coating weight of the surface treating agent, but this is not desirable because the coated glass may possibly decrease in reflectance and transmittance.</div>
<heading id="h-0015">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0126">The surface treating agent according to the present invention gives rise to a smooth cured coating film which excels in water- and oil-repellency. Therefore, it will be very effective in the field of applications, such as touch panel display and antireflective film, where it is necessary to avoid staining with sebum to ensure good visibility.</div>
