<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This U.S. non-provisional patent application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. ยง119 to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2013-0012523, filed on Feb. 4, 2013, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the inventive concept relate to a semiconductor device and a method of fabricating the same, and in particular, to a semiconductor memory device and a method of fabricating the same.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Highly integrated semiconductor memory devices have increased in demand with the development of electronic industry. The integration density of semiconductor memory devices can be a factor that may influence the cost of the semiconductor memory devices. That is, if the integration density of the semiconductor memory devices increases, the cost of the semiconductor memory devices may be lowered. The integration density of semiconductor memory devices, such as planar semiconductor memory devices, may be mainly determined by a planar area that a unit memory cell occupies. Accordingly, the integration density of the planar semiconductor memory devices may be affected by, for example, a technology for forming fine and small patterns. However, realizing fine patterns in the planar semiconductor memory devices may result in increasing manufacturing costs and/or high priced apparatuses. Therefore, there may be some limitations in forming the small and fine patterns.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Recently, three dimensional semiconductor devices, including memory cells arranged in a three dimensional array, have been proposed to overcome the above limitations. Nevertheless, new processes which are capable of reducing bit cost and realizing reliable products are still required for successful mass production of the three dimensional semiconductor memory devices.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">It should be noted that these figures are intended to illustrate the general characteristics of methods, structure and/or materials utilized in certain example embodiments and to supplement the written description provided below. These drawings are not, however, to scale and may not precisely reflect the precise structural or performance characteristics of any given embodiment, and should not be interpreted as defining or limiting the range of values or properties encompassed by example embodiments. For example, the relative thicknesses and positioning of molecules, layers, regions and/or structural elements may be reduced or exaggerated for clarity. The use of similar or identical reference numbers in the various drawings is intended to indicate the presence of a similar or identical element or feature.</div>
<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">Some embodiments of the inventive concepts will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some embodiments are shown. Embodiments of the inventive concepts may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as being limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the concept of the embodiments to those of ordinary skill in the art. In the drawings, the thicknesses of layers and regions are exaggerated for clarity. Like reference numerals in the drawings denote like elements, and thus their description will be omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being โconnectedโ or โcoupledโ to another element, it can be directly connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being โdirectly connectedโ or โdirectly coupledโ to another element, there are no intervening elements present. Like numbers indicate like elements throughout. As used herein the term โand/orโ includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items. Other words used to describe the relationship between elements or layers should be interpreted in a like fashion (e.g., โbetweenโ versus โdirectly between,โ โadjacentโ versus โdirectly adjacent,โ โonโ versus โdirectly onโ).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">It will be understood that, although the terms โfirstโ, โsecondโ, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another element, component, region, layer or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">Spatially relative terms, such as โbeneath,โ โbelow,โ โlower,โ โabove,โ โupperโ and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as โbelowโ or โbeneathโ other elements or features would then be oriented โaboveโ the other elements or features. Thus, the exemplary term โbelowโ can encompass both an orientation of above and below. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to limit the embodiments. As used herein, the singular forms โa,โ โanโ and โtheโ are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms โcomprisesโ, โcomprisingโ, โincludesโ and/or โincluding,โ if used herein, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components and/or groups thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which embodiments of the inventive concepts belong. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly-used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an equivalent circuit diagram of a semiconductor memory device according to some embodiments of the inventive concept.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a semiconductor memory device according to an embodiment may include a common source line CSL, a plurality of bit lines BL<b>0</b>, BL<b>1</b>, BL<b>2</b> and BL<b>3</b>, and a plurality of cell strings CSTR disposed between the common source line CSL and the bit lines BL<b>0</b>-BL<b>3</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">The common source line CSL may be a conductive layer disposed on a substrate (e.g., a semiconductor substrate) or an impurity region formed in the substrate. The bit lines BL<b>0</b>-BL<b>3</b> may be conductive patterns (e.g., metal lines) disposed over the substrate and separated from the substrate. The bit lines BL<b>0</b> to BL<b>3</b> may be two dimensionally arrayed, and a plurality of cell strings CSTR may be electrically connected in parallel (to one another to each of the bit lines BL<b>0</b> to BL<b>3</b>. Thus, the cell strings CSTR may be two dimensionally arrayed on the common source line CSL or the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">Each of the cell strings CSTR may be configured to include a ground selection transistor GST connected to the common source line CSL, a string selection transistor SST connected to one of the bit lines BL<b>0</b>-BL<b>3</b>, and a plurality of memory cell transistors MCT disposed between the ground selection transistor GST and the string selection transistor SST. The ground selection transistor GST, the plurality of memory cell transistors MCT and the string selection transistor SST constituting each of the cell strings CSTR may be serially connected to each other. In addition, gate electrodes of the ground selection transistors GST may extend to form a ground selection line GSL, and gate electrodes of the string selection transistors SST may extend to form a plurality of string selection lines SSL<b>0</b>, SSL<b>1</b> and SSL<b>2</b>. Further, gate electrodes of the memory cell transistors MCT may extend to form a plurality of word lines WL<b>0</b>, WL<b>1</b>, WL<b>2</b> and WL<b>3</b>. The ground selection line GSL, the string selection lines SSL<b>0</b> to SSL<b>2</b> and the word lines WL<b>0</b> to WL<b>3</b> may be disposed between the common source line CSL and the bit lines BL<b>0</b> to BL<b>3</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">The ground selection transistors GST may be located at substantially the same distance from the substrate, and the gate electrodes of the ground selection transistors GST may be commonly connected to the ground selection line GSL to have the same electrical potential. Accordingly, the ground selection line GSL may be a plate-shaped conductive pattern or a comb-shaped conductive pattern which is disposed between the common source line CSL and the lowermost memory cell transistors MCT closest to the common source line CSL. Similarly, the gate electrodes of the memory cell transistors MCT, which are located at the same level from the common source line CSL, may also be connected to one of the word lines WL<b>0</b> to WL <b>3</b> to have the same electrical potential. Thus, each of the word lines WL<b>0</b> to WL<b>3</b> may be a plate-shaped conductive pattern or a comb-shaped conductive pattern which is parallel with the substrate. Meanwhile, since the memory cell transistors MCT constituting each of the cell strings CSTR are located at different levels from one another, the plurality of word lines WL<b>0</b> to WL<b>3</b> disposed between the common source lines CSL and the bit lines BL<b>0</b> to BL<b>3</b> may also be located at different levels from one another. That is, the plurality of word lines WL<b>0</b> to WL<b>3</b> may be vertically stacked to form a multi-layered structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">Each of the cell strings CSTR may include a semiconductor pillar that vertically extend to be connected to one of the bit lines BL<b>0</b> to BL<b>3</b>. The semiconductor pillar of each of the cell strings CSTR may penetrate the ground selection line GSL and the word lines WL<b>0</b> to WL<b>3</b>. In addition, the semiconductor pillar of each of the cell strings CSTR may include a body and an impurity region formed in one end of the body. Alternatively, the semiconductor pillar of each of the cell strings CSTR may include a body and at least one impurity region formed in at least one end of the body. For example, the semiconductor pillar may include a body and a drain region formed in an upper portion of the body.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">A data storage layer may be disposed between the word lines WL<b>0</b> to WL<b>3</b> and each of the semiconductor pillars. In some embodiments, the data storage layer may include a charge storage layer. For example, the data storage layer may be an insulating charge trap layer, a conductive floating gate, or an insulating layer with conductive nano dots.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">A dielectric layer, which acts as a gate insulation layer of the ground selection transistor GST or the string selection transistors SST, may be disposed between the ground selection line GSL and the semiconductor pillars or between the string selection lines SSL<b>0</b> to SSL<b>2</b> and the semiconductor pillars. The gate insulation layer of the ground selection transistor GST and/or the gate insulation layer of the string selection transistors SST may be formed of the same material as the data storage layer of the memory cell transistors MCT. Alternatively, the gate insulation layer of the ground selection transistor GST and/or the gate insulation layer of the string selection transistors SST may be formed of a gate oxide layer (e.g., a silicon oxides layer) commonly used in a metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">Each of the ground and string selection transistors GST and SST and the memory cell transistors MCT may have a similar structure to the MOSFET that employs the semiconductor pillar as a channel region. That is, source/drain regions may be disposed in some portions of the semiconductor pillar, which are located between the ground selection line GSL, the word lines WL<b>0</b> to WL<b>3</b> and the string selection line SSL. Alternatively, the word lines WL<b>0</b> to WL<b>3</b> may constitute a plurality of MOS capacitors together with the semiconductor pillar without any source/drain regions therebetween. In this case, if a voltage higher than threshold voltages of the MOS capacitors is applied to the word lines WL<b>0</b> to WL<b>3</b>, inversion regions corresponding to the source/drain regions may be formed in the semiconductor pillar between the word lines WL<b>0</b> to WL<b>3</b>. This may be due to fringing fields. Thus, the memory cell transistors MCT of each of the cell strings CSTR may be electrically connected to one another even without formation of the source/drain regions.</div>

The electrode layers <b>110</b> may be formed to have at least two different thicknesses, although illustrated to have the same thickness.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">The electrode layers <b>110</b> may be metal-silicide layers.
