<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device including an oxide semiconductor, a display device including the semiconductor device, and a manufacturing method thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Various metal oxides are used for a variety of applications. Indium oxide is a well-known material and is used as a light-transmitting electrode material which is necessary for liquid crystal displays and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Some metal oxides have semiconductor characteristics. As metal oxides exhibiting semiconductor characteristics, for example, tungsten oxide, tin oxide, indium oxide, zinc oxide, and the like can be given. A thin film transistor in which such a metal oxide having semiconductor characteristics is used for a channel formation region has been disclosed (Patent Documents 1 to 4, and Non-Patent Document 1).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, not only single-component oxides but also multi-component oxides are known as metal oxides. For example, homologous compound, InGaO<sub>3</sub>(ZnO)<sub>m </sub>(m is a natural number) is known as a multi-component oxide including In, Ga and Zn (Non-Patent Documents 2 to 4).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, it is confirmed that an oxide semiconductor including such an In—Ga—Zn-based oxide can be used for a channel layer of a transistor (Patent Document 5, and Non-Patent Documents 5 and 6).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">In a conventional technique, amorphous silicon or polycrystalline silicon has been used for a thin film transistor (a TFT) provided for each pixel of an active matrix liquid crystal display. However, in place of these silicon materials, attention has been attracted to a technique for manufacturing a thin film transistor including the aforementioned metal oxide semiconductor. Examples of the techniques are disclosed in Patent Document 6 and Patent Document 7, in which a thin film transistor is manufactured with zinc oxide or an In—Ga—Zn—O-based oxide semiconductor for a metal oxide semiconductor film and is used as a switching element or the like of an image display device.</div>

When the oxide semiconductor layer <b>103</b> is used as the active layer of the thin film transistor, the thin film transistor having small off is obtained. As the air atmosphere, an atmosphere including an oxygen gas at 15 vol % to 25 vol % and a nitrogen gas at 75 vol % to 85 vol % is preferably employed. The atmosphere at the heat treatment may be changed in accordance with usage of the oxide semiconductor layer.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0112">Next, a second oxide semiconductor film <b>113</b> to be the buffer layers <b>106</b> <i>a </i>and <b>106</b> <i>b </i>is formed over the first oxide semiconductor film <b>111</b> using a sputtering method in an atmosphere of a rare gas such as argon. It is preferable that the second oxide semiconductor film <b>113</b> is formed using a sputtering method in an atmosphere of a rare gas such as argon and a nitrogen gas. As a result, the conductivity of the buffer layers <b>106</b> <i>a </i>and <b>106</b> <i>b </i>can be increased. Alternatively, the film formation may be performed in an atmosphere of a rare gas such as argon and an oxygen gas under the condition that the flow rate of a rare gas such as argon is higher than that of an oxygen gas. As the second oxide semiconductor film <b>113</b>, the oxide semiconductor to be the buffer layers <b>106</b> <i>a </i>and <b>106</b> <i>b</i>, which is described in Embodiment 1, can be used. Specifically, for example, the film formation is performed by sputtering with use of an oxide semiconductor target including In, Ga, and Zn (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:ZnO=1:1:1) of 8 inches in diameter, under the conditions that the distance between the substrate and the target is 60 mm, the pressure is 0.4 Pa, the direct current (DC) power is 0.5 kW, the flow rate ratio of Ar:N<sub>2 </sub>in a deposition gas is 35:5 (sccm), and the deposition temperature is room temperature. As the target, Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>and ZnO in a pellet state may be disposed on a disk of 8 inches in diameter which includes In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Note that a pulse direct current (DC) power source is preferable because powder substances (also referred to as particles or dust) generated in film formation can be reduced and the film thickness can be uniform. The thickness of the second oxide semiconductor film <b>113</b> is set to 5 nm to 20 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0113">In a manner similar to the case of the first oxide semiconductor film <b>111</b>, the target may include insulating oxide so that the second oxide semiconductor film <b>113</b> includes insulating oxide. Here, as the insulating oxide, silicon oxide is preferable. Further, nitrogen may be added to the insulating oxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0114">A chamber used for forming the second oxide semiconductor film <b>113</b> may be the same or different from the chamber in which the first oxide semiconductor film <b>111</b> has been formed. In addition, in formation of the second oxide semiconductor film <b>113</b>, the same sputtering apparatus as that for forming the first oxide semiconductor film <b>111</b> can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0115">Next, the second oxide semiconductor film <b>113</b> is subjected to reverse sputtering treatment. The reverse sputtering refers to a method in which an RF power source is used for application of voltage to a substrate side in an argon atmosphere and plasma is generated in the vicinity of the substrate to modify a surface. Note that instead of an argon atmosphere, a nitrogen atmosphere, a helium atmosphere, or the like may be used. Alternatively, an argon atmosphere to which oxygen, N<sub>2</sub>O, or the like is added may be used. Further alternatively, an argon atmosphere to which Cl<sub>2</sub>, CF<sub>4</sub>, or the like is added may be used. In addition, it is preferable that pressure inside the chamber is set to 10<sup>−5 </sup>Pa or less and impurities inside the chamber are removed in advance. By the reverse sputtering of the second oxide semiconductor film <b>113</b>, the conductivity of the second oxide semiconductor film <b>113</b> (the buffer layers <b>106</b> <i>a </i>and <b>106</b> <i>b</i>) can be increased. For example, an argon gas is introduced at a pressure of 0.6 Pa and a gas flow rate of approximately 50 sccm into the chamber where the substrate <b>100</b> is set and reverse sputtering treatment is performed for approximately 3 minutes. Here, since the reverse sputtering treatment greatly affects a surface of the second oxide semiconductor film <b>113</b>, the second oxide semiconductor film <b>113</b> has a structure in which the conductivity is changed in stages or successively from the surface toward the substrate side in some cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0116">Further, by the reverse sputtering treatment, dust attached to the surface of the second oxide semiconductor film <b>113</b> can be removed. Furthermore, by the reverse sputtering treatment, the flatness of the surface of the second oxide semiconductor film <b>113</b> can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0117">The substrate <b>100</b> is preferably processed without being exposed to the air during the period from the formation of the second oxide semiconductor film <b>113</b> up to the reverse sputtering treatment. Note that a chamber used for the reverse sputtering treatment may be the same or different from the chamber in which the second oxide semiconductor film <b>113</b> has been formed. The reverse sputtering treatment may be performed after heat treatment in a nitrogen atmosphere performed next. A cross-sectional view at this stage is <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>. A portion above a dashed line in the second oxide semiconductor film <b>113</b> is a mark of the reverse sputtering treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0118">Next, the second oxide semiconductor film <b>113</b> is subjected to heat treatment in a nitrogen atmosphere. The heat treatment is performed at 200° C. to 600° C. inclusive, preferably 250° C. to 500° C. inclusive. For example, the heat treatment is performed on the substrate <b>100</b> set in a furnace in a nitrogen atmosphere at 350° C. for about one hour. By the heat treatment on the oxide semiconductor in a nitrogen atmosphere, the conductivity of the oxide semiconductor can be increased. Accordingly, the conductivity of the second oxide semiconductor film <b>113</b> can be increased. Therefore, the conductivity of the buffer layers <b>106</b> <i>a </i>and <b>106</b> <i>b </i>can be improved. At this time, by subjecting the second oxide semiconductor film <b>113</b> to the heat treatment in a nitrogen atmosphere as described above, the conductivity of the second oxide semiconductor film <b>113</b> can be increased. Here, an atmosphere including a nitrogen gas at 80 vol % to 100 vol % and a rare gas such as argon at 0 vol % to 20 vol % is preferably employed as the nitrogen atmosphere. A cross-sectional view at this stage is <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. The heat treatment in a nitrogen atmosphere progresses from the surface toward the substrate side of the second oxide semiconductor film <b>113</b>. Therefore, the second oxide semiconductor film <b>113</b> (the buffer layers <b>106</b> <i>a </i>and <b>106</b> <i>b</i>) may have a structure in which the conductivity is changed in stages or successively from the surface toward the substrate side of the second oxide semiconductor film <b>113</b> in some cases. In particular, when time for the heat treatment in a nitrogen atmosphere is not enough, difference in the conductivity between the surface and the inside of the second oxide semiconductor film <b>113</b> becomes large in some cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0119">Next, a photolithography process is performed and a resist mask is formed over the second oxide semiconductor film <b>113</b>. Then, the first oxide semiconductor film <b>111</b> and the second oxide semiconductor film <b>113</b> are etched. An acid-based etchant can be used for an etchant for the etching. Here, unnecessary portions are removed by wet etching using a mixed solution of phosphoric acid, acetic acid, nitric acid, and pure water (referred to as an aluminum mixed acid) so that the first oxide semiconductor film <b>111</b> and the second oxide semiconductor film <b>113</b> have an island shape. Thus, the oxide semiconductor layer <b>103</b> and the buffer layer <b>106</b> are formed. The oxide semiconductor layer <b>103</b> and the buffer layer <b>106</b> are etched to have a tapered edge, whereby disconnection of a wiring due to a step shape can be prevented. A cross-sectional view at this stage is <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. A plan view at this stage corresponds to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0120">Note that etching here is not limited to wet etching and dry etching may also be employed. As an etching apparatus used for the dry etching, an etching apparatus using a reactive ion etching method (an RIE method), or a dry etching apparatus using a high-density plasma source such as ECR (electron cyclotron resonance) or ICP (inductively coupled plasma) can be used. As a dry etching apparatus by which uniform electric discharge can be obtained over a wide area as compared to an ICP etching apparatus, there is an ECCP (enhanced capacitively coupled plasma) mode etching apparatus in which an upper electrode is grounded, a high-frequency power source at 13.56 MHz is connected to a lower electrode, and further a low-frequency power source at 3.2 MHz is connected to the lower electrode. This ECCP mode etching apparatus can be applied, for example, even when a substrate of the tenth generation with a side of longer than 3 m is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0121">Here, the resist mask is formed over the second oxide semiconductor film <b>113</b>, whereby the resist mask can be prevented from being in direct contact with the first oxide semiconductor film <b>111</b>, and impurities can be prevented from entering the first oxide semiconductor film <b>111</b> (the oxide semiconductor layer <b>103</b>) from the resist mask. In the case of using O<sub>2 </sub>ashing or a resist stripper for removal of the resist mask, the second oxide semiconductor film <b>113</b> is formed over the first oxide semiconductor film <b>111</b>; thus, contamination of the first oxide semiconductor film <b>111</b> (the oxide semiconductor layer <b>103</b>) can be prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0122">Next, a photolithography process is performed and a resist mask is formed. Then, unnecessary portions of the gate insulating layer <b>102</b> are removed by etching, whereby a contact hole reaching the wiring or the electrode layer which is formed from the same material as the gate electrode layer <b>101</b> is formed. The contact hole is provided for direct connection with a conductive film to be formed later. For example, a contact hole is formed when a thin film transistor whose gate electrode layer is in direct contact with the source or drain electrode layer in the driver circuit portion is formed, or when a terminal that is electrically connected to a gate wiring of a terminal portion is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0123">Next, a conductive film <b>112</b> formed from a metal material is formed using a sputtering method or a vacuum evaporation method over the oxide semiconductor layer <b>103</b>, the buffer layer <b>106</b>, and the gate insulating layer <b>102</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0124">The conductive film <b>112</b> can be formed with a single layer or a stacked layer using the conductive material described in Embodiment 1. For example, in the conductive film <b>112</b>, a first conductive layer and a third conductive layer may be formed using titanium that is a heat-resistant conductive material, and a second conductive layer may be formed using an aluminum alloy including neodymium. The conductive film <b>112</b> has such a structure, whereby low resistance of aluminum is utilized and generation of hillocks can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0125">Next, a photolithography process is performed and a resist mask <b>131</b> is formed over the conductive film <b>112</b>.

Wet etching or dry etching is employed as an etching method at this time. For example, when in the conductive film <b>112</b>, the first and third conductive layers are formed using titanium and the second conductive layer is formed using an aluminum alloy including neodymium, wet etching can be performed using a hydrogen peroxide solution, heated hydrochloric acid, or a nitric acid solution including ammonium fluoride as an etchant. For example, the conductive film <b>112</b> including the first conductive layer, the second conductive layer, and the third conductive layer can be etched collectively with use of KSMF-240 (manufactured by Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.). A cross-sectional view at this stage is <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. Note that, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, since wet etching allows the layers to be etched isotropically, the edge portions of the source and drain electrode layers <b>105</b> <i>a </i>and <b>105</b> <i>b </i>are recessed from the resist mask <b>131</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0126">Through this etching step, an exposed region of the oxide semiconductor layer <b>103</b> is partly etched, so that the oxide semiconductor layer <b>103</b> includes a region which is between the buffer layers <b>106</b> <i>a </i>and <b>106</b> and whose thickness is smaller than that of a region overlapping with the buffer layers <b>106</b> <i>a </i>and <b>106</b> <i>b. </i> </div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0129">In the above photolithography process, two masks are necessary in a step where the oxide semiconductor layer <b>103</b> and the buffer layer <b>106</b> is etched to have an island shape and a step where the source and drain electrode layers <b>105</b> <i>a </i>and <b>105</b> <i>b </i>are formed. However, with use of a resist mask having regions with plural thicknesses (typically, two different thicknesses) which is formed using a multi-tone (high-tone) mask, the number of resist masks can be reduced, resulting in a simplified process and lower costs. A photolithography process using a multi-tone mask is described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A to 6C</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0130">First, starting from the state illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, a conductive film <b>112</b> is formed over the second oxide semiconductor film <b>113</b>.

Note that the reverse sputtering is a method in which voltage is applied to a substrate side in an argon atmosphere with use of an RF power source without applying voltage to a target side, so that plasma is generated to modify the surface of the substrate. Note that instead of an argon atmosphere, a nitrogen atmosphere, a helium atmosphere, or the like may be used. Alternatively, an argon atmosphere to which oxygen, N<sub>2</sub>O, or the like is added may be used. Further alternatively, an argon atmosphere to which Cl<sub>2</sub>, CF<sub>4</sub>, or the like is added may be used. Further, the pressure in the chamber is preferably set to 10<sup>−5 </sup>Pa or lower in advance so that an impurity in the chamber is removed. For example, an argon gas is introduced at a pressure of 0.6 Pa and a gas flow rate of approximately 50 sccm into the chamber where the substrate <b>100</b> is set and reverse sputtering treatment is performed for approximately 3 minutes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0180" num="0190">Next, the high-conductive oxide semiconductor film is subjected to heat treatment in a nitrogen atmosphere. The heat treatment is performed at 200° C. to 600° C. inclusive, preferably 250° C. to 500° C. inclusive. For example, the heat treatment is performed on the substrate <b>100</b> set in a furnace in a nitrogen atmosphere at 350° C. for approximately one hour. Here, an atmosphere including a nitrogen gas at 80 vol % to 100 vol % and a rare gas such as argon at 0 vol % to 20 vol % is preferably employed as the nitrogen atmosphere. The heat treatment in a nitrogen atmosphere progresses from the surface toward the inside of the high-conductive oxide semiconductor film. Therefore, the high-conductive oxide semiconductor film (the high-conductive oxide semiconductor layer <b>300</b>) may have a structure in which the conductivity is changed in stages or successively from the surface toward the substrate side of the high-conductive oxide semiconductor film in some cases. In particular, when time for the heat treatment in a nitrogen atmosphere is not enough, the conductivity of the high-conductive oxide semiconductor film is not increased sufficiently in some cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0181" num="0191">Next, a first oxide semiconductor film <b>111</b> is formed over the high-conductive oxide semiconductor film. Steps after this step are performed in accordance with the manufacturing steps of the thin film transistor described in Embodiment 2 to manufacture a thin film transistor. Note that the high-conductive oxide semiconductor layer <b>300</b> is formed in such a manner that the high-conductive oxide semiconductor film is etched at the same time as etching of the first oxide semiconductor film <b>111</b> and the second oxide semiconductor film <b>113</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0182" num="0192">In the thin film transistor used in this embodiment, the buffer layers having higher conductivity than the oxide semiconductor layer are formed over the oxide semiconductor layer, and the source and drain electrode layers are formed over the buffer layers. Accordingly, the oxide semiconductor layer and the source and drain electrode layers can be electrically connected to each other with the buffer layers interposed therebetween, contact resistance between the oxide semiconductor layer and the source and drain electrode layers can be reduced, and electric characteristics can be stabilized. In addition, the buffer layers are subjected to reverse sputtering and heat treatment in a nitrogen atmosphere, whereby the buffer layers having higher conductivity than the oxide semiconductor layer can be obtained. By employing the stacked-layer structure of the high-conductive oxide semiconductor layer <b>300</b> and the oxide semiconductor layer <b>103</b> for the active layer of the thin film transistor, the conductivity can be increased when the thin film transistor is turned on, and increase of off current can be suppressed when the thin film transistor is turned off.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0227" num="0237">In addition, the signal line driver circuit and the scan line driver circuit can be formed using only the n-channel TFTs described in any of Embodiments 1 to 4. The n-channel TFT described in any of Embodiments 1 to 4 has a high mobility, and thus a driving frequency of a driver circuit can be increased. Further, in the case of the n-channel TFT described in any of Embodiments 1 to 4, since parasitic capacitance is reduced by using an oxide semiconductor layer typified by an In—Ga—Zn—O-based non-single-crystal film, frequency characteristics (also referred to as f characteristics) is favorable. For example, the scan-line driver circuit including the n-channel TFT described in Embodiments 1 to 4 can operate at high speed; therefore, it is possible to increase the frame frequency or to achieve insertion of a black screen, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0228" num="0238">In addition, when the channel width of the transistor in the scan line driver circuit is increased or a plurality of scan line driver circuits are provided, for example, higher frame frequency can be realized. When a plurality of scan line driver circuits are provided, a scan line driver circuit for driving scan lines of even-numbered rows is provided on one side and a scan line driver circuit for driving scan lines of odd-numbered rows is provided on the opposite side; thus, an increase in frame frequency can be realized. Furthermore, the use of the plurality of scan line driver circuits for output of signals to the same scan line is advantageous in increasing the size of a display device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0229" num="0239">Further, when an active matrix light-emitting display device which is an example of a semiconductor device is manufactured, a plurality of thin film transistors are arranged in at least one pixel, and thus a plurality of scan line driver circuits are preferably arranged. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref> illustrates an example of a block diagram of an active matrix light-emitting display device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0230" num="0240">The light-emitting display device illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref> includes, over a substrate <b>5400</b>, a pixel portion <b>5401</b> including a plurality of pixels each provided with a display element, a first scan-line driver circuit <b>5402</b> and a second scan-line driver circuit <b>5404</b> that selects a pixel, and a signal-line driver circuit <b>5403</b> that controls a video signal input to the selected pixel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0231" num="0241">In the case where the video signal input to a pixel of the light-emitting display device illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref> is a digital signal, the pixel is put in a light-emitting state or a non-light-emitting state by switching on/off of a transistor. Thus, grayscale can be displayed using an area grayscale method or a time grayscale method. An area grayscale method refers to a driving method in which one pixel is divided into a plurality of subpixels and the respective subpixels are driven independently based on video signals so that grayscale is displayed. Further, a time grayscale method refers to a driving method in which a period during which a pixel emits light is controlled so that grayscale is displayed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0232" num="0242">Since the response time of a light-emitting element is higher than that of a liquid crystal element or the like, the light-emitting element is more suitable for a time grayscale method than the liquid crystal element. Specifically, in the case of displaying with a time grayscale method, one frame period is divided into a plurality of subframe periods. Then, in accordance with video signals, the light-emitting element in the pixel is brought into a light-emitting state or a non-light-emitting state in each subframe period. By dividing one frame period into a plurality of subframe periods, the total length of time, in which a pixel actually emits light in one frame period, can be controlled by video signals so that grayscale can be displayed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0233" num="0243">Note that in the example of the light-emitting display device illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref>, when two switching TFTs are arranged in one pixel, the first scan-line driver circuit <b>5402</b> generates a signal which is input to a first scan line serving as a gate wiring of one of the two switching TFTs, and the second scan-line driver circuit <b>5404</b> generates a signal which is input to a second scan line serving as a gate wiring of the other of the two switching TFTs. However, one scan-line driver circuit may generate both the signal which is input to the first scan line and the signal which is input to the second scan line. In addition, for example, there is a possibility that a plurality of scan lines used for controlling the operation of the switching element are provided in each pixel, depending on the number of the switching TFTs included in one pixel. In this case, one scan line driver circuit may generate all signals that are input to the plurality of scan lines, or a plurality of scan line driver circuits may generate signals that are input to the plurality of scan lines.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0273" num="0283">The electronic paper in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is an example of a display device using a twisting ball display system. The twisting ball display system refers to a method in which spherical particles each colored in black and white are arranged between a first electrode layer and a second electrode layer which are electrode layers used for a display element, and a potential difference is generated between the first electrode layer and the second electrode layer to control orientation of the spherical particles, so that display is performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0274" num="0284">The thin film transistor <b>581</b> sealed between a substrate <b>580</b> and a substrate <b>596</b> is a thin film transistor with a bottom-gate structure, and a source or drain electrode layer thereof is in contact with a first electrode layer <b>587</b> through an opening formed in insulating layers <b>583</b>, <b>584</b>, and <b>585</b>, whereby the thin film transistor <b>581</b> is electrically connected to the first electrode layer <b>587</b>. Between the first electrode layer <b>587</b> and a second electrode layer <b>588</b>, spherical particles <b>589</b> each having a black region <b>590</b> <i>a</i>, a white region <b>590</b> <i>b</i>, and a cavity <b>594</b> around the regions which is filled with liquid are provided. A space around the spherical particles <b>589</b> is filled with a filler <b>595</b> such as a resin (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>). In this embodiment, the first electrode layer <b>587</b> corresponds to a pixel electrode, and the second electrode layer <b>588</b> corresponds to a common electrode. The second electrode layer <b>588</b> is electrically connected to a common potential line provided over the same substrate as the thin film transistor <b>581</b>. A common connection portion described in Embodiment 2 is used, whereby the second electrode layer <b>588</b> provided on a substrate <b>596</b> and the common potential line can be electrically connected to each other through the conductive particles arranged between a pair of substrates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0275" num="0285">Further, instead of the twisting ball, an electrophoretic element can also be used. A microcapsule having a diameter of approximately 10 μm to 200 μm in which transparent liquid, positively charged white microparticles, and negatively charged black microparticles are encapsulated, is used. In the microcapsule which is provided between the first electrode layer and the second electrode layer, when an electric field is applied by the first electrode layer and the second electrode layer, the white microparticles and the black microparticles move to opposite sides, so that white or black can be displayed. A display element using this principle is an electrophoretic display element and is generally called electronic paper. The electrophoretic display element has higher reflectance than a liquid crystal display element, and thus, an auxiliary light is unnecessary, power consumption is low, and a display portion can be recognized in a dim place. In addition, even when power is not supplied to the display portion, an image which has been displayed once can be maintained. Accordingly, a displayed image can be stored even if a semiconductor device having a display function (which may be referred to simply as a display device or a semiconductor device provided with a display device) is distanced from an electric wave source.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0276" num="0286">In this way, an electrophoretic display element utilizes a so-called dielectrophoretic effect by which a substance having a high dielectric constant moves to a high-electric field region. An electrophoretic display device using an electrophoretic display element does not need to use a polarizer, which is required in a liquid crystal display device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0277" num="0287">A solution in which the above microcapsules are dispersed in a solvent is referred to as electronic ink. This electronic ink can be printed on a surface of glass, plastic, cloth, paper, or the like. Furthermore, by using a color filter or particles that have a pigment, color display can also be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0278" num="0288">In addition, if a plurality of the above microcapsules is arranged as appropriate over an active matrix substrate so as to be interposed between two electrodes, an active matrix display device can be completed, and display can be performed by application of an electric field to the microcapsules.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0282" num="0292">In this embodiment, an example of a light-emitting display device will be described as the semiconductor device to which the thin film transistor described in any of Embodiments 1 to 4 is applied. As a display element included in a display device, a light-emitting element utilizing electroluminescence is described here. Light-emitting elements utilizing electroluminescence are classified according to whether a light-emitting material is an organic compound or an inorganic compound. In general, the former is referred to as an organic EL element, and the latter is referred to as an inorganic EL element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0283" num="0293">In an organic EL element, by application of voltage to a light-emitting element, electrons and holes are separately injected from a pair of electrodes into a layer containing a light-emitting organic compound, and current flows. The carriers (electrons and holes) are recombined, and thus, the light-emitting organic compound is excited. The light-emitting organic compound returns to a ground state from the excited state, thereby emitting light. Owing to such a mechanism, this light-emitting element is referred to as a current-excitation light-emitting element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0284" num="0294">The inorganic EL elements are classified according to their element structures into a dispersion-type inorganic EL element and a thin-film inorganic EL element. A dispersion-type inorganic EL element has a light-emitting layer where particles of a light-emitting material are dispersed in a binder, and its light emission mechanism is donor-acceptor recombination type light emission that utilizes a donor level and an acceptor level. A thin-film inorganic EL element has a structure where a light-emitting layer is sandwiched between dielectric layers, which are further sandwiched between electrodes, and its light emission mechanism is localized type light emission that utilizes inner-shell electron transition of metal ions. Note that an example of an organic EL element as a light-emitting element is described here.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0290" num="0300">In the case of a voltage-input voltage driving method, a video signal is input to the gate of the driver transistor <b>6402</b> so that the driver transistor <b>6402</b> is in either of two states of being sufficiently turned on or turned off.

The IGZO film and the IGZON film, which had been formed, were subjected to reverse sputtering treatment, heat treatment in an air atmosphere, and heat treatment in a nitrogen atmosphere. After each heat treatment, the sheet resistance values of the IGZO film and the IGZON film were measured and the conductivity thereof was calculated. Each step of this example is described in detail below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0352" num="0362">First, the glass substrates were cleaned with pure water. Note that product name EAGLE 2000 (manufactured by Corning Inc., alkali-free glass) was used for the glass substrate. Next, the IGZO film and the IGZON film were each formed over the glass substrate. The IGZO film was formed using a target of an oxide semiconductor of In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:ZnO=1:1:1 under conditions where the distance between the substrate and the target was 60 mm, the pressure was 0.4 Pa, direct current (DC) power was 0.5 kW, the film thickness was 50 nm, the flow rate ratio of film formation gasses of Ar: O<sub>2 </sub>was 30:15 (sccm), and the film formation temperature was room temperature. The IGZON film was formed under conditions similar to those of the IGZO film except that the flow rate ratio of film formation gases of Ar to N<sub>2 </sub>was 35:5 (sccm). Note that the IGZO film and the IGZON film were each formed to a thickness of approximately 50 nm, and the actual thickness was measured by an ellipsometer after the formation. Then, the sheet resistance values of the IGZO film and the IGZON film were measured by a sheet resistance measuring apparatus. Note that conductivity can be obtained by a sheet resistance value and a film thickness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0353" num="0363">Next, the IGZO film and the IGZON were subjected to reverse sputtering treatment under conditions where an Ar gas flow rate was 50 sccm, the pressure was 0.6 Pa, direct current (DC) power was 0.2 kW, and treatment time was 3 minutes. After the reverse sputtering, the sheet resistance values of the IGZO film and the IGZON film were measured and the conductivity thereof was calculated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0354" num="0364">Next, the IGZO film and the IGZON film were repeatedly subjected to heat treatment in an air atmosphere (hereinafter referred to as air baking) under conditions where a treatment temperature was 350° C. and treatment time was 1 hour, and heat treatment in a nitrogen atmosphere (hereinafter referred to as nitrogen baking) under the same conditions of a treatment temperature and treatment time. The heat treatments were performed in two ways, a process A and a process B. In the process A, after the reverse sputtering treatment, air baking, nitrogen baking, second air baking, and second nitrogen baking were performed in this order. In the process B, after the reverse sputtering treatment, nitrogen baking, air baking, and second nitrogen baking were performed in this order.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0357" num="0367">Table 1 shows the conductivity of the IGZO film and the IGZON film in the process A, and Table 2 shows the conductivity of the IGZO film and the IGZON film in the process B. The unit for the conductivity is S/cm both in Table 1 and in Table 2. Note that the conductivity of a film whose sheet resistance value is too high to be measured by the sheet resistance measuring apparatus is represented as &lt;&lt;0.01 S/cm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0358" num="0368">In each of Table 1 and Table 2, when the IGZO film and the IGZON film which were formed through the same process are compared to each other, the conductivity of the IGZON film is higher than that of the IGZO film. In addition, after the reverse sputtering treatment, the conductivity of the IGZO film and the IGZON film is increased. The conductivity of the IGZO film and the IGZON film is reduced after the air baking and increased after the nitrogen baking. In particular, the conductivity of the IGZO film and the IGZON film after the first nitrogen baking in the process B shown in Table 2 is greatly high as compared to that of the others.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0359" num="0369">When the conductivity of the IGZO film and the IGZON film after the first nitrogen baking in the process A shown in Table 1 and that of the IGZO film and the IGZON film after the second nitrogen baking in the process B shown in Table 2 are compared to each other, the conductivity of each of the IGZO film and the IGZON film in the latter case is higher than that in the former case, even though the conductivity becomes 0.01 S/cm or less after the air baking in both the processes A and B. This shows that the conductivity of the IGZO film and the IGZON film is decreased when the atmosphere of the first heat treatment after the film formation is an air atmosphere, and increased when the atmosphere is a nitrogen atmosphere. Furthermore, the following is presumed: even when heat treatments in different atmospheres are performed a plurality of times after the film formation, effect of subsequent heat treatment in a different atmosphere is lowered depending on the atmosphere of the first heat treatment after the film formation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0360" num="0370">Accordingly, in any of the above embodiments, an In—Ga—Zn—O—N-based non-single-crystal film formed in an atmosphere of an argon gas and a nitrogen gas is preferable as the buffer layer. In addition, the In—Ga—Zn—O—N-based non-single-crystal film which is subjected to reverse sputtering treatment and heat treatment in a nitrogen atmosphere is preferable. By using such a film, the conductivity of the buffer layer can be increased, an ohmic contact can be formed between the oxide semiconductor layer and the source and drain electrode layers, and electric characteristics of the thin film transistor can be stabilized. In the case where the oxide semiconductor layer is subjected to heat treatment in an air atmosphere, it is preferable that the oxide semiconductor layer is subjected to the heat treatment in a nitrogen atmosphere in advance of the heat treatment in an air atmosphere. Alternatively, when an In—Ga—Zn—O-based non-single-crystal film which is formed in an atmosphere of an argon gas and an oxygen gas and subjected to heat treatment in an air atmosphere is used as the oxide semiconductor layer, the conductivity of the oxide semiconductor layer can be reduced and off current can be reduced. Further alternatively, when an In—Ga—Zn—O-based non-single-crystal film which is formed in an atmosphere of an argon gas and an oxygen gas and subjected to heat treatment in a nitrogen atmosphere is used, the conductivity of the oxide semiconductor layer can be increased and on current can be increased. Accordingly, an atmosphere of heat treatment for the oxide semiconductor layer may be changed depending on a purpose.</div>
