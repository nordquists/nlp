<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">Embodiments will be described below with reference to drawings. The embodiments can be implemented with various modes, and it will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art that modes and details can be changed in various ways without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Thus, the present invention should not be interpreted as being limited to the following description of the embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">In the drawings, the size, the layer thickness, or the region is exaggerated for clarity in some cases. Therefore, embodiments of the present invention are not limited to such a scale. Note that the drawings are schematic views showing ideal examples, and embodiments of the present invention are not limited to shapes or values shown in the drawings. For example, the following can be included: variation in signal, voltage, or current due to noise or difference in timing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">In this specification and the like, a transistor is an element having at least three terminals: a gate, a drain, and a source. The transistor includes a channel region between the drain (a drain terminal, a drain region, or a drain electrode) and the source (a source terminal, a source region, or a source electrode) and current can flow through the drain, the channel region, and the source.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">Here, since the source and the drain of the transistor change depending on the structure, the operating condition, and the like of the transistor, it is difficult to define which is a source or a drain. Thus, a portion that functions as a source or a portion that functions as a drain is not referred to as a source or a drain in some cases. Instead, one of the source and the drain might be referred to as a first electrode, and the other of the source and the drain might be referred to as a second electrode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">Note that in this specification, ordinal numbers such as “first”, “second”, and “third” are used in order to avoid confusion among components, and thus do not limit the number of the components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">In this specification, the expression “A and B are connected” means the case where A and B are electrically connected to each other in addition to the case where A and B are directly connected to each other. Here, the expression “A and B are electrically connected” means the case where electric signals can be transmitted and received between A and B when an object having any electric action exists between A and B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">Note that, for example, the case where a source (or a first terminal or the like) of a transistor is electrically connected to X through (or not through) Z<b>1</b> and a drain (or a second terminal or the like) of the transistor is electrically connected to Y through (or not through) Z<b>2</b>, or the case where a source (or a first terminal or the like) of a transistor is directly connected to one part of Z<b>1</b> and another part of Z<b>1</b> is directly connected to X while a drain (or a second terminal or the like) of the transistor is directly connected to one part of Z<b>2</b> and another part of Z<b>2</b> is directly connected to Y, can be expressed by using any of the following expressions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">The expressions include, for example, “X, Y, a source (or a first terminal or the like) of a transistor, and a drain (or a second terminal or the like) of the transistor are electrically connected to each other, and X the source (or the first terminal or the like) of the transistor, the drain (or the second terminal or the like) of the transistor, and Y are electrically connected to each other in this order”, “a source (or a first terminal or the like) of a transistor is electrically connected to X a drain (or a second terminal or the like) of the transistor is electrically connected to Y, and X the source (or the first terminal or the like) of the transistor, the drain (or the second terminal or the like) of the transistor, and Y are electrically connected to each other in this order”, and “X is electrically connected to Y through a source (or a first terminal or the like) and a drain (or a second terminal or the like) of a transistor, and X, the source (or the first terminal or the like) of the transistor, the drain (or the second terminal or the like) of the transistor, and Y are provided to be connected in this order”. When the connection order in a circuit configuration is defined by an expression similar to the above examples, a source (or a first terminal or the like) and a drain (or a second terminal or the like) of a transistor can be distinguished from each other to specify the technical scope.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">Other examples of the expressions include, “a source (or a first terminal or the like) of a transistor is electrically connected to X through at least a first connection path, the first connection path does not include a second connection path, the second connection path is a path between the source (or the first terminal or the like) of the transistor and a drain (or a second terminal or the like) of the transistor, Z<b>1</b> is on the first connection path, the drain (or the second terminal or the like) of the transistor is electrically connected to Y through at least a third connection path, the third connection path does not include the second connection path, and Z<b>2</b> is on the third connection path”. It is also possible to use the expression “a source (or a first terminal or the like) of a transistor is electrically connected to X through at least Z<b>1</b> on a first connection path, the first connection path does not include a second connection path, the second connection path includes a connection path through the transistor, a drain (or a second terminal or the like) of the transistor is electrically connected to Y through at least Z<b>2</b> on a third connection path, and the third connection path does not include the second connection path”. Still another example of the expression is “a source (or a first terminal or the like) of a transistor is electrically connected to X through at least Z<b>1</b> on a first electrical path, the first electrical path does not include a second electrical path, the second electrical path is an electrical path from the source (or the first terminal or the like) of the transistor to a drain (or a second terminal or the like) of the transistor, the drain (or the second terminal or the like) of the transistor is electrically connected to Y through at least Z<b>2</b> on a third electrical path, the third electrical path does not include a fourth electrical path, and the fourth electrical path is an electrical path from the drain (or the second terminal or the like) of the transistor to the source (or the first terminal or the like) of the transistor”. When the connection path in a circuit structure is defined by an expression similar to the above examples, a source (or a first terminal or the like) and a drain (or a second terminal or the like) of a transistor can be distinguished from each other to specify the technical scope.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">Note that these expressions are examples and the expression is not limited to these examples. Here, X, Y, Z<b>1</b>, and Z<b>2</b> each denote an object (e.g., a device, an element, a circuit, a wiring, an electrode, a terminal, a conductive film, and a layer).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">Note that in this specification, terms for describing arrangement, such as “over” and “under”, are used for convenience to describe the positional relation between components with reference to drawings. Further, the positional relation between components is changed as appropriate in accordance with a direction in which each component is described. Thus, the positional relation is not limited to that described with a term used in this specification and can be explained with another term as appropriate depending on the situation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">The positional relation of circuit blocks in a block diagram is specified for description. Even when a block diagram shows that different functions are achieved by different circuit blocks, one circuit block may be actually configured to achieve the different functions. Functions of circuit blocks in a diagram are specified for description, and even when a diagram shows one circuit block performing given processing, a plurality of circuit blocks may be actually provided to perform the processing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">In this specification, the term “parallel” indicates that the angle formed between two straight lines is greater than or equal to −10° and less than or equal to 10°, and accordingly also includes the case where the angle is greater than or equal to −5° and less than or equal to 5°. The term “perpendicular” indicates that the angle formed between two straight lines is greater than or equal to 80° and less than or equal to 100°, and accordingly also includes the case where the angle is greater than or equal to 85° and less than or equal to 95°.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">In this specification, trigonal and rhombohedral crystal systems are included in a hexagonal crystal system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">Note that the terms “film” and “layer” can be interchanged with each other depending on the case or circumstances. For example, the term “conductive layer” can be changed into the term “conductive film” in some cases. Also, the term “insulating film” can be changed into the term “insulating layer” in some cases.</div>

Such an operation is possible when the potentials of the nodes FN<b>3</b>, FN<b>2</b>, and FN<b>1</b> are set to VPR, VFR+Δv<b>1</b>, and v<b>1</b>·c<b>2</b>/(c<b>2</b>+c<b>3</b>+cg)+Vth+Δv, respectively, in the beginning of each operation period for obtaining imaging data (corresponding to the periods from Time t<b>11</b> to Time t<b>12</b>, from Time t<b>21</b> to Time t<b>22</b>, from Time t<b>31</b> to Time t<b>32</b>, from Time t<b>41</b> to Time t<b>42</b>, and from Time t<b>51</b> to Time t<b>52</b>) by setting the signal line PR at “H”, the signal line FR at “L”, and the signal line TX at “H. While the nodes of FN<b>1</b> to FN<b>3</b> are set at the above potentials, a difference with the first imaging data can be detected. That is, a difference can be detected even for a very gentle change which cannot be detected by image comparison of pieces of imaging data obtained in sequential frames. Furthermore, the signal line SEL is set at “H” in the state where the nodes are set at the above potentials, whereby a signal corresponding to the first imaging data can be read out. That is, imaging data and difference data can be obtained with the same pixel circuit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0171" num="0170"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a block diagram showing a configuration of an imaging device including the pixels PIX_B illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. The imaging device illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> includes the pixel portion <b>101</b> including the plurality of pixels PIX_B arranged in matrix, an analog processing circuit Analog, the A/D converter circuit ADC which is a digital processing circuit, the column driver CDRV, and the row driver RDRV.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0172" num="0171">The analog processing circuit Analog executes analog data processing on pieces of imaging data which are analog data output from the pixels PIX_B. Specifically, the analog processing circuit Analog detects a current value corresponding to a difference between pieces of imaging data output from the pixels PIX_B. As a result of the detection, in the case where the current value is different from a reference current value, a trigger signal (represented as TRIG) is generated. The A/D converter circuit ADC, the column driver CDRV, and the row driver RDRV have the same configurations as those described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0173" num="0172">Next, operations of the imaging device including the pixels PIX_B in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> are described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and FIGS. <b>7</b>A<b>1</b> to <b>7</b>C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0174" num="0173">First, an operation of a first mode is described (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). In the first mode, comparison of a current value corresponding to the difference in imaging data with a reference current value is performed in the analog processing circuit Analog, whereby the presence or absence of a difference between the first imaging data and the second imaging data which are taken by the pixel PIX_B is detected. As a result of the analog processing, when there is no difference between the first imaging data and the second imaging data, i.e., when a trigger signal is not generated, the analog processing continues. In contrast, when there is a difference between the first imaging data and the second imaging data as a result of the analog processing, i.e., a trigger signal is generated, the mode is switched to a second mode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0175" num="0174">For example, in the case where both the first imaging data and the second imaging data are data of an image of a clump of trees (see FIGS. <b>7</b>A<b>1</b> and <b>7</b>A<b>2</b>), the difference therebetween is zero. Thus, a trigger signal is not generated. In contrast, in the case where the first imaging data is data of an image of a clump of trees (see FIG. <b>7</b>B<b>1</b>) and the second imaging data is data of an image of a clump of trees and a person (see FIG. <b>7</b>B<b>2</b>), the difference therebetween is not zero, and a trigger signal is generated accordingly. In response to the generation of the trigger signal, the mode of the imaging device is switched from the first mode to the second mode. Note that in the drawings, the first imaging data and the second imaging data show the same scenery but differ in time of taking the image. Therefore, the first imaging data may be represented as imaging data in a first state, and the second imaging data may be represented as imaging data in a second state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0176" num="0175">Then, an operation of the second mode is described (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). In the second mode, third imaging data taken by the pixel PIX_B is converted into digital data by A/D conversion. For example, in the case where the third imaging data is data of an image of a clump of trees and a person (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>), the third imaging data is converted into digital data and details of the data are analyzed, whereby detailed information on the person in the data can be obtained. Note that for the analysis of the imaging data, digital processing using image processing software of a computer is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0177" num="0176">Next, an operation for switching the mode from the second mode to the first mode is described (see Step <b>110</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). This is executable by providing conditions in advance. Examples of the conditions include passage of a predetermined period of time and input of a control signal for terminating the digital processing. When the conditions are satisfied, the mode is switched from the second mode to the first mode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0178" num="0177">In the imaging device including the pixel PIX_B illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, in the first mode, digital processing which consumes a vast amount of power, such as A/D conversion, is not performed and only minimum analog processing for generating a trigger signal is performed; therefore, power consumption can be reduced. Furthermore, in the second mode, a cause of generation of a trigger signal, i.e., the difference between the first imaging data and the second imaging data can be checked in detail by digital processing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0179" num="0178">Such a configuration makes it possible to provide an imaging device capable of obtaining highly accurate imaging data. Furthermore, in the imaging device of this embodiment, in the first mode, digital processing which consumes a vast amount of power is not performed and only minimum analog processing for generating a trigger signal is performed; therefore, power consumption can be reduced. Furthermore, in the second mode, a cause of generation of a trigger signal, i.e., the difference between the first imaging data and the second imaging data can be checked in detail by digital processing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0180" num="0179">Note that the first imaging data is output from Time t<b>05</b> to t<b>06</b> in this embodiment; however, in the case where it is enough to obtain only difference data between the first imaging data and the second imaging data, that is, in the case where the first imaging data need not be output, the operations from Time t<b>03</b> to Time t<b>06</b> can be skipped. Note that even in the case where the operations from Time t<b>03</b> to Time t<b>06</b> are skipped, when the signal line PR is set at “H”, the signal line FR is set at “L”, and the signal line TX is set at “H”, the potentials of the nodes FN<b>3</b>, FN<b>2</b>, and FN<b>1</b> are set at VPR, VFR+Δv<b>1</b>, and v<b>1</b>·c<b>2</b>/(c<b>2</b>+c<b>3</b>+cg)+Vth+Δv, respectively, in each of the periods from Time t<b>1</b> to Time t<b>12</b>, from Time t<b>21</b> to Time t<b>22</b>, from Time t<b>31</b> to Time t<b>32</b>, from Time t<b>41</b> to Time t<b>42</b>, and from Time t<b>51</b> to Time t<b>52</b>.

<heading id="h-0009">Embodiment 4</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0207" num="0206">In this embodiment, a modified example of the pixel described in the above embodiment is described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0208" num="0207"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> illustrates a modification example of the circuit diagram in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> in which the semiconductor layers of the transistors are each formed using an oxide semiconductor. In a pixel PIX_C in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, the transistors M<b>1</b> to M<b>5</b> each include an oxide semiconductor in the semiconductor layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0209" num="0208">Note that “OS” is written beside each circuit symbol of the transistors including an oxide semiconductor (also referred to as OS transistors) in the circuit diagram to clearly demonstrate that the transistors each include an oxide semiconductor in the semiconductor layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0210" num="0209">The OS transistor has a characteristic of extremely low off-state current, which can broaden the dynamic range of imaging. In the circuit in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, an increase in the intensity of light entering the photodiode PD reduces the potential of the node FD<b>1</b>. Since the OS transistor has an extremely low off-state current, a current corresponding to the gate potential can be accurately output even when the gate potential is extremely low. Thus, it is possible to broaden the detection range of illuminance, i.e., the dynamic range.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0211" num="0210">Since a period during which charge can be retained in the node FD<b>1</b> can be extremely long owing to the extremely low off-state current characteristics of the OS transistor, a global shutter system can be used without a complicated circuit configuration and operation method, and thus, an image with little distortion can be easily obtained even in the case of a moving object. Furthermore, for the same reason, exposure time (a period for conducting charge accumulation operation) can be long; thus, the imaging device is suitable for imaging even in a low illuminance environment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0212" num="0211">The OS transistor has lower temperature dependence of change in electrical characteristics than a Si transistor. Therefore, the OS transistor can be used at an extremely wide range of temperatures. Thus, an imaging device and a semiconductor device which include OS transistors are suitable for use in automobiles, aircrafts, and spacecrafts.</div>

A configuration in which peripheral circuits are formed using only OS transistors does not need a process for forming Si transistors; therefore, the configuration is effective in reducing the cost of the imaging device. Furthermore, a configuration in which peripheral circuits are formed using only OS transistors and p-channel Si transistors does not need a process for forming n-channel Si transistors; therefore, the configuration is effective in reducing the cost of the imaging device. Furthermore, since the peripheral circuits can be CMOS circuits, such a configuration is effective in reducing the power consumption of the peripheral circuits, that is, reducing the power consumption of the imaging device.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0260" num="0259">The off-state current of an OS transistor can be reduced by reducing the concentration of impurities in an oxide semiconductor to make the oxide semiconductor intrinsic or substantially intrinsic. The term “substantially intrinsic” refers to a state where an oxide semiconductor has a carrier density lower than 1×10<sup>17</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, preferably lower than 1×10<sup>15</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, further preferably lower than 1×10<sup>13</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>. In the oxide semiconductor, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon, silicon, and a metal element other than a main component are impurities.

Furthermore, a transistor including the oxide semiconductor enables an extremely low off-state current.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0262" num="0261">For example, the OS transistor with reduced off-state current can exhibit a normalized off-state current per micrometer in channel width of less than or equal to 1×10<sup>−18 </sup>A, preferably less than or equal to 1×10<sup>−21 </sup>A, further preferably less than or equal to 1×10<sup>−24 </sup>A at room temperature (approximately 25° C.); or less than or equal to 1×10<sup>−15 </sup>A, preferably less than or equal to 1×10<sup>−18 </sup>A, further preferably less than or equal to 1×10<sup>−21 </sup>A at 85° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0263" num="0262">Note that the off-state current of an n-channel transistor refers to a current that flows between a source and a drain when the transistor is off.

As a result, the threshold voltage of the transistor shifts in the negative direction. Therefore, it is preferable that, after formation of the oxide semiconductor film, dehydration treatment (dehydrogenation treatment) be performed to remove hydrogen or moisture from the oxide semiconductor film so that the oxide semiconductor film is highly purified to contain impurities as little as possible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0269" num="0268">Note that oxygen in the oxide semiconductor film is also reduced by the dehydration treatment (dehydrogenation treatment) in some cases.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0270" num="0269">In this manner, hydrogen or moisture is removed from the oxide semiconductor film by the dehydration treatment (dehydrogenation treatment) and oxygen vacancies therein are filled by the oxygen adding treatment, whereby the oxide semiconductor film can be turned into an i-type (intrinsic) or substantially i-type (intrinsic) oxide semiconductor film which is extremely close to an i-type oxide semiconductor film. Note that “substantially intrinsic” means that the oxide semiconductor film contains extremely few (close to zero) carriers derived from a donor and has a carrier density of lower than or equal to 1×10<sup>17</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, lower than or equal to 1×10<sup>16</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, lower than or equal to 1×10<sup>15</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, lower than or equal to 1×10<sup>14</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, or lower than or equal to 1×10<sup>13</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0273" num="0272">In this embodiment, a case where the imaging device described in Embodiment 2 is used for a monitoring device (also referred to as a monitoring system) is described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0274" num="0273"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a block diagram illustrating the structural example of the monitoring device of this embodiment. The monitoring device includes a camera <b>200</b>, a memory device <b>211</b>, a display device <b>212</b>, and an alarm device <b>213</b>. The camera <b>200</b> includes an imaging device <b>220</b>. The camera <b>200</b>, the memory device <b>211</b>, the display device <b>212</b>, and the alarm device <b>213</b> are functionally connected to one another. An image captured by the camera <b>200</b> is stored in the memory device <b>211</b> and displayed on the display device <b>212</b>. The alarm device <b>213</b> gives an alarm to an administrator when the camera <b>200</b> detects movement.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0275" num="0274">In the imaging device <b>220</b>, a trigger signal is generated when the camera <b>200</b> detects difference data. Analog processing continues when the trigger signal is not generated, whereas digital processing is performed when the trigger signal is generated. Therefore, it is not necessary to continuously perform digital processing, which consumes a vast amount of power; thus, power consumption can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0276" num="0275">For example, the first state is set to a state where there is surely no intruder entering the monitored area, and the second state is set to the current state. Here, when there is not intruder in the state where the imaging device <b>220</b> operates in the first mode, the first imaging data is the same as the second data, and thus difference data is zero. Accordingly, the result of a sum-of-absolute-difference operation performed on the difference data read from each pixel in the analog processing circuit is zero, and no trigger signal is generated. In contrast, when there is an intruder, the first imaging data is different from the second imaging data, and thus, difference data is infinite. Accordingly, the result of a sum-of-absolute-difference operation performed on the difference data read from each pixel in the analog processing circuit is finite, and the trigger signal is generated. The mode of the imaging device <b>220</b> is switched to the second mode in response to the generation of the trigger signal, third imaging data is converted into digital data in the digital processing circuit, and detailed analysis of the captured image is executed by digital processing with a personal computer or the like. As a result, detailed information on the intruder can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0277" num="0276">Therefore, in a period in which movement in the image is not detected, the imaging device <b>220</b> does not execute digital processing. As a result, the power consumption in the camera <b>200</b> can be reduced. Furthermore, since the memory capacity of the memory device <b>211</b> can be saved by image data in the period in which no movement is detected, recording for a longer period is possible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0278" num="0277">Note that the alarm device <b>213</b> may give an alarm to those around the alarm device <b>213</b> when the trigger signal is generated. Alternatively, whether or not an alarm is given may be determined on the basis of a result of comparison by a certification system.</div>
