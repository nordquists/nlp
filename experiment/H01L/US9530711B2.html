<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Silicon-on-insulator is the process of fabricating silicon based devices, such as complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) field effect transistors (FET) on top of a layer of electrically insulating material, such as an oxide. The layer of oxide is on top of a bulk silicon substrate in an integrated circuit (IC) chip and acts as an electrical barrier between the devices (e.g., FETs) and the bulk silicon. The layer of oxide greatly reduces electrical leakage from the devices, but also greatly reduces heat flow from these devices. Accumulation of heat within a device, such as a FET, can reduce the performance and/or useful lifetime of the device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Heat can be removed from a FET using wiring that is formed over the FET as a heat path for transferring heat away from the FET and out of the top of the chip. Such wiring, however, typically has a primary purpose of carrying electric current within the chip. The electric current generates its own heat within the wiring through resistive heating, and the combination of resistive heating and heat transfer from FETs can degrade the current handling capacity of the wiring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, there exists a need in the art to overcome the deficiencies and limitations described hereinabove.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention relates to testing integrated circuit devices and, more particularly, to methods and systems for dissipating heat in silicon-on-insulator semiconductor devices. According to aspects of the invention, a thermally conductive and electrically insulative substrate contact is formed between an SOI island and a substrate, e.g., through a buried insulator layer. In embodiments, the substrate contact is formed with a same or similar material as the SOI island and the substrate, e.g., silicon, which has a higher thermal conductivity than the material of the buried insulator layer, e.g., oxide. Moreover, a portion of the SOI island surrounding the substrate contact is doped to provide electrical isolation from a device (e.g., a FET) formed in another portion of the SOI island. In this manner, implementations of the invention provide a thermal path from the SOI island to the substrate so that the substrate can serve as a heat sink for a device (e.g., a FET) formed in the SOI island.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with aspects of the invention, there is a thermal channel/heat sink implemented in a silicon-on-insulator semiconductor manufacturing process, comprising: a thermal via (e.g., substrate contact) formed in a first buried oxide layer and contacting a high resistance silicon substrate on a first end and a SOI device contact on a second end. The thermal via comprises an electrically resistive and thermally conducting material. Implementations of the invention take advantage of the existing thin SOI silicon layer and substrate contact through the buried oxide later (e.g., SiO<sub>2</sub>) to provide a heat sink for the device without requiring additional layers to channel the heat from that device to the bulk silicon beneath. By adjusting the doping of these channels, the channels can be kept thermally conductive, while at the same time making the channel electrically resistive, which prevents loading down the device with parasitics often associated with the other heat sinking methods. Methods in accordance with aspects of the invention allow heavy doping of these same channels to provide a good electrical ground when desired. Implementations of the invention may be applied to any front-end-of-line device, can be adapted to thick-film SOI, and can employ npn junctions to further isolate the device from the substrate contact. In embodiments, heat build-up in the SOI device can be greatly reduced by etching around the active device and through the buried insulator layer so that a substrate contact comprising thermally conductive material (e.g., polysilicon, Tungsten, Copper, etc.) can be formed. The substrate contact permits the heat generated by the SOI device to be channeled through the buried insulator layer to the bulk silicon substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-18</figref> show processing steps and respective structures in accordance with aspects of the invention. Specifically, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an exemplary SOI wafer <b>10</b> employed as an intermediate structure in implementations of the invention. The SOI wafer <b>10</b> has a bulk semiconductor substrate <b>15</b>, which is typically a bulk silicon substrate, a buried insulator layer <b>20</b> formed on the substrate <b>15</b>, and a semiconductor layer <b>25</b>, which is typically a silicon layer formed on the buried insulator layer <b>20</b>. The SOI wafer <b>10</b> may be fabricated using techniques understood by those skilled in the art. For example, the SOI wafer <b>10</b> may be formed by conventional processes including, but not limited to, oxygen implantation (e.g., SIMOX), wafer bonding, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">The constituent materials of the SOI wafer <b>10</b> may be selected based on the desired end use application of the semiconductor device. For example, the substrate <b>15</b> may be composed of any suitable material including, but not limited to, Si, SiGe, SiGeC, SiC, GE alloys, GaAs, InAs, InP, and other III/V or II/VI compound semiconductors. In a particular exemplary embodiment, the substrate <b>15</b> is a high-resistivity silicon substrate having a resistivity of about 1000 ohm-cm or greater. The buried insulator layer <b>20</b> may be composed of oxide, such as SiO<sub>2</sub>, and may be referred to as a buried oxide (BOX) layer <b>20</b>. Moreover, although the SOI wafer is referred to as “silicon on insulator,” the semiconductor layer <b>25</b> is not limited to silicon. Instead, the semiconductor layer <b>25</b> may be comprised of various semiconductor materials, such as, for example, Si, SiGe, SiC, SiGeC, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">In embodiments, the SOI wafer <b>10</b> has a thickness of about 700 μm, with the BOX layer <b>20</b> having a thickness in a range of about 0.4 μm to about 1 μm, and the semiconductor layer <b>25</b> having a thickness in a range of about 0.1 μm to about 0.2 μm, and more particularly about 0.145 μm. However, the invention is not limited to these dimensions, and the various portions of the SOI wafer may have any desired thicknesses based upon the intended use of the final semiconductor device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, shallow trench isolation (STI) structures <b>30</b> are formed in the wafer <b>10</b>. The STI <b>30</b> may be conventional shallow trench isolation structures formed using conventional semiconductor fabrication processes and materials. For example, the STIs <b>30</b> may be formed by arranging a photoresist material on the semiconductor layer <b>25</b>, exposing and developing the photoresist, etching an STI trench in the semiconductor layer <b>25</b> through the patterned photoresist (e.g., using a reactive ion etch (RIE) process), stripping the photoresist, filling the trench with an STI material (e.g., SiO<sub>2</sub>), and planarizing the top surface of the structure (e.g., via chemical mechanical polish (CMP)). The STI <b>30</b> locally replaces a portion of the semiconductor layer <b>25</b>. The remaining portion of the semiconductor layer <b>25</b> that is surrounded by the STI <b>30</b> is referred to as an island <b>35</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a substrate contact trench <b>40</b> is formed through the island <b>35</b> and the BOX layer <b>20</b> to the substrate <b>15</b>. In embodiments, the substrate contact trench <b>40</b> is formed using one or more lithography (e.g., masking and etching) processes. For example, a photoresist material may be formed on the wafer <b>10</b> and patterned into a mask, and one or more RIE processes may be used to etch portions of the wafer <b>10</b> through an opening in the mask. A respective RIE process may be performed for etching each of the island <b>35</b> and the BOX layer <b>20</b>, with each respective RIE process being tailored to the material of the layer/feature being etched. Additionally, a single RIE process may be used to etch more than one layer/feature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">The substrate contact trench <b>40</b> may have any desired size and shape, and more than one substrate contact trench <b>40</b> may be formed at different locations in the island <b>35</b>. In accordance with aspects of the invention, the substrate contact trench <b>40</b> may be located anywhere within the island <b>35</b> outside of a footprint (e.g., in top-down plan view) where a FET will later be formed in the island <b>35</b>. In embodiments, the substrate contact trench <b>40</b> is formed through the entire depth of the BOX layer <b>20</b> to expose an upper surface of the substrate <b>15</b>, and may optionally extend into the substrate <b>15</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">As depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a substrate contact <b>45</b> is formed in the substrate contact trench <b>40</b> and in direct physical contact with the substrate <b>15</b>. According to aspects of the invention, the substrate contact <b>45</b> is composed of a material that has a thermal conductivity that is substantially greater than the thermal conductivity of the material of the BOX layer <b>20</b>. In embodiments, the BOX layer is composed of SiO<sub>2</sub>, which has a nominal thermal conductivity of about 0.1 W/(cm·K), and the substrate contact <b>45</b> is composed of silicon, which has a nominal thermal conductivity of about 1.5 W/(cm·K).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">The substrate contact <b>45</b> may be formed using conventional semiconductor fabrication techniques. In embodiments, the substrate contact <b>45</b> is composed of undoped polysilicon and is formed using a low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) process, although other high thermal conductivity materials may be provided using other formation processes. The top surface of the wafer <b>10</b> may be planarized, e.g., using CMP, after forming the substrate contact <b>45</b> in the substrate contact trench <b>40</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the formation of a mask <b>50</b> on the wafer <b>10</b> with an opening defined over a portion of the island <b>35</b> containing the substrate contact <b>45</b>. The mask <b>50</b> may be formed using conventional materials and techniques, such as photolithography.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">Still referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the unmasked portion of the island <b>35</b> is doped as indicated by arrows “P”. The doping may be performed using conventional techniques, such as ion implantation of p-type impurities (e.g., boron) or n-type impurities (e.g., arsenic or phosphorous). In accordance with aspects of the invention, the type of impurity implanted in the unmasked portion of the island <b>35</b> is opposite the type of impurity that is used in source/drain regions of a FET formed in the island <b>35</b>. For example, the unmasked portion is described herein as being doped with a p-type impurity to create a P+ region <b>60</b> in the island <b>35</b>. The mask <b>60</b> is removed (e.g., stripped) after forming the P+ region <b>60</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">As depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, another mask <b>75</b> is formed over the P+ region <b>60</b> and an NFET <b>80</b> is formed in the island <b>35</b> adjacent the P+ region <b>60</b>. The mask <b>75</b> may comprise any suitable mask (e.g., photomask, hardmask, etc.) that protects the P+ region <b>60</b> during ion implantation steps performed in making the NFET <b>80</b>. The mask <b>75</b> may comprise a single mask that remains on the P+ region <b>60</b> throughout the duration of forming the NFET <b>80</b>. Alternatively, the mask <b>75</b> may represent plural masks that are formed and then removed at particular stages during the fabrication of the NFET <b>80</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">The NFET <b>80</b> may be of any desired configuration, and may be formed using conventional CMOS fabrication techniques and materials. For example, the NFET <b>80</b> may be formed by first forming a gate dielectric on the upper surface of the wafer <b>10</b> including the top surface of the island <b>35</b>, forming a gate conductor on the gate dielectric, and patterning the gate conductor and the gate dielectric to form a gate <b>83</b> on the unmasked portion of the island <b>35</b>. The gate dielectric may be any suitable material, including, for example, high-k dielectrics such as hafnium-based materials. The gate conductor can be any suitable material, such as doped polysilicon or other metal. Sidewall spacers <b>84</b> <i>a </i>may be formed on the gate <b>83</b>. Shallow source/drain extension regions (e.g., pocket implants) may be formed in the island <b>35</b> by performing an ion implantation of n-type impurities using the gate as a mask. The mask <b>75</b> masks the P+ region <b>60</b> during the ion implantation that forms the shallow source/drain extension regions. Sidewall spacers <b>84</b> <i>b </i>may be formed on the first sidewall spacers. Source/drain regions <b>85</b> <i>a</i>/<b>85</b> <i>b </i>may be formed in the island <b>35</b> by performing another ion implantation of n-type impurities using the second sidewall spacers as a mask, e.g., as shown at arrows “N”. The mask <b>75</b> masks the P+ region <b>60</b> during the ion implantation that forms the source/drain regions <b>85</b> <i>a</i>/<b>85</b> <i>b</i>. The mask <b>75</b> is removed (e.g., stripped) after forming the NFET <b>80</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">Aspects of the invention are described herein with respect to an NFET <b>80</b> having N+ type source/drain regions <b>85</b> <i>a</i>/<b>85</b> <i>b </i>and a P+ region <b>60</b> in the SOI island <b>35</b>. It is noted, however, that the invention may also be implemented with a PFET having P+ type source/drain regions and an N+ region in the SOI island by altering the types of impurities used in the ion implantation steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a block <b>90</b> is formed on the P+ region <b>60</b> and partially on the source/drain region <b>85</b> <i>a </i>that is adjacent the P+ region <b>60</b>. In embodiments, the block <b>90</b> covers the entirety of an interface <b>95</b> between the P+ region <b>60</b> and the source/drain region <b>85</b> <i>a </i>that is adjacent the P+ region <b>60</b>. The block <b>90</b> may be composed of any suitable material that prevents the formation of silicide on the P+ region <b>60</b> in subsequent processing steps. For example, the block <b>90</b> may comprise nitride. The block <b>90</b> may be formed using conventional CMOS processing techniques, such as depositing a blanket layer of nitride on the entire wafer, and masking and etching the nitride to shape the block <b>90</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the formation of silicide <b>100</b> on silicon-containing surfaces that are unmasked by the block <b>90</b>, e.g., on the source/drain regions <b>85</b> <i>a</i>/<b>85</b> <i>b </i>and the gate <b>83</b> of the NFET <b>80</b>. The block <b>90</b> prevents silicide from forming on the P+ region <b>60</b> and also from forming on the interface <b>95</b>, which ensures that the silicide <b>100</b> does not electrically short the source/drain region <b>85</b> <i>a </i>to the P+ region <b>60</b>. The silicide <b>100</b> may be formed using conventional CMOS processing techniques, such as: sputtering a layer of metal onto the top surface of the wafer; annealing the wafer to react the metal with silicon in places where the metal contacts silicon; and stripping any unreacted metal. Conventional back end of line processing may follow the silicide formation, such as forming one or more insulator layers on the top surface of the wafer <b>10</b> and forming any of contacts, vias, interconnects, and wires in the insulator layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">The structure depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> comprises an NFET <b>80</b> and a substrate contact <b>45</b> formed in the same island <b>35</b> of an SOI wafer <b>10</b>. According to aspects of the invention, the substrate contact <b>45</b> provides a low thermal resistance path for heat to travel from the NFET <b>80</b> to the substrate <b>15</b>, where the heat can be efficiently dissipated. Specifically, the island <b>35</b> and substrate contact <b>45</b> are both composed of silicon, which has a much higher thermal conductivity (i.e., lower thermal resistance) than the oxide of the BOX layer <b>20</b>. Moreover, the interface <b>95</b> between the P+ region <b>60</b> and the adjacent N+ source/drain region <b>85</b> <i>a </i>electrically isolates the substrate contact <b>45</b> from the NFET <b>80</b>. In this manner, the substrate contact <b>45</b> is prevented from shunting the NFET <b>80</b> to the substrate <b>15</b>. Implementations of the invention thus provide a high-thermal conductivity heat path from the NFET <b>80</b> to the substrate <b>15</b>, where the structure of the high-thermal conductivity heat path maintains electrical isolation of the NFET <b>80</b> from the substrate <b>15</b>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">Implementations of the invention as described herein can be used to dissipate heat from a FET through the SOI substrate using the substrate contact. The increased heat dissipation permits a FET to utilize increased current, e.g., DC drain current, for a given operating temperature. This is particularly useful in high current devices, such as power amplifiers. Channeling heat into the substrate using a silicon substrate contact reduces, and in some cases removes, the need for conducting heat through wiring that is added in the interlevel dielectric (ILD) layers above the transistors. A transistor's maximum output power and power-added-efficiency is achieved when it is operating under compression, and implementations of the invention provide sufficient drive power to achieve this result.</div>
