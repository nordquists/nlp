<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">A liquid crystal display (“LCD”) is a type of flat panel display (“FPD”) which is most widely used as a display device. The LCD includes two substrates on which an electric field generating electrode such as a pixel electrode and a common electrode is disposed, and a liquid crystal layer interposed between the two substrates. In the LCD, a voltage is applied to the electric field generating electrode so that liquid crystal molecules of the liquid crystal layer are rearranged, thereby adjusting the amount of transmitted light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">A display device using an organic light emitting diode (OLED) does not require a backlight unit for light emission unlike an LCD, and can be manufactured so as to have a thin film laminated structure, which in turn imparts flexibility, and thus it is drawing attention as not only a flat panel display but also as a flexible panel display.</div>
