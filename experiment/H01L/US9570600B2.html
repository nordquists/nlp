<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field of Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Described herein are semiconductor structures and processes for forming semiconductor structures. Etching techniques are described for forming a recess in a semiconductor structure, such as a gate recess of a transistor. Such techniques can be used to produce high performance transistors for use in power electronics, power amplification and digital electronics, by way of example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Discussion of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Improved power transistors are desired for advanced transportation systems, more robust energy delivery networks and new approaches to high-efficiency electricity generation and conversion. Applications of power transistors include power supplies, automotive electronics, automated factory equipment, motor controls, traction motor drives, high voltage direct current (HVDC) electronics, lamp ballasts, telecommunications circuits and display drives, for example. Such systems rely on efficient converters to step-up or step-down electric voltages, and use power transistors capable of blocking large voltages and/or carrying large currents. In hybrid vehicles, for example, power transistors with blocking voltages of more than 500 V are used to convert DC power from the batteries to AC power to operate the electric motor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Conventional power devices (e.g., transistors or diodes) used in such applications are made of silicon. However, the limited critical electric field of silicon and its relatively high resistance causes available commercial devices, circuits and systems to be very large and heavy, and operate at low frequencies. Therefore, such commercial devices are unsuitable for future generations of hybrid vehicles and other applications.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Nitride semiconductor devices have been proposed as offering the potential for producing high-efficiency power electronics demanding high blocking voltages and low on-resistances.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">Gate recess is an important technology for certain types of transistors, including nitride semiconductor based transistors such as AlGaN/GaN high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs), for example. In radio frequency (RF) AlGaN/GaN HEMTs, a gate recess technique has been used to reduce short channel effects and improve the current gain cut-off frequency (f<sub>t</sub>). In power switching applications, gate recess has been used to fabricate normally-off field effect transistors, such as AlGaN/GaN HEMTs. Since both GaN and AlGaN are very inert to wet chemical etchants, chlorine-based dry plasma etching is typically used to form gate recesses in AlGaN/GaN devices. There are, however, two major drawbacks to dry plasma etching: 1) it may cause plasma damage, creating a high density of defect states and degrading the channel mobility in the recessed region; and 2) due to variations in the plasma etch rate, it may be difficult to control the recess depth precisely by timed etching, which causes a variation in transistor parameters such as the transconductance (g<sub>m</sub>) and threshold voltage (V<sub>th</sub>). This problem becomes even more challenging when devices with different gate lengths are subjected to the same gate recess etching process, as the etching rates can be different for different transistor gate lengths and/or aspect ratios.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">Described herein are semiconductor structures and processes for forming semiconductor structures that can reduce or eliminate plasma-induced damage and etch-based process variations. A recess etching fabrication technology is described which can precisely control the etching depth and produce an extremely low defect density on the recessed surface. In some embodiments, the semiconductor structures described herein may be formed of compound semiconductor material(s), such as III-V semiconductor material(s), particularly Ill-Nitride (III-N) semiconductor material(s). Using such techniques, high performance transistors can be fabricated, such as RF III-N and/or normally-off III-N power transistors, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">The techniques described herein can exploit etching selectivity between different semiconductor materials (e.g., different III-N semiconductor materials). For example, GaN can be selectively etched over materials such as AlN, AlGaN, InAlN and AlInGaN with high Al content using a dry etching technique. In some embodiments, a selective dry etching step followed by a wet etching step can be used to achieve precise control of recess depth and produce a surface with a low density of defect states. The wet etching step, if performed, may be selective or non-selective. If the wet etching step is selective, AlN, AlGaN, InAlN and AlInGaN with high Al content can be selectively etched over materials such as GaN, AlGaN, InGaN, and AlInGaN with low Al content using a wet etching technique. However, the techniques described herein are not limited as to a wet etching step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows a semiconductor structure <b>1</b> on which an etching technique as described herein may be performed. Semiconductor structure <b>1</b> may include a substrate <b>2</b>, a buffer layer <b>4</b>, a channel layer <b>6</b>, and a barrier layer <b>8</b>. Barrier layer <b>8</b> includes an upper barrier layer <b>10</b> and a lower barrier layer <b>12</b>. In some embodiments, the upper barrier layer <b>10</b> is formed of a material that is etchable by a first etching technique, such as dry etching, and the lower barrier layer <b>12</b> is formed of a material that is etchable by a second etching technique, such as wet etching. In this embodiment, the lower barrier layer <b>12</b> is substantially not etched by the first etching technique used to etch the upper barrier layer <b>10</b>, thus forming an etch-stop. Examples of materials that may form the semiconductor structure <b>1</b> will now be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, a semiconductor material with a lattice constant different from that of the substrate <b>2</b> may be formed over the substrate <b>2</b>. In some embodiments, a buffer layer <b>4</b> may be included between the substrate <b>2</b> and the overlying semiconductor material to accommodate a difference in lattice constant. The substrate <b>2</b> may include a group IV semiconductor material such as silicon or germanium, for example. The semiconductor material formed over the substrate <b>2</b> may include a compound semiconductor material, such as a III-V semiconductor material (e.g., a III-N material). Suitable techniques for accommodating a lattice mismatch between a substrate <b>2</b> and a semiconductor material of different lattice constant using a buffer layer <b>4</b> are understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, and will not be detailed herein. In some embodiments a substrate <b>2</b> having a suitable lattice constant for the formation of overlying compound semiconductor material(s) may be used, and buffer layer <b>4</b> may be omitted. For example, substrate <b>2</b> may be a GaN substrate, a ZnO substrate or another substrate of a material with a lattice constant similar to that of a compound semiconductor material to be formed thereon. The techniques described herein are not limited as to the substrate <b>2</b> or buffer layer <b>4</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">The substrate <b>2</b> and the layer(s) of semiconductor material formed thereon may be monocrystalline, and may have any suitable crystallographic orientation. Compound semiconductor materials, if included in the substrate <b>2</b> or an overlying layer, may have any suitable composition at the face of the semiconductor material. If a III-N material is included, it may have an N-face composition or a group III face composition. For example, GaN may be grown either N-face and Ga-face or in non-polar orientations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">The channel layer <b>6</b> may be formed of a semiconductor material suitable for formation of a channel therein. In some embodiments, the channel layer <b>6</b> may include a MN semiconductor material, such as a III-N semiconductor material. In some embodiments, the channel layer <b>6</b> may include gallium nitride (GaN). In some embodiments, a nitride semiconductor material may be used such as B<sub>w</sub>Al<sub>x</sub>In<sub>y</sub>Ga<sub>z</sub>N, for example, in which w, x, y and z each have any suitable value between zero and one (inclusive), and w+x+y+z=1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, a semiconductor heterostructure may be formed in the semiconductor structure <b>1</b>. For example, in some embodiments a barrier layer <b>8</b> comprising B<sub>w1</sub>Al<sub>x1</sub>In<sub>y1</sub>Ga<sub>z1</sub>N and a channel layer <b>6</b> comprising B<sub>w2</sub>Al<sub>x2</sub>In<sub>y2</sub>Ga<sub>z2</sub>N may be formed, where a semiconductor material of the barrier layer <b>8</b> has a larger bandgap and/or polarization than that of the channel layer <b>6</b>. However, the techniques described herein are not limited as to the formation of heterostructures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">As discussed above, in some embodiments a barrier layer <b>8</b> may be formed having two or more layers. For example, the barrier layer <b>8</b> may include a “dual-layer” barrier structure having an upper barrier layer <b>10</b> of a first semiconductor material that is etchable using a first etching technique and a lower barrier layer <b>12</b> of a second semiconductor material that is etchable using a second etching technique. In some embodiments, the upper barrier layer <b>10</b> may include a semiconductor material that is selectively etchable in a dry etching process, such as GaN, for example, or another nitride semiconductor material such as B<sub>w</sub>Al<sub>x</sub>In<sub>y</sub>Ga<sub>z</sub>N, for example, in which w, x, y and z each have any suitable value between zero and one (inclusive), and w+x+y+z=1, and the composition is such that the nitride semiconductor material is selectively etchable using a dry etching process. For example, the upper barrier layer <b>10</b> may include a semiconductor material such as B<sub>w</sub>Al<sub>x</sub>In<sub>y</sub>Ga<sub>z</sub>N in which x is less than 0.25.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">The upper barrier layer <b>10</b> may be doped or undoped. Doping the upper barrier layer <b>10</b> may supply carriers to the channel layer in the region(s) that are not under the gate. A doped region may be formed between the gate and the source and/or between the gate and the drain, outside of the gate-recess. If the upper barrier layer <b>10</b> includes a region that is doped, it may be polarization doped or may include dopants such as n-type dopants or p-type dopants. If the upper barrier layer <b>10</b> is doped, it may have any suitable doping concentration and distribution. For example, dopants may be provided at the lower surface of upper barrier layer <b>10</b>, the upper surface of upper barrier layer <b>10</b>, and/or in another location. The doping profile can be uniform or non-uniform. In some embodiments, a delta-doping profile may be used. If upper barrier layer <b>10</b> is doped, any suitable doping technique may be used, such as implantation or diffusion, for example. As another example, the upper barrier layer <b>10</b> may be doped during the formation (e.g., growth) of upper barrier layer <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, the doping type of the upper barrier layer <b>10</b> may be of the same type as that of the carriers in the channel region. For example, the doping type in the upper barrier layer <b>10</b> may be n-type for an n-channel transistor and p-type for a p-channel transistor. In some embodiments, the doped region may be highly doped.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">The lower barrier layer <b>12</b> may include a semiconductor material that is etchable using a wet etching technique, such as aluminum nitride (AlN), for example, or another material such as B<sub>w</sub>Al<sub>x</sub>In<sub>y</sub>Ga<sub>z</sub>N, for example, in which x, y and z each have any suitable value between zero and one (inclusive), and w+x+y+z=1, and the composition is such that the nitride semiconductor material is etchable using a wet etching process. For example, the lower barrier layer <b>12</b> may include a semiconductor material such as B<sub>w</sub>Al<sub>x</sub>In<sub>y</sub>Ga<sub>z</sub>N in which x is greater than 0.5.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">The reference herein to B<sub>w</sub>Al<sub>x</sub>In<sub>y</sub>Ga<sub>z</sub>N or a “B<sub>w</sub>Al<sub>x</sub>In<sub>y</sub>Ga<sub>z</sub>N material” refers to a semiconductor material having nitride and one or more of boron, aluminum, indium and gallium. Examples of B<sub>w</sub>Al<sub>x</sub>In<sub>y</sub>Ga<sub>z</sub>N materials include GaN, AlN, AlGaN, AlInGaN, InGaN, and BAlInGaN, by way of illustration. A B<sub>w</sub>Al<sub>x</sub>In<sub>y</sub>Ga<sub>z</sub>N material may include other materials besides nitride, boron, aluminum, indium and/or gallium. For example, a B<sub>w</sub>Al<sub>x</sub>In<sub>y</sub>Ga<sub>z</sub>N material may be doped with a suitable dopant (e.g., silicon, germanium, etc.).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a first etching step may be performed using a first etching technique to remove a portion of the upper barrier layer <b>10</b>. A suitable masking process may be used to define the region to be etched. The etching technique used in the first etching step may selectively etch the material of upper barrier layer <b>10</b> with respect to the material of the lower barrier layer <b>12</b>. The selectivity of the etch process used in the first etching step may be greater than one, such that the upper barrier layer <b>10</b> is etched at a faster rate than the lower barrier layer <b>12</b>. In some embodiments, the selectivity of the etch process used in the first etching step may be greater than 3:1, such that the upper barrier layer <b>10</b> is etched at a rate greater than three times as high as the rate at which the lower barrier layer <b>12</b> is etched.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">As discussed above, the first etching technique may include a dry etching technique (e.g., dry plasma etching, also referred-to as reactive ion etching (RIE)). If the upper barrier layer includes GaN, a fluorine-based etching process may be used, for example. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows the semiconductor structure <b>1</b> following the removal of a region of the upper barrier layer <b>10</b> using a dry etching process. The lower barrier layer <b>12</b> may serve as an etch stop to stop the dry etching process at its upper surface. The dry etching process may damage the upper surface of the lower barrier layer <b>12</b>, creating a damaged region <b>14</b>. However, in some embodiments the dry etching process may not produce any significant damage. In some embodiments, a damaged region <b>14</b> of the barrier layer <b>12</b> may be oxidized prior to removal of the damaged region <b>14</b> in a second etching step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, a second etching step may be performed using a second etching technique to remove a portion of the lower barrier layer <b>12</b>.

In some embodiments, the etch process used in the second etching step may selectively etch the lower barrier layer <b>12</b> with respect to a layer below the lower barrier layer <b>12</b> which may be in contact with the lower barrier layer <b>12</b>, such as the channel layer <b>6</b> and/or a band offset layer. The selectivity of the etching of the lower barrier layer <b>12</b> with respect to the upper barrier layer <b>10</b> and/or the channel layer <b>6</b> may be greater than one, such that the rate of etching of the lower barrier layer <b>12</b> is greater than that of the upper barrier layer <b>10</b> and/or channel layer <b>6</b>. In some embodiments, the selectivity may be greater than 3:1, such that the lower barrier layer <b>12</b> is etched at a rate greater than three times as high as the upper barrier layer <b>10</b> and/or the channel layer <b>6</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">In an exemplary embodiment, the upper barrier layer <b>10</b> may be formed of GaN, and the lower barrier layer <b>12</b> may be formed of AlN. The GaN can be selectively etched over the AlN by fluorine-based dry etching. The AlN can be selectively etched over GaN by a wet etching process with a base such as potassium hydroxide (KOH) and/or tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH), or by a digital etching process. Digital etching processes are understood by those of ordinary skill in the art and will not be detailed herein. However, these are only examples, and any suitable etchants may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> shows a plot showing the band structure and electron density versus position for an exemplary transistor. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> shows the structure of an exemplary transistor, according to some embodiments. Exemplary devices have been fabricated having the structure shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. The structure was grown on a 4 inch silicon substrate by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. The structure includes a 22 nm GaN:Si cap layer with 3-6×10<sup>18 </sup>cm<sup>−3 </sup>Si doping/1.5 nm AlN/3 nm Al<sub>0.15</sub>Ga<sub>0.85</sub>N/1.2-μm i-GaN/2.8-μm buffer/p-type Si(111) substrate. Hall measurement shows a sheet resistance of 579±11 Ω/sq and two-dimensional-electron-gas (2DEG) mobility of 1529±18 cm<sup>2</sup>·V<sup>−1</sup>·s<sup>−1 </sup>with a sheet charge density of 7.1±0.1×10<sup>12 </sup>cm<sup>−2</sup>. The device fabrication started with mesa isolation and Ti/Al/Ni/Au ohmic contact formation which was annealed at 870° C. for 30 s. To fabricate the recessed-gate transistors, the n-GaN cap in the recessed-gate region was selectively etched over the AlN layer by fluorine-based electron-cyclotron-resonance reactive ion etching (ECR-RIE). Due to the non-volatility of aluminum fluoride (AlF<sub>3</sub>), very high etch selectivity of GaN over AlN is achieved for the gas flow rates of 5 sccm BCl<sub>3</sub>/35 sccm SF<sub>6 </sub>at 35 mtorr, 100 W ECR power and 100 V DC bias. A 350 second etch with 70 second over-etching was used to achieve uniform and complete removal of the n-GaN layer, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, where the recess depth was measured by an atomic force microscope. The surface of the AlN layer was then oxidized by low-energy oxygen plasma and wet etched by a 1-min dip in tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) at room temperature to remove the dry etching damage. The presence of fluorine from the dry-etch step was significantly reduced after the TMAH wet etch, as shown in the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. After UV ozone and HCl surface cleaning, a 10-nm Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>gate dielectric was then deposited by atomic layer deposition at 250° C. and annealed at 500° C. for 1 min in forming gas. A Ni/Au gate electrode was deposited covering the recessed-gate region with a 2.5-μm overhang length, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. The sample was then annealed in forming gas at 400° C. for 5 min to reduce the positive fixed charge in Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The recessed-gate transistors have a recessed-gate length L<sub>rec-g </sub>varying from 3 to 20 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">The dc (direct current) characteristics of the recessed-gate GaN MISFET are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>. Device threshold voltage V<sub>th </sub>is defined as V<sub>th</sub>=V<sub>gsi</sub>−0.5 V<sub>ds</sub>, where V<sub>gsi </sub>is the interception voltage from the linear extrapolation of the I<sub>d</sub>−V<sub>gs </sub>curve, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. A small drain voltage (V<sub>ds</sub>=0.1 V) was applied to place the device in a linear operation region. Averaging over 13 devices, the recessed-gate GaN MISFETs have a uniform V<sub>th </sub>of 0.30±0.04 V. The average subthreshold slope is 62±1 mV/decade. The bidirectional gate voltage sweep in the transfer characteristics in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows less than 10 mV hysteresis in the threshold voltage. The recessed-gate transistor (solid lines) has a similar ON-resistance (R<sub>on</sub>=10 Ω·mm) as a planar gate transistor (dashed lines) with the same source-to-drain distance (Lsd=11 μm), as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The relatively low maximum drain current of both devices is due to the large gate length and gate-to-source distance, relatively low 2DEG density (7.1×10<sup>12 </sup>cm-2), and high contact resistance (1.2 Ω·mm) of the non-optimized ohmic contact.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">Capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristics (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) were measured on recessed-gate capacitors after subtracting the parasitic capacitance from the gate-2DEG overlapping region (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>). The C-V characteristics have low frequency dispersion between 1 kHz and 1 MHz and small hysteresis under bidirectional C-V sweeps, which indicate very low dielectric/semiconductor interface trap density in the recessed-gate region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">The effective channel electron mobility of the GaN normally-off MISFETs, i.e., μ<sub>e</sub>, as a function of gate-to-source voltage V<sub>gs </sub>can be extracted from μ<sub>e</sub>=1/(qN<sub>sh</sub>R<sub>ch</sub>), where q is the electron charge (1.6×10-19 C), R<sub>ch </sub>is the channel sheet resistance, and N<sub>sh </sub>is the channel accumulation charge density (in cm<sup>−2</sup>). R<sub>ch </sub>was extracted from the slope of the R<sub>on </sub>versus L<sub>rec-g </sub>curves in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. N<sub>sh </sub>was extracted by integrating the 1-MHz C-V characteristic in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. R<sub>ch</sub>, N<sub>sh</sub>, and μ<sub>e </sub>are summarized in Table 1 along with the gated-Hall measurement data from the recessed-gate Hall structure. The extracted R<sub>ch </sub>from the dc characteristics agrees with the gated-Hall measurement. The extracted N<sub>sh </sub>from the C-V measurement is larger than the gated-Hall measurement, and the difference grows as V<sub>gs </sub>increases. This is because at higher V<sub>gs</sub>, an increasing quantify of the channel electrons overcomes the AlGaN barrier and accumulates at the gate dielectric/semiconductor interface.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">Since these electrons have low mobility due to alloy scattering and gate dielectric interface roughness scattering, they contribute little to the channel current and make no change to R<sub>on </sub>even at high gate voltages (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). Therefore, the gated-Hall measurement only measures the 2DEG at the AlGaN/GaN interface, which has lower N<sub>sh </sub>than the value extracted from the C-V characteristics. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the increase in μ<sub>e </sub>at low N<sub>sh </sub>is due to the screening of ionized impurities and dislocations, and the decrease in μ<sub>e </sub>at high N<sub>sh </sub>is due to increasing alloy scattering and interface roughness scattering.
