<div class="abstract" id="p-0001" num="0000">Selective area deposition of metal films by atomic layer deposition (ALD) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is described. In an example, a method of fabricating a metallization structure for an integrated circuit involves forming an exposed surface above a substrate, the exposed surface including regions of exposed dielectric material and regions of exposed metal. The method also involves forming, using a selective metal deposition process, a metal layer on the regions of exposed metal without forming the metal layer on the regions of exposed dielectric material.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/133,262, filed on Dec. 18, 2013, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the invention are in the field of semiconductor structures and processing and, in particular, selective area deposition of metal films by atomic layer deposition (ALD) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD).</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">For the past several decades, the scaling of features in integrated circuits has been a driving force behind an ever-growing semiconductor industry. Scaling to smaller and smaller features enables increased densities of functional units on the limited real estate of semiconductor chips. For example, shrinking transistor size allows for the incorporation of an increased number of memory or logic devices on a chip, lending to the fabrication of products with increased capacity. The drive for ever-more capacity, however, is not without issue. The necessity to optimize the performance of each device becomes increasingly significant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Integrated circuits commonly include electrically conductive microelectronic structures, which are known in the arts as vias, to electrically connect metal lines or other interconnects above the vias to metal lines or other interconnects below the vias. Vias are typically formed by a lithographic process. Representatively, a photoresist layer may be spin coated over a dielectric layer, the photoresist layer may be exposed to patterned actinic radiation through a patterned mask, and then the exposed layer may be developed in order to form an opening in the photoresist layer. Next, an opening for the via may be etched in the dielectric layer by using the opening in the photoresist layer as an etch mask. This opening is referred to as a via opening. Finally, the via opening may be filled with one or more metals or other conductive materials to form the via.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">In the past, the sizes and the spacing of vias has progressively decreased, and it is expected that in the future the sizes and the spacing of the vias will continue to progressively decrease, for at least some types of integrated circuits (e.g., advanced microprocessors, chipset components, graphics chips, etc.). One measure of the size of the vias is the critical dimension of the via opening. One measure of the spacing of the vias is the via pitch. Via pitch represents the center-to-center distance between the closest adjacent vias.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">When patterning extremely small vias with extremely small pitches by such lithographic processes, several challenges present themselves, especially when the pitches are around 70 nanometers (nm) or less and/or when the critical dimensions of the via openings are around 35 nm or less. One such challenge is that the overlay between the vias and the overlying interconnects, and the overlay between the vias and the underlying landing interconnects, generally need to be controlled to high tolerances on the order of a quarter of the via pitch. As via pitches scale ever smaller over time, the overlay tolerances tend to scale with them at an even greater rate than lithographic equipment is able to keep up.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Another such challenge is that the critical dimensions of the via openings generally tend to scale faster than the resolution capabilities of the lithographic scanners. Shrink technologies exist to shrink the critical dimensions of the via openings. However, the shrink amount tends to be limited by the minimum via pitch, as well as by the ability of the shrink process to be sufficiently optical proximity correction (OPC) neutral, and to not significantly compromise line width roughness (LWR) and/or critical dimension uniformity (CDU).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Yet another such challenge is that the LWR and/or CDU characteristics of photoresists generally need to improve as the critical dimensions of the via openings decrease in order to maintain the same overall fraction of the critical dimension budget. However, currently the LWR and/or CDU characteristics of most photoresists are not improving as rapidly as the critical dimensions of the via openings are decreasing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">A further such challenge is that the extremely small via pitches generally tend to be below the resolution capabilities of even extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithographic scanners. As a result, commonly two, three, or more different lithographic masks may be used, which tend to increase the costs. At some point, if pitches continue to decrease, it may not be possible, even with multiple masks, to print via openings for these extremely small pitches using EUV scanners.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, improvements are needed in the area of via manufacturing technologies.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">Selective area deposition of metal films by atomic layer deposition (ALD) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is described. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth, such as specific integration and material regimes, in order to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the present invention. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that embodiments of the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known features, such as integrated circuit design layouts, are not described in detail in order to not unnecessarily obscure embodiments of the present invention. Furthermore, it is to be understood that the various embodiments shown in the Figures are illustrative representations and are not necessarily drawn to scale.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">One or more embodiments described herein are directed to selective area deposition of metal films by atomic layer deposition (ALD) and/or chemical vapor deposition (CVD). To provide context, the ability to selectively deposit metal on one surface over another can enable new integration and patterning schemes as well as decrease the number of manufacturing operations otherwise associated with a semiconductor manufacturing process. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a precursor class is described with built-in structural features that enable the ALD or CVD of late transition metals on metallic surfaces while avoiding deposition on adjacent dielectric surfaces such as silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) or low-k inter layer dielectric layers (ILDs). In one embodiment, the selectivity is inherent to the precursor and, as such, chemical passivation of the undesired or adjacent surface may not be needed. In a particular embodiment, the approaches described herein can be used to enable electroless via bottom-up fill on non-catalytic metals and can also enable self-aligned bottom-up interconnect design, examples of which are described in greater detail below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">Generally, in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention, there is currently no unified solution for selective deposition of metals on metals in semiconductor processing. However, embodiments described herein can be used to provide several general benefits from a manufacturing point of view such as, but not limited to: (1) films are deposited by thermal ALD or CVD, thus maximizing film conformality and minimizing damage to device structures as is otherwise observed with plasma-enhanced processes; (2) the precursor design is widely applicable to a variety of metals including, but not limited to: cobalt (Co), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), iron (Fe) or chromium (Cr), and provides access to high metal content films (e.g., greater than approximately 90%) under thermal deposition conditions; (3) in some cases, the selective deposition process can be achieved without special pre-treatment of the exposed, competing surfaces, e.g., without chemical passivation of either the low-k dielectric or pre-cleaning of the metal surface; (4) metal cap growth can be achieved on so-called “non-catalytic” metals such as tungsten (W), thus enabling electroless via bottom-up fill; (5) the processes do not require the use of lithographic patterning schemes or masks to define the selectivity of a corresponding process—rather, the processes rely on inherent differences in chemical reactivity; and/or (6) selective metal on metal growth can be used for self-aligned next layer interconnect fabrication.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">More specifically, in one or more embodiments, approaches are provided for the deposition of a variety of transition metals selectively on metal surfaces, while avoiding deposition on contiguous, hydrophilic and generic low-k dielectric substrates. In one such embodiment, a selective metal deposition is accomplished by thermal ALD or CVD using a homoleptic N,N′-dialkyl-diazabutadiene metal precursor and may use a suitable co-reactant such as a hydrogen or ammonia. In an embodiment, the selective deposition can be performed with or without pretreatment of an adjacent or nearby low-k substrate. In one embodiment, the nature of one or more of the processes described herein (e.g., precursor type, surfaces and deposition schemes) render one or more of the approaches directly applicable for back end of line (BEOL) integration and self-aligned patterning schemes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">As an example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a chemical representation illustrating a homoleptic N,N′-dialkyl-diazabutadiene metal precursor <b>100</b>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the N,N′-dialkyl-diazabutadiene metal precursor <b>100</b> includes a metal center, M, which may be a metal such as but not limited to, Mn, Cr, Fe, Co or Ni. In the example shown, the N,N′-dialkyl-diazabutadiene metal precursor <b>100</b> includes two N,N′-dialkyl-diazabutadiene ligands <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>, respectively. It is to be appreciated that precursors may also be considered having only one N,N′-dialkyl-diazabutadiene ligand, or more than two N,N′-dialkyl-diazabutadiene ligands. The alkyl groups, R, may be bulky alkyl groups such as, but not limited to, ethyl, iso-propyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, cyclohexyl and phenyl. It is also to be appreciated that the R groups within a single N,N′-dialkyl-diazabutadiene ligand need not be identical. Furthermore, the R groups between different N,N′-dialkyl-diazabutadiene ligands need not be identical. Additionally, in other embodiments, one or more R groups instead of hydrogen may be included on one or both of the carbon atoms in the backbone of the diazabutadiene metal precursor <b>100</b>. This may allow fabrication of bulkier ligands and may have applications for molybdenum (Mo), ruthenium (Ru) or tungsten (W) metal centers, as described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, more generally, the motif of a suitable precursor is generally applicable to first row, late-transition metals (e.g., M=Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) but it could be expanded to heavier elements by variation of the R group(s). In one such embodiment, the metal is one such as, but not limited to: molybdenum (Mo), ruthenium (Ru) or tungsten (W), and three N,N′-dialkyl-diazabutadiene ligands are used per metal center. The bulky substituent on nitrogen (e.g., R is typically <sup>t</sup>Bu) sterically protects the metal center from direct undesirable reactions with an adjacent or nearby dielectric surface (e.g., low-k or SiO<sub>2</sub>) by providing an effective hydrophobic pocket. The selectivity for metal surfaces can be achieved by direct interaction of the diazabutadiene ligand with the conducting sea of electrons on the metal surface, by nature of its redox non-innocence. More generally, in an embodiment, the suitability of such complexes can be described as molecules possessing electron-acceptor ligands on late transition metal centers. The complexes are sterically protected and redox active, with electrons stored in the ligands.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">As an example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a schematic <b>200</b> showing chemical selectivity for metal over ILD as designed into the metal precursor, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to schematic <b>200</b>, a surface <b>202</b> is provided having alternating exposed ILD portions <b>204</b> and exposed metal portions <b>206</b>. The exposed ILD portions <b>204</b> may include a surface termination such as —OH termination, as is shown. A metal precursor <b>208</b>, such as a precursor described in association with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is inhibited from reacting with the exposed ILD portions <b>204</b> but is encouraged to react with the exposed metal portions <b>206</b>. In one embodiment, the inhibition from the metal precursor <b>208</b> reacting with the exposed ILD portions <b>204</b> and corresponding favorability of reacting with the exposed metal surface <b>206</b> is electron driven, as depicted. Thus, metal-diazabutadiene precursors enable selective metal on metal deposition, as exemplified above. In one such embodiment, the selective deposition is achieved without protecting or passivating either the exposed ILD portions <b>204</b> or the exposed metal portions <b>206</b> and, as such, the deposition is directly on the exposed metal portions <b>206</b> while the exposed ILD portions <b>204</b> are directly exposed to the precursors. In an embodiment, the exposed metal portions <b>206</b> metal portions are composed of a pure metal such as, but not limited to, copper, nickel, cobalt, manganese, ruthenium, molybdenum or tungsten, or a conductive metal containing allow such as, but not limited to, titanium nitride, vanadium nitride or tungsten nitride.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">Several examples of the precursors described in association with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> have been demonstrated as having accessible, low energy electron acceptor levels. For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> includes a Table 300 of E1/2 reduction potentials (in Volts) for a Co complex, a Mn complex, and a Cr complex, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to Table 300 and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, where M=Co, Mn or Cr, the E1/2 reduction (in Volts) is −2.82, −2.73, and −2.09, respectively. As such, separate solution cyclic voltammetry experiments confirm the presence of accessible, low energy electron acceptor levels in such complexes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">In one aspect, selective deposition of cobalt (Co) on post-chemical mechanical polish (CMP) tungsten (W) lines in silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) has been demonstrated. For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> include a pre scanning electron microscope (SEM) image <b>402</b> and post SEM image <b>404</b>, respectively, showing selective deposition of a cobalt (Co) cap <b>406</b> on exposed W lines <b>408</b> formed in silicon dioxide <b>410</b>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, with substrate temperatures approximately in a range of 175-250 degrees Celsius, as much as 14 nm of Co is grown on top of W, with no visible deposition on the adjacent SiO<sub>2</sub>. The deposition is performed using the complex of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> where M=Co and R=tBu.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">The above described selective deposition of Co on W has been extended to growth of a catalytic cap on W at the bottom of a via structure in a low-k ILD material. For example, selective deposition of a cobalt (Co) cap on underlying exposed W contacts through a via opening formed in a low-k ILD material, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention using precursors as described herein can thus be used to enable bottom-up electroless via fill.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> described above, in an embodiment, selective deposition schemes in the interconnect space can benefit from such selective metal deposition approaches. Final interconnect structures may include detectable discrete layers of metals such as, but not limited to, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co and Ni via standard materials analysis (e.g., SEM, TEM, XPS, AES, EDS, EELS etc.) at the bottom of an interconnect structure combined with their absence in adjacent dielectric surfaces. Additionally, such deposited films may include nitrogen and/or carbon as impurities in the films.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">As such, one or more embodiments provide approaches for selectively depositing metallic films by a thermal ALD or CVD, while avoiding undesirable metallic contamination of neighboring (low-k) dielectric layers. Depending on the substrate in play, a direct way to deposit “metal on metal” with or without the need for pre-treatment of either the metallic or dielectric surface is thus achieved. While the selective deposition per se constitutes a significant advance in comparison to existing methods, there are other advantages for manufacturing such as the circumvention of substrate passivation or the use of lithographic patterning to direct the selectivity. The approaches are also applicable to a variety of different metals and can be employed in self-aligned next layer interconnect patterning scheme, an example of which is described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">Thus, in another aspect, one or more embodiments described herein are directed to self-aligned via and plug patterning. The self-aligned aspect of the processes described herein may be based on a directed self-assembly (DSA) mechanism, as described in greater detail below. However, it is to be understood that selective growth mechanisms may be employed in place of, or in combination with, DSA-based approaches. In an embodiment, processes described herein enable realization of self-aligned metallization using selective metal deposition for back-end of line feature fabrication.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">To provide context, patterning and aligning of features at less than approximately 50 nanometer pitch requires many reticles and critical alignment strategies that are extremely expensive for a semiconductor manufacturing process. Generally, embodiments described herein involve the fabrication of metal and via patterns based on the positions of an underlying layer. That is, in contrast to conventional top-down patterning approaches, a metal interconnect process is effectively reversed and built from the previous layer up. This is in contrast to a conventional approach where an interlayer dielectric (ILD) is first deposited, with a pattern for metal and via layers subsequently patterned therein. In the conventional approach, alignment to a previous layer is performed using a lithography scanner alignment system. The ILD is then etched.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">More specifically, one or more embodiments are directed to an approach that employs an underlying metal as a template to build the conductive vias and non-conductive spaces or interruptions between metals (referred to as “plugs”). Vias, by definition, are used to land on a previous layer metal pattern. In this vein, embodiments described herein enable a more robust interconnect fabrication scheme since alignment by lithography equipment is no longer relied on. Such an interconnect fabrication scheme can be used to save numerous alignment/exposures, can be used to improve electrical contact (e.g., by reducing via resistance), and can be used to reduce total process operations and processing time otherwise required for patterning such features using conventional approaches.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">As illustrated below, self-aligned via and metal patterning approaches described herein may include one or more of the following aspects or attributes: (a) a bottom up super-self-aligned via/metal patterning process is enabled; (b) a previous layer metal is used to direct positions of vias on the layer formed above; (c) a process that generates every possible via and metal line end position but maintains only required or desired via and metal line end positions; (d) the position and shape of vias and metal line ends are pre-formed from a previous layer pattern; (e) an intersection of metal below and above naturally forms the fully self-aligned via positions; (f) via and plugs position, size and shape are defined by a pre-existing grating lithography from underlying metal layers; (g) via and plug lithography is required only for selecting one or another and does not affect the position, shape or size of the features (e.g., LWR is irrelevant); (h) processes described herein may be characterized as an upside down dual-damascene or via/plug first approach; (i) corresponding lithography photoresist design can be simplified since greater tolerance is achieved in the selection of via and plug locations within a layer (this may be referred to as a “bucket” approach, where a photoresist is merely used fill a plurality of generated holes, where only certain holes are subsequently selected to be maintained or deleted); (j) LWR is not critical and faster resists can be used; (k) the size of the features can be fabricated as a single shape and size, and may be applicable for electron beam direct write (EBDW) processes; and (k) via design rules are simplified and all possible vias are allowed in any geometric configuration, where the size of the vias is completely defined by the intersection of the metal above and below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6L</figref> illustrate portions of integrated circuit layers representing various operations in a method of self-aligned via and metal patterning, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In each illustration at each described operation, plan views are shown on the left-hand side, and corresponding cross-sectional views are shown on the right-hand side. These views will be referred to herein as corresponding cross-sectional views and plan views.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> illustrates a plan view and corresponding cross-sectional views of options for a previous layer metallization structure, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to the plan view and corresponding cross-section view option (a), a starting structure <b>600</b> includes a pattern of metal lines <b>602</b> and interlayer dielectric (ILD) lines <b>604</b>. The starting structure <b>600</b> may be patterned in a grating-like pattern with metal lines spaced at a constant pitch and having a constant width (e.g., for a DSA embodiment, but not necessarily needed for a directed selective growth embodiment), as is depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. The pattern, for example, may be fabricated by a pitch halving or pitch quartering approach. Some of the lines may be associated with underlying vias, such as line <b>602</b>′ shown as an example in the cross-sectional views.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring again to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, alternative options (b)-(f) address situations where an additional film is formed (e.g., deposited, grown, or left as an artifact remaining from a previous patterning process) on a surface of one of, or both of, the metal lines <b>602</b> and interlayer dielectric lines <b>604</b>. In example (b), an additional film <b>606</b> is disposed on the interlayer dielectric lines <b>604</b>. In example, (c), an additional film <b>608</b> is disposed on the metal lines <b>602</b>. In example, (d) an additional film <b>606</b> is disposed on the interlayer dielectric lines <b>604</b>, and an additional film <b>608</b> is disposed on the metal lines <b>602</b>. Furthermore, although the metal lines <b>602</b> and the interlayer dielectric lines <b>604</b> are depicted as co-planar in (a), in other embodiments, they are not co-planar. For example, in (e), the metal lines <b>602</b> protrude above the interlayer dielectric lines <b>604</b>. In example, (f), the metal lines <b>602</b> are recessed below the interlayer dielectric lines <b>604</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring again to examples (b)-(d), an additional layer (e.g., layer <b>606</b> or <b>608</b>) can be used as a hardmask (HM) or protection layer or be used to enable a selective growth and/or self-assembly described below in association with subsequent processing operations. Such additional layers may also be used to protect the ILD lines from further processing. In addition, selectively depositing another material over the metal lines may be beneficial for similar reasons. Referring again to examples (e) and (f), it may also be possible to recess either the ILD lines or the metal lines with any combination of protective/HM materials on either or both surfaces. Overall, there exist numerous options at this stage for preparing ultimately underlying surfaces for a selective or directed self-assembly process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">In an embodiment, as used throughout the present description, interlayer dielectric (ILD) material, such as the material of the interlayer dielectric lines <b>604</b>, is composed of or includes a layer of a dielectric or insulating material. Examples of suitable dielectric materials include, but are not limited to, oxides of silicon (e.g., silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>)), doped oxides of silicon, fluorinated oxides of silicon, carbon doped oxides of silicon, various low-k dielectric materials known in the arts, and combinations thereof. The interlayer dielectric material may be formed by conventional techniques, such as, for example, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), or by other deposition methods.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">In an embodiment, as is also used throughout the present description, interconnect material, such as the material of metal lines <b>602</b>, is composed of one or more metal or other conductive structures. A common example is the use of copper lines and structures that may or may not include barrier layers between the copper and surrounding ILD material. As used herein, the term metal includes alloys, stacks, and other combinations of multiple metals. For example, the metal interconnect lines may include barrier layers, stacks of different metals or alloys, etc. The interconnect lines are also sometimes referred to in the arts as traces, wires, lines, metal, or simply interconnect. As will be described further below, top surfaces of the lower interconnect lines may be used for self-aligned via and plug formation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">In an embodiment, as is also used throughout the present description, hardmask materials, such, as layers <b>606</b> or <b>608</b> if included as a hardmask, are composed of dielectric materials different from the interlayer dielectric material. In one embodiment, different hardmask materials may be used in different regions so as to provide different growth or etch selectivity to each other and to the underlying dielectric and metal layers. In some embodiments, a hardmask layer includes a layer of a nitride of silicon (e.g., silicon nitride) or a layer of an oxide of silicon, or both, or a combination thereof. Other suitable materials may include carbon-based materials. In another embodiment, a hardmask material includes a metal species. For example, a hardmask or other overlying material may include a layer of a nitride of titanium or another metal (e.g., titanium nitride). Potentially lesser amounts of other materials, such as oxygen, may be included in one or more of these layers. Alternatively, other hardmask layers known in the arts may be used depending upon the particular implementation. The hardmask layers maybe formed by CVD, PVD, or by other deposition methods.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">It is to be understood that the layers and materials described in association with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> are typically formed on or above an underlying semiconductor substrate or structure, such as underlying device layer(s) of an integrated circuit. In an embodiment, an underlying semiconductor substrate represents a general workpiece object used to manufacture integrated circuits. The semiconductor substrate often includes a wafer or other piece of silicon or another semiconductor material. Suitable semiconductor substrates include, but are not limited to, single crystal silicon, polycrystalline silicon and silicon on insulator (SOI), as well as similar substrates formed of other semiconductor materials. The semiconductor substrate, depending on the stage of manufacture, often includes transistors, integrated circuitry, and the like. The substrate may also include semiconductor materials, metals, dielectrics, dopants, and other materials commonly found in semiconductor substrates.

Referring to the plan view and corresponding cross-sectional views (a) and (c) taken along axes a-a′ and c-c′, respectively, the ILD lines <b>610</b> are formed in a grating structure perpendicular to the direction of underlying lines <b>604</b>. In an embodiment, a blanket film of the material of lines <b>610</b> is deposited by chemical vapor deposition or like techniques. In an embodiment, the blanket film is then patterned using lithography and etch processing which may involve, e.g., spacer-based-quadruple-patterning (SBQP) or pitch quartering. It is to be understood that the grating pattern of lines <b>610</b> can be fabricated by numerous methods, including EUV and/or EBDW lithography, directed self-assembly, etc. As will be described in greater detail below, subsequent metal layer will thus be patterned in the orthogonal direction relative to the previous metal layer since the grating of lines <b>610</b> is orthogonal to the direction of the underlying structure. In one embodiment, a single 193 nm lithography mask is used with alignment/registration to the previous metal layer <b>602</b> (e.g., grating of lines <b>610</b> aligns to the previous layer ‘plug’ pattern in X and to the previous metal grating in Y). Referring to cross-sectional structures (b) and (d), a hardmask <b>612</b> may be formed on, or retained following pattering of, dielectric lines <b>610</b>. The hardmask <b>612</b> can be used to protect lines <b>610</b> during subsequent patterning steps. As described in greater detail below, the formation of lines <b>610</b> in a grating pattern exposes regions of the previous metal lines <b>602</b> and previous ILD lines <b>604</b> (or corresponding hardmask layers on <b>602</b>/<b>604</b>).

In an embodiment, surface modification layer <b>614</b> is a dielectric layer. In an embodiment, surface modification layer <b>614</b> is formed by a selective bottom-up growth approach. In one such embodiment, the bottom-up growth approach involves a directed self-assembly (DSA) brush coat that has one polymer component which assembles preferentially on the underlying ILD lines <b>604</b> or, alternatively, on the metal lines <b>602</b> (or on a sacrificial layer deposited or grown on the underlying metal or ILD material).</div>

Referring to the plan view and corresponding cross-sectional views (a)-(d) taken along axes, a-a′, b-b′, c-c′ and d-d′, respectively, directed self-assembly (DSA) or selective growth on exposed portions of the underlying metal/MD <b>602</b>/<b>604</b> grating is used to form intervening lines <b>616</b> with alternating polymers or alternating polymer components in between the ILD lines <b>610</b>. For example, as shown, polymer <b>616</b>A (or polymer component <b>616</b>A) is formed on or above the exposed portions of interlayer dielectric (ILD) lines <b>604</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, while polymer <b>616</b>B (or polymer component <b>616</b>B) is formed on or above the exposed portions of the metal lines <b>602</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>. Although polymer <b>616</b>A is formed on or above the surface modification layer <b>614</b> described in association with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref> (see cross-sectional views (b) and (d) of FIG. <b>6</b>D<b>1</b>), it is to be understood that, in other embodiments, the surface modification layer <b>614</b> can be omitted and the alternating polymers or alternating polymer components can instead be formed directly in the structure described in association with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring again to FIG. <b>6</b>D<b>1</b>, in an embodiment, once the surface of the underlying structure (e.g., structure <b>600</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>) has been prepared (e.g., such as the structure of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> or the structure of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>) or is used directly, a 50-50 diblock copolymer, such as polystyrene-polymethyl methacrylate (PS-PMMA), is coated on the substrate and annealed to drive self assembly, leading to the polymer <b>616</b>A/polymer <b>616</b>B layer <b>616</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref> <b>1</b>. In one such embodiment, with appropriate surface energy conditions, the block copolymers segregate based on the underlying material exposed between ILD lines <b>610</b>. For example, in a specific embodiment, polystyrene aligns selectively to the exposed portions of underlying metal lines <b>602</b> (or corresponding metal line cap or hardmask material). Meanwhile, the polymethyl methacrylate aligns selectively to the exposed portions of ILD lines <b>604</b> (or corresponding metal line cap or hardmask material).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">Thus, in an embodiment, the underlying metal and ILD grid, as exposed between ILD lines <b>610</b> is recreated in the block co-polymer (BCP, i.e., polymer <b>616</b>A/polymer <b>616</b>B). This can particularly be so if the BCP pitch is commensurate with the underlying grating pitch. The polymer grid (polymer <b>616</b>A/polymer <b>616</b>B) is, in one embodiment, robust against certain small deviations from a perfect grid. For example, if small plugs effectively place an oxide or like material where a perfect grid would have metal, a perfect polymer <b>616</b>A/polymer <b>616</b>B grid can still be achieved. However, since the ILD lines grating is, in one embodiment, an idealized grating structure, with no metal disruptions of the ILD backbone, it may be necessary to render the ILD surface neutral since both types of polymer (<b>616</b>A and <b>616</b>B) will, in such an instance, be exposed to ILD like material while only one type is exposed to metal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">In an embodiment, the thickness of the coated polymer (polymer <b>616</b>A/polymer <b>616</b>B) is approximately the same as, or slightly thicker than, the ultimate thickness of an ILD ultimately formed in its place. In an embodiment, as described in greater detail below, the polymer grid is formed not as an etch resist, but rather as scaffolding for ultimately growing a permanent ILD layer there around. As such, the thickness of the polymer <b>616</b> (polymer <b>616</b>A/polymer <b>616</b>B) can be important since it may be used to define the ultimate thickness of a subsequently formed permanent ILD layer. That is, in one embodiment, the polymer grating shown in FIG. <b>6</b>D<b>1</b> is eventually replaced with an ILD grating of roughly the same thickness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">In an embodiment, as mentioned above, the grid of polymer <b>616</b>A/polymer <b>616</b>B of FIG. <b>6</b>D<b>1</b> is a block copolymer. In one such embodiment, the block copolymer molecule is a polymeric molecule formed of a chain of covalently bonded monomers. In a block copolymer, there are at least two different types of monomers, and these different types of monomers are primarily included within different blocks or contiguous sequences of monomers. The illustrated block copolymer molecule includes a block of polymer <b>616</b>A and a block of polymer <b>616</b>B. In an embodiment, the block of polymer <b>616</b>A includes predominantly a chain of covalently linked monomer A (e.g., A-A-A-A-A . . . ), whereas the block of polymer <b>616</b>B includes predominantly a chain of covalently linked monomer B (e.g., B-B-B-B-B . . . ). The monomers A and B may represent any of the different types of monomers used in block copolymers known in the arts. By way of example, the monomer A may represent monomers to form polystyrene, and the monomer B may represent monomers to form poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), although the scope of the invention is not so limited. In other embodiments, there may be more than two blocks. Moreover, in other embodiments, each of the blocks may include different types of monomers (e.g., each block may itself be a copolymer). In one embodiment, the block of polymer <b>616</b>A and the block of polymer <b>616</b>B are covalently bonded together. The block of polymer <b>616</b>A and the block of polymer <b>616</b>B may be of approximately equal length, or one block may be significantly longer than the other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">Typically, the blocks of block copolymers (e.g., the block of polymer <b>616</b>A and the block of polymer <b>616</b>B) may each have different chemical properties. As one example, one of the blocks may be relatively more hydrophobic (e.g., water repelling) and the other may be relatively more hydrophilic (water attracting). At least conceptually, one of the blocks may be relatively more similar to oil and the other block may be relatively more similar to water. Such differences in chemical properties between the different blocks of polymers, whether a hydrophilic-hydrophobic difference or otherwise, may cause the block copolymer molecules to self-assemble. For example, the self-assembly may be based on microphase separation of the polymer blocks. Conceptually, this may be similar to the phase separation of oil and water which are generally immiscible. Similarly, differences in hydrophilicity between the polymer blocks (e.g., one block is relatively hydrophobic and the other block is relatively hydrophilic), may cause a roughly analogous microphase separation where the different polymer blocks try to “separate” from each other due to chemical dislike for the other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">However, in an embodiment, since the polymer blocks are covalently bonded to one another, they cannot completely separate on a macroscopic scale. Rather, polymer blocks of a given type may tend to segregate or conglomerate with polymer blocks of the same type of other molecules in extremely small (e.g., nano-sized) regions or phases. The particular size and shape of the regions or microphases generally depends at least in part upon the relative lengths of the polymer blocks. In an embodiment, by way of example (as shown in FIG. <b>6</b>D<b>1</b>), in two block copolymers, if the blocks are approximately the same length, a grid like pattern of alternating polymer <b>616</b>A lines and polymer <b>616</b>B lines is generated. In another embodiment (not shown), in two block copolymers, if one of the blocks is longer than the other, but not too much longer than the other, columnar structures may formed. In the columnar structures, the block copolymer molecules may align with their shorter polymer blocks microphase separated into the interior of the columns and their longer polymer blocks extending away from the columns and surrounding the columns. For example, if the block of polymer <b>616</b>A were longer than the block of polymer <b>616</b>B, but not too much longer, columnar structures may formed in which many block copolymer molecules align with their shorter blocks of polymer <b>616</b>B forming columnar structures surrounded by a phase having the longer blocks of polymer <b>616</b>A. When this occurs in an area of sufficient size, a two-dimensional array of generally hexagonally-packed columnar structures may be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">In an embodiment, the polymer <b>616</b>A/polymer <b>616</b>B grating is first applied as an unassembled block copolymer layer portion that includes a block copolymer material applied, e.g., by brush or other coating process. The unassembled aspect refers to scenarios where, at the time of deposition, the block copolymer has not yet substantially phase separated and/or self-assembled to form nanostructures. In this unassembled form, the block polymer molecules are relatively highly randomized, with the different polymer blocks relatively highly randomly oriented and located, which is in contrast to the assembled block copolymer layer portion discussed in association with the resulting structure of FIG. <b>6</b>D<b>1</b>. The unassembled block copolymer layer portion may be applied in a variety of different ways. By way of example, the block copolymer may be dissolved in a solvent and then spin coated over the surface. Alternatively, the unassembled block copolymer may be spray coated, dip coated, immersion coated, or otherwise coated or applied over the surface. Other ways of applying block copolymers, as well as other ways known in the arts for applying similar organic coatings, may potentially be used. Then, the unassembled layer may form an assembled block copolymer layer portion, e.g., by microphase separation and/or self-assembly of the unassembled block copolymer layer portion. The microphase separation and/or self-assembly occurs through rearrangement and/or repositioning of the block copolymer molecules, and in particular to rearrangement and/or repositioning of the different polymer blocks of the block copolymer molecules.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">In one such embodiment, an annealing treatment may be applied to the unassembled block copolymer in order to initiate, accelerate, increase the quality of, or otherwise promote microphase separation and/or self-assembly. In some embodiments, the annealing treatment may include a treatment that is operable to increase a temperature of the block copolymer. One example of such a treatment is baking the layer, heating the layer in an oven or under a thermal lamp, applying infrared radiation to the layer, or otherwise applying heat to or increasing the temperature of the layer. The desired temperature increase will generally be sufficient to significantly accelerate the rate of microphase separation and/or self-assembly of the block polymer without damaging the block copolymer or any other important materials or structures of the integrated circuit substrate. Commonly, the heating may range between about 50° C. to about 300° C., or between about 75° C. to about 250° C., but not exceeding thermal degradation limits of the block copolymer or integrated circuit substrate. The heating or annealing may help to provide energy to the block copolymer molecules to make them more mobile/flexible in order to increase the rate of the microphase separation and/or improve the quality of the microphase separation. Such microphase separation or rearrangement/repositioning of the block copolymer molecules may lead to self-assembly to form extremely small (e.g., nano-scale) structures. The self-assembly may occur under the influence of surface energy, molecular affinities, and other surface-related and chemical-related forces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">In any case, in some embodiments, self-assembly of block copolymers, whether based on hydrophobic-hydrophilic differences or otherwise, may be used to form extremely small periodic structures (e.g., precisely spaced nano-scale structures or lines). In some embodiments, they may be used to form nano-scale lines or other nano-scale structures that can ultimately be used to form via and openings. In some embodiments, directed self assembly of block copolymers may be used to form vias that are self aligned with interconnects, as described in greater detail below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring again to FIG. <b>6</b>D<b>1</b>, in an embodiment, for a DSA process, in addition to direction from the underlying ILD/metal <b>604</b>/<b>602</b> surfaces the growth process can be affected by the sidewalls of the material of ILD lines <b>610</b>. As such, in one embodiment, DSA is controlled through graphoepitaxy (from the sidewalls of lines <b>610</b>) and chemoepitaxy (from the underlying exposed surface characteristics). Constraining the DSA process both physically and chemically can significantly aid the process from a defectivity standpoint. The resulting polymers <b>616</b>A/<b>616</b>B have fewer degrees of freedom and are fully constrained in all directions through chemical (e.g., underlying ILD or metal lines, or surface modifications made thereto by, for example, a brush approach) and physical (e.g., from the trenches formed between the ILD lines <b>610</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">In an alternative embodiment, a selective growth process is used in place of a DSA approach. FIG. <b>6</b>D<b>2</b> illustrates a cross-sectional view of the structure of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> following selective material deposition on the exposed portions of underlying metal and ILD lines, in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. <b>6</b>D<b>2</b>, a first material type <b>800</b> is grown above exposed portions of underlying ILD lines <b>604</b>. A second, different, material type <b>802</b> is grown above exposed portions of underlying metal lines <b>602</b>. In an embodiment, the selective growth is achieved by a dep-etch-dep-etch approach for each of the first and second materials, resulting in a plurality of layers of each of the materials, as depicted in FIG. <b>6</b>D<b>2</b>. Such an approach may be favorable versus conventional selective growth techniques which can form “mushroom-top” shaped films. The mushroom topping film growth tendency can be reduced through an alternating deposition/etch/deposition (dep-etch-dep-etch) approach. In another embodiment, a film is deposited selectively over the metal followed by a different film selectively over the ILD (or vice versa) and repeated numerous times creating a sandwich-like stack. In another embodiment, both materials are grown simultaneously in a reaction chamber (e.g., by a CVD style process) that grows selectively on each exposed region of the underlying substrate.</div>

Referring to the plan view and corresponding cross-sectional views (a)-(d) taken along axes, a-a′, b-b′, c-c′ and d-d′, respectively, the exposed regions of underlying ILD lines <b>604</b> are filled with a permanent interlayer dielectric (ILD) layer <b>618</b>. As such, the open spaces between all possible via positions are filled with an ILD layer <b>618</b> includes a hardmask layer <b>620</b> disposed thereon, as depicted in the plan view and in the cross-sectional views (b) and (d) of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6F</figref>. It is to be understood that the material of ILD layer <b>618</b> need not be the same material as ILD lines <b>610</b>.

In the case where ILD layer <b>618</b> is formed with an accompanying hardmask layer <b>620</b>, a special ILD fill material may be used (e.g., polymer encapsulated nanoparticles of ILD that fills holes/trenches).

Referring to the plan view and corresponding cross-sectional views (a)-(d) taken along axes, a-a′, b-b′, c-c′ and d-d′, respectively, via locations <b>622</b>A, <b>622</b>B and <b>622</b>C are opened by removal of polymer <b>616</b>B in select locations. In an embodiment, selective via location formation is accomplished by using a lithographic technique. In one such embodiment, polymer <b>616</b>B is globally removed with an ash and refilled with photoresist. The photoresist may be highly sensitive and have a large acid diffusion and aggressive deprotection or crosslinking (depending on resist tone) because the latent image is confined in both directions by ILD (e.g., by ILD lines <b>610</b> and ILD layer <b>618</b>). The resist serves as a digital switch to turn “on” or “off” depending whether a via is required in a particular location or not. Ideally, the photoresist can be used to fill the holes only, without spilling over. In an embodiment, the via locations <b>622</b>A, <b>622</b>B and <b>622</b>C are fully confined with the process such that line edge or width roughness (LWR) and line collapse and/or reflection is mitigated if not eliminated. In an embodiment, low doses are used with EUV/EBDW and increase runrate significantly. In one embodiment, an additional advantage with the use of EBDW is that only a single shot type/size that can increase runrate by significantly reducing the number of apertures required as well as lowering the dose that needs to be delivered. In a case that 193 nm immersion lithography is used, in an embodiment, the process flow confines the via locations in both directions such the size of the via that actually is patterned is twice the size of the actual via on the wafer (e.g., assuming 1:1 line/space patterns). Alternatively, the via locations can be selected in the reverse tone where the vias that need to be retained are protected with photoresist and the remaining sites are removed and later filled with ILD. Such an approach can allow a single metal fill/polish process at the end of the patterning flow rather than two separate metal deposition steps.</div>

Referring to the plan view and corresponding cross-sectional views (a) and (b) taken along axes, a-a′ and b-b′, respectively, plug positions <b>628</b>A, <b>628</b>B and <b>628</b>C are preserved by forming a mask or resist layer over those locations. Such preservation patterning may be referred to as metal end-to-end lithographic patterning, wherein plug positions are determined where breaks in subsequently formed metal lines are required. It is to be understood that since the plug locations can only be in those locations where ILD layer <b>618</b>/hardmask <b>620</b> are positioned, plugs can occur over the previous layer ILD lines <b>604</b>. In an embodiment, the patterning is achieved by using a lithography operation (e.g., EUV, EBDW or immersion 193 nm). In an embodiment, the process illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6J</figref>, demonstrates use of a positive tone patterning process where the regions where spaces between metal need to occur are preserved.

It is to be understood that the recessing of ILD layer <b>618</b> and ILD layer <b>626</b> is performed without etching or recessing ILD lines <b>610</b>. The selectivity may be achieved by use of a hardmask layer <b>612</b> on the ILD lines (as depicted in cross-sectional views (a) and (b)). Alternatively, in a case that the ILD lines <b>610</b> are composed of an ILD material different from the material of ILD layer <b>618</b> and ILD layer <b>626</b>, a selective etch may be used even in the absence of a hardmask <b>612</b>. The recessing of ILD layer <b>618</b> and ILD layer <b>626</b> is to provide locations for the second level of metal lines, as isolated by ILD lines <b>610</b>, as described below. The extent or depth of the recess is, in one embodiment, selected based on the desired ultimate thickness of the metal lines formed thereon.

Referring to the plan view and corresponding cross-sectional views (a), (b) and (c) taken along axes, a-a′, b-b′ and c-c′, respectively, metal for forming metal interconnect lines is formed conformally above the structure of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6K</figref>. The metal is then planarized, e.g., by CMP, to provide metal lines <b>630</b>, which are confined to locations above recessed ILD layer <b>618</b>′ and recessed ILD layer <b>626</b>′. The metal lines <b>630</b> are coupled with underlying metal lines <b>602</b> through the predetermined via locations <b>624</b>A, <b>624</b>B and <b>624</b>C (<b>624</b>B is shown in cross-sectional view (c); note that for illustrative purposes, another via <b>632</b> is depicted directly adjacent plug <b>628</b>B in cross-sectional view (b) even though this is inconsistent with the previous figures). The metal lines <b>630</b> are isolated from one another by ILD lines <b>610</b> and are disrupted or broken-up by the preserved plugs <b>628</b>A, <b>628</b>B and <b>628</b>C.

The metal (e.g., copper and associated barrier and seed layers) deposition and planarization process to form metal lines <b>630</b> may be that typically used for standard back end of line (BEOL) single or dual damascene processing.

It is to be understood that the above process operations may be practiced in alternative sequences, not every operation need be performed and/or additional process operations may be performed. Furthermore, although the above process flow focused on applications of directed self-assembly (DSA), selective growth processes may be used instead in one or more locations of the process flow. In any case, the resulting structures enable fabrication, by selective metal deposition, of vias that are directly centered on underlying metal lines. That is, the vias may be wider than, narrower than, or the same thickness as the underlying metal lines, e.g., due to non-perfect selective etch processing. Nonetheless, in an embodiment, the centers of the vias are directly aligned (match up) with the centers of the metal lines. As such, in an embodiment, offset due to conventional lithograph/dual damascene patterning that must otherwise be tolerated, is not a factor for the resulting structures described herein.</div>
