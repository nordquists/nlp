<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Technical Field</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an ultrasonic transducer element chip, a probe that uses the ultrasonic transducer element chip, and an electronic instrument and an ultrasonic diagnostic device that use the probe.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">As described in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2011-82624, for example, an ultrasonic transducer element chip is provided with a substrate. A plurality of openings are formed in the substrate. An ultrasonic transducer element is provided in each of the openings. The ultrasonic transducer element chip is provided with a vibrating film. The vibrating film covers the openings from a surface of the substrate.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">When the openings are formed in the substrate, the strength of the substrate is deteriorated. The strength is insufficient with respect to force in a thickness direction of the substrate. Therefore, when the ultrasonic transducer element chip is pressed against a target to be tested, the ultrasonic transducer element chip will often be damaged.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">According to at least one embodiment of the present invention, an ultrasonic transducer element chip that is thin and has sufficient strength in a thickness direction of a substrate can be provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">An ultrasonic transducer element chip according to one aspect of the present invention includes a substrate, a plurality of ultrasonic transducer elements and a plate-shaped member. The substrate includes a partition wall section defining a plurality of openings arranged in an array pattern. A wall thickness of the partition wall section is smaller than a wall height of partition wall section. Each of the ultrasonic transducer elements is provided in each of the openings. The plate-shaped member is fixed on a surface of the substrate opposite to a surface of the substrate on which the ultrasonic transducer elements are provided. The plate-shaped member covers at least one of the openings in a plan view seen along a thickness direction of the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">In this ultrasonic transducer element chip, the ultrasonic transducer element can be formed to be thin. The ultrasonic transducer element can be formed in a thin substrate. Even in a case where the plate-shaped member is fixed to a substrate, the ultrasonic transducer element chip can be formed to be thin. At the same time, the plate-shaped member reinforces the strength of the substrate. In particular, since the wall thickness of the partition wall section between the openings is smaller than the wall height of the partition wall section between the openings, the sufficient rigidity of the partition wall section can be obtained in the thickness direction of the substrate due to the section modulus. Force in the thickness direction of the substrate is transmitted through the partition wall section and supported by the plate-shaped member. In this manner, the ultrasonic transducer element chip has sufficient strength in the thickness direction of the substrate. Here, the partition wall section corresponds to parts of the substrate sandwiched between spaces of the adjacent openings. The wall thickness refers to the thickness of the partition wall section, that is, the distance between the openings. When the wall surface of the partition wall section is a flat surface, the wall thickness can be defined as the length of the perpendicular line that is orthogonal to the wall surface. The wall height can be defined as the length of the wall surface defined in the thickness direction of the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">In the ultrasonic transducer element chip, the plate-shaped member is preferably bonded to at least one bonding region of the partition wall section. When the partition wall section is bonded to the plate-shaped member, the movement of the partition wall section is restricted by the plate-shaped member. Thus, vibration of the partition wall section can be prevented. As a result, cross talk between the ultrasonic transducer elements can be prevented. Further, when the movement of the partition wall section is restricted, vibration of the partition wall section can be prevented from acting on ultrasonic vibration of the ultrasonic transducer elements. Then, ultrasonic vibration in a clear vibration mode can be obtained in the ultrasonic transducer elements. Consequently, when vibration of the partition wall section is avoided, the amplitude of ultrasonic vibration can be prevented from being decreased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">In the ultrasonic transducer element chip, the partition wall section is preferably arranged so that an outline of each the openings is defined as a quadrangle. When the openings having a quadrangular outline are adjacent to each other, the partition wall section has a uniform wall thickness. In particular, as the density of the ultrasonic transducer elements increases, the wall thickness of the partition wall section uniformly decreases. Therefore, the rigidity of the partition wall section is significantly deteriorated. In such an instance, by bonding the partition wall section to the plate-shaped member, vibration of the partition wall section can be effectively prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">In the ultrasonic transducer element chip, the quadrangle preferably has two opposed long sides, and the bonding region of the partition wall section is preferably a region including a center position of each of the long sides. Therefore, a part of the partition wall section in which the amplitude of vibration is large is bonded to the plate-shaped member. As a result, vibration of the partition wall section can be effectively prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">In the ultrasonic transducer element chip, the bonding region of the partition wall section is preferably a region including an entire length of each of the long sides. When the partition wall section is bonded to the plate-shaped member over the entire length of the long side, vibration of the partition wall section can be securely prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">In the ultrasonic transducer element chip, the partition wall section is preferably surface-bonded to the plate-shaped member over an entire surface corresponding to each of the long sides disposed between the openings. When the partition wall section is surface-bonded to the plate-shaped member with respect to the entire surface between the openings over the entire length of the long side, vibration of the partition wall section can be securely prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">In the ultrasonic transducer element chip, the partition wall section corresponding to each side of the quadrangle preferably includes the bonding region. When the partition wall section is bonded to the plate-shaped member in each side of the quadrangle, vibration of the partition wall section can be securely prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">In the ultrasonic transducer element chip, the bonding region of the partition wall section preferably continuously surrounds the quadrangle. When the partition wall section is bonded to the plate-shaped member with respect to the entire region of the quadrangle, vibration of the partition wall section can be securely prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">In the ultrasonic transducer element chip, the partition wall section is preferably surface-bonded to the plate-shaped member over an entire surface corresponding to an entire periphery of the quadrangle. When the partition wall section is surface-bonded to the plate-shaped member with respect to the entire surface between the openings over the entire periphery of the quadrangle, vibration of the partition wall section can be securely prevented.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">(1) Overall Configuration of Ultrasonic Diagnostic Device</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically shows a configuration of an ultrasonic diagnostic device <b>11</b> as an example of an electronic instrument according to an embodiment of the present invention.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> schematically shows a plan view of the element chip <b>17</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. The element chip <b>17</b> is provided with a substrate <b>21</b>. An element array <b>22</b> is formed on a surface of the substrate <b>21</b>. The element array <b>22</b> is constructed with an arrangement of an ultrasonic transducer element (hereinafter referred to as “element”) <b>23</b>. The arrangement is formed in a matrix having a plurality of columns and a plurality of rows. Each element <b>23</b> has a piezoelectric element section. The piezoelectric element section is constructed of a lower electrode <b>24</b>, an upper electrode <b>25</b>, and a piezoelectric film <b>26</b>. The piezoelectric film <b>26</b> is sandwiched between the lower electrode <b>24</b> and the upper electrode <b>25</b> in each element <b>23</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">The lower electrode <b>24</b> has a plurality of first conductive bodies <b>24</b> <i>a</i>. The first conductive bodies <b>24</b> <i>a </i>extend in a row direction of the arrangement in parallel to each other. One first conductive body <b>24</b> <i>a </i>is assigned to each row of the elements <b>23</b>. One first conductive body <b>24</b> <i>a </i>is provided in common with respect to the piezoelectric films <b>26</b> of the elements <b>23</b> lined up in the row direction of the arrangement. Both ends of the first conductive body <b>24</b> <i>a </i>are connected to a pair of extraction wirings <b>27</b>, respectively. The extraction wirings <b>27</b> extend in a column direction of the arrangement in parallel to each other. All the first conductive bodies <b>24</b> <i>a </i>have the same length. In this manner, the lower electrode <b>24</b> is provided in common with respect to the elements <b>23</b> of the entire matrix.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">The upper electrode <b>25</b> has a plurality of second conductive bodies <b>25</b> <i>a</i>.

One second conductive body <b>25</b> <i>a </i>is assigned to each column of the elements <b>23</b>. One second conductive body <b>25</b> <i>a </i>is provided in common with respect to the piezoelectric films <b>26</b> of the elements <b>23</b> lined up in the column direction of the arrangement. Power distribution to the elements <b>23</b> is switched per column. Line scanning or sector scanning is achieved corresponding to such switching of power distribution. Since the elements <b>23</b> in one column output ultrasonic waves at the same time, the number of the elements <b>23</b> in one column, that is, the row number of the arrangement can be determined based on the output level of ultrasonic waves. For example, the row number may be set to be around 10-15. In the drawing, five rows are illustrated for simplicity. The column number of the arrangement can be determined based on the extent of an area to be scanned. For example, the column number may be set to be 128 or 256. In the drawing, eight columns are illustrated for simplicity. Regarding the arrangement, a zigzag pattern may be used. In the zigzag pattern, a group of the elements <b>23</b> in an even column may be displaced with respect to a group of the elements <b>23</b> in an odd column by one-half of the row pitch. The number of the elements in one of an odd column and an even column may be smaller than the number of the elements in the other of an odd column and an even column by one. Further, the role of the lower electrode <b>24</b> and the role of the upper electrode <b>25</b> may be switched. Specifically, the upper electrode may be connected in common to the elements <b>23</b> of the entire matrix, and the lower electrode may be connected in common to the elements <b>23</b> in each column of the arrangement.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, each of the elements <b>23</b> has a vibrating film <b>43</b>. In order to achieve the vibrating film <b>43</b>, an opening <b>45</b> is formed in each of the elements <b>23</b> on a substrate base <b>44</b> of the substrate <b>21</b>. The openings <b>45</b> are arranged in an array pattern with respect to the substrate base <b>44</b>. A flexible film <b>46</b> is formed all over a surface of the substrate base <b>44</b>. The flexible film <b>46</b> is constructed of a silicon oxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) layer <b>47</b> layered on the surface of the substrate base <b>44</b>, and a zirconium oxide (ZrO<sub>2</sub>) layer <b>48</b> layered on a surface of the silicon oxide layer <b>47</b>. The flexible film <b>46</b> contacts the openings <b>45</b>. In this manner, a part of the flexible film <b>46</b> serves as the vibrating film <b>43</b> corresponding to the outline of the opening <b>45</b>. The film thickness of the silicon oxide layer <b>47</b> can be determined based on the resonance frequency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">The lower electrode <b>24</b>, the piezoelectric film <b>26</b>, and the upper electrode <b>25</b> are layered on a surface of the vibrating film <b>43</b> in this order. As for the lower electrode <b>24</b>, a layered film of titanium (Ti), iridium (Ir), platinum (Pt), and titanium (Ti) can be used, for example. The piezoelectric film <b>26</b> may be formed of piezoelectric zirconate titanate (PZT), for example. The upper electrode <b>25</b> may be formed of iridium (Ir), for example. Another conductive material may be used for the lower electrode <b>24</b> and the upper electrode <b>25</b>. Another piezoelectric material may be used for the piezoelectric film <b>26</b>. The piezoelectric film <b>26</b> completely covers the lower electrode <b>24</b> under the upper electrode <b>25</b>. The function of the piezoelectric film <b>26</b> prevents short circuit between the upper electrode <b>25</b> and the lower electrode <b>24</b> from occurring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">A protective film <b>49</b> is layered on the surface of the substrate <b>21</b>. The protective film <b>49</b> covers, for example, the entire surface of the substrate <b>21</b>. As a result, the protective film <b>49</b> covers the element array <b>22</b>, the first terminal array <b>32</b> <i>a</i>, the second terminal array <b>32</b> <i>b</i>, a first end <b>37</b> <i>a </i>of the first flexible printed substrate <b>37</b>, and the first end <b>41</b> <i>a </i>of the second flexible printed substrate <b>41</b>. For example, a silicone resin film may be used for the protective film <b>49</b>. The protective film <b>49</b> protects the configuration of the element array <b>22</b>, the bonding of the first terminal array <b>32</b> <i>a </i>and the first flexible printed substrate <b>37</b>, and the bonding of the second terminal array <b>32</b> <i>b </i>and the second flexible printed substrate <b>41</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">A partition wall <b>51</b> (one example of a partition wall section) is laid out between the openings <b>45</b> adjacent in the row direction and the column direction of the matrix. The openings <b>45</b> are partitioned by the partition wall <b>51</b>. The wall thickness “t” of the partition wall <b>51</b> corresponds to the distance between the hollow spaces of the openings <b>45</b>. The partition wall <b>51</b> has two wall surfaces in planes extending in parallel to each other. The wall thickness “t” of the partition wall <b>51</b> corresponds to the distance between the wall surfaces. Specifically, the wall thickness “t” of the partition wall <b>51</b> corresponds to the length of a perpendicular line that is orthogonal to the wall surfaces and is sandwiched by the wall surfaces. When the wall thickness of the partition wall <b>51</b> varies along the thickness direction of the substrate <b>21</b> (for example, see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>), the wall thickness “t” refers to a maximum length between the wall surfaces of the partition wall <b>51</b>. The wall height “H” of the partition wall <b>51</b> corresponds to the depth of the opening <b>45</b>. The depth of the opening <b>45</b> corresponds to the thickness of the substrate base <b>44</b>. Therefore, the wall height “H” of the partition wall <b>51</b> can be defined as the length of the wall surface defined in the thickness direction of the substrate base <b>44</b>. Since the substrate base <b>44</b> has a uniform thickness, the partition wall <b>51</b> can have a uniform wall height “H” over the entire length. When the wall thickness “t” of the partition wall <b>51</b> is decreased, the arrangement density of the vibrating film <b>43</b> can be increased. This can contribute to downsizing of the element chip <b>17</b>. When the wall height “H” of the partition wall <b>51</b> is larger than the wall thickness “t” of the partition wall <b>51</b>, the bending rigidity of the element chip <b>17</b> can be increased. Consequently, the distance between the openings <b>45</b> is set to be smaller than the depth of the opening <b>45</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">A reinforcing plate <b>52</b> (one example of a plate-shaped member) is fixed to a rear surface of the substrate base <b>44</b>. The rear surface of the substrate base <b>44</b> is layered on a surface of the reinforcing plate <b>52</b>. The surface of the reinforcing plate <b>52</b> extends in a hypothetical plane HP. Since the rear surface of the substrate base <b>44</b> also extends in the hypothetical plane HP, the rear surface of the substrate base <b>44</b> can contact the surface of the reinforcing plate <b>52</b> with an area as large as possible. The reinforcing plate <b>52</b> closes the openings <b>45</b> in a rear surface of the element chip <b>17</b>. The reinforcing plate <b>52</b> covers the openings <b>45</b> in a plan view along a thickness direction of the substrate base <b>44</b>. The reinforcing plate <b>52</b> may have a rigid base material. For example, the reinforcing plate <b>52</b> may be formed of a silicon base plate. The plate thickness of the substrate base <b>44</b> is set to be around 100 μm, and the plate thickness of the reinforcing plate <b>52</b> is set to be around 100-150 μm.

<heading id="h-0009">(4) Operation of Ultrasonic Diagnostic Device</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">Next, the operation of the ultrasonic diagnostic device <b>11</b> will be explained briefly. The processing circuit <b>74</b> gives the driving/receiving circuit <b>72</b> instructions to transmit and receive ultrasonic waves. The driving/receiving circuit <b>72</b> supplies a control signal to the multiplexer <b>61</b>, and supplies a driving signal to each of the pulsers <b>67</b>. The pulser <b>67</b> outputs a pulse signal in response to the supply of the driving signal. The multiplexer <b>61</b> connects the port of the group of ports <b>61</b> <i>a </i>to the port of the group of ports <b>61</b> <i>b </i>in response to the instructions of the control signal. The pulse signal is supplied to the elements <b>23</b> per column through the lower electrode terminals <b>33</b>, <b>35</b> and the upper electrode terminals <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> in response to the selection of the port. The vibrating film <b>43</b> vibrates in response to the supply of the pulse signal. As a result, desired ultrasonic waves are emitted toward a target (for example, the inside of a human body).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">After ultrasonic waves are transmitted, the changing switch <b>64</b> is switched. The multiplexer <b>61</b> maintains the connection relation of the ports. The changing switch <b>64</b> establishes a connection between the reception channel <b>66</b> and the signal line <b>63</b> instead of a connection between the transmission channel <b>65</b> and the signal line <b>63</b>. Reflected waves of ultrasonic waves vibrate the vibrating film <b>43</b>. As a result, a detection signal is output from the element <b>23</b>. The detection signal is converted into a digital signal, and sent into the driving/receiving circuit <b>72</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">Transmission and reception of ultrasonic waves are repeated. For repeating transmission and reception of ultrasonic waves, the multiplexer <b>61</b> changes the connection relation of the ports. As a result, line scanning or sector scanning is achieved. When scanning is finished, the processing circuit <b>74</b> generates an image based on the digital signal of the detection signal. The generated image is displayed on the screen of the display panel <b>15</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">In the element chip <b>17</b>, the element <b>23</b> can be formed to be thin. The element <b>23</b> can be formed on the thin substrate <b>21</b>. Even in a case where the reinforcing plate <b>52</b> is fixed to the substrate <b>21</b>, the element chip <b>17</b> can be formed to be thin. At the same time, the reinforcing plate <b>52</b> reinforces the strength of the substrate <b>21</b>. In particular, since the wall thickness “t” is smaller than the wall height “H” in the partition wall <b>51</b>, the sufficient rigidity of the partition wall <b>51</b> can be obtained in the thickness direction of the substrate <b>21</b> due to the section modulus. Force in the thickness direction of the substrate <b>21</b> is transmitted through the partition wall <b>51</b> and supported by the reinforcing plate <b>52</b>. In this manner, the element chip <b>17</b> has sufficient strength in the thickness direction of the substrate <b>21</b>. Accordingly, even when the plate thickness of the substrate <b>21</b> is set to be around 100 μm, for example, the reinforcing plate <b>52</b> can prevent the substrate <b>21</b> from being damaged. On the other hand, in a case where the element array is constructed of a bulk-type ultrasonic transducer element, the plate thickness of the substrate is set to be around several millimeters. Even when the reinforcing plate <b>52</b> is bonded, the thickness of the element chip <b>17</b> according to the present embodiment can be reduced securely compared to the case where the element array is constructed of a bulk-type ultrasonic transducer element. In addition, since the acoustic impedance of the vibrating film <b>43</b> is close to that of a human body compared to a bulk-type ultrasonic transducer element, an acoustic impedance matching layer can be omitted in the element chip <b>17</b> unlike in the case of a bulk-type ultrasonic transducer element. Omission of the matching layer can further contribute to making the element chip <b>17</b> thinner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">The reinforcing plate <b>52</b> is bonded to each of the partition walls <b>51</b> in at least one bonding region. When the partition walls <b>51</b> are bonded to the reinforcing plate <b>52</b>, the movement of the partition walls <b>51</b> is restricted by the reinforcing plate <b>52</b>. Thus, vibration of the partition walls <b>51</b> can be prevented. As a result, cross talk between the elements <b>23</b> can be prevented. Further, when the movement of the partition walls <b>51</b> is restricted, vibration of the partition walls <b>51</b> can be prevented from acting on ultrasonic vibration of the elements <b>23</b>. Then, ultrasonic vibration in a clear vibration mode can be obtained in the elements <b>23</b>. When vibration of the partition walls <b>51</b> is avoided, the amplitude of ultrasonic vibration can be prevented from being decreased. On the other hand, when the partition wall <b>51</b> moves, a distorted vibration mode having a lower frequency than the vertical vibration mode of the vibrating film <b>43</b> occurs. Furthermore, the kinetic energy of the vibrating film <b>43</b> decreases by the movement of the partition wall <b>51</b>, and the amplitude of the vibration decreases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">When the openings <b>45</b> having a quadrangular outline are adjacent to each other, the partition walls <b>51</b> can be formed to have a uniform wall thickness “t”. Thus, the density of the elements <b>23</b> can be increased. As the density of the elements <b>23</b> increases, the wall thickness “t” of the partition walls <b>51</b> uniformly decreases. Therefore, the rigidity of the partition walls <b>51</b> is significantly deteriorated. In such an instance, by bonding the partition walls <b>51</b> to the reinforcing plate <b>52</b>, vibration of the partition walls <b>51</b> can be effectively prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">The bonding region of the partition walls <b>51</b> can be a region that includes a center position of the long side. Therefore, a part of the partition walls <b>51</b> in which the amplitude of vibration is large is bonded to the reinforcing plate <b>52</b>. As a result, vibration of the partition walls <b>51</b> can be effectively prevented. Also, the bonding region of the partition walls <b>51</b> can be a region that includes the entire length of the long side. When the partition walls <b>51</b> are bonded to the reinforcing plate <b>52</b> over the entire length of the long side, vibration of the partition walls <b>51</b> can be securely prevented. Further, the partition walls <b>51</b> can be surface-bonded with respect to the entire surface between the openings <b>45</b> over the entire length of the long side. When the partition walls <b>51</b> are surface-bonded to the reinforcing plate <b>52</b> with respect to the entire surface between the openings <b>45</b> over the entire length of the long side, vibration of the partition walls <b>51</b> can be securely prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">It is sufficient that the bonding region of the partition walls <b>51</b> is located in at least one position of each side of the quadrangle. When the partition walls <b>51</b> are bonded to the reinforcing plate <b>52</b> in each side of the quadrangle, vibration of the partition walls <b>51</b> can be securely prevented. Also, the bonding region of the partition walls <b>51</b> can continuously surround the quadrangle. When the partition walls <b>51</b> are bonded to the reinforcing plate <b>52</b> with respect to the entire region of the quadrangle, vibration of the partition walls <b>51</b> can be securely prevented.
