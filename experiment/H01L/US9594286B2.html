<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the priority of Korean Patent Application No. 2012-0157792 filed on Dec. 31, 2012, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a transparent display apparatus and a method for controlling the same, and more particularly, to a transparent display apparatus and a method for reducing light interference to improve visibility of images displayed on the transparent display apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">A transparent display apparatus allows a user to see objects placed behind the display device while viewing the image displayed by the display device. Although there have been attempts to provide transparent display device with a liquid-crystal display (LCD), the two polarizing plates included in the LCD display significantly reduces the light transmittance rate through the display device. Accordingly, it is extremely difficult to implement transparent display apparatus with LCD based display device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Display devices employing organic light-emitting diode (OLED) do not require such polarizing plates as the LCD display device. For this reason, the OLED based display device has been considered as the promising component in implementing a transparent display apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Such a transparent display apparatus can be applied as a front glass for a vehicle or as a smart window for a house for displaying information while allowing the user to view the outside environment through the transparent display.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">In this case, however, the visibility of the information displayed on the transparent display apparatus is often degraded by certain degree depending on the brightness of the environment. More specifically, it becomes difficult for the user to see the image on the display device when the external light at entering from the rear side of the transparent display apparatus is excessively brighter than the light emitted from the display device. More specifically, it becomes difficult for the user to recognize the information displayed on the transparent display device when the external light entering from the rear side of the display apparatus is excessively brighter than the light emitted from the display device itself.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Attempts have been made to solve the aforementioned problem by shielding the external light entering from the rear side of the entire transparent display apparatus. This method, however, prevents the user to see the outside environment through the display device, significantly limiting the user experience in using the transparent display device, thereby defeating the purpose of having the transparent display apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, there remains a need for a transparent display device capable of maintaining both the visibility of the displayed image as well as the transparency of the display device.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

Therefore, a first component mentioned below may be a second component within the technical spirit of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">In the drawings, size and thickness of each element are arbitrarily illustrated for convenience of description, and the present invention is not necessarily limited to those illustrated in the drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram of a transparent display apparatus. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the transparent display apparatus <b>100</b> includes a transparent display unit <b>110</b> and a light control unit <b>120</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">The transparent display apparatus <b>100</b> is configured to emit light from its pixels while transmitting external light through the transparent display apparatus <b>100</b>. The external light passed through the display apparatus <b>100</b> allows the user to simultaneously recognize the image displayed by the display apparatus and the view behind the display apparatus <b>100</b>. The user receives image information delivered by the external light passed through the transparent display and image information delivered by the light emitted from the display.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">The external light through the transparent display and the light emitted by the display become a blended image and delivered to the user. The term “information” means that information contained within the image which is to be seen to users. The term “visibility” means a certain degree of recognition of the information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">Information delivered to the user is divided into information displayed on the transparent display apparatus <b>100</b> and information from the view through the rear side of the transparent display apparatus <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">Regarding the overall visibility of the blended image on the transparent display apparatus <b>100</b>, the visibility of the image displayed by the transparent display apparatus <b>100</b> and the visibility of the view behind the display apparatus <b>100</b> through the transparent display apparatus <b>100</b> are independently considered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">The transparent display apparatus <b>100</b> is configured to maintain the good visibility of the image displayed by the transparent display apparatus <b>100</b> as well as the visibility of the view behind the display apparatus <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">Illuminance level of an ambient environment affects the visibility of the image displayed by display apparatus <b>100</b>. The amount of light is measured in lux unit by a light sensor. For example, the illuminance in an office ranges from about 200 to 500 lux, the illuminance in the shade of a building or forest in the daytime ranges from about 20,000 to 30,000 lux, and the illuminance in the sun in the daytime ranges from about 50,000 to 100,000 lux.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">The transparent display unit <b>110</b> comprises an emissive area and a transmissive area adjacent to the emissive area. The maximum brightness of the emissive area is limited by the transparent display unit <b>110</b>. In general, the brightness of the emissive area is very lower than the brightness of the sun light. That is, the ambient light through the transmissive area could be much brighter than the light from the emissive area depending on the ambient environment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">The term “visibility” also can be explained in terms of “contrast ratio of the image”. The problem occurs when the transmissive area is much brighter than the emissive area. The light through the transmissive area affects the neighboring emissive areas causes the neighboring emissive areas to become brighter due to diffusion and/or diffraction of light. Consequently, the emissive areas become brighter and the contrast ratio becomes decreased and the visibility is degraded such that it is difficult to differentiate the image and the view.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">The non-transparent display apparatus has attempted to suppress the front surface reflection of the display apparatus under the high illuminance environment. However, such a configuration only considers light reflected from a front surface of the display apparatus. In the transparent display apparatus <b>100</b>, light entering from the rear side as well as the light reflected from the front surface is taken account of. Further, since the light entering from the rear side of the transparent display apparatus <b>100</b> is not a source of interference for the image to be displayed on the display apparatus <b>100</b> but also includes information of behind view that the user intended to see, the luminance of an image displayed by the transparent display apparatus and the light entering from the rear side need to be maintained under the various illuminance conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">In an embodiment, the transparent display apparatus <b>100</b> controls transmittance of an object <b>115</b> displayed on the transparent display unit <b>110</b> so as to ensure the visibility of the object <b>115</b> and ensure the visibility of the view behind the transparent display apparatus <b>100</b> at the same time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">In the present disclosure, the term “transmittance” refers a value obtained by dividing the amount of light passed-through the transparent display unit <b>110</b> by the amount of light exposed on the rear side of the light control unit <b>120</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">In the present disclosure, the term “object” refers to an object within the image displayed on the display apparatus <b>110</b>, which contains information. The object <b>115</b> includes all objects capable of being displayed on the display apparatus. That is, any object may be defined as the object <b>115</b> in the present disclosure as long as at least one characteristic of the object <b>115</b> can be distinguished from its surroundings. The characteristic of the object <b>115</b> could be at least one of form, shape, color, illuminance, contrast, size, position, contour, a degree of importance, type, and movement. The object can be recognized from the surroundings. That is, the object <b>115</b> may include all distinguishable objects within the image displayed by the transparent display unit <b>110</b>. The object may include a background, a person, a text, an icon, and a program window. When the visibility of the object <b>115</b> within the displayed video is degraded, it may be difficult for a user to obtain desired information from the transparent display apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">The object <b>115</b> is displayed on the display unit <b>110</b> of the transparent display apparatus <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">The transparent display unit <b>110</b> is a transparent organic light-emitting display device. The organic light-emitting display device is a display apparatus configured to cause an organic light-emitting layer to emit by current flow through the organic light-emitting layer. The transparent organic light-emitting display device emits light having a certain wavelength by using the organic light-emitting layer. The transparent organic light-emitting display device includes at least a cathode, the organic light-emitting layer, and an anode. The light control unit <b>120</b> has an adjustable transmittance for external light and controls the transmittance of an area corresponding to the object. The light control unit <b>120</b> improves the visibility of the object <b>115</b> by controlling transmittance of an area <b>125</b> corresponding to the object. Furthermore, improvement of the visibility of the object <b>115</b> improves the visibility of the displayed video.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">The area <b>125</b> corresponding to the object means an area determined by a boundary of the object <b>115</b>. A boundary of the object <b>115</b> includes area <b>125</b> corresponding to the object and may additionally include a surrounding area of the object <b>115</b>. The surrounding area of the object <b>115</b> is formed by extending the boundary of the object <b>115</b> to the outside of the object <b>115</b>. The surrounding area of the object <b>115</b> may be an area formed by extending from the boundary of the object <b>115</b> to the outside by at least one pixel or more. By setting the surrounding area of the object, the transparent display apparatus <b>100</b> can improve the low visibility problem due to light incident on the transmissive area adjacent to the boundary of the object or arbitrarily emphasize the object.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">The light control unit <b>120</b> is configured to change a path of light incident on the light control unit <b>120</b> by transmitting, scattering, absorbing or shielding the light, or change characteristics of the light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">The controlling of the transmittance of the light incident on the transparent display apparatus <b>100</b> is closely relevant to whether the incident external light is absorbed or passes through the transparent display apparatus. If reflectivity of the light control unit <b>120</b> is high, even though the light from the rear side of the transparent display apparatus <b>100</b> can be blocked, the visibility of the transparent display apparatus <b>100</b> is degraded. Accordingly, the light control unit <b>120</b> may have a transmittance of 1% to 90%, and the reflectivity of the light control unit <b>120</b> may be 10% or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">Furthermore, the light control unit <b>120</b> may be a MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical System) device. The MEMS device includes a substrate, thin-film layers, an air layer, and a reflection film layer. In the MEMS device, a screen is displayed according to two states of an open state and a collapsed state. In the MEMS device, when a voltage is not applied, the thin-film layers are separated, so that selective reflection can be carried out. When a low voltage is applied to generate an electrostatic force, the reflection film layer is moved to absorb light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">Furthermore, the light control unit <b>120</b> may be an electro wetting device or an electro chromic device. However, for the sake of convenience in description, a case where the light control unit <b>120</b> is a light control unit <b>120</b> in which transmittance is determined by charged particles, will be described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for sake of convenience in description, although the transparent display unit <b>110</b> and the light control unit <b>120</b> are distanced from each other, the transparent display unit <b>110</b> and the light control unit <b>120</b> may be bonded by an adhesive or glue or may be positioned sufficiently close to each other so as to be driven as a transparent display apparatus <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">Since the light control unit <b>120</b> and the transparent display unit <b>110</b> have the same resolution, an area displayed by the transparent display unit <b>110</b> and an area controlled by the light control unit <b>120</b> are substantially the same. Alternatively, the transparent display unit <b>110</b> and the light control unit <b>120</b> may have different resolutions. For example, the resolution of the light control unit <b>120</b> may be lower than the resolution of the transparent display unit <b>110</b>. In such a case, an algorithm for allowing the resolution of the transparent display unit <b>110</b> to be compatible with the resolution of the light control unit <b>120</b> may be further provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">The light control unit <b>120</b> of the transparent display apparatus <b>100</b> may be changed in design depending on a type of the transparent display unit <b>110</b>. Specifically, an area ratio of the transmissive area to the emissive area of the transparent display apparatus <b>100</b> may be changed depending on whether or not the type of the transparent display unit is a top emission type, a bottom emission type or a double-side emission type. Driving wires of the light control unit <b>120</b> may be arranged within the emissive area other than the transmissive area in order to improve the transmittance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in the transparent display apparatus <b>100</b> according to the embodiment of the present invention, the transparent display unit <b>110</b> and the light control unit <b>120</b> are overlapping and disposed close to each other or come in contact with each other as stated above. The object <b>115</b> is displayed on the transparent display unit <b>110</b>. The transmittance of the area <b>125</b> corresponding to the object may be controlled by the light control unit <b>120</b>, thereby adjusting the portion of the external light passing through the transparent display unit <b>110</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">In the transparent display apparatus <b>100</b>, the transmittance of the area <b>125</b> corresponding to the object is decreased to decrease the portion of the external light passing through the transparent display unit <b>110</b>. Since the visibility of the object <b>115</b> is improved by decreasing the transmittance of the area <b>125</b> corresponding to the object, the user can clearly recognize the displayed object <b>115</b> and maintain the informativeness of the background on the rear side of the transparent display apparatus <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">Hereinafter, a specific configuration of the transparent display apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of a transparent display apparatus depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> according to an embodiment of the present invention. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> illustrates a transparent display unit <b>210</b> and a light control unit <b>230</b>. The transparent display unit <b>210</b> may be a transparent organic light-emitting display device in which an image is displayed, and the light control unit <b>230</b> may be a charged-particle control device in which transmittance is controlled.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">The transparent display unit <b>210</b> includes an emissive area EA and a transmissive area TA.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">The emissive area EA is an area where display light is emitted, and the transmissive area TA is an area where a portion of light representing the view behind of transparent display apparatus <b>200</b> is transmitted. Since the transmissive area TA is adjacent to the emissive area EA, when light incident on the transmissive area TA is excessively bright, the intensity of light in the adjacent emissive area EA appears relatively weak.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">Accordingly, when the transparent organic light-emitting display device is not driven, the user is capable of seeing a background through the transmissive area TA, namely, an object of a rear side of the transparent display apparatus <b>200</b>. Meanwhile, when the transparent display apparatus <b>200</b> is driven, the user is capable of simultaneously seeing an image of the emissive area EA and the background through the transmissive area TA. Although it has been illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> that an area of the transmissive area TA of a pixel region is greater than that of the emissive area EA, an area ratio of the emissive area EA to the transmissive area TA in the pixel region may be variously set in terms of visibility and transmittance.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">The control unit <b>515</b> may be integrated with the processing unit <b>510</b>.

The OS further includes various modes for providing effects of the present invention to the user. The modes are selected by the user when necessary, and, especially, a third mode is actively adapted to the ambient environment to be selected as an optimum mode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">A first mode sets the light control unit to a transmissive state. The first mode maximizes a transparent effect. However, a problem about the visibility of an external environment is not solved.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">The third mode is a mode for extracting an object of the input video and adjusting the transmittance of the area of the light control unit corresponding to the object displayed on the transparent display unit. The transparent display apparatus <b>500</b> in the third mode minimizes a decrease in visibility with a change in an external illuminance environment and the external environment.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">The transmittance control device <b>600</b> means a data processing unit that is included in or connected to the light control unit, analyzes an image displayed on the transparent display unit to extract an object, and determines transmittance of an area corresponding to the extracted object. Transmittance control device <b>600</b> thus adjusts the portion of the light passing through the transparent display unit by adjusting transmittance of the light control unit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">The extracting unit <b>610</b> separates the object from the image by analyzing the input video to identify the object. The extracting unit <b>610</b> separates the object from the image by using various algorithms. The object extracted by the extracting unit <b>610</b> may be an object having saliency in the image. For example, the object extracted by the extracting unit <b>610</b> may be an object or a person which is a central figure in the image. When one object is extracted, for example, when one object exists in the image, it is determined that the image includes the object and the background, and the object and the background may be respectively extracted as one object.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">The extracting unit <b>610</b> separates the object from the image through video classification. The image classification means a process in which a given video is divided into a plurality of areas having similar characteristics or uniformity. In the image classification process, feature elements such as contrast, a color component, a boundary, texture, movement, depth information, a degree of importance, and template matching are used as a criterion of uniformity. Examples of a classification algorithm include a threshold-based algorithm, a cluster-based algorithm, a template matching algorithm, and an edge-based algorithm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">The template matching algorithm classifies or extracts similar objects by measuring a similarity between a template and the image in the entire video. The template is an object having high appearance frequency in the image, such as a person's face, an icon, or a character. The extracting unit <b>610</b> loads the image and the template from the template matching algorithm and creates a correlation coefficient map between parts of the image and the template. The extracting unit <b>610</b> may extract the object corresponding to the template by obtaining a maximum correlation coefficient in the correlation coefficient map. The template matching algorithm has an advantage in extracting a standardized object such as an icon, a program window, a person's face, or a character.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">The extracting unit <b>610</b> can more precisely recognize a contour of the object by applying another extraction algorithm on the basis of the object extracted using the template matching algorithm. Alternatively, the extracting unit may extract the object by using another algorithm and more clearly recognize the contour of the object by using the template matching algorithm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">The object can be separated from the image by using a boundary or an edge. The boundary in the image includes a lot of information on the image and is an element representing features of the image. The boundary in the image may be used to classify and separate the object as well as providing contour information of objects constituting the image.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">The boundary includes high signal variation in terms of video processing. Accordingly, the extracting unit <b>610</b> may measure signal variation in each pixel of the image and determine whether or not the pixel is a boundary pixel on the basis of the measured signal variation. Moreover, the boundary detection may be performed by calculating a slope of the signal variation in the pixel and comparing a value of the slope with a threshold value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">The threshold-based algorithm is an algorithm that sets a plurality of threshold values and divides the image for each of contrast value ranges divided by the threshold values. Here, the threshold value is called a bi-level threshold value when one threshold value is used, and the threshold value is called a multi-level threshold value when several threshold values are used. The bi-level threshold value may be used when an image including two areas such as a foreground and a background that have different brightness levels is divided into the areas. In addition, the extracting unit <b>610</b> of the transparent display apparatus according to the embodiment of the present invention may be configured to extract a text, an icon, and a program active window included in the image. The extracting unit <b>610</b> may perform various filtering on brightness image information of the image to remove the background, and then obtain the boundary to extract the text, the icon, or the program active window. The text, the icon, or the program active window may be generally elements that include important information in the image and that can be selected by an interactive device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">Further, the extracting unit <b>610</b> of the transparent display apparatus according to the embodiment of the present invention may generate a saliency map in order to separate the object from the image and separate the object from the background on the basis of the saliency map.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">The saliency map may be called a feature map, and represents concentration levels of attention generated in a salient area or a non-salient area as a map. A visual system of a viewer extracts only necessary information to efficiently process the extracted information instead of processing all images seen by eyes. The salient area may be a visual selection area of a part of the input video which is the most interest. The salient area may be determined by visual attention characteristics. The determination of the salient area by visual attention characteristics may be performed by selecting only significant features in the image.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">The salient area may be distinguished by salient factors represented by a spatial distribution of information within the image. That is, after various features of input images are extracted, the extracted features are combined to extract a feature indicating a degree of importance of several images among the images, and the salient area may be selected based on the extracted feature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">The method of extracting the salient area and setting the degree of importance thereof may be variously performed, and the extracting unit <b>610</b> of the transparent display apparatus according to the embodiment of the present invention may obtain the salient map by analyzing features of the image such as color and shape and applying an importance filter to analyze the degree of importance corresponding to the features. The extracting unit <b>610</b> may extract the object on the basis of the salient map.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">Further, the object may be extracted by sending positional information on the displayed object to the extracting unit <b>610</b> of the transparent display apparatus. For example, when x and y coordinates of a rectangular program window displayed on the transparent display apparatus are sent to the extracting unit <b>610</b>, the extracting unit <b>610</b> may extract the display object. Alternatively, the extracting unit <b>610</b> may request positional information and contour information of the object to a system that provides the displayed video, and the system may provide information on the object to the extracting unit <b>610</b>. When the system provides the information on the object to the extracting unit <b>610</b>, the system that provides the image may be, for example, a system that provides a structured video.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">The transmittance determining unit <b>620</b> determines the transmittance of the area corresponding to the separated object. As stated above, the transmittance is controlled by the light control unit of the transparent display apparatus by using a light-control-unit data signal. That is, the light-control-unit data signal is generated based on the determined transmittance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">The transmittance determining unit <b>620</b> may be configured to decrease the transmittance of the area corresponding to the object in order to improve the visibility of the extracted object. The transparent display unit may represent red, green, and blue through pixels, and may represent natural colors by combining these three colors. In order for the transparent display unit to represent black, red, green, and blue are not allowed to be emitted, and interference caused by the transmissive area and light incident onto the transmissive area exists in the transparent display unit. Accordingly, when the transmittance is decreased, interference of light incident onto the transmissive area can be reduced, so that it is possible to improve the visibility of the image. The transmittance control device <b>600</b> of the present invention is configured to decrease the transmittance of the area corresponding to the extracted object to secure the visibility of the object.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">When the extracted object moves within the image, since a portion corresponding to the object is also moved, the transmittance determining unit <b>620</b> may determine the transmittance so as to the portion corresponding to the object to be moved in synchronization with time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">Furthermore, when a plurality of objects is displayed, the transmittance determining unit <b>620</b> determines the transmittance so as to allow the plurality of objects to have different transmittance values. When one object is displayed, it is determined that the image includes the object and the background, and the object and the background are respectively extracted as one object. The object and the background have different transmittance values, and the transmittance of the area corresponding to the object may be lower than the transmittance of the area corresponding to the background.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">Moreover, when a plurality of objects is overlapped, the transmittance determining unit <b>620</b> determines the transmittance so as to allow the plurality of objects to have different transmittance values. For example, by allowing the transmittance of one object to be lower than the transmittance of the other one object, it is possible to relatively improve the visibility of the one object.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">In addition, the transmittance determining unit <b>620</b> determines the transmittance of the area corresponding to the object on the basis of video characteristics of the object. For example, the transmittance determining unit <b>620</b> may determine the transmittance so as to allow the plurality of objects to have different transmittance values depending on luminance values of the plurality of objects. It is possible to further improve the visibility by adjusting the transmittance of the object having a low luminance value rather than adjusting the transmittance of the object having a high luminance value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">In addition, the transmittance determining unit <b>620</b> determines the transmittance of the area corresponding to the object depending on the kind of the object. For example, the transmittance determining unit <b>620</b> may determine the transmittance so as to allow a text and a moving image to have different transmittance values. The transmittance determining unit <b>620</b> may determine the transmittance so as to allow an object having a relatively larger size to have transmittance of an intermediate level and may determine the transmittance so as to allow an object having a relatively smaller size to have transmittance of a low level. The object considered as being important, such as a character extracted by the template matching, may have lower transmittance or the lowest transmittance. The transmittance of the text may be determined to be different depending on a color of the text. For example, the transmittance determining unit <b>620</b> may determine the transmittance so that white text and black text have different transmittance values. In addition, the transmittance of the white text may be decreased in an area wider than an area of the text by extending a boundary of the text.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">The transmittance determining unit <b>620</b> may determine the transmittance values of the areas corresponding to the objects and generate a light-control-unit control signal including the determined transmittance. The transmittance control device <b>600</b> may include a sending unit that sends the light-control-unit control signal to the transparent display apparatus or the light control unit of the transparent display apparatus so as to control the determined transmittance values of the plurality of areas. The transmittance control device <b>600</b> may be included in the processing unit <b>510</b>.</div>

Further, all steps may be independently performed, but may be described as one process in the following description for the sake of convenience in description.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0150">An ideal transparent display apparatus is an apparatus in which an image input to a panel is clearly seen and an ambient environment transparently seen through a rear side due to transparency of the transparent display apparatus is also clearly seen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0152" num="0151">Pixels of the transparent display apparatus include a transmissive part and an emissive part. When the amount of light of one part of the transmissive part and the emissive part is relatively larger than that of the other, the visibility of the image of the adjacent transmissive part or emissive part or the visibility of the ambient environment may be degraded.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0153" num="0152">Accordingly, in order to maintain optimum visibility of the input video of the transparent display apparatus, it is required that the amount of light transmitted through the transmissive part is set to be relatively lower than the amount of light of the adjacent emissive part.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0154" num="0153">In contrast, in order to maintain optimum visibility of the ambient environment that is transparently seen, it is required that the amount of light emitted from the emissive part is set to be relatively lower than the amount of light transmitted through the adjacent transmissive part.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0155" num="0154">That is, brightness of the transmissive part and brightness of the emissive part have a conflict relation in terms of visibility. Due to such characteristics, it is difficult for the transparent display apparatus to simultaneously satisfy the visibility of the transmissive part and the visibility of the emissive part.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0156" num="0155">Hereinafter, there will be described an embodiment in which the visibility of the image and the visibility of the ambient environment that is transparently seen are simultaneously maintained by dividing the input video into an area including information and an area not including information and controlling the areas to have different transmittance values by the light control unit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0157" num="0156">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the processing unit divides the input video into the area including information and the area not including information and recognizes the area including information as an object (S<b>200</b>). The image includes information and non-information. The information and the non-information meant in the embodiment are determined depending on the presence or absence of information to be sent to the user. For example, when working on a document is performed through the display unit, an image, a character, an image, a certain shape, and a figure in the document include information, but it may be determined that a white background in the document clearly shows the character and does not include important information. The background may have design elements such as brightness of various colors and various textures, but it may be determined in the embodiment that the background does not include important information. That is, the important information is elements that are likely to cause a problem in sending information when information does not exist, such as writing including a specific content, an icon such as a button for performing a specific function, and an image having specific information.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0158" num="0157">For example, in a document in which a black character is written on a white background, it is determined that the black character includes information and the white background does not include any special information. In contrast, in a document in which a white character is written on a black background, it is determined that the white character includes information and the black background does not include any special information. The processing unit recognizes the area divided as the area including information as the object. For example, in the document in which the black character is written on the white background, an area of the black character is recognized as an object. Furthermore, the area including information, which is recognized as the object, may include a character, an icon, an image, a video, a program active window of the input video.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0158">Subsequently, the processing unit controls the transmittance of the area corresponding to the object (S<b>210</b>). The processing unit sets transmittance values of a non-information area serving as the area not including information and an information area serving as the area including information, or the recognized object to be different from each other. The processing unit sets the transmittance of the information area to be decreased. The processing unit sets the transmittance of the non-information area not including a character to be increased. By increasing the transmittance of the non-information area, it is possible to secure the visibility of the ambient environment in the non-information area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0159">Meanwhile, when the document in which the black character is written on the white background is displayed on the transparent display unit of the embodiment, most pixels of the area not including a character emits white light to display the white background, and the visibility of the ambient environment that is seen through the adjacent transmissive part is decreased by the white light. In order to maintain the visibility of the ambient environment by the white light, the processing unit can additionally correct the image.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0160">The processing unit corrects the image so as to decrease the luminance of the transparent display unit in the non-information area (S<b>220</b>). For example, by distinguishing a background area that emits the white light and modulating data of the corresponding area, it is possible to decrease or completely suppress the emission of the white light. When the luminance of the transparent display unit is lowered in the non-information area, since the non-information area becomes dark, the ambient environment can be clearly seen and power consumption can be reduced. Accordingly, it is possible to maximize transparency and openness of the transparent display apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0161">That is, the non-information area is an area that can extend a transparent area by performing image processing on the image and allowing the transmissive part to be more clearly seen since important information is not included.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0162">The transparent display unit displays the object, and the light control unit disposed on one surface of the transparent display unit controls the transmittance of the area corresponding to the object (S<b>230</b>). Since light incident from the rear side is shielded by the area corresponding to the object, which includes information, the user can easily recognize light of the object emitted from the emissive area, and interference by external light is decreased to be able to improve the visibility of the object. In addition, in the method for controlling a transparent display apparatus according to the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, it is possible to maintain the visibility of the image and the visibility of the background that is transparently seen through the transmissive part by dividing the image into the non-information area and the information is a conceptual diagram showing an information area in the method for controlling a transparent display apparatus area.</div>

Otherwise, only the character area <b>1422</b> may be recognized as the information area <b>1420</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0165">The non-information area <b>1430</b> is illustrated as a background area of the image.
