<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">In Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2010-103326 (JP-2010-103326 A) (hereinafter referred to as Patent Document 1), there is disclosed an IGBT that has a top body region, a floating region, and a bottom body region. In manufacturing this IGBT, after a trench gate electrode is formed, p-type impurities are implanted in such a manner as to stop within a depth range of the top body region, n-type impurities are implanted in such a manner as to stop within a depth range of the floating region, and p-type impurities are implanted in such a manner as to stop within a depth range of the bottom body region. Thus, the top body region, the floating region, and the bottom body region are formed.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0004">Problem to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">In a manufacturing method of Patent Document 1, the respective impurities are implanted after the trench gate electrode is formed. If the impurities are thus implanted into the respective regions after the trench gate electrode is formed, it becomes difficult to accurately control the implantation depth of impurities into a region in the vicinity of the trench gate electrode, due to the influence of the shape of a recess portion that exists in an upper portion of the trench gate electrode. The art of Patent Document 1 explains that the implantation depth of impurities into the region in the vicinity of the trench gate electrode is stabilized by setting the depth of the recess portion to a predetermined value. In this method as well, however, the implantation depth is dispersed to a certain extent. The ON-state voltage and the gate threshold voltage are dispersed among mass-produced IGBT's, due to this dispersion of the implantation depth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to prevent the implantation depth of impurities in the vicinity of the trench gate electrode from being dispersed, it is also conceivable to form the trench gate electrode after implanting the impurities. However, in a method in which the impurities are directly implanted into the respective regions as in Patent Document 1, the respective impurities need to be implanted to a deep position through high energy, so that a semiconductor substrate is seriously damaged. If the trench gate electrode is formed on the semiconductor substrate thus damaged, an oxidation-induced defect (hereinafter referred to as an OSF) is caused in the semiconductor substrate, in a heat treatment for forming a gate insulating film. Since a leak current is produced in the semiconductor substrate with the OSF formed therein, it is difficult to adopt this method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, the present specification provides an art that can restrain an ON-state voltage and a gate threshold voltage from being dispersed among mass-produced IGBT's.</div>
<heading id="h-0005">Means for Solving the Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">An IGBT that is provided by the present specification is equipped with a semiconductor substrate. The IGBT has an emitter region, a top body region, a floating region, a bottom body region, a trench, a gate insulating film, and a gate electrode. The emitter region is an n-type region that is formed in such a range as to be exposed to an upper face of the semiconductor substrate. The top body region is a p-type region that is formed below the emitter region. The floating region is an n-type region that is formed below the top body region and separated from the emitter region by the top body region. The bottom body region is a p-type region that is formed below the floating region and separated from the top body region by the floating region. The trench is formed in the upper face of the semiconductor substrate, and penetrates the emitter region, the top body region, the floating region, and the bottom body region. The gate insulating film covers an inner face of the trench. The gate electrode is arranged inside the trench. When a distribution of a concentration of p-type impurities in the top body region and the floating region, which are located below the emitter region, is viewed along a thickness direction of the semiconductor substrate, the concentration of p-type impurities decreases as a downward distance increases from an upper end of the top body region that is located below the emitter region, and assumes a local minimum value at a predetermined depth in the floating region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Incidentally, the top body region may be formed not only below the emitter region but also beside the emitter region. Besides, the aforementioned “such a range as to be exposed to the upper face of the semiconductor substrate” means a range that emerges on the upper face of the semiconductor substrate in the case where the electrode and the insulating film, which are formed on the semiconductor substrate, are removed. Accordingly, even a region whose surface is covered with the electrode and the insulating film may fall under “such a range as to be exposed to the upper face of the semiconductor substrate”. Besides, in describing the distribution of the concentration of impurities in the semiconductor substrate in the present specification, a waveform with an amplitude that is smaller than 30% of the concentration of the impurities is a noise resulting from a measurement error, and is not treated as a local maximum value or a local minimum value. For example, in the case where a distribution of the concentration of p-type impurities in the top body region and the floating region as shown in a graph A of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref> is obtained, a plus peak value A<b>1</b> and a minus peak value A<b>2</b> are not treated as a local maximum value and a local minimum value respectively. This is because an amplitude Aw (=(A<b>1</b>−A<b>2</b>)/<b>2</b>) of a waveform including the values A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b> is smaller than 30% of an average A<b>3</b> of the value A<b>1</b> and the value A<b>2</b>. If such a small waveform is ignored, the graph A can be regarded as a graph B. Besides, a plus peak value B<b>1</b> of the graph B is treated as a local maximum value, and a minus peak value B<b>2</b> of the graph B is treated as a local minimum value. This is because an amplitude Bw (=(B<b>1</b>−B<b>2</b>)/<b>2</b>) of a waveform including the values B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> is larger than 30% of an average B<b>3</b> of the value B<b>1</b> and the value B<b>2</b>. Accordingly, the graph A shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref> has a configuration in which “the concentration of p-type impurities decreases as the downward distance increases from the upper end of the top body region that is located below the emitter region, and assumes the local minimum value at the predetermined depth in the floating region”. Incidentally, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref> is exemplified for the sake of illustration, and does not limit the claims. For example, the plus peak value B<b>1</b> may not exist in the bottom body region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">In this manner, the top body region in which the concentration of p-type impurities is distributed in such a manner as to decrease as the downward distance increases can be formed by implanting p-type impurities into the vicinity of the upper face of the semiconductor substrate (within a depth range of the emitter region) and diffusing the implanted p-type impurities. In this method, the top body region is formed by diffusing the p-type impurities implanted at a shallow position. Therefore, even if the top body region is formed after a trench gate electrode (a set of the gate insulating film and the gate electrode arranged in the trench) is formed, the distribution of the concentration of p-type impurities in the top body region is hardly influenced by the shape of the trench gate electrode. Besides, in this method, the trench gate electrode can also be formed after the top body region is formed. In this case as well, almost no OSF is produced in and around the top body region. This is because p-type impurities are implanted into the vicinity of the upper face of the semiconductor substrate, and hence there is no peak of the p-type impurities in the top body region, and the top body region is hardly damaged. In this manner, this top body region can be stably formed both before the trench gate electrode is formed and after the trench gate electrode is formed. The distribution of the concentration of p-type impurities in the top body region has a great influence on the gate threshold voltage of the IGBT. Accordingly, in the case where these IGBT's are mass-produced, the gate threshold voltage is unlikely to be dispersed among the mass-produced IGBT's. Besides, the floating region having a local minimum value of the concentration of p-type impurities can be realized by implanting p-type impurities into a region that is located below the floating region (e.g., the bottom body region). By thus providing the floating region with a local minimum value of the concentration of p-type impurities, the difference between the concentration of n-type impurities and the concentration of p-type impurities increases, and hence the floating region can be stably formed. The concentration of impurities in the floating region influences the ON-state voltage of the IGBT. Accordingly, in the case where these IGBT's are mass-produced, the ON-state voltage is unlikely to be dispersed among the mass-produced IGBT's. Besides, p-type impurities are implanted into the region that is located below the aforementioned floating region with high energy. Therefore, this implantation needs to be carried out after the trench gate electrode is formed. If p-type impurities are implanted to a deep position after the trench gate electrode is formed, the implantation depth of impurities is unstable in the vicinity of the trench gate electrode, as described above. Accordingly, it is difficult to control the concentration of impurities in the region that is located below the floating region (e.g., the bottom body region).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">However, the inventors have discovered that the distribution of the concentration of impurities in the vicinity of the trench gate electrode that is located below the floating region does not have a great influence on the characteristics of the IGBT's (the ON-state voltage, the gate threshold voltage and the like). Accordingly, the characteristics of the IGBT's are hardly dispersed as a result of the dispersion of the distribution of the concentration of impurities in the region that is located below the floating region. Accordingly, when these IGBT's are mass-produced, the ON-state voltage and the gate threshold voltage are unlikely to be dispersed among the IGBT's.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">In the aforementioned IGBT, it is preferable that when a distribution of a concentration of n-type impurities in the floating region is viewed along the thickness direction of the semiconductor substrate, a local maximum value of the concentration of the n-type impurities do not exist in the floating region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">This floating region can be formed by implanting n-type impurities into the vicinity of the upper face of the semiconductor substrate (within the depth range of the emitter region) and diffusing the implanted n-type impurities. Alternatively, such a floating region can also be formed through epitaxial growth. These methods make it possible to control the concentration of n-type impurities in the floating region without being influenced by the shape of the trench gate electrode. Accordingly, when these IGBT's are mass-produced, the ON-state voltage is more unlikely to be dispersed among the IGBT's.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">In the aforementioned IGBT, it is preferable that the floating region be formed by an epitaxial layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">This configuration makes it possible to hold the concentration of n-type impurities in the floating region substantially constant. Accordingly, the concentration of n-type impurities in the floating region can be more accurately controlled. Accordingly, when these IGBT's are mass-produced, the ON-state voltage is more unlikely to be dispersed among the IGBT's.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">In the aforementioned IGBT, it is preferable that when a distribution of a concentration of p-type impurities in the bottom body region is viewed along the thickness direction of the semiconductor substrate, a local maximum value of the concentration of the p-type impurities exist in the bottom body region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">In the case where the local maximum value of the concentration of p-type impurities thus exists in the bottom body region, when the IGBT's are mass-produced, the position of the lower end of the floating region is unlikely to be dispersed among the IGBT's. Accordingly, when these IGBT's are mass-produced, the ON-state voltage is more unlikely to be dispersed among the IGBT's.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">In the aforementioned IGBT, it is preferable that a width of the floating region along the thickness direction of the semiconductor substrate be wider at a position in contact with the gate insulating film than at a position away from the gate insulating film</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">In this manner, if the width of the floating region is wide in the vicinity of the gate insulating film where holes are likely to flow, a larger number of holes can be accumulated in the region that is located below the floating region (e.g., a drift region) when the IGBT is on. Accordingly, this configuration makes it possible to reduce the ON-state voltage of the IGBT.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">In the aforementioned IGBT, it is preferable that a lower end of the bottom body region be located lower at a position in contact with the gate insulating film than at a position away from the gate insulating film</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">This configuration makes it possible to reduce the feedback capacity of the IGBT.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">Besides, the present specification provides a new method of manufacturing an IGBT. This manufacturing method has a process of forming an n-type emitter region in such a range as to be exposed to an upper face of a semiconductor substrate, a process of forming a p-type top body region below a depth range of the emitter region by implanting p-type impurities into the upper face of the semiconductor substrate such that the p-type impurities stop within the depth range of the emitter region, and diffusing the implanted p-type impurities, a process of forming an n-type floating region below a depth range of the top body region by implanting n-type impurities into the upper face of the semiconductor substrate such that the n-type impurities stop within the depth range of the emitter region, and diffusing the implanted n-type impurities, a process of forming a trench in the upper face of the semiconductor substrate, and forming a gate insulating film that covers an inner face of the trench, and a gate electrode that is arranged in the trench, and a process of forming a p-type bottom body region below a depth range of the floating region by implanting p-type impurities into the upper face of the semiconductor substrate such that the p-type impurities stop at a depth below the depth range of the floating region, after forming the trench, the gate insulating film, and the gate electrode. The trench is arranged in such a manner as to penetrate the emitter region, the top body region, the floating region, and the bottom body region after the respective processes are carried out.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">Incidentally, the process of forming the emitter region, the process of forming the top body region, the process of forming the floating region, and the process of forming the trench, the gate insulating film, and the gate electrode may be carried out in any sequence. Accordingly, the aforementioned “depth range of the emitter region” may be the depth range of the emitter region that has already been formed or the depth range of the emitter region that is to be formed. By the same token, each of “the depth range of the top body region” and “the depth range of the floating region” may be the depth range of the region that has already been formed or the depth range of the region that is to be formed. Besides, in the present specification, the implantation of impurities in such a manner that the impurities stop in the predetermined depth range means that the average stop position of the implanted impurities is in the predetermined depth range.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">This method makes it possible to stably form the top body region and the floating region through diffusion of the impurities. Besides, the bottom body region is formed by implanting p-type impurities to the deep position after the trench gate electrode is formed. Therefore, the bottom body region can be formed without substantially raising the p-type impurities in the floating region. Accordingly, if the IGBT's are mass-produced according to this manufacturing method, the ON-state voltage and the gate threshold voltage are restrained from being dispersed among the mass-produced IGBT's.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">In the aforementioned manufacturing method, it is preferable that the process of forming the top body region and the process of forming the floating region be carried out prior to the process of forming the trench, the gate insulating film, and the gate electrode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">According to this manufacturing method, the width of the floating region in the vicinity of the gate insulating film is widened when the gate insulating film is formed. Accordingly, this manufacturing method makes it possible to manufacture an IGBT with a lower ON-state voltage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">In the aforementioned manufacturing method, it is preferable that the p-type impurities be implanted into the semiconductor substrate with an upper face of the gate electrode present below the upper face of the semiconductor substrate, in the process of forming the bottom body region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">This manufacturing method makes it possible to form the bottom body region such that the lower end thereof is located lower at the position in contact with the gate insulating film than at the position away from the gate insulating film. Accordingly, the feedback capacity of the IGBT can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">Besides, the present specification provides another manufacturing method. This method of manufacturing an IGBT has a process of causing an epitaxial layer of an n-type semiconductor to grow on an upper face of a base substrate, a process of forming an n-type emitter region in such a range as to be exposed to an upper face of the epitaxial layer, a process of forming a p-type top body region below a depth range of the emitter region by implanting p-type impurities into the upper face of the epitaxial layer such that the p-type impurities stop within the depth range of the emitter region, and diffusing the implanted p-type impurities, a process of forming a trench in the upper face of the epitaxial layer, and forming a gate insulating film that covers an inner face of the trench, and a gate electrode that is arranged in the trench, and a process of forming a p-type bottom body region in the base substrate by implanting p-type impurities into the upper face of the epitaxial layer such that the p-type impurities stop in the base substrate, after forming the trench, the gate insulating film, and the gate electrode. The n-type epitaxial layer remains between the top body region and the bottom body region to constitute the floating region, and the trench is arranged in such a manner as to penetrate the emitter region, the top body region, the floating region, and the bottom body region, after the aforementioned respective processes are carried out.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">This manufacturing method makes it possible to stably form the top body region and the floating region through epitaxial growth and diffusion of impurities. Accordingly, if the IGBT's are mass-produced according to this manufacturing method, the ON-state voltage and the gate threshold voltage are restrained from being dispersed among the IGBT's. Besides, in this manufacturing method, the floating region is constituted by the n-type epitaxial layer. Accordingly, the concentration of n-type impurities in the floating region can be held substantially constant. Accordingly, in the case where these IGBT's are mass-produced, the ON-state voltage is more unlikely to be dispersed among the IGBT's.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">In the aforementioned manufacturing method for causing the epitaxial layer to grow, it is preferable that the process of forming the top body region be carried out prior to the process of forming the trench, the gate insulating film, and the gate electrode.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">Next, a method of manufacturing the IGBT <b>10</b> will be described. The IGBT <b>10</b> is manufactured according to a flowchart shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The IGBT <b>10</b> is manufactured from a semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is an n-type silicon substrate having a concentration N<sub>L </sub>of n-type impurities that is approximately equal to that of the drift region <b>28</b> (about 1×10<sup>14 </sup>cm<sup>3 </sup>in this embodiment of the invention). The thickness of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is about 700 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">In step S<b>2</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the floating regions <b>24</b> are formed in the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. Specifically, first of all, n-type impurities (phosphorus in this embodiment of the invention) are ion-implanted into an upper face of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. In this case, the acceleration energy of ions is set to 30 keV to 300 keV, and the dose amount is set to 1×10<sup>11 </sup>to 1×10<sup>14 </sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>. The implantation of n-type impurities is carried out such that the implanted n-type impurities stop in a region in the vicinity of the upper face of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> (in a depth range in which the emitter regions <b>20</b> are to be formed later). More specifically, the implantation of n-type impurities is carried out such that the average stop position of the implanted n-type impurities is located in the region in the vicinity of the upper face of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> (in the depth range in which the emitter regions <b>20</b> are to be formed later). Subsequently, the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is subjected to a heat treatment. In this case, the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is held under the atmosphere of nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) or oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) at a temperature of 900 to 1250° C., for 30 to 120 minutes. Incidentally, the atmosphere for the heat treatment may be a mixed atmosphere of nitrogen and oxygen, or an atmosphere that is obtained by adding hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) to oxygen, nitrogen or a mixture of these. By performing the heat treatment, the n-type impurities implanted into the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> are diffused and activated. Thus, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the floating regions <b>24</b> are formed in the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in the floating regions <b>24</b>, the concentration of n-type impurities is highest at a position of the upper face of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>, and the concentration of impurities decreases as the downward distance increases from the position. The concentration of n-type impurities is thus distributed because n-type impurities are implanted in such a manner as to stop in the vicinity of the upper face of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> and the n-type impurities are diffused.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">In step S<b>4</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the top body regions <b>22</b> are formed in the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>.

In this case, the acceleration energy of ions is set to 30 keV to 150 keV, and the dose amount is set to 1×10<sup>11 </sup>to 5×10<sup>14 </sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>. The implantation of p-type impurities is carried out such that the implanted p-type impurities stop in the region in the vicinity of the upper face of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> (in the depth range in which the emitter regions <b>20</b> are to be formed later). More specifically, the implantation of p-type impurities is carried out such that the average stop position of the implanted p-type impurities is located in the region in the vicinity of the upper face of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> (in the depth range in which the emitter regions <b>20</b> are to be formed later).

By performing the heat treatment, the p-type impurities implanted into the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> are diffused and activated. Thus, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the top body regions <b>22</b> are formed inside the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the concentration of p-type impurities in the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is highest at a position of the upper face of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>, and decreases as the downward distance increases from the position.

The resist is formed in such a manner as to cover a range where the emitter regions <b>20</b> are not formed (a range where the top body regions <b>22</b> are exposed to the upper face of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). Subsequently, n-type impurities (arsenic in this embodiment of the invention) are ion-implanted into the upper face of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. In this case, the acceleration energy of ions is set to 30 keV to 150 keV, and the dose amount is set to 1×10<sup>13 </sup>to 1×10<sup>16</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>. Thus, n-type impurities are implanted into the upper face of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> in a range that is not covered with the resist. Besides, the implantation of n-type impurities is carried out such that the implanted n-type impurities stop in the region in the vicinity of the upper face of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. Subsequently, the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is subjected to a heat treatment. In this case, the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is held under the atmosphere of nitrogen, oxygen, the mixture of nitrogen and oxygen, or a gas that is obtained by adding hydrogen thereto at a temperature of 900 to 1250° C., for 20 to 120 minutes. By performing the heat treatment, the n-type impurities implanted into the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> are diffused and activated. Thus, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the emitter regions <b>20</b> are formed. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the concentration of n-type impurities in the emitter regions <b>20</b> is highest at the position of the upper face of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>, and decreases as the downward distance increases from the position.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">In step S<b>8</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the trenches <b>40</b> are formed in the upper face of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. Specifically, first of all, an etching mask is formed on the upper face of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. Opening portions are formed in the etching mask in regions where the trenches <b>40</b> should be formed, respectively. Subsequently, the upper face of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> in the opening portions is etched through anisotropic etching such as RIE or the like. Thus, the trenches <b>40</b> are formed in the upper face of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. The trenches <b>40</b> are formed in such a manner as to reach a depth equivalent to the drift region <b>28</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">In step S<b>10</b>, the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is subjected to a heat treatment at 800 to 1150° C. in an oxidation atmosphere.

At this time, oxidation films are formed on inner faces of the trenches <b>40</b> as well, respectively. The oxidation films that are formed on the inner faces of the trenches <b>40</b> respectively are the gate insulating films <b>42</b>. During the growth of the oxidation films (the gate insulating films <b>42</b>) on the inner faces of the trenches <b>40</b>, the growing oxidation films absorb p-type impurities from ambient regions, and discharge n-type impurities to the ambient regions from within themselves. This phenomenon is generally referred to as segregation. Due to this segregation, if the gate insulating films <b>42</b> are formed, the width of the floating regions <b>24</b> in the vicinity of the gate insulating films <b>42</b> (the width along the thickness direction of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>) is enlarged as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. As a result, the wide portions <b>24</b> <i>a </i>of the floating regions <b>24</b> are formed in such ranges as to be in contact with the gate insulating films <b>42</b>, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">In step S<b>12</b>, polysilicon is caused to grow on the surface of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>.

As a result, the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> assumes a state shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the gate electrodes <b>44</b> are formed by the polysilicon remaining inside the trenches <b>40</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">In step S<b>14</b>, with a view to forming the bottom body regions <b>26</b>, p-type impurities are implanted into the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">In step S<b>16</b>, the bottom body regions <b>26</b> are formed. Specifically, the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is subjected to a heat treatment through reflow. In this heat treatment, the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is held in the atmosphere of nitrogen (i.e., in a non-oxidative atmosphere) at a temperature of 900 to 1000° C., for 15 to 60 minutes. By performing the heat treatment, the p-type impurities implanted into the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> are diffused and activated. Thus, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the bottom body regions <b>26</b> are formed in the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. Incidentally, since this heat treatment is performed in the non-oxidative atmosphere, an OSF is prevented from being produced in the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. Besides, the n-type region below the bottom body regions <b>26</b> is the drift region <b>28</b>. If step S<b>14</b> is executed, the distribution of the concentrations of impurities in the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> along a line F-F of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> becomes the distribution shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The local maximum value P<sub>LH </sub>of the concentration of p-type impurities is formed in the bottom body regions <b>26</b> because the ion implantation of step S<b>14</b> is carried out such that the p-type impurities stop in the ranges where the bottom body regions <b>26</b> should be formed. Besides, since the concentration of p-type impurities in the bottom body regions <b>26</b> thus becomes high, the local minimum value P<sub>LL </sub>of the concentration of p-type impurities is formed in the floating regions <b>24</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">Incidentally, as described above, during implantation of p-type impurities in step S<b>14</b>, the bumps H<b>1</b> are formed between the upper faces of the gate electrodes <b>44</b> and the upper face of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> respectively. Thus, due to the influence of the shape of the bumps H<b>1</b>, the average stop position of the p-type impurities is located lower in the regions in the vicinity of the trench gate electrodes <b>48</b> than in the regions away from the trench gate electrodes <b>48</b>, respectively. Thus, the displacement portions <b>26</b> <i>a </i>are formed in the bottom body regions <b>26</b> in such ranges as to be in contact with the gate insulating films <b>42</b>, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">In step S<b>17</b>, the insulating films that cover the emitter regions <b>20</b> and the top body regions <b>22</b> respectively are removed.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">In step S<b>18</b>, the lower face of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is worked. Specifically, first of all, the lower face of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> is polished to thin the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. Subsequently, the buffer region <b>30</b> and the collector region <b>32</b> are formed inside the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> by subjecting the lower face of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> to ion implantation and a heat treatment. After that, the collector electrode <b>62</b> is formed on the lower face of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. If step S<b>18</b> is executed, the IGBT <b>10</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is completed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">Next, the operation of the IGBT <b>10</b> will be described. If a voltage equal to or higher than a gate threshold voltage (a minimum required gate voltage for turning the IGBT <b>10</b> on) is applied to the gate electrodes <b>44</b> with a voltage applied between the emitter electrode <b>60</b> and the collector electrode <b>62</b> such that the voltage of the collector electrode <b>62</b> assumes a positive value, the IGBT <b>10</b> is turned on. That is, channels are formed through the top body regions <b>22</b> and the bottom body regions <b>26</b> in such ranges as to be in contact with the gate insulating films <b>42</b> respectively, and electrons flow from the emitter regions <b>20</b> to the collector region <b>32</b> through the channels respectively. At the same time, holes flow from the collector region <b>32</b> into the drift region <b>28</b>. Due to the holes flowing into the drift region <b>28</b>, a phenomenon of conductivity modulation occurs in the drift region <b>28</b>, and the electric resistance of the drift region <b>28</b> falls. Accordingly, the electrons flow in the drift region <b>28</b> with low loss. Besides, the holes that have flowed into the drift region <b>28</b> flow from the drift region <b>28</b> toward the top body regions <b>22</b>. However, the floating regions <b>24</b> exist between the drift region <b>28</b> and the top body regions <b>22</b> respectively, and these floating regions <b>24</b> serve as barriers, thus restraining the holes from moving toward the top body regions <b>22</b> respectively. Thus, the concentration of holes in the drift region <b>28</b> becomes high, and the electric resistance of the drift region <b>28</b> is further reduced. Thus, the ON-state voltage of the IGBT <b>10</b> is reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">Besides, in the aforementioned manufacturing method, the top body regions <b>22</b> are formed by diffusing the p-type impurities implanted into the vicinity of the upper face of the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b>. As a result, in the top body regions <b>22</b>, the concentration of p-type impurities decreases as the downward distance increases or as the upward distance decreases. According to this method, the top body regions <b>22</b> can be formed without forming a defect such as an OSF or the like in the semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> or without being influenced by the shape of the trench gate electrodes <b>48</b>. That is, the positions of the top body regions <b>22</b> and the concentration of p-type impurities in the top body regions <b>22</b> can be accurately controlled. Thus, if the IGBT's <b>10</b> according to the first embodiment of the invention are mass-produced, the gate threshold voltage is unlikely to be dispersed among the mass-produced IGBT's <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">Besides, in the aforementioned manufacturing method, the bottom body regions <b>26</b> are formed by directly implanting p-type impurities to the depth of the bottom body regions <b>26</b> after forming the trench gate electrodes <b>48</b>. Thus, the bottom body regions <b>26</b> can be formed with the concentration of p-type impurities in the floating regions <b>24</b> hardly raised. As a result, the local minimum values P<sub>LL </sub>of the concentration of p-type impurities is formed in the floating regions <b>24</b>. For this reason, the difference between the concentration of n-type impurities and the concentration of p-type impurities is relatively large in the floating regions <b>24</b>. Thus, the floating regions <b>24</b> are likely to be stably formed. Thus, if the IGBT's <b>10</b> according to the first embodiment of the invention are mass-produced, the ON-state voltage is unlikely to be dispersed among the mass-produced IGBT's <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">Besides, if p-type impurities are implanted to the depth of the bottom body regions <b>26</b> after thus forming the trench gate electrodes <b>48</b>, the implantation depth of p-type impurities in the vicinity of the trench gate electrodes <b>48</b> changes in accordance with the shape of the bumps H<b>1</b> in upper portions of the trench gate electrodes <b>48</b>. Thus, the implantation depth of p-type impurities in the vicinity of the trench gate electrodes <b>48</b> cannot be controlled very accurately. However, the concentration of p-type impurities in the bottom body regions <b>26</b> in the vicinity of the trench gate electrodes <b>48</b> has a small influence on the ON-state voltage and gate threshold voltage of the IGBT <b>10</b>. Accordingly, the ON-state voltage and the gate threshold voltage are hardly dispersed due to this influence.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">Besides, if the bottom body regions <b>26</b> are thus formed, the displacement portions <b>26</b> <i>a </i>can be formed in the bottom body regions <b>26</b> respectively. Thus, the following advantages are obtained. In the IGBT <b>10</b>, a protrusion amount L<b>1</b> of the trench gate electrodes <b>48</b> that protrude below the bottom body regions <b>26</b> respectively is relatively large. Thus, the holes that are present in the drift region <b>28</b> in the vicinity of the bottom body regions <b>26</b> are blocked by the protruding trench gate electrodes <b>48</b> respectively, and are restrained from moving laterally in the drift region <b>28</b>. For this reason, a large number of holes are accumulated in the drift region <b>28</b> in the vicinity of the bottom body regions <b>26</b>. Thus, the ON-state voltage of the IGBT <b>10</b> is reduced. On the other hand, in general, if the protrusion amount of the trench gate electrodes is increased, the areas of contact between the gate insulating films and the drift region increase respectively, and the feedback capacity of the IGBT increases. However, in the aforementioned IGBT <b>10</b>, the areas of contact between the gate insulating films <b>42</b> and the drift region <b>28</b> are small respectively, due to the formation of the displacement portions <b>26</b> <i>a</i>. Accordingly, this IGBT <b>10</b> has a small feedback capacity despite the large protrusion amount L<b>1</b>. Accordingly, the switching loss caused in the IGBT <b>10</b> according to the first embodiment of the invention is small.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">Besides, many of the holes that move from the drift region <b>28</b> to the top body regions <b>22</b> move through the floating regions <b>24</b> in the vicinity of the gate insulating films <b>42</b> (i.e., in the vicinity of the channels) respectively. In the aforementioned IGBT <b>10</b>, the wide portions <b>24</b> <i>a </i>of the floating regions <b>24</b> are formed in the vicinity of the gate insulating films <b>42</b> respectively. The wide portions <b>24</b> <i>a </i>restrain the holes from moving from the drift region <b>28</b> to the top body regions <b>22</b> respectively.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">Incidentally, in the aforementioned first embodiment of the invention, the floating regions <b>24</b>, the top body regions <b>22</b>, and the emitter regions <b>20</b> are formed in this sequence, but the sequence in which these regions are formed may be changed in any manner. Besides, in the case where there is no need to form the wide portions <b>24</b> <i>a </i>in the floating regions <b>24</b> respectively, the floating regions <b>24</b>, the top body regions <b>22</b>, and the emitter regions <b>20</b> may be formed after forming the trench gate electrodes <b>48</b>. Incidentally, in the case where the emitter regions <b>20</b> are formed before forming the trench gate electrodes <b>48</b>, it is preferable that arsenic be used as n-type impurities for forming the emitter regions <b>20</b> as described above. This is because arsenic is unlikely to be thermally diffused, and hence can be retained in target regions even upon receiving heat when the trench gate electrodes <b>48</b> are formed. In order to form the emitter regions <b>20</b>, phosphorus can also be used instead of arsenic. In this case, phosphorus is likely to be thermally diffused. It is therefore better to form the emitter regions <b>20</b> after forming the trench gate electrodes <b>48</b>.

In this manner, even if the local maximum value N<sub>LH </sub>of the concentration of n-type impurities is formed within the depth range of the emitter regions <b>20</b>, no problem is caused in particular as long as there is no local maximum value of the concentration of n-type impurities in the top body regions <b>22</b> and the floating regions <b>24</b> that are located below the emitter regions <b>20</b> respectively.
