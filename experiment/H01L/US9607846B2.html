<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to planarization for semiconductor structures or device fabrication.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">This section provides background information and introduces information related to various aspects of the disclosure that are described and/or claimed below. These background statements are not admissions of prior art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Integration of lattice-mismatched semiconductor materials is one path to high performance devices such as complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) field-effect transistors (FET) due to their high carrier mobility. For example, the heterointegration of lattice-mismatched semiconductor materials with silicon will be useful for a wide variety of device applications. One heterointegration method involves creation of confined regions of lattice-mismatched semiconductor materials on a silicon substrate. However, planarization is typically required for device fabrication. Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) of the selected lattice-mismatched semiconductor materials is an option to smooth the surface of the material. Low material removal rates are needed, and creation of dishing or surface impurities must be avoided. Thus, there exists a need to planarize a surface of lattice-mismatched materials in a confined or selectively grown area (e.g., an active region of crystalline materials).</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">Reference will now be made in detail to the embodiments of the present general inventive concept, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout. The embodiments are described below in order to explain the present general inventive concept by referring to the figures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">The formation of lattice-mismatched materials has many practical applications. For example, heteroepitaxial growth of group IV materials or compounds, and III-V, III-N and II-VI compounds on a crystalline substrate, such as silicon, has many applications such as photovoltaics, resonant tunneling diodes (RTD's), transistors (e.g., FET (which can be planar or 3D (e.g., finFET), HEMT, etc.), light-emitting diodes and laser diodes. As one example, heteroepitaxy of germanium on silicon is considered a promising path for high performance p-channel metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) field-effect transistors (FET) and for integrating optoelectronic devices with silicon complementary MOS (CMOS) technology. Heteroepitaxy growth of other materials (e.g., of group III-V, III-N and II-VI compounds and other group IV materials or compounds) also is beneficial for these and other applications.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">However, the dislocation density of the epitaxially grown material can be unacceptably high for many applications. For example, the dislocation density of germanium directly grown on silicon can be as high as 10<sup>8</sup>-10<sup>9 </sup>cm<sup>−2 </sup>due to the 4.2% lattice mismatch between the two materials—unacceptable for most device applications. Various approaches to reducing the defect density have been pursued, including compositional grading, and post-epi high-temperature annealing. However, these approaches may not be optimal for integration with silicon-based CMOS technology due to requirements for thick epi-layers and/or high thermal budgets, or due to incompatibility with selective growth at a density suitable for CMOS integration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">Aspect Ratio Trapping (ART) is a defect reduction technique that mitigates these problems. As used herein, “ART” or “aspect ratio trapping” refers generally to the technique(s) of causing defects to terminate at non-crystalline, e.g., dielectric, sidewalls, where the sidewalls are sufficiently high relative to the size of the growth area so as to trap most, if not all, of the defects. ART utilizes high aspect ratio openings, such as trenches or holes, to trap dislocations, preventing them from reaching the epitaxial film surface, and greatly reduces the surface dislocation density within the ART opening.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1<i>a </i> </figref>shows a cross section of a lattice-mismatched material <b>140</b> of high quality above a defect region <b>155</b> using ART. As illustrated here, a crystalline material <b>140</b> is epitaxially grown on substrate <b>100</b> (here, for example, on the (001) surface of a silicon substrate). By confining the crystalline growth within an opening <b>120</b> (e.g., trench, recess or the like) with a sufficiently high aspect ratio (e.g., 1 or greater, 0.5 or greater), defects <b>150</b> formed while epitaxially growing the crystalline material <b>140</b> travel to and end at the sidewalls (e.g., insulator sidewalls) <b>110</b>. Thus, the crystalline material <b>140</b> continues to grow without the continued growth of the defects <b>150</b>, thereby producing crystal with reduced defects. This technique has been shown to be effective for growing low defectivity materials such as Ge, InP and GaAs selectively on Si in trenches 200-450 nm wide and of arbitrary length—an area large enough for devices such as a FET, for example. Such trenches can be wider or narrower.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">An embodiment of the invention is directed to a device including a planarized lattice-mismatched material in an opening in an insulator. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1<i>b </i> </figref>shows one example, illustrating a perspective view of a portion of an exemplary device. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1<i>b</i> </figref>, the example includes a crystalline material <b>140</b> grown on a substrate <b>100</b> in an opening <b>120</b> defined in an insulator <b>130</b> for a non-Si channel MOSFET. The substrate <b>100</b> may be a crystalline material such as silicon, Ge or sapphire. Insulator <b>130</b> is preferably a non-crystalline material such as a dielectric material including silicon nitride or SiO<sub>2</sub>. The crystalline material <b>140</b> at least at some stage has a surface above the top surface of insulator <b>130</b>. A planarized surface can include at least a surface of portions of the crystalline material <b>140</b> corresponding to source, drain and gate regions of the device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">In one example, the width of the opening <b>120</b> may be 400 nm or less, 350 nm or less, 200 nm or less, 100 nm or less or 50 nm or less; these sizes have been shown to be effective for ART (of course these sizes do not need to be used with ART). Alternatively, the width of the opening may be 5 μm or less. In another alternative, the width of the opening may be 1 μm or less. The opening may be formed as a trench (with the length of the trench running front to back as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1<i>b</i> </figref>) in which case the width would be considered to be perpendicular to its length and height. The length of the trench may be arbitrary. Alternatively, the length of the trench may be substantially larger than the width of the trench, for example greater than 10 times larger, or greater than 100 times larger. In one example, the length of the trench is 2 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">It is preferred, but not necessary, that the opening <b>120</b> is used to trap defects when epitaxially growing the crystalline material <b>140</b> using ART (aspect ratio trapping) techniques. (Aspect ratio “AR” is defined for trenches as the ratio of the trench height/trench width.) In such a case, the aspect ratio may be greater than 1, although it possible for the aspect ratio to be lower in ART devices, for example 0.5. In one embodiment, the crystalline material <b>140</b> can include two different semiconductor materials or more than one semiconductor material (e.g., GaAs/InP/InGaAs) such as or first, second and third materials where the first material can be Ge or GaAs, can be less than 100 nm or can have bonding characteristics to a substrate and the third material is polished. Further details of example ART devices and ART techniques in which this invention may be incorporated may be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/436,198 filed May 17, 2006, Ser. No. 11/493,365 filed Jul. 26, 2006 and Ser. No. 11/852,078 filed Sep. 7, 2007, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">The substrate <b>100</b> in the above examples may include a group IV element or compound, such as germanium and/or silicon, e.g., (001) silicon. The crystalline material <b>140</b> may include at least one of a group IV element or compound, a III-V or III-N compound, or a II-VI compound. Examples of group IV elements include Ge, Si and examples of group IV compounds include SiGe. Examples of III-V compounds include aluminum phosphide (AlP), gallium phosphide (GaP), indium phosphide (InP), aluminum arsenide (AlAs), gallium arsenide (GaAs), indium arsenide (InAs), aluminum antimonide (AlSb), gallium antimonide (GaSb), indium antimonide (InSb), and their ternary and quaternary compounds. Examples of III-N compounds include aluminum nitride (AlN), gallium nitride (GaN), indium nitride (InN), and their ternary and quaternary compounds. Examples of II-VI compounds includes zinc selenide (ZnSe), zinc telluride (ZnTe), cadmium selenide (CdSe), cadmium telluride (CdTe), zinc sulfide (ZnS), and their ternary and quaternary compounds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">The layer of insulator need not be formed as a substantially planar layer. For example, the insulator may be formed of a thin layer that conforms to an undulating surface of the substrate on which it is created. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1<i>c </i> </figref>illustrates an example including a substrate that has openings/recesses/trenches <b>120</b> etched into the substrate <b>100</b>. An insulating layer <b>180</b> has been formed across the substrate <b>100</b> conforming to the surface topography of the etched substrate <b>100</b>. The insulating layer <b>180</b> is configured at the bottom of the openings/trenches to expose portions <b>160</b> of the substrate <b>100</b> for subsequent lattice-mismatched crystalline material. In this case, sidewalls of the insulator <b>190</b> can be formed by deposition on or oxidation of the substrate <b>100</b> and are not formed by a separate photolithography process. Exemplary configurations of the trenches <b>120</b> and portions <b>160</b> are illustrated however, embodiments of the invention are not intended to be so limited, for example, as other linear, tiered or nonlinear cross-sections may be used for the trenches <b>120</b> and the portions <b>160</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">The following description in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-15</figref> describes examples of how surfaces of the lattice-mismatched semiconductor material or crystalline material within a confined space (e.g., crystalline material <b>140</b> within insulator <b>130</b>) may be planarized or provided with a prescribed surface smoothness. Although this description is in connection with specific materials and process parameters, it will be apparent that the description is exemplary only, and should not be considered to limit embodiments of the invention to such materials and process parameters.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">Exemplary CMP embodiments according to the invention for planarizing Ge—SiO<sub>2 </sub>composite structures produced by Ge growth in SiO<sub>2 </sub>trenches on a Si wafer will now be described. Embodiments of CMP processes can produce flat and/or co-planar planarized regions (e.g., Ge regions or Ge/insulator regions) suitable for device fabrication including reduced roughness, low dishing and/or overpolish of such regions and low levels of contamination. A slurry mix can include part abrasive, part chemical additive, and the remaining liquid or de-ionized (DI) water, adding up to 100% of the slurry mix. In one embodiment, the addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>to a diluted colloidal slurry was determined to provide desired results including selectivity, step height, reduced surface roughness and low resulting contaminants in composite structures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">The following materials and process parameters were used for Ge grown as discussed in connection with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-15</figref>. The starting substrates used in this work were crystalline silicon, 200 mm diameter, p-type, and (001) oriented. A 500-nm-thick thermal oxide was grown on the substrate. The oxide layer was patterned into trenches along [110] direction of the silicon substrate having 180-350 nm width and 13 mm length. The trenches were formed using conventional photolithography techniques and a reactive ion etching (RIE) step. The patterned substrates were then cleaned in Pirana, SC2, and dilute HF solutions sequentially. Removal of fluorocarbon residues caused by RIE was accomplished using a 25-nm-thick sacrificial oxidation and subsequent HF oxide etch. The final trench height was 490 nm after this cleaning procedure. Undoped Ge layers were selectively, epitaxially grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on the exposed Si substrate (either in the trenches or on a blanket Si substrate (e.g., a bare Si wafer)) in an industrial ASM Epsilon E2000 system. This CVD system is a horizontal, cold-wall, single wafer, load-locked reactor with a lamp-heated graphite susceptor in a quartz tube. Directly prior to growth, the substrates were cleaned in a diluted HF solution and rinsed in DI (deionized) water. The substrates were loaded into the growth chamber and baked in H<sub>2 </sub>for 1 minute at 870° C. The pressure during the bake was set the same value as used in the subsequent growth step, 80 Torr. The growth step used a 30 sccm germane (GeH<sub>4</sub>) source gas flow diluted to 25% in a 20 slm hydrogen carrier gas flow. The Ge growth was performed in two steps; the first step is at 400° C. for 540 sec and the second step is at 600° C. for a time period of 1200-7000 sec. Selected samples for CMP were uncoalesced, while other samples were grown to coalescence above the oxide trenches.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">Experimental Results</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">For the experimental results described below, CMP was performed on these 200 mm wafers on either a Strasbaugh 6EC or an IPEC 472 CMP tool with a spiral k-groove IC1000-Suba IV stacked pad, a 3M S60 diamond conditioner, and variable concentrations of Nalco 2360 slurry (70 nm colloidal silica). Nalco 2360 slurry is a commercially available colloidal silica polishing slurry having submicron silica particles in an aqueous solution. Either 6% NaOCl, 30% NH4OH, or 30% H2O2 solution was added to the diluted slurry to enhance the Ge removal rate. Thus, each slurry mix consisted of part Nalco 2360, part chemical additive, and the remainder was deionized water (DI) water, adding up to 100% of the slurry mix. Concentration percentages listed beyond this point refer to the fraction of Nalco 2360, NaOCl solution, NH4OH solution, H2O2 solution, or DI water in the slurry mix. Exemplary concentration ranges of the chemicals tested in the slurry mix were 0-2.4% of NaOCl, 0-100% NH4OH, and 0-10% H2O2. Polish conditions for the Strasbaugh 6EC tool follow. Before CMP, the pad break-in is accomplished with 5 lbs applied, 50 rpm conditioner speed, 65 rpm table speed, 200 mL/min of DI water, 25 sweeps of the conditioner arm (back and forth), and 36 seconds/complete sweep. A precondition step was used to spread slurry over the table at the beginning of each run, using parameters 5 lbs applied, 150 mL/min of slurry mix, 20 rpm conditioner speed, 20 rpm table speed, 2-5 center-to-edge sweeps, and 11 seconds/partial sweep. The CMP process included 10 seconds of ramp-up, a polish step, and 25 seconds of ramp-down and rinse steps. Polishing time for the polish step was varied, and in-situ sweep pad conditioning of 5 lbs (22 sec/complete sweep) was used throughout the CMP process. The down-force during the polish step was 3 PSI, slurry feed rate 150 mL/min, table speed 45 rpm, and wafer chuck speed 41 rpm. Automatic hydro-load and polish were used for all samples, and back pressure and ring force were optimized as needed. The table is cooled by building cooling water, and table temperature varied between 60-85° F. during polishing. Wafers polished with the IPEC 472 CMP tool used similar conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">The post-CMP clean, using the Verteq Goldfinger single-wafer megasonic post-CMP tool, consisted of a contamination spin-off, 60 sec process time, 30 sec rinse time, and 30 sec spin dry time. Megasonic power of 125 W was used for all samples. Only DI water (1.7-3 L/min) was used for most Ge and Ge ART samples, while a diluted standard clean 1 (SC-1) solution was used in the megasonic clean for all wafers with an oxide film. The concentration of the SC-1 solution was 50 mL/min NH4OH (30%) and 100 mL/min H2O2 (30%) in 1.7-3 L/min of DI water. Wafers which were polished on the IPEC 472 CMP were cleaned using an OnTrak brush scrubber.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">Evaluation of the material removal rate (RR) was based on CMP of blanket oxide and Ge films on Si. Pre-CMP and post-CMP film thicknesses were measured by interferometry (Filmetrics) or ellipsometry (Sopra). Endpointing of the patterned ART samples was achieved initially by visual and optical microscope inspection, and later by calibrating CMP process time with cross-sectional scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis. However, alternative known endpointing techniques may be used. The patterned sample thicknesses after polishing were measured in an Amray 3300FE or Zeiss Supra 40 field-emission SEM.

Factors analyzed can include at least selectivity, removal rate, and planarized surface characteristics such as smoothness, dishing, overpolish, step height and post-CMP surface metallic contamination levels.

As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the Nalco 2360 concentration alone does not significantly affect the Ge polish rate <b>220</b>, but oxide RR <b>210</b> is directly related to the amount of Nalco 2360 in the slurry mix.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">Exemplary results for oxide RR <b>210</b> using slurry and oxide RR using slurry with additives indicate Nalco 2360 concentration is the major factor controlling the oxide RR in all slurry mixes. While the oxide removal rates for wafers polished with additives appear to have some effect on the oxide RR as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the effect appears to follow the same general trend as a slurry mix without additives, at least for the concentrations tested. Thus, Nalco 2360 concentration is the major factor controlling the oxide RR. Using diluted slurry alone, the preferred selectivity of Ge faster than SiO<sub>2 </sub>was not achievable for any concentrations because of vibration (described below).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">The Nalco 2360 slurry chosen for testing was intended to be selective in polishing Ge rather than SiO<sub>2</sub>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an increasing oxide RR and a relatively constant Ge RR can result in selectivity&gt;1 for Ge:SiO<sub>2 </sub>at low concentrations of slurry (e.g., a slurry mix with approximately &lt;20% slurry). An unexpected result of the Nalco 2360 choice was significant CMP tool vibration when polishing oxide wafers with slurry mixes containing low concentrations of Nalco 2360 in DI water. A slurry mix containing below approximately 35% Nalco 2360 slurry generated debilitating vibration of the CMP tool and experimentally a preferred selectivity of Ge removal faster than SiO<sub>2 </sub>was not achievable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">Although the Nalco 2360 slurry was successfully used experimentally, embodiments of the invention are not intended to be so limited. For example, particle size can range between 20-90 nm, 50-90 nm or 50-70 nm may be used. Such particles may be spherical. Thus, colloidal or fumed slurry may be used. In addition, embodiments of a slurry mix can operate with a pH range between 7-10, however, any pH sufficient for particles to remain in suspension in a slurry mix can be used. Further, although colloidal silica particles were used experimentally, alternative materials for slurry particles (e.g., abrasives) can include ceria (e.g., CeO<sub>2</sub>) or alumina (e.g., Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). Alternative slurry mix can use particles of similar size. Although these do not oxidize semiconductor crystalline materials (e.g., Ge) during CMP as silica does, the functional operation of an abrasive can be sufficient in embodiments of a slurry mix according to the invention. According to one embodiment, semiconductor crystalline materials that exhibit water soluble oxidation can enhance polishing characteristics of a CMP process. Exemplary slurry mix according to one embodiment is preferred to not significantly polish or not to polish the insulator (e.g., dielectric, silicon nitride or SiO<sub>2</sub>) confining the lattice-mismatched semiconductor crystalline materials. Thus, in one embodiment, a slurry mix with diluted Nalco 2360 achieved oxide RR below 70 nm/minute without CMP tool vibration. According to one embodiment, a lubricant can be used to reduce vibration during CMP, however, consideration (e.g., additional cleaning procedures) should be made to reduce contaminants that can be added by exemplary lubricants.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, some metals levels (e.g., Mg) for polishing with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>in the slurry mix are higher than acceptable levels for post-CMP device fabrication, but this additive had the best performance in coplanar CMP.

A cleaning step was devised to follow the megasonic post-CMP clean that included a DI water rinse and hydrofluoric acid (HF) dip. Ge may etch slightly in this cleaning step. After the water rinse and HF dip, metals levels were reduced to acceptable levels for samples polished with the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-containing slurry mix.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">From the exemplary experimental data, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>was the chemical additive to the slurry mix with superior performance in terms of removal rate and selectivity (e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 9</figref>), and contaminant or metals levels post-CMP (e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). A successful CMP planarization using an embodiment of a CMP composition according to the present general inventive concept is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(<i>b</i>)</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11(<i>a</i>) and 11(<i>b</i>)</figref> illustrate respective cross-sectional SEM images of germanium structure before and after CMP with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>additive (here 0.16% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) in the slurry mix.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">According to embodiments of the invention, sufficient planarization results in the ability to implement the planarized lattice-mismatched semiconductor material or composite crystalline/insulator structure, which may be formed using ART techniques, in a semiconductor device. In one embodiment, dishing is preferably less than 50 nm, less than 30 nm, less than 20 nm or less than 10 nm. The surface smoothness can be measured by a surface roughness Rms (root mean square). Rms of the Ge in a Ge/oxide composite structure was calculated only on the Ge area and did not include the oxide. The overall Rms value can reflect variations of Ge surface height from one trench to another, within a trench or along the length of the trenches. In one embodiment, the surface roughness (Rms) is preferably less than 20 nm, less than 10 nm less than 5 nm, less than 3 nm, or less than about 1 nm, and may be less than 0.5 nm or less than 0.2 nm. In one embodiment, overpolishing is a significant concern for reduced device dimensions corresponding to the exemplary disclosed devices. In one embodiment, overpolishing is preferably less than 50 nm, less than 10 nm, less than 5 nm or less than 2 nm. In one embodiment, the step height is less than 30 nm, less than 20 nm, less than 15 nm or less than 10 nm. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(<i>b</i>)</figref>, exemplary results of CMP according to embodiments of the invention satisfy prescribed or required coplanar characteristics of the polished surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">In addition, for CMP of Ge ART, a Ge:SiO<sub>2 </sub>polish selectivity of about 5:1 is preferred. This exemplary selectivity can reduce or prevent significant overpolish or dishing. As described above, embodiments of a slurry mix using H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>were able to provide the prescribed selectivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">Once slurry mix chemistry was determined (e.g., Nalco 2360, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and DI water), process and performance improvement for embodiments of the invention were tested (e.g., on the Ge ART samples). For example, embodiments of the invention were tested to determine the effects of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>concentrations on removal rates for various compositions and process considerations for characteristic CMP results (e.g., a more effective CMP process). Additional factors to consider when evaluating removal rate data for various concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>additive in the slurry mix include pitting and polish time. Dishing can increase when selectivity increases. In addition, removal rates that are too low can unduly increase polish time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">Pitera disclosed pitting occurred during CMP on Si/Ge material combinations when using H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, but avoided the problem by adding an additional oxide layer that was then polished using known CMP techniques. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12(<i>a</i>) and 12(<i>b</i>)</figref> confirm such results for relatively high H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>concentrations. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12(<i>a</i>) and 12(<i>b</i>)</figref> illustrate pitting <b>1210</b> in plan-view SEM for a Ge blanket film sample polished with 10% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>in the slurry mix and trench Ge ART samples polished with 5% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>in the slurry mix, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">At one preferred concentration of 0.16% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>in a slurry mix, pitting of the Ge surface was not detected. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates a 2 μm×2 μm AFM scan of a Ge ART sample polished with 0.16% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>in the slurry mix. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, dishing is 30 nm, and RMS roughness (of Ge areas in a Ge ART sample) measured by AFM is 0.21 nm. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, decreasing concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>was able control or decrease pitting effects in CMP for Ge.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">Dishing can vary with concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>in the slurry mix, ranging from unacceptable levels at high concentrations (e.g., over 5% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>concentration) to ˜20-50 nm for 200-375 nm wide Ge ART trenches at 0.16% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14(<i>a</i>) and 14(<i>b</i>)</figref> respectively illustrate such differences post-CMP using an SEM image of an unacceptably dished sample (5% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and a TEM image of polished Ge ART at 0.16% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">Most of the samples presented here were used a post-CMP megasonic clean (except those polished using NaOCl additive in the slurry mix, because the equipment was not available at that time). Samples that required low metals also used a water rinse and HF dip (primarily used for samples that underwent additional processing post-CMP). The megasonic cleaning used SC-1 chemistry for all oxide wafers, but SC-1 chemistry was detected to etch Ge even at low concentrations (e.g., primarily caused by the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). Since etching occurred even at low concentration, DI water only was then used in the megasonic clean for all the Ge samples (e.g., blanket film and Ge ART). The DI water-only megasonic clean was effective for slurry particle removal on the Ge samples, except where sample topography (for example incomplete planarization) prevented slurry from escaping the surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">Effect of Coalescence on CMP</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">All of the post-CMP Ge ART samples described above used pre-CMP structures that coalesced over the oxide trenches during growth (e.g., see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(<i>a</i>)</figref>). The selective Ge growth caused each of the patterned areas to have a different thickness of coalescence over the trenches, which leads to different elapsed polish times to reach coplanar Ge ART for each patterned area. However, the lattice-mismatched semiconductor materials (e.g., Ge) do not need to coalesce over the oxide trenches if a CMP process can effectively planarize uncoalesced crystalline growth above a top surface of the oxide trench. At the tested concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>(e.g., 0.16% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) in the slurry mix, exemplary polish time for an uncoalesced Ge ART wafer to reach coplanar is typically less than a minute. However, a CMP process does not tend to reach a steady state until after about a minute of polish. Accordingly, control of a short process for the uncoalesced Ge ART could not be guaranteed in tested samples. In this situation, it may help that the SiO<sub>2 </sub>patterning slows the polish rate as the structure begins to clear.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">Initial investigations of the effect of coalescence on Ge ART CMP addressed coalescence effects on the clearing behavior of the structures during CMP, so polish controllability was not evaluated. Analysis of polished samples of “thin coalesced” and uncoalesced samples focused on dishing and overpolish as a function of polish time for four different patterned regions, for example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">Combined data for several samples is presented in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>; thin coalesced samples are on the left side of the graph, uncoalesced on the right. Times listed at the bottom of the chart reflect the polish step; where two times are listed “X+Xsec”, two polishes were done on the sample. The original oxide pattern film thickness on this sample was approximately 490 nm. A 500 nm thickness reference point is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">Exemplary Ge thickness, dishing, and overpolish for four different patterned areas (e.g., patterns A-D) of thin coalesced and uncoalesced Ge ART wafers polished in 0.16% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-containing slurry mix for different times are shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. The colored bars represent the resulting thickness of the Ge in the trenches (e.g., for a given patterned area and for a given wafer/CMP time) measured from the bottom of the oxide patterning to the bottom of any dishing that may have occurred. “Error bars” are used to show the level of the oxide post-CMP. If the error bar ends below the height of the Ge thickness bar, the Ge is under polished and some Ge remains above the patterned oxide. If the error bar ends above the height of the Ge thickness bar, the oxide height is greater than that of the Ge, and therefore the length of the error bar reflects the amount of dishing in the Ge. Finally, if the end of the error bar lies below the 500 nm horizontal line on the graph, the difference between the end of the error bar and the 500 nm line reflects how much overpolish occurred for that patterned area on that sample.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">An enormous amount can be learned from the data presented in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. First, comparing the thin coalesced vs. uncoalesced samples, it is interesting to note that the A section clears before the B section in uncoalesced, but the reverse is true for thin coalesced. Also, the amount of overpolish evident in thin coalesced sections C and D (before section A is completely cleared) is much more significant than that observed for the uncoalesced samples when all four sections are cleared. It seems that in order to more effectively clear all four sections without significant overpolish in any of the sections, polishing uncoalesced samples is better. For thin coalesced samples, after two one-minute polishes, section A is not yet cleared, while the film remaining in section D is rapidly approaching its dislocation trapping region. On the other hand, if the primary sections of interest for a given sample are C and D, the polish time for an uncoalesced sample would be extraordinarily short, and it would be better to polish from a thin coalesced sample. Only one of the samples tested here used an etching clean (e.g., low concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>in the megasonic post-CMP clean), and it is clear that this sample had more significant dishing than the other samples shown. In addition, some difference can be observed between the two thin coalesced samples with similar polishing times (75 seconds in one polish and 60+15 seconds in two polishes). It seems from these two samples that the ramp-up and ramp-down steps in the CMP do polish a small amount.</div>

While exemplary embodiments may be effective for various materials like a group III-V compound or group IV material like silicon, oxidation during a CMP process may vary. Thus, polishing of materials including semiconductor crystalline lattice-mismatched materials where water soluble oxidation results can enhance polishing characteristics or interactions corresponding to a CMP process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">In an embodiment, a post-CMP clean of the planarized surface can be performed. The post-CMP clean can be a megasonic clean using DI water.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">As described above, embodiments of CMP process can planarize lattice-mismatched materials and lattice-mismatched material/insulator composite structures effectively. Further, embodiments can planarize first material adjacent second material combinations for use in semiconductor device applications including incorporation with CMOS techniques, processes and devices. Embodiments of devices according to the application can include planarized composite structures. Embodiments according to the application can include CMP compositions. One embodiment of a CMP process can planarize Ge in oxide trenches on Si substrates generated by Aspect Ratio Trapping techniques. An exemplary slurry mix according to one embodiment included 35% colloidal silica sub-micron particles, 0.1%-0.3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>30% solution, and DI water slurry mix to provide a desired combination of selectivity and post-CMP coplanar surface characteristics, for example using crystalline materials confined by insulators formed using ART techniques, and low surface metal contamination. One slurry mix embodiment and a post-CMP cleaning embodiment were used to polish a variety of coalesced and uncoalesced Ge ART samples to coplanar Ge—SiO<sub>2</sub>. Embodiments of CMP process according to the invention can be used in heterointegration by ART techniques. Embodiments of CMP process can be used to create planarized areas of defect-free Ge on a Si wafer and devices created thereby. Such structures can be used for high mobility, non-Si channel MOSFETs for next generation CMOS and for a wide variety of other applications.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">As noted above, this invention has a wide variety of applications.
