<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0002">Organic light-emitting devices, such as an organic electroluminescent device (organic EL device), have been actively studied for enhancing the light emission efficiency, where light emission efficiency is defined and hereafter used for mean photoluminescence quantum efficiency, electroluminescence quantum efficiency, or both as appropriate thereof. In particular, various studies for enhancing the light emitting efficiency have been made by newly developing and combining an electron transporting material, a hole transporting material, a light-emitting material and the like constituting an organic electroluminescent device. There are studies relating to an organic electroluminescent device utilizing a compound containing a 1,3,5-triazine structure and a compound containing a phenazine structure, which are found among them, and some proposals have been made hitherto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0003">For example, PTL 1 describes a compound containing a 1,3,5-triazine structure represented by the following general formula, which is contained not in between two electrodes but in a layer formed outside the electrodes, and thereby the light efficiency is improved. In the general formula, Ar<sub>2</sub>, Ar<sub>4 </sub>and Ar<sub>6 </sub>each represent a phenylene group or the like, b, d and f each represent an integer of one of from 0 to 3, and R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>4 </sub>and R<sub>6 </sub>each are selected from a wide range of groups including a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, an alkyl group and an aryl group. However, there is no group described for R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>4 </sub>and R<sub>6 </sub>that contains a phenoxazine structure, a phenothiazine structure or a phenazine structure.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">Technical Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">As described above, compounds containing a 1,3,5-triazine structure and a compound containing a phenazine structure has been studied, and some proposals relating to application thereof to an organic electroluminescent device have been made. However, a compound containing in the molecule thereof a 1,3,5-triazine structure along with a phenoxazine structure, a phenothiazine structure or a phenazine structure has almost not been specifically studied. In particular, a compound containing a 2,4,6-triaryl-1,3,5-triazine structure along with a phenoxazine structure, a phenothiazine structure or a phenazine structure has not been reported even for a synthesis example thereof. Accordingly, it is extremely difficult to predict accurately properties that are exhibited by the compound having a combination of the structure. In particular, for the usefulness thereof as a light-emitting material, it is difficult to find any literature capable of becoming the basis of prediction of the usefulness, as apparent from PTL 1 and PTL 2, which fail to describe a purpose as a light-emitting material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">The present inventors have performed investigations with the aim of synthesizing a compound containing in the molecule thereof a 1,3,5-triazine structure along with a phenoxazine structure, a phenothiazine structure or a phenazine structure, and evaluating the compound for usefulness as a light-emitting material. The inventors have further performed earnest investigations with the aim of evolving a general formula of a compound that is useful as a light-emitting material, and generalizing a structure of an organic light-emitting device having a high light emission efficiency.</div>
<heading id="h-0007">Solution to Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">As a result of earnest investigations for achieving the objects, the inventors have succeeded at synthesis of a compound containing a 2,4,6-triaryl-1,3,5-triazine structure along with a phenoxazine structure, a phenothiazine structure or a phenazine structure, and have first revealed that the compound is useful as a light-emitting material. It has been also found that a compound that is useful as a delayed fluorescent material is included in the compound, and have revealed that an organic light-emitting device having a high light emission efficiency may be provided inexpensively. Based on the knowledge, the inventors have consequently provide the invention below as a measure for solving the problems.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0013" num="0000">Organic Light-Emitting Device</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">The compound represented by the general formula (1) of the invention is useful as a light-emitting material of an organic light-emitting device. Accordingly, the compound represented by the general formula (1) of the invention may be effectively used as a light-emitting material in a light-emitting layer of an organic light-emitting device. The compound represented by the general formula (1) includes a delayed fluorescent material (delayed fluorescent emitter) emitting delayed fluorescent light. Accordingly, the invention also relates to a delayed fluorescent emitter having a structure represented by the general formula (1), use of a compound represented by the general formula (1) as a delayed fluorescent emitter, and a method for emitting delayed fluorescent light with a compound represented by the general formula (1). An organic light-emitting device that uses the compound as a light-emitting material thus has features that the device emits delayed fluorescent light and has a high light emission efficiency. The principle of the features may be described as follows for an organic electroluminescent device as an example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">In an organic electroluminescent device, carriers injected from an anode and a cathode form an excited state for the light-emitting material, from which light is emitted. In the case of a carrier injection type organic electroluminescent device, in general, excitons that are excited to the excited singlet state are 25% of the total excitons generated, and the remaining 75% thereof are excited to the excited triplet state. Accordingly, the use of phosphorescence, which is light emission from the excited triplet state, provides a high energy utilization. However, the excited triplet state has a long lifetime and thus causes saturation of the excited state and deactivation of energy through mutual action with the excitons in the excited triplet state, and therefore the quantum yield of phosphorescence may generally be often not high. A delayed fluorescent material emits fluorescent light through the mechanism that excitons excited in the triplet state, which can be formed directly in that state or indirectly processes such as intersystem crossing from a singlet state, transits to the excited triplet state through intersystem crossing or the like, and then transits to the excited singlet state through reverse intersystem crossing due to triplet-triplet annihilation or absorption of thermal energy, thereby emitting fluorescent light. It is considered that among the materials, a thermal activation type delayed fluorescent material emitting light through absorption of thermal energy is particularly useful for an organic electroluminescent device. In the case where a delayed fluorescent material is used in an organic electroluminescent device, the excitons in the excited singlet state normally emit fluorescent light. On the other hand, the excitons in the excited triplet state emit fluorescent light after reverse intersystem crossing to the excited singlet state by absorbing the heat generated by the device. At this time, the light emitted after reverse intersystem crossing from the excited triplet state to the excited singlet state has the same wavelength as fluorescent light since it is light emission from the excited single state, but has a longer lifetime (light emission lifetime) than the normal fluorescent light and phosphorescent light, and thus the light is observed as fluorescent light that is delayed from the normal fluorescent light and phosphorescent light. The light may be defined as delayed fluorescent light. The use of the thermal activation type exciton transition mechanism may raise the proportion of the compound in the excited single state, which is generally formed in a proportion only of 25%, to 25% or more through the absorption of the thermal energy after the carrier injection. A compound that emits strong fluorescent light and delayed fluorescent light at a low temperature of lower than 100° C. undergoes the intersystem crossing from the excited triplet state to the excited singlet state sufficiently with the heat of the device, thereby emitting delayed fluorescent light, and thus the use of the compound may drastically enhance the light emission efficiency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117">The use of the compound represented by the general formula (1) of the invention as a light-emitting material of a light-emitting layer may provide an excellent organic light-emitting device, such as an organic photoluminescent device (organic PL device) and an organic electroluminescent device (organic EL device). The organic photoluminescent device has a structure containing a substrate having formed thereon at least a light-emitting layer. The organic electroluminescent device has a structure containing at least an anode, a cathode and an organic layer formed between the anode and the cathode. The organic layer contains at least a light-emitting layer, and may be formed only of a light-emitting layer, or may have one or more organic layers in addition to the light-emitting layer. Examples of the organic layer include a hole transporting layer, a hole injection layer, an electron barrier layer, a hole barrier layer, an electron injection layer, an electron transporting layer and an exciton barrier layer. The hole transporting layer may be a hole injection and transporting layer having a hole injection function, and the electron transporting layer may be an electron injection and transporting layer having an electron injection function.

Specific examples of the electrode material include a metal, such as Au, and an electroconductive transparent material, such as CuI, indium tin oxide (ITO), SnO<sub>2 </sub>and ZnO. A material that is amorphous and is capable of forming a transparent electroconductive film, such as IDIXO (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>—ZnO), may also be used. The anode may be formed in such a manner that the electrode material is formed into a thin film by such a method as vapor deposition or sputtering, and the film is patterned into a desired pattern by a photolithography method, or in the case where the pattern may not require high accuracy (for example, approximately 100 μm or more), the pattern may be formed with a mask having a desired shape on vapor deposition or sputtering of the electrode material. In alternative, in the case where a material capable of being applied as a coating, such as an organic electroconductive compound, is used, a wet film forming method, such as a printing method and a coating method, may be used. In the case where emitted light is to be taken out through the anode, the anode preferably has a transmittance of more than 10%, and the anode preferably has a sheet resistance of several hundred Ohm per square or less. The thickness thereof may be generally selected from a range of from 10 to 1,000 nm, and preferably from 10 to 200 nm, while depending on the material used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0016" num="0000">Cathode</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">The cathode is preferably formed of, as an electrode material, a metal having a small work function (4 eV or less) (referred to as an electron injection metal), an alloy or an electroconductive compound each having a small work function (4 eV or less), or a mixture thereof. Specific examples of the electrode material include sodium, a sodium-potassium alloy, magnesium, lithium, a magnesium-cupper mixture, a magnesium-silver mixture, a magnesium-aluminum mixture, a magnesium-indium mixture, an aluminum-aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) mixture, indium, a lithium-aluminum mixture, and a rare earth metal. Among these, a mixture of an electron injection metal and a second metal that is a stable metal having a larger work function than the electron injection metal, for example, a magnesium-silver mixture, a magnesium-aluminum mixture, a magnesium-indium mixture, an aluminum-aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) mixture, a lithium-aluminum mixture, and aluminum, are preferred from the standpoint of the electron injection property and the durability against oxidation and the like. The cathode may be produced by forming the electrode material into a thin film by such a method as vapor deposition or sputtering. The cathode preferably has a sheet resistance of several hundred Ohm per square or less, and the thickness thereof may be generally selected from a range of from 10 nm to 5 μm, and preferably from 50 to 200 nm. For transmitting the emitted light, any one of the anode and the cathode of the organic electroluminescent device is preferably transparent or translucent, thereby enhancing the light emission luminance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">The cathode may be formed with the electroconductive transparent materials described for the anode, thereby forming a transparent or translucent cathode, and by applying the cathode, a device having an anode and a cathode, both of which have transmittance, may be produced.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">The light-emitting layer is a layer, in which holes and electrons injected from the anode and the cathode, respectively, are recombined to form excitons, and then the layer emits light. A light-emitting material may be solely used as the light-emitting layer, but the light-emitting layer preferably contains a light-emitting material and a host material. The light-emitting material used may be one kind or two or more kinds selected from the group of compounds represented by the general formula (1) of the invention. In order that the organic electroluminescent device and the organic photoluminescent device of the invention exhibit a high light emission efficiency, it is important that the singlet excitons and the triplet excitons generated in the light-emitting material are confined in the light-emitting material. Accordingly, a host material is preferably used in addition to the light-emitting material in the light-emitting layer. The host material used may be an organic compound that has excited singlet energy and excited triplet energy, at least one of which is higher than those of the light-emitting material of the invention. As a result, the singlet excitons and the triplet excitons generated in the light-emitting material of the invention are capable of being confined in the molecules of the light-emitting material of the invention, thereby eliciting the light emission efficiency thereof sufficiently. However, there are cases where a high light emission efficiency is obtained even though the singlet excitons and the triplet excitons may not be sufficiently confined, and therefore host materials capable of achieving a high light emission efficiency may be used in the invention without any particular limitation. In the organic light-emitting device and the organic electroluminescent device of the invention, the light emission occurs in the light-emitting material of the invention contained in the light-emitting layer. The emitted light contains both fluorescent light and delayed fluorescent light. However, a part of the emitted light may contain emitted light from the host material, or the emitted light may partially contain emitted light from the host material.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">The host material in the light-emitting layer is preferably an organic compound that has a hole transporting function and an electron transporting function, prevents the emitted light from being increased in wavelength, and has a high glass transition temperature.</div>

The injection layer may be provided depending on necessity.</div>

Similarly, the hole barrier layer may be disposed between the light-emitting layer and the electron transporting layer, and inhibits holes from passing through the light-emitting layer toward the electron transporting layer. The barrier layer may also be used for inhibiting excitons from being diffused outside the light-emitting layer. Thus, the electron barrier layer and the hole barrier layer each may also have a function as an exciton barrier layer.

Specifically, in the case where the exciton barrier layer is present on the side of the anode, the layer may be inserted between the hole transporting layer and the light-emitting layer and adjacent to the light-emitting layer, and in the case where the layer is inserted on the side of the cathode, the layer may be inserted between the light-emitting layer and the cathode and adjacent to the light-emitting layer. Between the anode and the exciton barrier layer that is adjacent to the light-emitting layer on the side of the anode, a hole injection layer, an electron barrier layer and the like may be provided, and between the cathode and the exciton barrier layer that is adjacent to the light-emitting layer on the side of the cathode, an electron injection layer, an electron transporting layer, a hole barrier layer and the like may be provided. In the case where the barrier layer is provided, the material used for the barrier layer preferably has lowest excited singlet energy and lowest excited triplet energy, at least one of which is higher than the lowest excited singlet energy and the lowest excited triplet energy of the light-emitting layer, respectively.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0154" num="0153">The organic electroluminescent device thus produced by the aforementioned method emits light on application of an electric field between the anode and the cathode of the device. In this case, when the light emission is caused by the excited singlet energy, light having a wavelength that corresponds to the energy level thereof may be confirmed as fluorescent light or delayed fluorescent light. When the light emission is caused by the excited triplet energy, light having a wavelength that corresponds to the energy level thereof may be confirmed as phosphorescent light. The normal fluorescent light has a shorter light emission lifetime than the delayed fluorescent light, and thus the light emission lifetime may be distinguished between the fluorescent light and the delayed fluorescent light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0155" num="0154">The phosphorescent light may substantially not be observed with a normal organic compound, such as the compound of the invention, at room temperature since the excited triplet energy is converted to heat of the like due to the instability thereof, and is immediately deactivated with a short lifetime. The excited triplet energy of the normal organic compound may be measured by observing light emission under an extremely low temperature condition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0156" num="0155">The organic electroluminescent device of the invention may be applied to any of a single device, a device having a structure with plural devices disposed in an array, and a device having anodes and cathodes disposed in an X-Y matrix. According to the invention, an organic light-emitting device that is largely improved in light emission efficiency may be obtained by adding the compound represented by the general formula (1) in the light-emitting layer. The organic light-emitting device, such as the organic electroluminescent device, of the invention may be applied to a further wide range of purposes. For example, an organic electroluminescent display apparatus may be produced with the organic electroluminescent device of the invention, and for the details thereof, reference may be made to S. Tokito, C. Adachi and H. Murata, “Yuki EL Display” (Organic EL Display) (Ohmsha, Ltd.). In particular, the organic electroluminescent device of the invention may be applied to organic electroluminescent illumination and backlight which are highly demanded.</div>

An aqueous solution containing potassium carbonate (40 mmol, 5.53 g) and 100 mL of water was added thereto, and the mixture was heated under refluxing for 48 hours. After standing to cool to room temperature, ethyl acetate and a sodium chloride aqueous solution were added, and the organic layer was separated and extracted. The organic layer was dehydrated over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the solvent was distilled off to provide a brown solid matter. Chloroform was added thereto, and an insoluble solid matter was filtered off under suction, thereby providing 2-(4-aminophenyl)-4,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazine as the target product (yield amount: 4.60 g, yield: 71%).</div>

Antimony chloride (11.0 mmol, 3.30 g) was added dropwise thereto, and then the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour. Thereafter, the mixture was heated under refluxing for 12 hours. After standing to cool to room temperature, the yellow solid matter thus deposited was collected by filtering under suction, washed with methylene chloride, and then dried in vacuum. The resulting yellow solid matter was added to 75 mL of 28% aqueous ammonia cooled (0 to 5° C.) over an ice bath, and the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes. Thereafter, the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 hours. The white solid matter thus deposited was collected by filtering under suction, washed with water, and then dried in vacuum. The resulting white solid matter was added to 30 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide having been heated to 155° C., the mixture was stirred for 10 minutes, and the insoluble solid matter was filtered off under suction. The operation was repeated twice for purifying the product. Thereafter, N,N′-dimethylformamide was distilled off under heating and reduced pressure, thereby providing 2,4-bis(3-bromophenyl)-6-phenyl-1,5-triazine as the target product (yield amount: 2.67 g, yield: 51.9%).</div>
