<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a 35 U.S.C. 371 National Phase Entry Application from PCT/JP2013/060852, filed Apr. 10, 2013, which claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2012-106586, filed May 8, 2012, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">An exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure relates to an etching method for a substrate to be processed and a plasma etching device.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">In manufacturing a semiconductor device, various processings such as, for example, film forming and etching, are performed on a substrate to be processed so as to form a fine pattern. Such a pattern formed on a substrate to be processed tends to be finer and finer and thus, a control of an etching amount in the order of several nm or less is requested.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">An atomic layer etching (ALE) method receives attention as a technology for controlling such an etching amount. The ALE method is a technology of etching a substrate to be processed to an atomic layer level by causing an etchant gas to be adsorbed on the substrate to be processed, and then, generating plasma of an inert gas such as, for example, Ar gas. For example, Patent Document 1 discloses a technology based on such an ALE method.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">PRIOR ART DOCUMENT</heading>
<heading id="h-0005">Patent Document</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Patent Document 1: Specification of US Patent Application Publication No. 2012/0048831A</div>
<heading id="h-0006">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0007">Problems to be Solved</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">In the technology disclosed in Patent Document 1, the ALE method is carried out using a parallel flat plate type plasma etching device. However, in the ALE method using the parallel flat plate type plasma etching device, the etching amount may not be precisely controlled, or a substrate to be processed may be damaged.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, what is requested in the related art is an etching method based on an ALE method which may reduce damage to the substrate to be processed and is excellent in controllability of etching amount.</div>
<heading id="h-0008">Solution</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">An aspect of the present disclosure relates to an etching method for a substrate to be processed. The method includes: (a1) supplying an etchant gas into a processing container that accommodates a substrate to be processed; (b1) evacuating the inside of the processing container; (c1) supplying a noble gas into the processing container; and (d1) supplying microwaves into the processing container so as to excite plasma of the nobble gas inside the processing container. In an exemplary embodiment, a series of steps including the supplying of the etchant gas, the evacuating, the supplying of the noble gas, and the exciting of the plasma of the noble gas may be repeated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Here, in a parallel flat plate type plasma etching device, the electronic temperature of the plasma within the processing container becomes higher than 2 eV to 3 eV. The plasma with this electronic temperature may cut a bond between the etchant gas adsorbed on the substrate to be processed and the substrate to be processed. Thus, it is estimated that the etching amount is difficult to control in the ALE method using the parallel flat plate type plasma etching device. In addition, the substrate to be processed may be damaged in the plasma having such a high electronic temperature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Meanwhile, the method according to the aspect of the present invention uses microwaves for exciting plasma. The plasma excited using the microwaves has a considerably low electronic temperature which is, for example, 1 eV to 2 eV. The plasma having such a low electronic temperature does not have an energy to break a bond between an etchant gas chemically adsorbed to a substrate to be processed and the substrate to be processed. In the present method, it is possible to separate constituent atoms of the substrate to be processed which form the bond with the etchant gas from the substrate to be processed by heat generated due to the activation of the noble gas, without breaking the bond. Because the present method does not break the bond between the etchant gas and the constituent atoms of the substrate to be processed, the method is excellent in controllability of etching amount. In addition, according to the present method, the plasma having an electronic temperature lower than that of plasma excited by the parallel flat plate type plasma etching device is excited. Thus, the damage to the substrate to be processed may also be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">In an exemplary embodiment, the substrate to be processed may include a polycrystalline silicon layer. In such a case, the etchant gas may be Cl<sub>2 </sub>gas. In the present exemplary embodiment, the Cl<sub>2 </sub>gas is chemically adsorbed to silicon in the polycrystalline silicon. A binding energy between chlorine and silicon is higher than a binding energy of Si—Si in the polycrystalline silicon layer. Thus, according to the present exemplary embodiment, it is possible to separate the silicon which forms a bond with Cl (chlorine) from the polycrystalline silicon layer by the heat generated due to the activation of the noble gas, without breaking the bond.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition, a plasma etching device according to another aspect of the present disclosure includes a processing container, a first supply unit, an exhaust unit, a second supply unit, a microwave supply unit, and a control unit. The first supply unit supplies an etchant gas to inside of the processing container. The exhaust unit evacuates the inside of the processing container. The second supply unit supplies a noble gas to the inside of the processing container. The microwave supply unit supplies microwaves to the inside of the processing container. The control unit controls the first supply unit, the exhaust unit, the second supply unit, and the microwave supply unit such that (a1) the etchant gas is supplied into the processing container, then (b1) the inside of the processing container is evacuated, then (c1) the noble gas is supplied to the inside of the processing container, and then (d1) the microwaves are supplied to the inside of the processing container so as to excite the plasma of the noble gas. The plasma etching device may be used so as to perform the above-described etching method of a substrate to be processed in which microwaves are used for exciting plasma. In an exemplary embodiment, the control unit may control the first supply unit, the exhaust unit, the second supply unit, and the microwave supply unit to repeat a series of processings including steps (a1) to (d1) as described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">In addition, in an exemplary embodiment, the first supply unit may supply Cl<sub>2 </sub>gas as the etchant gas. When such an etchant gas is supplied, it is possible to etch a substrate to be processed which includes a polycrystalline silicon layer, as the substrate to be processed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">In addition, still another aspect of the present disclosure relates to an etching method for a substrate to be processed. The method includes: (a2) supplying a noble gas into a processing container that accommodates a substrate to be processed and supplying microwaves so as to excite plasma; and (b2) alternately increasing and decreasing a supply amount of an etchant gas in relation to the inside of the processing chamber that accommodates the substrate to be processed, in a period of exciting the plasma. In an exemplary embodiment, in the alternate increasing and decreasing of the supply amount of the etchant gas, supply of the etchant gas and supply stop of the etchant gas may be alternately switched.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">The present method may control the etching rate of each cycle of increasing and decreasing the supply amount of the etchant gas to be relatively small. In addition, when the number of times of performing the cycle is adjusted, the etching amount may be controlled. Accordingly, the present method is excellent in controllability of etching amount.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">In an exemplary embodiment, the substrate to be processed may include polycrystalline silicon and silicon nitride. In such a case, the etchant gas may include CH<sub>3</sub>F gas. According to this exemplary embodiment, it becomes possible to selectively etching the silicon nitride in relation to the polycrystalline silicon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">In addition, a plasma etching device according to yet another aspect of the present disclosure includes a processing container, a first supply unit, a second supply unit, a microwave supply unit, and a control unit. The first supply unit supplies an etchant gas into the processing container. The second supply unit supplies a noble gas into the processing container. The microwave supply unit supplies microwaves into the processing container. The control unit controls the first supply unit, second supply unit and the microwave supply unit to alternately increase and decrease a supply amount of the etchant gas in relation to the inside of the processing container, in a period of (a2) supplying the microwaves and (b2) exciting plasma. The plasma etching device may be used for performing a method including the above-mentioned steps (a2) and (b2) in which microwaves are used for exciting plasma. In an exemplary embodiment, the control unit may alternately switch supply of the etchant gas and supply stop of the etchant gas in order to increase and decrease of a supply amount of the etchant gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">In an exemplary embodiment, the first supply unit may supply a gas including CH<sub>3</sub>F gas as the etchant gas. The device of the present exemplary embodiment may be used for etching a substrate to be processed which includes polycrystalline silicon and silicon nitride, and may selectively etching the silicon nitride on the substrate to be processed.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">Hereinafter, an etching method which may be performed using the plasma etching device <b>10</b> will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4E</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flowchart illustrating an etching method according to an exemplary embodiment. In addition, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4E</figref> are views for describing a concept of the etching method illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in the etching method according to the exemplary embodiment, in step S<b>1</b>, an etchant gas is supplied into the processing container <b>12</b> in a state where a substrate to be processed W is mounted on the stage <b>20</b>. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the substrate to be processed W may include, for example, a polycrystalline silicon layer as an etched layer L<b>10</b>, and, for example, Cl<sub>2 </sub>gas may be supplied as an etchant gas. In addition, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a circle surrounding a mark “Si” indicates a Si atom, and a circle surrounding a mark “Cl” indicates a molecule of Cl<sub>2 </sub>gas. By step S<b>1</b>, the etchant gas is adsorbed on a surface of the substrate to be processed W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">Subsequently, in the present method, evacuation of the inside of the processing container <b>12</b> is performed in step S<b>2</b>. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the etchant gas chemically adsorbed to the atoms on the surface of the substrate to be processed W remains, and the etchant gas excessively adsorbed to the substrate to be processed W and the etchant gas within the processing space S are removed from the processing container <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">Subsequently, in the present method, in step S<b>3</b>, a noble gas is supplied into the processing container <b>12</b>. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, as for the noble gas, for example, Ar gas may be used. In addition, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, a circle surrounding a mark “Ar” indicates an Ar atom. Subsequently, in the present method, in step S<b>4</b>, microwaves are supplied into the processing container <b>12</b> so as to excite plasma of the noble gas. By step S<b>4</b>, the atoms of the surface of the substrate to be processed W which form bonds with chlorine are released from the substrate to be processed W, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">Subsequently, in the present method, in step S<b>5</b>, the inside of the processing container <b>12</b> is evacuated as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref>. The present method may perform a series of processings including steps S<b>1</b> to S<b>5</b> as described above a predetermined number of times. In addition, in step S<b>6</b>, when it is determined that the series of processings should be finished, for example, when it is determined that the series of processings has performed the predetermined number of times, the present method is finished.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">In the above-described etching method, the plasma of the noble gas is excited using microwaves after the etchant gas is chemically adsorbed to the surface of the substrate to be processed W and the inside of the processing container <b>12</b> is evacuated. The electron temperature of the plasma is, for example, 1 eV to 2 eV which is lower than the electron temperature of plasma generated in a parallel flat plate type plasma etching device. The plasma with the low electron temperature does not have an energy that cuts bonds between the atoms on the surface of the substrate to be processed W and constituent molecules or atoms of the etchant gas. The present method separates the constituent atoms of the substrate to be processed W which form bonds with the constituent atoms or molecules of the etchant gas, from the substrate to be processed W by the heat generated by the activation of the noble gas without cutting the bonds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">For example, when the substrate to be processed W includes a polycrystalline silicon layer as an etched layer L<b>10</b> and Cl<sub>2 </sub>gas is supplied as an etchant gas, the plasma excited by the present method does not have an energy that cuts bonds between Si atoms and chlorine molecules or atoms. The present method separates the Si atoms of the etched layer L<b>10</b> which form bonds with chlorine molecules or atoms, from the substrate to be processed W by the heat generated by the activation of the noble gas without cutting the bonds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">As described above, because the present method is capable of separating the constituent atoms of the substrate to be processed W which form bonds with the constituent atoms or molecules of the etchant gas, from the substrate to be processed W without cutting the bonds, the present method is excellent in controllability of etching amount.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0124">In Test Examples 4 and 5, etching depths of the etched layer were measured on each of X, V, Y, and W axes which pass the center of the substrate to be processed W at 45 degree intervals. In addition, etching rates on each axis in 1 cycle were calculated from the measured etching depths. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> represents the etching rates obtained in Test Example 4, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> represents the etching rates obtained in Test Example 5.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0125">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, it was found from Test Example 4 that when the mixed gas of CH<sub>3</sub>F gas and O<sub>2 </sub>gas was used as the etchant gas, the etching rate of the polycrystalline silicon layer was 0 mm/min or less. In addition, as illustrated in FIG. <b>9</b>B, it was found from Test Example 5 that when the mixed gas of CH<sub>3</sub>F gas and O<sub>2 </sub>gas was used as the etchant gas, the etching rate of the silicon nitride is larger than 0 mm/min. Accordingly, it was found that when the substrate to be processed including silicon nitride and polycrystalline silicon etched while alternately switching the supply and the supply stop of the mixed gas of CH<sub>3</sub>F gas and O<sub>2 </sub>gas, the silicon nitride can be selectively etched.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0126">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, in Test Example 5 described above, the etching rate of the silicon nitride layer on the substrate to be processed was increased toward the edge of the substrate to be processed. Accordingly, Test Examples 6 and 7 were performed in order to determine whether the reason resulted from the etchant gas adhered to the side wall of the processing container <b>12</b> at the time of supply stop of the etchant gas. In Test Examples 6 and 7, the temperature of the heater HS was increased in order to increase the temperature of the side wall of the processing container <b>12</b> to be higher than that of the side wall in Test Examples 4 and 5 so as to reduce the adhesion of the etchant gas to the side wall. In addition, the temperature of the heater HT was also increased so as to increase the temperature of the upper portion of the processing container <b>12</b>. Specifically, in Test Example 6, the temperature of the heaters HT and HS was set to 80° C. The other conditions in Test Example 6 are the same as those in Test Example 4. In addition, in Test Example 7, the temperature of the heaters HT and HS was set to 80° C. The other conditions in Test Example 7 are the same as those in Test Example 5.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0127">In Test Examples 6 and Test Example 7, the etching depths of the etched layer were also measured on each of X, V, Y, and W axes which pass the center of the substrate to be processed W at 45 degree intervals. In addition, etching rates on each axis in 1 cycle were calculated from the measured etching depths. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> represents the etching rates obtained in Test Example 6, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> represents the etching rates obtained in Test Example 7.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0128">As is obvious from comparison of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>, it was found that even if the temperature of the side wall of the processing container <b>12</b> is increased, there is no change in etching rate value and distribution. That is, it was found that the reason why the etching rate of the silicon nitride layer is increased toward the edge does not result from the etchant gas adhered to the side wall of the processing container <b>12</b> at the time of supply stop of the etchant gas. Further, it is estimated that the etching rate distribution at respective positions on the substrate to be processed may be controlled when the spatial distribution of supply amount the etchant gas is controlled.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0129">Although various exemplary embodiments have been described above, various modified aspects may be made without being limited to the above-described exemplary embodiments. For example, in the etching method illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A to 4E</figref>, CF<sub>4 </sub>gas may be used instead of Cl<sub>2 </sub>gas as the etchant gas when the etched layer is a SiN layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0130">In addition, a gas may be supplied downward toward the substrate to be processed W from the central portion of the dielectric window <b>18</b> in the plasma etching device illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 7</figref> in order to control the spatial distribution of the etchant gas supply amount. Specifically, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the central inlet <b>22</b> may be additionally provided in the plasma etching device illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 7</figref>. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the central inlet <b>22</b> includes a pipe <b>22</b> <i>a </i>and an injector <b>22</b> <i>b</i>. The pipe <b>22</b> <i>a </i>extends through the inside of the inner conductor <b>16</b> <i>b </i>along the axis X. The injector <b>22</b> <i>b </i>is connected to the pipe <b>22</b> <i>a</i>. A plurality of through holes extending in the axis X direction is formed in the injector <b>22</b> <i>b</i>. In the dielectric window <b>18</b>, a space that accommodates the injector <b>22</b> <i>b </i>and a hole <b>18</b> <i>h </i>that interconnects the space and the processing space S are formed along the axis X. The central inlet <b>22</b> may supply the gas into the processing space S along the axis X from the upper side of the processing space S through the pipe <b>22</b> <i>a</i>, the plurality of through holes of the injector <b>22</b> <i>b</i>, and the hole <b>18</b> <i>h</i>. In the case of the plasma etching device <b>10</b>, a separate gas supply system which is the same as the gas supply system GS may be connected to the central inlet <b>22</b>.

In addition, in the case of the plasma etching device <b>10</b>A, a separate gas supply system which is the same as the gas supply system GS<b>10</b> may be connected to the central inlet <b>22</b>. Further, the gas from the gas supply system GS may be branched to the central inlet <b>22</b> through a flow splitter.
