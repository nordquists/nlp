<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">Hereinafter, the present disclosure will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. The following description is presented for purposes of illustration only and not of limitation as the scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims. For example, the steps mentioned in any of the method or process may be executed in any order and are not necessarily limited to the order provided. Also, any reference to singular includes plural embodiments, and vice versa.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic view illustrating an exemplary embodiment of a semiconductor light emitting device according to the present disclosure and a manufacturing method of the same.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">In a manufacturing method of a semiconductor light emitting device, in step <b>11</b>, a plurality of semiconductor layers is formed on a substrate, the plurality of semiconductor layers including a first semiconductor layer having a first conductivity type, a second semiconductor layer having a second conductivity type different from the first conductivity type, and an active layer interpositioned between the first and second semiconductor layers, for generating light by electron-hole recombination. Then, in step <b>21</b>, an electrode electrically connected to the first semiconductor layer or the second semiconductor layer is formed. Next, in step <b>31</b>, a non-conductive film for reflecting light from the active layer is formed in a manner that the non-conductive film covers the electrode and faces the plurality of semiconductor layers. The subsequent step <b>41</b> involves a process of forming an opening on the non-conductive film for an electrical connecting pass with the electrode. That is, a first etching process is carried out to form an opening through which the electrode is exposed. Afterwards, in step <b>51</b>, a second etching process is carried out to remove insulating materials formed on top of the electrode having been exposed to the opening. Then, in step <b>61</b>, an electrical connection in contact with the electrode is formed in the opening.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic view illustrating an exemplary embodiment of a manufacturing method of the semiconductor light emitting device shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">In this manufacturing method of the semiconductor light emitting device, firstly, a buffer layer <b>20</b> is grown on a substrate <b>10</b>, followed by an n-type semiconductor layer <b>30</b> (a first semiconductor layer), an active layer <b>40</b>, and a p-type semiconductor layer <b>50</b> (a second semiconductor layer) in sequence (refer to S<b>11</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">The substrate <b>10</b>, which may eventually be removed, is typically made of sapphire, SiC, Si, GaN or the like, and the buffer layer <b>20</b> may be omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">The p-type semiconductor layer <b>50</b> and the active layer <b>40</b> are mesa-etched, thereby exposing a part of the n-type semiconductor layer. The mesa etching may be carried out in different orders.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">A light absorption barrier <b>65</b> is formed on the p-type semiconductor layer, in correspondence with an electrode <b>93</b> to be formed in a subsequent step. The light absorption barrier <b>65</b> may be omitted. The light absorption barrier <b>65</b> may be composed of a single layer (e.g. SiO<sub>2</sub>) that is made of a light transmitting material having a refractive index lower than the refractive index of the p-type semiconductor layer <b>50</b>, or a multilayered structure (e.g. SiO<sub>2</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub>), or a DBR, or a combination of the single layer and the DBR. In addition, the light absorption barrier <b>65</b> may be made of a non-conductive material (e.g. a dielectric film such as SiO<sub>x</sub>, TiO<sub>x </sub>or the like).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">A light transmitting conductive film <b>60</b> covering the light absorption barrier <b>65</b> is preferentially formed on the p-type semiconductor layer <b>50</b>, for current spreading into the p-type semiconductor layer <b>50</b>. For example, the light transmitting conductive film <b>60</b> may be made of a material such as ITO, Ni/Au or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">Next, the electrode <b>93</b> is formed on the light transmitting conductive film <b>60</b> (refer to S<b>21</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The electrode <b>93</b> is electrically connected with the p-type semiconductor layer <b>50</b> by means of the light transmitting conductive film <b>60</b>. When the electrode <b>93</b> is formed, an n-side bonding pad <b>80</b> adapted to supply electrons to the n-type semiconductor layer <b>30</b> may also be formed on the exposed n-type semiconductor layer <b>30</b>. Optionally, the n-side bonding pad <b>80</b> may be formed when a reflective electrode <b>92</b> (to be described later) is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">If an electrical connection <b>94</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) (to be described later) is directly connected to the light transmitting conductive film <b>60</b>, it may not be easy to form a satisfactory electrical contact between the reflective electrode <b>92</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) and the light transmitting conductive film <b>60</b>. In this embodiment, the electrode <b>93</b> which is interpositioned between the light transmitting conductive film <b>60</b> and the electrical connection <b>94</b> makes a stable electrical contact with them and prevents an increase in the contact resistance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">Subsequently, as a non-conductive film, a non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> covering the electrode <b>93</b> is formed (see S<b>31</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> may also be formed on top of the etch-exposed n-type semiconductor layer <b>30</b> and on top of a part of the n-side bonding pad <b>80</b>. It is not absolutely necessary for the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> to cover the entire area on the n-type and p-type semiconductor layers <b>30</b>, <b>50</b>. It is desirable that the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> functions as a reflective film, yet it is made of light transmitting materials for avoiding light absorption. The non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> may be formed of light transmitting dielectric materials such as SiO<sub>x</sub>, TiO<sub>x</sub>, Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, or MgF<sub>2</sub>. When the non-conductive reflective layer <b>91</b> is made of SiO<sub>x</sub>, it has a lower refractive index than the refractive index of the p-type semiconductor layer <b>50</b> (e.g. GaN) such that the light incident at a greater angle than the critical angle will partly be reflected towards the plurality of semiconductor layers <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">Meanwhile, when the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> is made of a DBR (e.g. DBR using the combination of SiO<sub>2 </sub>and TiO<sub>2</sub>), a greater amount of incident light will be reflected towards the plurality of semiconductor layers <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an enlarged view of a portion R<b>2</b> of an opening formed by dry etching, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a schematic view illustrating the upper face of a wet-etched electrode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">Further, an opening <b>102</b> is formed by dry etching (a first etching process) in the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> such that a part of the electrode <b>93</b> is exposed (see S<b>41</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). During dry etching, halogen gases containing an F group (e.g. CF<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>8</sub>, SF<sub>6 </sub>or the like) may be used as an etching gas. The electrode <b>93</b> may include multiple layers. For example, the electrode <b>93</b> includes a contact layer <b>95</b> electrically connected with the p-type semiconductor layer <b>50</b>, an anti-oxidation layer <b>98</b> formed on the contact layer <b>95</b>, and an anti-etching layer <b>99</b> formed on the anti-oxidation layer <b>98</b>. In this embodiment, the electrode <b>93</b> includes a contact layer <b>95</b>, a reflective layer <b>96</b>, a diffusion barrier layer <b>97</b>, an anti-oxidation layer <b>98</b> and an anti-etching layer <b>99</b>, which are arranged sequentially on the light transmitting conductive film <b>60</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0106">The contact layer <b>95</b> is preferentially made of a material that can establish a satisfactory electrical contact with the light transmitting conductive film <b>60</b>. To this end, a material such as Cr or Ti is typically used, but other materials such as Ni, Ti or TiW and highly reflective materials such as Al or Ag can also be used for the contact layer <b>95</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0107">The reflective layer <b>96</b> may be made of a highly reflective metal (e.g. Ag, Al or a combination thereof). The reflective layer <b>96</b> reflects light generated in the active layer <b>40</b> towards the plurality of semiconductor layers <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>. The reflective layer <b>96</b> may be omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">The diffusion barrier layer <b>97</b> prevents the material of the reflective layer <b>96</b> or the material of the anti-oxidation layer <b>98</b> from diffusing to other layers. The diffusion barrier layer <b>97</b> may be made of at least one of Ti, Ni, Cr, W or TiW. If high reflectance is required, Al or Ag may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0109">The anti-oxidation layer <b>98</b> may be made of Au, Pt or the like. Any material that is not easily oxidized when exposed to the outside and brought into contact with oxygen is also acceptable. Au with high electrical conductivity is preferentially used for the anti-oxidation layer <b>98</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0110">The anti-etching layer <b>99</b> is exposed during dry etching for forming the opening <b>102</b>. In this embodiment, the anti-etching layer <b>99</b> corresponds to a top layer of the electrode <b>93</b>. When the anti-etching layer <b>99</b> is made of Au, it shows weak bonding strength towards the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>, and part of Au may be damaged or ruined during etching. Hence, the anti-etching layer <b>99</b> is preferentially made of a material such as Ni, W, TiW, Cr, Pd, Mo or the like, instead of Au, in order to retain the bonding strength towards the non-conductive reflective layer <b>91</b>, thus improving reliability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0111">During dry etching, the anti-etching layer <b>99</b> protects the electrode <b>93</b>, and in particular it prevents damages on the anti-oxidation layer <b>98</b>. During dry etching, halogen gases containing an F group (e.g. CF<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>8</sub>, SF<sub>6 </sub>or the like) may be used as an etching gas. To avoid any damage on the anti-oxidation layer <b>98</b> during dry etching, the anti-etching layer <b>99</b> is preferentially made of a material having high etching selectivity. If the anti-etching layer <b>99</b> has poor etching selectivity, the anti-oxidation layer <b>98</b> may be damaged or ruined during dry etching. Therefore, from the perspective of etching selectivity, Cr or Ni is a suitable choice of materials for the anti-etching layer <b>99</b>. Ni or Cr does not or only slightly reacts with the etching gas during dry etching, thereby remaining in a non-etched condition, which enables the anti-etching layer to protect the electrode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0112">Meanwhile, the etching gas used in dry etching for forming the opening <b>102</b> may produce a material <b>107</b> such as an insulation material or impurities on the top layer of the electrode <b>93</b>. For example, the material <b>107</b> may be produced by a reaction between the halogen etching gas containing an F group and the top layer metal of the electrode. For instance, Ni, W, TiW, Cr, Pd, Mo and the like, which are the materials of the anti-etching layer <b>99</b>, may at least partly react with the etching gas used in dry etching, and produce the material <b>107</b> (e.g. NiF), as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. However, the material <b>107</b> thus produced can cause deterioration of the electrical properties (e.g. an increased operating voltage) of the semiconductor light emitting device. Another part of Ni, W, TiW, Cr, Pd, Mo and the like, which are the materials of the anti-etching layer <b>99</b>, may react with the etching gas but will not produce the material at all or produce a very small amount of the material. It is desirable to suppress the production of the material, or allow only a very small amount to be produced. From this perspective, Cr is preferred to Ni as a material for the anti-etching layer <b>99</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0113">In this embodiment, due to the material being produced, the top layer of the electrode <b>93</b>, i.e. a part of the anti-etching layer <b>99</b> in correspondence to the opening <b>102</b> is subjected to wet etching (a second etching process) and removed such that, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a part of the anti-oxidation layer <b>98</b> in correspondence to the opening <b>102</b> is exposed. As such, the material <b>107</b> as well as the anti-etching layer <b>99</b> are etched and removed together. With the material <b>107</b> having been removed, the electrode <b>93</b> and the electrical connection <b>94</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) may have a better electrical contact between them, and deterioration of the electrical properties of the semiconductor light emitting device is avoided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0114">Alternatively, the first etching process for forming the opening <b>102</b> may be carried out by wet etching. In this case, the wet etchant for the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> may be HF, BOE, NHO<sub>3</sub>, or HCl, which is used singly or in combination at a suitable concentration. Similar to dry etching mentioned above, when the opening <b>102</b> is formed in the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> by wet etching, the anti-etching layer <b>99</b> should preferentially have high etching selectivity for protecting the anti-oxidation layer <b>98</b>. From this perspective, Cr is a suitable material for the anti-etching layer <b>99</b>. Then a part of the anti-etching layer <b>99</b> in correspondence to the opening <b>102</b> can be removed by another subsequent wet etching (a second etching process).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0115">As a result of the processes of forming the opening <b>102</b> and removing a part of the anti-etching layer <b>99</b> in correspondence to the opening <b>102</b>, the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> and the anti-etching layer <b>99</b> having excellent bonding strength in other parts except for the opening <b>102</b> are brought into contact with each other; and, for example, the electrode <b>93</b> will have a stack of Cr (contact layer)/AI (reflective layer)/Ni (diffusion barrier layer)/Au (anti-oxidation layer)/Cr (anti-etching layer) arranged sequentially. Also, having removed a part of the anti-etching layer <b>99</b> in correspondence to the opening <b>102</b> to avoid deterioration of the electrical properties, the electrode <b>93</b> will have a stack including Cr (contact layer)/AI (reflective layer)/Ni (diffusion barrier layer)/Au (anti-oxidation layer) arranged sequentially, in which the anti-oxidation layer <b>98</b> may come into contact with an electrical connection <b>94</b> (to be described).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0116">Unlike the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a part of the anti-etching layer <b>99</b> in correspondence to the opening <b>102</b> may be partly wet etched down to a certain thickness, leaving the other part of the anti-etching layer <b>99</b> non-etched; and the material centered on the top face of the anti-etching layer can be removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0117"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a schematic view illustrating an electrical connection formed in the opening.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0118">As can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an electrical connection <b>94</b> in contact with the electrode <b>93</b> is formed in the opening <b>102</b> (see S<b>61</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The electrical connection <b>94</b> may be formed such that it is brought into contact with the anti-oxidation layer <b>98</b> exposed to the opening <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">A reflective electrode <b>92</b> being in contact with the electrical connection <b>94</b> may then be formed on the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>, with the reflective electrode being made of a highly reflective metal such as Al or Ag. The reflective electrode <b>92</b> may be formed by deposition or plating, for instance. Alternatively, the reflective electrode <b>92</b> and the electrical connection <b>94</b> may be formed together instead of forming them separately. For example, the electrical connection <b>94</b> is formed by filling the opening <b>102</b> during the formation of the reflective electrode <b>92</b>. For a stable electrical contact, the reflective electrode <b>92</b> may be made of Cr, Ti, Ni or an alloy thereof. The reflective electrode <b>92</b> may be electrically connected to the outside to supply holes to the p-type semiconductor layer <b>50</b>, and it may reflect light that is not reflected by the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">When the substrate <b>10</b> has been removed or the substrate <b>10</b> is conductive, the n-side bonding pad <b>80</b> may be formed either on the n-type semiconductor layer <b>30</b> side after the substrate <b>10</b> had been removed, or on the conductive substrate side. The positions of the n-type semiconductor layer <b>30</b> and p-type semiconductor layer <b>50</b> may be exchanged, and these semiconductor layers are typically made of GaN in case of Group III-nitride semiconductor light emitting devices. Each of the semiconductor layers <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>50</b> may have a multilayered structure, and an additional layer may optionally be added thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">The electrode <b>93</b>, the n-side bonding pad <b>80</b> and the reflective electrode <b>92</b> may be formed to have a branch portion to spread current. The n-side bonding pad <b>80</b> may have a height that is high enough to be combined with a package with the help of a separate bump, or the n-side bonding pad itself may be deposited up to a certain height that is high enough to be combined with a package as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">According to the manufacturing method of a semiconductor light emitting device described above, deterioration of the electrical properties of the semiconductor light emitting device is avoided by removing the material produced between the electrode <b>93</b> and the electrical connection <b>94</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">Moreover, the method makes it possible to manufacture a semiconductor light emitting device including an electrode <b>93</b> that demonstrates excellent bonding strength towards the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> as well as a satisfactory electrical contact with the electrical connection <b>94</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">In this embodiment, the electrode <b>93</b>, the electrical connection <b>94</b> and the reflective electrode <b>92</b> form an electrode part adapted to supply holes to the second semiconductor layer <b>50</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">The electrode <b>93</b> includes a contact layer <b>95</b> formed on a light transmitting conductive film <b>60</b>; alternating layers of a reflective layer <b>96</b> and a diffusion barrier layer <b>97</b> deposited on the contact layer <b>95</b>; an anti-oxidation layer <b>98</b> formed on the diffusion barrier layer <b>97</b>; and an anti-etching layer <b>99</b> in contact with a non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>. A part of the anti-etching layer <b>99</b> in correspondence to an opening is removed to expose the anti-oxidation layer <b>98</b> such that the anti-oxidation layer <b>98</b> may be brought into contact with an electrical connection <b>94</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">For example, the reflective layer <b>96</b>/the diffusion barrier layer <b>97</b> may form an Al/Ni/Al/Ni/Al/Ni layered structure.

Because of this, the prevention of light absorption by the electrode <b>93</b> can become more important, and the reflective layer <b>96</b> becomes important as well. If the reflective layer <b>96</b> such as Al is made very high, several problems may occur, e.g. the Al layer may burst. However, the alternating layers of the reflective layer <b>96</b>/the diffusion barrier layer <b>97</b> as in this embodiment make it possible to remove things like insulating materials or impurities, which in turn provides a satisfactory electrical contact and improves reflectivity, while eliminating the aforementioned problems.</div>

The n-side contact areas <b>31</b> are expanded in parallel with one lateral face C of the semiconductor light emitting device.

The number of the n-side contact areas <b>31</b> may be higher or lower, and the array or configuration thereof may vary. The n-side finger electrode <b>81</b> preferentially includes a branch portion <b>88</b> being stretched, and a connecting part <b>89</b> to allow a greater width at one side end of the branch portion <b>88</b>.

Therefore, the n-side finger electrodes <b>81</b> are placed in-between three p-side finger electrodes <b>93</b>, respectively, in an alternate manner. Also, the p-side finger electrode <b>93</b> preferentially includes a branch portion <b>98</b> being stretched, and a connecting part <b>99</b> to allow a greater width at one side end of the branch portion <b>98</b>. Meanwhile, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, when the semiconductor light emitting device is seen in a top plan view, the connecting part <b>99</b> of the p-side finger electrode <b>93</b> is positioned on the opposite side of the connecting part <b>89</b> of the n-side finger electrode <b>81</b>. That is to say, the connecting part <b>99</b> of the p-side finger electrode <b>93</b> is positioned on the left side, while the connecting part <b>89</b> of the n-side finger electrode <b>81</b> is positioned on the right side. The p-side finger electrode <b>93</b> is long stretched along one lateral C direction of the semiconductor light emitting device. For instance, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, it is long stretched from the left side to the right side. With these long stretched, plural p-side finger electrodes <b>93</b>, the device can be placed on a mount (e.g., a sub-mount, a package, or a COB (Chip on Board)) in an upside-down position without leaning.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0154" num="0153">Preferentially, a light absorption barrier film <b>95</b> is first formed on the p-type semiconductor layer <b>50</b> and then the p-side finger electrode <b>93</b> is formed above them. The light absorption barrier film <b>95</b> is formed in a manner that it is slightly wider than the p-side finger electrode <b>93</b>. The light absorption preventing layer <b>95</b> serves to prevent the p-side finger electrode <b>93</b> from absorbing light that is generated in the active layer <b>40</b>. The light absorption barrier film <b>95</b> may only serve to reflect part or all of the light generated in the active layer <b>40</b>, or may only serve to stop the current flow from the p-side finger electrode <b>93</b> to the bottom thereof, or may serve both functions. To perform these functions, the light absorption barrier film <b>95</b> can be composed of a single layer that is made of a light transmitting material having a lower refractive index than the refractive index of the p-type semiconductor layer <b>50</b> (e.g., SiO<sub>2</sub>), or multilayers (e.g., SiO<sub>2</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub>), or a DBR, or a combination of the single layer and the DBR. In addition, the light absorption barrier film <b>95</b> can be made of a non-conductive material (e.g., a dielectric material such as SiO<sub>x</sub>, TiO<sub>x </sub>or the like). Depending on the structure, a suitable thickness for the light absorption barrier film <b>95</b> would range from 0.2 μm to 3.0 μm. If the light absorption barrier film <b>95</b> is thinner than the range, it cannot function properly; and if the light absorption barrier film <b>95</b> is thicker than the range, it may be difficult to deposit the light transmitting conductive film <b>60</b> on the light absorption barrier film <b>95</b>. Although the light absorption prevention film <b>95</b> does not always have to be made of a light transmitting material, or of a non-conductive material, the effects thereof may be enforced by incorporating a light transmitting dielectric material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0155" num="0154">Preferentially, the light transmitting conductive film <b>60</b> is formed on the p-type semiconductor layer <b>50</b>, prior to the formation of the light absorption barrier film <b>95</b> followed by the p-side finger electrode <b>93</b>. The light transmitting conductive film <b>60</b> is formed on the p-type semiconductor layer <b>50</b> in such a way that it covers nearly the entire p-type semiconductor layer, but it does not cover the n-side contact area <b>31</b> that is formed by mesa etching. In this way, the light absorption barrier film <b>95</b> is disposed between the light transmitting conductive film <b>60</b> and the p-type semiconductor layer <b>50</b>. Especially p-type GaN demonstrates poor current spreading capability. Also, when the p-type semiconductor layer <b>50</b> is made of GaN, the light transmitting conductive film <b>60</b> should be incorporated most of the time. For instance, a material such as ITO, Ni/Au or the like may be used for the light transmitting conductive film <b>60</b>. Once the light transmitting conductive film <b>60</b> is formed, the light absorption barrier film <b>95</b> and then the p-side finger electrode <b>93</b> are formed above the light transmitting conductive film <b>60</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0156" num="0155">Following the formation of the n-side finger electrode <b>81</b> and the p-side finger electrode <b>93</b>, a non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> is formed in a manner that the both n-side contact area <b>31</b> including the n-side finger electrode <b>81</b> and the p-type semiconductor layer <b>50</b> including the p-side finger electrode <b>93</b> are covered all over with the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>. The non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> serves to reflect light from the active layer <b>40</b> towards the substrate <b>10</b> used for growing or towards the n-type semiconductor layer <b>30</b> if the substrate <b>10</b> has been removed. The non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> preferentially covers the p-type semiconductor layer <b>50</b> that connects the upper face of the p-type semiconductor layer <b>50</b> and the upper face of the n-side contact area <b>31</b>, as well as the exposed lateral face of the active layer <b>40</b>. A person skilled in the art would understand that it is not absolutely necessary for the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> to cover the entire area of the etch-exposed n-type semiconductor layer <b>30</b> and p-type semiconductor layer <b>50</b> on the opposite side of the substrate <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0157" num="0156">The non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> serves as a reflective film, yet it may preferentially be made of a light transmitting material, for example, a light transmitting dielectric material such as SiO<sub>x</sub>, TiO<sub>x</sub>, Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>or MgF<sub>2</sub>, so as to prevent light absorption. The non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> may be formed in various structures, including a single dielectric layer made of a light transmitting dielectric material such as SiO<sub>x </sub>(e.g., a single DBR including the combination of SiO<sub>2 </sub>and TiO<sub>2</sub>), heterogeneous plural dielectric films, or any combination of a dielectric film and a DBR, at a thickness ranging from 3 to 8 μm, for example. The dielectric film has a lower refractive index than the refractive index of the p-type semiconductor layer <b>50</b> (e.g., GaN) such that it can reflect part of the light incident at a greater angle than the critical angle towards the substrate <b>10</b>. Meanwhile, the DBR can reflect a greater amount of light towards the substrate <b>10</b>, and may be designed for a specific wavelength such that it can effectively reflect light according to the wavelength of the light generated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0158" num="0157">Preferentially, as can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> has a dual structure of a DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>and a dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b</i>. As the deposition of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>needs to be done with high precision, the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>having a uniform thickness is formed prior to the deposition such that the DBR <b>91</b> <i>b </i>may be prepared in a stable manner, and light reflection may also benefit therefrom.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0158">During the manufacture of a semiconductor light emitting device according to the present disclosure, a step (or bump) may be created by mesa etching for forming the n-side contact area <b>31</b>, and thus a component such as the p-side finger electrode <b>93</b> or the n-side finger electrode <b>81</b> is required to accommodate the step. Even after the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> is formed, a perforation process as described in detail below is still required to make an opening in the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>. Thus, extra caution should be paid especially during the formation of the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0159">The dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>is suitably made of SiO<sub>2</sub>, and it preferentially has a thickness ranging from 0.2 μm to 1.0 μm. If the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>is thinner than the range, it is not sufficiently thick enough to sufficiently cover the n-side finger electrode <b>81</b> and p-side finger electrode <b>93</b> having a height ranging from 2 μm to 3 μm; and if the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>is thicker than the range, it would make the subsequent perforation process more difficult. The dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>may be thicker than the DBD <b>91</b> <i>b </i>that comes next. Moreover, it is necessary to form the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>by a more suitable method to ensure the reliability of the device. For example, it is preferential to form the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>made of SiO<sub>2 </sub>by CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition), or inter alia, by PECVD (Plasma Enhanced CVD). This is because steps are created during the formation of the n-side contact area <b>31</b>, the p-side finger electrode <b>93</b> and the n-side finger electrode <b>81</b> by mesa etching, and because a CVD such as E-beam evaporation is more advantageous than PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) to cover the steps. More specifically, if the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>is formed by E-beam evaporation, the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>may be formed into a thin film on the lateral faces of the p-side finger electrode <b>93</b> and n-side finger electrode <b>81</b> having steps, or on the tilted step faces generated by mesa etching. Meanwhile, if a thinner dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>is formed on the step face, and especially if the p-side finger electrode <b>93</b> and the n-side finger electrode <b>81</b> are placed below the p-side electrode <b>92</b> and the n-side electrode <b>80</b> as described below, a short might occur between the electrodes. Therefore, in order to ensure insulation, the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>is preferentially formed by CVD. Accordingly, it is possible to secure the reliability of the semiconductor light emitting device, while ensuring those functions of the dielectric film as the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0160">The DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>is formed on the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b</i>, and the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>and the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>together form the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>. For example, the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>having alternating layers of the combination of TiO<sub>2</sub>/SiO<sub>2 </sub>is preferentially formed by PVD, and inter alia, by E-beam evaporation, sputtering or thermal evaporation. When the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>is made of the combination of TiO<sub>2</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub>, each layer is designed to have an optical thickness of one fourth of a given wavelength, and the number of its combinations is suitably between 4 and 20 pairs. This range is set because if the number of pairs is smaller than the range, the reflectivity of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>may be degraded; and if the number of pairs is larger than the range, the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>may become excessively thick.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0161">With the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> thus formed, the p-side finger electrode <b>93</b> and the n-side finger electrode <b>81</b> are fully covered with the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>. To enable the p-side finger electrode <b>93</b> and the n-side finger electrode <b>81</b> to electrically communicate with the p-side electrode <b>92</b> and the n-side electrode <b>80</b> described below, openings that pass through the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> are formed, and the openings are then filled with an electrode material to form electrical connections <b>94</b>, <b>82</b>. These openings are preferentially formed by dry etching or wet etching or both. As the p-side finger electrode <b>93</b> and the n-side finger electrode <b>81</b> have narrow-width branch portions <b>98</b>, <b>88</b> respectively, the electrical connections <b>94</b>, <b>82</b> are preferentially formed on the connection parts <b>99</b>, <b>89</b> of the p-side finger electrode <b>93</b> and the n-side finger electrode <b>81</b>, respectively. In absence of the p-side finger electrode <b>93</b>, a number of electrical connections <b>94</b> should be formed and connected directly to the light transmitting conductive film <b>60</b> that is prepared on nearly the entire face of the p-type semiconductor layer <b>50</b>. Likewise, in absence of the n-side finger electrode <b>81</b>, a number of electrical connections <b>82</b> should be formed and connected directly to the n-side contact area <b>31</b>. However, these do not necessarily make it easier to form a satisfactory electrical contact between the p-side electrode <b>92</b> and the light transmitting conductive film <b>60</b>, and between the n-side electrode <b>80</b> and the n-type semiconductor layer <b>30</b>, and many problems also occur during the manufacturing process. Meanwhile, according to the present disclosure, prior to the formation of the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>, the n-side finger electrode <b>81</b> is formed on the n-side contact area <b>31</b>, and the p-side finger electrode <b>93</b> is formed either on the p-type semiconductor layer <b>50</b> or preferentially on the light transmitting conductive film <b>60</b>, and these electrodes are then subjected to heat treatment, thereby establishing a stable electrical contact between both sides.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0162">Once the electrical contact portions <b>94</b>, <b>82</b> are formed, it is desirable to form the p-side electrode <b>92</b> and the n-side electrode <b>80</b>. Considering that the p-side electrode <b>92</b> and the n-side electrode <b>80</b> contribute to reflecting light from the active layer <b>40</b> towards the substrate <b>10</b>, those electrodes are formed over a broad area to be able to cover the entire or nearly the entire upper part of the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>, thereby serving as a conductive reflective film. However, the p-side electrode <b>92</b> and the n-side electrode <b>80</b> are preferentially formed at a distance from each other on the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>. As such, there exists a part on the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>, which is covered neither by the p-side electrode <b>92</b> nor by the n-side electrode <b>80</b>. While the p-side electrode <b>92</b> or the n-side electrode <b>80</b> may suitably be made of a material having a good reflectance (e.g., Al, Ag or the like), it is preferential to combine the high-reflectance material (e.g., Al, Ag or the like) with Cr, Ti, Ni, Au or any alloy thereof for obtaining a stable electrical contact. The p-side electrode <b>92</b> and the n-side electrode <b>80</b> serve to supply current to the p-side finger electrode <b>93</b> and the n-side finger electrode <b>82</b>; to connect the semiconductor light emitting device with external equipment; and to reflect the light from the active layer <b>40</b> and/or dissipate the heat, by occupying a broad area. Therefore, forming both the p-side electrode <b>92</b> and the n-side electrode <b>81</b> on the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> makes it possible to minimize the height difference between the p-side electrode <b>92</b> and the n-side electrode <b>80</b>, and is advantageous when the semiconductor light emitting device according to the present disclosure is bonded to a mount (e.g., a sub-mount, a package or a COB). This advantage becomes more apparent especially when the eutectic bonding method is applied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0163">As the p-side electrode <b>92</b> and the n-side electrode <b>80</b> formed occupy a greater portion on the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>, both the p-side finger electrode <b>93</b> and the n-side finger electrode <b>81</b> are placed below the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>. Here, the p-side finger electrode <b>93</b> is long stretched down by passing through the bottom of the n-side electrode <b>80</b> placed directly on the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>, and the n-side finger electrode <b>81</b> is long stretched down by passing through the bottom of the p-side electrode <b>92</b> placed directly on the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>. The non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> present between the p-side electrode <b>92</b> and the n-side electrode <b>80</b>, and between the p-side finger electrode <b>93</b> and the n-side finger electrode <b>81</b> prevents a short between the electrodes <b>92</b>, <b>80</b> and between the finger electrodes <b>93</b>, <b>81</b>. Further, by introducing the p-side finger electrode <b>93</b> and the n-side finger electrode <b>81</b> as described above into the formation of a flip-chip, it becomes possible to supply current to the semiconductor layer areas of interest, without restriction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0164">In general, the p-side electrode <b>92</b>, the n-side electrode <b>80</b>, the p-side finger electrode <b>93</b> and the n-side finger electrode <b>81</b> are made of multiple metal layers. In case of the p-side finger electrode <b>93</b>, the bottom layer thereof should have a high bonding strength with the light transmitting conductive film <b>60</b>. To this end, a material such as Cr or Ti is typically used, but other materials such as Ni, Ti or TiW can also be used as there are no particular limitations regarding this matter. A person skilled in the art should understand that Al or Ag having a high reflectance can also be employed for the p-side finger electrode <b>93</b> and the n-side finger electrode <b>81</b>. In case of the p-side electrode <b>92</b> and the n-side electrode <b>80</b>, Au is used for their top layers for wire bonding or for the connection with an external electrode. Meanwhile, in order to reduce the amount of Au used and to offset a relatively low hardness of Au, other material such as Ni, Ti, TiW or W can be employed between the bottom layer and the top layer, depending on the specifications required. Also, when a high reflectance is required, Al or Ag can be employed. In this disclosure, Au could be considered for use as the top layer since the p-side finger electrode <b>93</b> and the n-side finger electrode <b>81</b> need to be electrically connected to the electrical connections <b>94</b>, <b>82</b>. However, the inventors found out that it is not appropriate to use Au as the top layer for the p-side finger electrode <b>93</b> and the n-side finger electrode <b>81</b>, because the Au gets easily peeled off due to a weak bonding strength between the Au and the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> at the time of deposition of the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> onto the Au top layer. To resolve this problem, other material such as Ni, Ti, W, TiW, Cr, Pd or Mo was adopted in place of Au to form the top layer of the finger electrodes. In this way, the bonding strength between the top layer with the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> to be deposited on the top layer is retained and the reliability can thus be improved. Further, one of those metals mentioned above is fully capable of functioning as a diffusion barrier while forming an opening in the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>, for the electrical connection <b>94</b>, which can be helpful for ensuring the security of the subsequent processes and the electrical connects <b>94</b>, <b>82</b>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0167" num="0166">As can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, in a semiconductor light emitting device <b>2</b> according to the present disclosure, a non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> further includes, in addition to a dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>and a DBR <b>91</b> <i>a</i>, a clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>to be formed on the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a</i>. Although a large portion of light generated in the active layer <b>40</b> is reflected by the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>and the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>towards an n-side semiconductor layer <b>30</b>, part of the light is trapped inside the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>and the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>as they also have a certain thickness, or emitted through the lateral faces of the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>and the DBR <b>91</b> <i>b</i>. The inventors tried to analyze the relationships among the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b</i>, the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>and the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f</i>, from the perspective of an optical waveguide. The optical waveguide is a structure that encompasses the propagation part of light by a material having a lower refractive index than the refractive index of the light propagation part and guides the light utilizing total internal reflection. In this regard, if the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>is taken as the propagation part, the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>and the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>can be considered as part of the structure that encompasses the propagation part. When the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>is made of SiO<sub>2</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub>, with SiO<sub>2 </sub>having a refractive index of 1.46 and TiO<sub>2 </sub>having a refractive index of 2.4, an effective refractive index (which means an equivalent refractive index of light that can travel in a waveguide that is made of materials having different refractive indices, and has a value between 1.46 and 2.4) of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>is higher than the refractive index of the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>made of SiO<sub>2</sub>. The clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>is also made of a material having a lower effective refractive index than the refractive index of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a</i>. Preferentially, the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>has a thickness which desirably ranges from λ/4n to 3.0 μm, in which λ denotes a wavelength of the light generated in the active layer <b>40</b>, and n denotes a refractive index of a material constituting the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f</i>. By way of example, the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>can be formed of SiO<sub>2</sub>, a dielectric having a refractive index of 1.46. When λ is 450 nm (4500 Å), the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>can be formed in a thickness of 771 Å (4500/4×1.46=771 Å) or more. Considering that the top layer of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>made of multiple pairs of SiO<sub>2</sub>/TiO<sub>2 </sub>can be made of a SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer having a thickness of λ/4n, it is desirable that the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>is thicker than λ/4n to be distinguished from the top layer of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>that is placed below the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f</i>. Although it is not desirable for the top layer of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>to be too thick (e.g., 3 μm or more), imposing a burden on the subsequent perforation process and only increasing the material cost without contributing to the improvement of the efficiency, it is not impossible, depending on the case, to make the top layer as thick as 3.0 μm or more. When the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>comes into direct contact with the p-side electrode <b>92</b> and the n-side electrode <b>80</b>, part of the light travelling through the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>might be affected by the p-side electrode <b>92</b> and the n-side electrode <b>80</b> and then absorbed. However, inserting the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>having a lower refractive index than the refractive index of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>between the p- and n-side electrodes (<b>92</b>, <b>80</b>) and the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>can minimize the partial absorption of the light traveling through the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>by the p-side electrode <b>92</b> and the n-side electrode <b>80</b>, thereby increasing the efficiency of light absorption. Accordingly, the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>should generally have at least a thickness corresponding to the wavelength of light to achieve the effect described above, and therefore it preferentially has a thickness of at least λ/4n. Meanwhile, if there is a big difference between the refractive index of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>and the refractive index of the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f</i>, the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>may restrict light more strongly such that a thinner clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>could be used to avoid that. However, if the difference between the refractive indices is small, the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>is needed to be sufficiently thick to obtain the effect described above. Thus, the thickness of the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>is determined with full consideration of a difference between the refractive index of a material constituting the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>and the effective refractive index of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a</i>. For instance, suppose that the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>is made of SiO<sub>2</sub>, and the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>is made of SiO<sub>2</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub>. Then a suitable thickness for the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>will be at least 0.3 μm to be distinguished from the top layer of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>made of SiO<sub>2</sub>. On the other hand, the upper limit of the thickness of the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>is preferentially between 1 μm and 3 μm, not to impose any burden on the subsequent perforation process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0167">The clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>is not particularly limited as long as its refractive index is lower than the effective refractive index of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a</i>, and can also be made of a metal oxide such as Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, a dielectric film such as SiO<sub>2 </sub>or SiON, or other material such as MaF or CaF. If a difference in the refractive indices is small, the clad film should be made thicker to obtain the desired effect. Also, in case of using SiO<sub>2 </sub>for the clad film, it is desirable to use SiO<sub>2 </sub>having a refractive index lower than 1.46 to be able to increase the efficiency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0169" num="0168">Optionally, the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>may be omitted. Also, although not desirable from the perspective of an optical waveguide, there is no reason to exclude the configuration composed of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>and the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f</i>, when the overall technical idea of this disclosure is taken into consideration. Alternatively, a TiO<sub>2 </sub>dielectric film may be used in place of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a</i>. Further, as an alternative, the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>may be omitted if the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>includes a SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer on the top thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0170" num="0169">The non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>, which is composed of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>having a high effective reflectance, and the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>and the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f</i>, each having a low reflectance, disposed on the top and bottom of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a</i>, respectively, serves as an optical waveguide, and preferentially has a combined thickness of 3 to 8 μm. Also, the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> preferentially has a slant face <b>91</b> <i>m </i>at the corner. This slant face <b>91</b> <i>m </i>can be formed, for example, by a dry etching process. Among light rays incident on the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> that serves as an optical waveguide, the light rays that are incident on the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> at right angles or almost at right angles are well reflected towards the substrate <b>10</b>, while some light rays including those that are incident on the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> at an oblique angle are not reflected towards the substrate <b>10</b>, but can be trapped inside the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>that serves as a propagation part and then propagated to the lateral face. As such, the light rays propagated to the lateral surface of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>are either emitted to the outside from the slant face <b>91</b> <i>m </i>at the corner of the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>, or reflected towards the substrate <b>10</b>. That is to say, the slant face <b>91</b> <i>m </i>at the corner of the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> serves as a corner reflector, and contributes to the improved luminance of the semiconductor light emitting device. The slant face <b>91</b> <i>m </i>is suitably at an angle ranging from 50 to 70 degrees, to facilitate the light reflection towards the substrate <b>10</b>. The slant face <b>91</b> <i>m </i>can easily be formed by wet etching, dry etching, or both.</div>

For one's information, those semiconductor light emitting devices <b>3</b>, shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> for explaining the fabrication process, are in a state where none of the p-side electrode <b>92</b>, n-side electrode <b>80</b> and bonding pad <b>97</b> is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0172" num="0171">Usually a semiconductor light emitting device is first prepared in a wafer form including a multitude of semiconductor light emitting devices, and then split into separate semiconductor light emitting devices by cutting, such as breaking, sawing, or scribing-and-breaking. In the scribing-and-breaking operation, the scribing process employs a laser and can be performed by focusing the laser onto the substrate of the semiconductor light emitting device, in which the substrate has a surface and an interior. In this scribing process employing the laser, the semiconductor light emitting device <b>3</b> is preliminarily cut along the boundary G of the rim of the semiconductor light device <b>3</b>, i.e., along the boundary G between the semiconductor light emitting device <b>3</b> and another neighboring semiconductor light emitting device <b>3</b>. These preliminarily cut semiconductor light emitting device is completely split into separate semiconductor light emitting devices through the breaking process that is performed following the scribing process. The breaking process is performed by applying an external force along the boundary G between the semiconductor light emitting device <b>3</b> and another neighboring semiconductor light emitting device <b>3</b>, for example, in the direction of the substrate <b>10</b> indicated by an arrow F in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, or in the opposite direction thereof. In this breaking process, the substrate <b>10</b> and the semiconductor layers <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>, which are crystalline, can be cut precisely along the boundary G; while the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> on the p-type semiconductor layer <b>50</b>, which is amorphous, cannot be cut precisely along the boundary G, and cracks are likely to occur in the areas around the rim of the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>, causing a damage thereto. The damage to the areas around the rim of the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> leads to poor yields due to those appearance defects. Preferentially, during the manufacture of a semiconductor light emitting device, a plurality of semiconductor light emitting devices is prepared in a wafer form, and then a certain area H of the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> around the boundary G between a semiconductor light emitting device and another neighboring semiconductor light emitting device is eliminated, prior to the scribing and braking processes using a laser for splitting the semiconductor light emitting device of interest into separate ones. The certain area H of the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> to be eliminated along the boundary G of the semiconductor light emitting device <b>3</b> corresponds to a rim area of the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>, if taken from the viewpoint of the semiconductor light emitting device. The elimination of a certain area H of the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> around the boundary G can also indicate that the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> present in one semiconductor light emitting device, and the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> of another neighboring semiconductor light emitting device are spaced apart from each other, before the semiconductor light emitting device is split into individual ones. With a portion of the area of the rim of the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> being eliminated, even if the subsequent scribing and breaking processes may be performed using a laser, the appearance defect caused by the damaged rim of the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> of each semiconductor light emitting device can be avoided, thereby increasing yields. The elimination of a certain area H of the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> can be carried out by dry etching, and it should be performed prior to the breaking process in the overall semiconductor fabrication process. However, while forming an opening that passes through the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> to obtain electrical connections <b>94</b>, <b>82</b>, it is preferential to form those electrical contacts together with the openings. Although the slant face <b>91</b> <i>m </i>serving as a corner reflector can be obtained by a separate etching process, those slant faces can be formed simultaneously in a process of eliminating the rim area of the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> to avoid damage, by etching the rim part of the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> of an individual semiconductor light emitting device into a slant face <b>91</b> <i>m. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0173" num="0172">As can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, a bonding pad <b>97</b> can be present on the p-side electrode <b>92</b> and on the n-side electrode <b>80</b>, as a part of each of the p-side electrode <b>92</b> and the n-side electrode <b>80</b>. The top face of the bonding pad <b>97</b> on the p-side electrode <b>92</b> has the same height as the top face of the bonding pad <b>97</b> on the n-side electrode <b>80</b>. That is to say, the top face of the bonding pad <b>97</b> on the p-side electrode <b>92</b> and the top face of the bonding pad on the n-side electrode <b>80</b> are on the same plane. When a semiconductor light emitting device is coupled with external equipment by, for example, the eutectic bonding method, those bonding pads <b>97</b> allow the p-side electrode <b>92</b> and the n-side electrode <b>80</b> to have an equal final height to thus prevent any tilting on the mount, provide a broad, flat coupling face to obtain excellent bonding strength, and dissipates the heat from the inside of the semiconductor light emitting device to the outside. A plurality of bonding pads <b>97</b> can be present on the p-side electrode <b>92</b> and on the n-side electrode <b>80</b>, respectively, provided that the bonding pads <b>97</b> are preferentially formed on the positions where the n-side finger electrode <b>81</b> and the p-side finger electrode <b>93</b> are not overlapped, i.e., in-between the n-side finger electrode <b>81</b> and the p-side finger electrode <b>93</b>. In other words, the bonding pads <b>97</b> are formed on the areas, except on a part of the p-side finger electrode <b>93</b> corresponding to the most protruded portion and a part of the n-side finger electrode <b>81</b> corresponding to the lower most recessed portion. In addition, the bonding pad <b>97</b> can have a dual layer structure including an underlying spacer layer <b>97</b> <i>a </i>and a bonding layer <b>97</b> <i>b </i>overlying the spacer layer <b>97</b> <i>a</i>, and has a combined thickness of 5 to 6 μm, for example. In one example, the spacer layer <b>97</b> <i>a </i>may be made of a metal layer including Ni, Cu and a combination thereof, and the bonding layer <b>97</b> <i>b </i>may be composed of a eutectic bonding layer including a Ni/Sn, Ag/Sn/Cu, Ag/Sn, Cu/Sn or Au/Sn combination such that it has a thickness of about several μm. The spacer layer <b>97</b> <i>a </i>can serve as a diffusion barrier as well as wetting layer for a solder used in the eutectic bonding, and reduces the cost burden as compared with a case where the bonding pad <b>97</b> is entirely formed of a eutectic bonding layer <b>97</b> <i>b </i>containing expensive Au. To match the final height of the bonding layer during bonding (e.g., eutectic bonding), the bonding pad <b>97</b> is preferentially formed to be taller than the most protruded part of the p- and n-side electrodes <b>92</b>, <b>80</b>, namely, the height of the upper part of the p-side finger electrode, by 1 to 3 μm. Accordingly, during the bonding operation, excellent bonding results are obtained between the semiconductor light emitting device and the mount, and heat dissipation of the semiconductor light emitting device is facilitated. Here, the spacer layer <b>97</b> <i>a </i>and the bonding layer <b>97</b> <i>b </i>can be formed by various methods, such as plating, E-beam evaporation, thermal evaporation or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0174" num="0173">Referring back to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, all areas of the n-type semiconductor layer <b>30</b>, except the n-side contact area <b>31</b>, is preferentially covered with the active layer <b>40</b> and the p-type semiconductor layer <b>50</b>. That is to say, for the semiconductor light emitting device <b>100</b>, the target etching area is limited to the n-side contact area <b>31</b>, and there is no other area including the edges that are to be etched. Those lateral faces around the semiconductor light emitting device <b>100</b> are all cut faces obtained by the scribing-and-braking process or the like. As such, the area of the active layer <b>40</b> generating light increases and the light extraction efficiency is thus improved. Moreover, a minimal number step faces are produced from the etching process; namely, those step faces are limited to the exposed surface of the active layer <b>40</b> that connects the top face of the p-type semiconductor layer <b>50</b> with the top face of the n-side contact area <b>31</b>, and the exposed surface of the p-type semiconductor layer <b>50</b>. These exposed lateral faces of the active layer <b>40</b> and the p-type semiconductor layer <b>50</b> are the ones that are difficult, in particular, to deposit the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>constituting the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> in the formation of the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>. Consequently, the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>on the exposed lateral faces of the active layer <b>40</b> and the p-type semiconductor layer <b>50</b> may have a relatively lower reflection efficiency. By minimizing the exposed lateral faces of the active layer <b>40</b> and the p-type semiconductor layer <b>50</b>, it is possible to reduce areas having a low reflection efficiency in the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>to a minimum, thereby increasing the overall reflection efficiency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0175" num="0174"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is a schematic view illustrating a still further exemplary embodiment of a semiconductor light emitting device according to the present disclosure, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line A-A′ in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. The first feature of this embodiment is that the finger electrodes <b>93</b> above the p-type semiconductor layer <b>50</b> are isolated from each other, and connected to each other by an electrode <b>92</b> after going through the respective electrical connections <b>94</b>. Here, the electrode <b>92</b> serves to supply current to the finger electrodes <b>93</b>, to reflect light, to emit heat and/or to connect the device to the outside. Although it would be most desirable if the finger electrodes <b>93</b> are all isolated from one another, two or more finger electrodes <b>93</b> could be paired up and a branch portion that interconnects the finger electrodes <b>93</b> may be removed such that the overall height on top of the device is less irregular. The second feature of this embodiment is that the finger electrodes <b>93</b> are stretched along the direction of one lateral face C of the device. For example, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, the finger electrode <b>93</b> is extended from the electrode <b>92</b> towards the electrode <b>80</b>. With these stretched finger electrodes <b>93</b>, the device can be placed on a mount (e.g., a sub-mount, a package, or a COB (Chip on Board)) in an upside-down position without leaning. In this regard, it is preferential to form the finger electrodes <b>93</b> as long as possible. According to this embodiment, the finger electrodes <b>93</b> are arrayed below a non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>, they may be stretched passing the electrode <b>80</b>. The third feature of this embodiment is that the electrode <b>80</b> overlies the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>. The electrode <b>80</b> is connected with finger electrodes <b>81</b> through an electrical connection <b>82</b>. The electrode <b>80</b> has the same functions as the electrode <b>92</b>. With this configuration, the region where the electrode <b>80</b> is located is raised up as compared with the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and thus the height difference between the electrode <b>92</b> and the electrode <b>80</b> is reduced when the device was coupled with the mount, resulting in more favorable coupling. This effect is magnified when eutectic bonding is used. The fourth feature of this embodiment is that the finger electrodes <b>81</b> can be arranged in the same manner as the finger electrodes <b>93</b>. The fifth feature of this embodiment is that an auxiliary heat-emission pad <b>97</b> is provided. The auxiliary heat-emission pad <b>97</b> serves to discharge heat from the inside of the device to the outside and/or to reflect light. Moreover, the auxiliary heat-emission pad <b>97</b> is electrically isolated from the electrode <b>92</b> and/or the electrode <b>80</b>, and thus it prevents an electrical contact between the electrode <b>92</b> and the electrode <b>80</b>. The auxiliary heat-emission pad <b>93</b> might as well be used for bonding. In particular, when the auxiliary heat-emission pad <b>93</b> is electrically isolated from both the electrode <b>92</b> and the electrode <b>80</b>, even if one of the electrode <b>92</b> and the electrode <b>80</b> might accidently have an electrical contact with the auxiliary heat-emission pad <b>93</b>, this would not cause any problem to the overall electrical operation of the device. A person skilled in the art should understand that it is not mandatory for this embodiment to have all five features described above.</div>

When a semiconductor light emitting device is formed according to the present disclosure, a structure like the finger electrode <b>93</b> or the finger electrode <b>81</b> is needed, and a process for forming an electrical connection <b>94</b> or an electrical connection <b>82</b> should be carried out even after the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> had been formed. Now that the semiconductor light emitting device as a finished product can still experience current leakage and suffer from degraded reliability affected by the SiO<sub>2 </sub>dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>c</i>, one should be very careful in forming the SiO<sub>2 </sub>dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>c</i>. To this end, first of all, the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>c </i>should be made thicker than those subsequent dielectric films <b>91</b> <i>d </i>and <b>91</b> <i>e</i>. Secondly, it is necessary to form the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>c </i>by a method that is particularly suitable for ensuring the reliability of the device. For instance, CVD, in particular (preferentially) PECVD may be used for obtaining the SiO<sub>2 </sub>dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>c</i>, and PVD, in particular (preferentially) E-beam evaporation, sputtering or thermal evaporation may be used for obtaining the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>d</i>/dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>e </i>made of a stack of alternating TiO<sub>2</sub>/SiO<sub>2 </sub>DBR, thereby ensuring the reliability of the resulting semiconductor light emitting device according to the present disclosure and ensuring the dielectric films' function as the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>. This is because CVD is more advantageous than PVD (in particular, E-beam evaporation) for covering steps in a mesa etched region.</div>

However, considering that a semiconductor light emitting device is manufactured using Au for top layers of the n-side and p-side electrodes <b>80</b>, <b>90</b>, Au or Ag may optionally be used in consideration of conductivity, with Au being usually chosen over oxidation-sensitive Ag.

It turned out that the bonding strength keeps increasing until Au thickness reaches 500 Å, and then it gets decreased when Au thickness exceeds this level. Therefore, the bonding strength of the soldering layers which are made of Sn only or contain Sn falls between Ref and the bonding strength of 100 Å Au-overlaid Sn soldering layer.

If one prepares the top layer of an electrode of a semiconductor light emitting device using Sn and then tries to solder it on site where it is attached the an external electrode <b>1000</b>, <b>2000</b>, impurities produced from oxidation for example may be present on Sn, causing problems in soldering and electrical conductivity. To resolve this, one may complete the manufacture of a semiconductor light emitting device first, coat a corresponding metal such as Sn or Au with a solder material while bringing the completely manufactured device into contact with the external electrode <b>1000</b>, <b>2000</b>, and solder them immediately on the spot. As an alternative way, as can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33, 34, 35</figref>, a thin anti-oxidation layer <b>80</b> <i>b</i>, <b>92</b> <i>b </i>may be applied onto the Sn-based soldering layer <b>80</b> <i>a</i>, <b>92</b> <i>a</i>, and thereby preventing oxidation of Sn.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0239" num="0238">Considering that the top layer of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>made of multiple pairs of SiO<sub>2</sub>/TiO<sub>2 </sub>can be composed of a SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer having a thickness of λ/4n, it is desirable that the clad film <b>91</b> <i>c </i>is thicker than λ/4n to be distinguished from the top layer of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>that is underlaid beneath the clad film <b>91</b> <i>c</i>. However, it is not desirable for the top layer of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>to be too thick (e.g., 3 μm or more) because this would impose a burden on the subsequent processes for forming a plurality of first semiconductor layer-side openings <b>63</b> and a plurality of second semiconductor layer-side openings <b>65</b> and only increase the material cost without contributing to the improvement of the efficiency. Therefore, an appropriate upper limit of the thickness of the clad film <b>91</b> <i>c </i>would be between 1 μm and 3 μm, so as to relieve the burden on the subsequent processes for forming the plurality of first semiconductor layer-side openings <b>63</b> and the plurality of second semiconductor layer-side openings <b>65</b>. But still, it is not totally prohibited to make the top layer as thick as 3.0 μm or more.</div>

As described above, by introducing the clad film <b>91</b> <i>c </i>and the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>having a lower refractive index than the refractive index of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a</i>, it becomes possible to significantly reduce an amount of light being absorbed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0241" num="0240">Optionally, the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>may be omitted. Also, although not desirable in terms of an optical waveguide, there is no reason to exclude the configuration composed of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>and the clad film <b>91</b> <i>c</i>, when the overall technical idea of this disclosure is taken into consideration. Alternatively, a TiO<sub>2 </sub>dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>may also be used in place of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a</i>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0247" num="0246">The p-side finger electrode <b>88</b> may have multiple layers, as described above. For example, the p-side finger electrode <b>88</b> includes a contact layer <b>88</b> <i>a </i>electrically connected with the second semiconductor layer <b>50</b>, an anti-oxidation layer <b>88</b> <i>d </i>formed on the contact layer <b>88</b> <i>a</i>, and an anti-etching layer <b>88</b> <i>e </i>formed on the anti-oxidation layer <b>88</b> <i>d</i>. In this embodiment, the p-side finger electrode <b>88</b> includes a contact layer <b>88</b> <i>a</i>, a reflective layer <b>88</b> <i>b</i>, a diffusion barrier layer <b>88</b> <i>c</i>, an anti-oxidation layer <b>88</b> <i>d </i>and an anti-etching layer <b>88</b> <i>e</i>, which are formed sequentially on the current spreading conductive film <b>60</b>. The n-side ohmic contact pad <b>79</b> and the p-side ohmic contact pad <b>89</b> can also have the same layer structure as the p-side finger electrode <b>88</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0248" num="0247">The contact layer <b>88</b> <i>a </i>is preferentially made of a material establishing a satisfactory electrical contact with the current spreading conductive film <b>60</b>. A material such as Cr or Ti is typically used for the contact layer <b>88</b> <i>a</i>. Other materials such as Ni, TiW or the like, or highly reflective materials such as Al, Ag or the like may also be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0249" num="0248">The reflective layer <b>88</b> <i>b </i>may be made of a highly reflective metal (e.g. Ag, Al or a combination thereof). The reflective layer <b>88</b> <i>b </i>reflects light generated in the active layer <b>40</b> towards the plurality of semiconductor layers <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>. The reflective layer <b>88</b> <i>b </i>may be omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0250" num="0249">The diffusion barrier layer <b>88</b> <i>c </i>prevents the material of the reflective layer <b>88</b> <i>b </i>or the material of the anti-oxidation layer <b>88</b> <i>d </i>from diffusing into other layers. The diffusion barrier layer <b>88</b> <i>c </i>may be made of at least one selected from Ti, Ni, Cr, W, TiW or the like. If the diffusion barrier layer <b>88</b> <i>c </i>needs to be highly reflective, Al, Ag or the like may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0251" num="0250">The anti-oxidation layer <b>88</b> <i>d </i>may be made of Au, Pt or the like, and any material that would not be oxidized easily when exposed to the outside and brought into contact with oxygen is also useful. Au, a highly electrically conductive material, is typically used for the anti-oxidation layer <b>88</b> <i>d. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0252" num="0251">The anti-etching layer <b>88</b> <i>e </i>is a layer exposed during dry etching for forming the second semiconductor layer-side opening <b>65</b>. In this embodiment, the anti-etching layer <b>88</b> <i>e </i>is the top layer of the p-side finger electrode <b>88</b>. When the anti-etching layer <b>88</b> <i>e </i>is made of Au, it shows weak bonding strength towards the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>, and part of Au may be damaged or ruined during etching. Hence, the anti-etching layer <b>88</b> <i>e </i>is preferentially made of a material such as Ni, W, TiW, Cr, Pd, Mo or the like, instead of Au, in order to retain the bonding strength towards the non-conductive reflective layer <b>91</b>, thus improving reliability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0253" num="0252">During dry etching, the anti-etching layer <b>88</b> <i>e </i>protects the p-side finger electrodes <b>88</b>, and in particular it prevents damages on the anti-oxidation layer <b>88</b> <i>d</i>. During dry etching, halogen gases containing an F group (e.g. CF<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>8</sub>, SF<sub>6 </sub>or the like) may be used as an etching gas. To avoid any damage on the anti-oxidation layer <b>88</b> <i>d </i>during dry etching, the anti-etching layer <b>88</b> <i>e </i>is preferentially made of a material having high etching selectivity. If the anti-etching layer <b>88</b> <i>e </i>has poor etching selectivity, the anti-oxidation layer <b>88</b> <i>e </i>may be damaged or ruined during dry etching. Therefore, from the perspective of etching selectivity, Cr or Ni is a suitable choice of materials for the anti-etching layer <b>88</b> <i>e</i>. Ni or Cr does not or only slightly reacts with the etching gas during dry etching, thereby remaining in a non-etched condition, which enables the anti-etching layer to protect the p-side finger electrode <b>88</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0254" num="0253">Meanwhile, the etching gas used in dry etching for forming the second semiconductor layer-side openings <b>65</b> may produce a material such as an insulation material or impurities on the top layer of the p-side finger electrode <b>88</b>. For example, the material may be produced by a reaction between the halogen etching gas containing an F group and the top layer metal of the p-side finger electrode <b>88</b>. For instance, Ni, W, TiW, Cr, Pd, Mo and the like, which are the materials of the anti-etching layer <b>88</b> <i>e</i>, may at least partly react with the etching gas used in dry etching, and produce the material (e.g. NiF). However, the material thus produced can cause deterioration of the electrical properties (e.g. an increased operating voltage) of the semiconductor light emitting device. Another part of Ni, W, TiW, Cr, Pd, Mo and the like, which are the materials of the anti-etching layer <b>88</b> <i>e</i>, may react with the etching gas but will not produce the material at all or produce a very small amount of the material. It is desirable to suppress the production of the material, or allow only a very small amount to be produced. From this perspective, Cr is preferred to Ni as a material for the anti-etching layer <b>88</b> <i>e. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0255" num="0254">In this embodiment, due to the material being produced, the top layer of the p-side finger electrode <b>88</b>, i.e. a part of the anti-etching layer <b>88</b> <i>e </i>in correspondence to the second semiconductor layer-side opening <b>65</b> is subjected to wet etching (a second etching process) and removed such that, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>, a part of the anti-oxidation layer <b>88</b> <i>d </i>in correspondence to the second semiconductor layer-side opening <b>65</b> is exposed. As such, the material as well as the anti-etching layer <b>88</b> <i>e </i>are etched and removed. With the material having been removed, the p-side finger electrode <b>93</b> and the second electrical connection <b>81</b> may have a better electrical contact between them, and deterioration of the electrical properties of the semiconductor light emitting device is avoided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0256" num="0255">Alternatively, the first semiconductor layer-side openings <b>63</b> and the second semiconductor layer-side openings <b>65</b> may be formed by wet etching.

Similar to dry etching mentioned above, the anti-etching layer <b>88</b> <i>e </i>preferentially has high etching selectively for protecting the anti-oxidation layer <b>88</b> <i>d</i>. From this perspective, Cr is a suitable material for the anti-etching layer <b>88</b> <i>e</i>. Then a part of the anti-etching layer <b>88</b> <i>e </i>in correspondence to the second semiconductor layer-side opening <b>65</b> can be removed by another subsequent wet etching.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0320" num="0319">A first opening <b>5</b> exposing a part of the p-side finger electrode <b>193</b> is formed, passing through the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b</i>, the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>and the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f</i>. A combined thickness of the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b</i>, the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>and the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>may be not more than 10 μm and not less than 0.5 μm. To form the first opening (<b>5</b>) passing through the film of a thickness in the above range, a process such as dry etching or wet etching may be carried out. For example, when the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> undergoes photolithographic processing followed by thermal processing, a resulting photoresist pattern at the location in correspondence to an opening to be formed is slanted at an angle. Then dry etching (e.g. ICP, RIE, RIBE, CAIBE or the like) is carried out using the photoresist pattern as a mask, and the first opening <b>5</b> having a slant face as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</figref> is obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0321" num="0320">The first opening <b>5</b> has an increasing width as it gets farther away from the plurality of semiconductor layers <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0322" num="0321">After that, a p-side electrode <b>92</b> is formed on the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f</i>, and electrically connected to the p-side finger electrode <b>93</b> by an electrical connection <b>94</b> formed in the first opening <b>5</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0323" num="0322">A large portion of the light generated in the active layer <b>40</b> is reflected towards the n-type semiconductor layer <b>30</b> by the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>and the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a</i>. However, part of the light is trapped inside the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>and the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>as they also have a certain thickness, or emitted through the lateral faces of the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>and the DBR <b>91</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0324" num="0323">The relationships among the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b</i>, the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>and the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>can be explained from the perspective of an optical waveguide. The optical waveguide is a structure that encompasses the propagation part of light by a material having a lower refractive index than the refractive index of the light propagation part and guides the light utilizing total internal reflection. In this regard, if the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>is taken as the propagation part, the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>and the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>can be considered as part of the structure that encompasses the propagation part.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0325" num="0324">When the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>is made of SiO<sub>2</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub>, with SiO<sub>2 </sub>having the refractive index of 1.46 and TiO<sub>2 </sub>having the refractive index of 2.4, the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>is preferentially formed to have a higher effective refractive index than the refractive index of the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>made of SiO<sub>2</sub>. Here, the effective refractive index means an equivalent refractive index of light that can travel in a waveguide that is made of materials having different refractive indices, and has a value between 1.46 and 2.4.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0326" num="0325">The clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>can also be made of a material having a refractive index lower than the effective refractive index of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a</i>. Examples of the material may include a metallic oxide such as Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, a dielectric film such as SiO<sub>2 </sub>or SiON, or a material such as MgF, CaF or the like. Preferentially, the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>has a thickness which desirably ranges from λ/4n to 3.0 μm, in which λ denotes a wavelength of the light generated in the active layer <b>40</b>, and n denotes a refractive index of a material of the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f</i>. When λ is 450 nm (4500 Å), the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>can be formed in a thickness of 771 Å (4500/4×1.46=771 Å) or more.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0327" num="0326">Considering that the top layer of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>made of multiple pairs of SiO<sub>2</sub>/TiO<sub>2 </sub>can be composed of a SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer having a thickness of λ/4n, it is desirable that the clad film <b>91</b> <i>c </i>is thicker than λ/4n to be distinguished from the top layer of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>that is underlaid beneath the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f</i>. However, it is not desirable for the top layer of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>to be too thick (e.g., 3 μm or more) because this would impose a burden on the subsequent processes for forming a first opening <b>5</b> and only increase the material cost without contributing to the improvement of the efficiency. Therefore, an appropriate upper limit of the thickness of the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>would be between 1 μm and 3 μm, so as to relieve the burden on the subsequent processes for forming the first opening <b>5</b>. But still, it is not totally prohibited to make the top layer as thick as 3.0 μm or more.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0328" num="0327">When the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>comes into direct contact with the p-side electrode <b>92</b> and the n-side bonding pad <b>80</b>, part of the light travelling through the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>might be affected by the p-side electrode <b>92</b> and the n-side bonding pad <b>80</b> and then absorbed. However, inserting the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>and the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>having a lower refractive index than the refractive index of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>between the p-side electrode and the n-side bonding pad <b>80</b> and between the p-side electrode <b>92</b> and the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>can minimize the partial absorption of the light traveling through the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>by the p-side electrode <b>92</b> and the n-side bonding pad <b>80</b>, thereby increasing the efficiency of light absorption.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0329" num="0328">Optionally, the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>may be omitted. Also, although not desirable from the perspective of an optical waveguide, there is no reason to exclude the configuration composed of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>and the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f</i>, when the overall technical idea of this disclosure is taken into consideration. Alternatively, TiO<sub>2 </sub>dielectric film may be used in place of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a</i>. Further, as an alternative, the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>may be omitted if the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>includes a SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer on the top thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0330" num="0329">The dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b</i>, the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>and the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>serve as an optical waveguide, and they preferentially have a combined thickness of 1 to 8 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0331" num="0330">Among light rays incident on the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> that serves as an optical waveguide, the light rays that are incident on the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> at right angles or almost at right angles are well reflected towards the substrate <b>10</b>, while some light rays including those that are incident on the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> at an oblique angle are not reflected towards the substrate <b>10</b>, but can be trapped inside the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>that serves as a propagation part, and then propagated to the lateral face as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0332" num="0331">Therefore, part of the light being propagated to the lateral face of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>is guided towards the substrate <b>10</b> from the slant face <b>3</b> formed by the first opening <b>5</b>. To facilitate guiding of the light towards the substrate <b>10</b>, the slant face <b>3</b> preferentially has a slant angle <b>6</b> ranging from 10 degrees to 80 degrees, for example. If the slant angle <b>6</b> is smaller than 10 degrees or larger than 80 degrees, the advantageous effect of guiding the light toward the substrate <b>10</b> is weak; and if the slant angle is greater than or equal to 80 degrees, it can impose a burden on the formation of the slant face <b>3</b>. Therefore, a preferential angle would range from 25 degrees to 75 degrees, in order to increase the effect of guiding the light toward the substrate <b>10</b> and not to impose any burden on the formation of the first opening <b>5</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0333" num="0332">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</figref>, the light is drawn on a 2D plane, but in reality, there are lights that are reflected or guided from a 3D slant face <b>3</b> and travels back and forth from the ground at an oblique angle.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0364" num="0363">For example, when the lower electrode <b>52</b> is about 2 μm thick and the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> is about 4 μm thick, as can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71 (<i>a</i>)</figref>, the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> is slightly bumped up at the lower electrode <b>52</b> region, thereby creating a height difference between the lower electrode <b>52</b> and the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> on the outside the lower electrode. Meanwhile, the light absorption barrier film <b>41</b> may be formed to have a thickness of about 0.2 μm, and it does not have a major influence on the creation of a height difference. Next, a photoresist pattern PR is formed on the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>, and the opening <b>5</b> is formed as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71 (<i>b</i>)</figref>. Because of a height difference, the upper inlet boundary, i.e. the upper rim of the opening <b>5</b> is raised above the top face of the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> on the outside the lower electrode <b>52</b>, creating a height difference T<b>1</b>. Subsequently, the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> is subjected to a metal formation process, e.g. deposition, to form a metal layer thereon, extending across the top face of the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> and the opening <b>5</b>. This metal layer may be composed of a single layer or multiple layers of different kinds (e.g. see <b>92</b> and <b>80</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> through <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>; <b>92</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>92</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>92</b>-<b>3</b>, <b>92</b>-<b>4</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>; <b>92</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42, 6</figref>; and <b>92</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0365" num="0364">The metal layer thus formed can be sub-divided into an upper electrode <b>92</b> corresponding to a part formed on the top face of the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>, and an electrical connection <b>94</b> corresponding to a part formed in the opening <b>5</b>. For instance, the upper electrode <b>92</b> can be a eutectic bonding electrode, and in that case, the top layer of the upper electrode <b>92</b> is made of a eutectic bonding material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0366" num="0365">Alternatively, a separate upper electrode may be formed on the metal layer, coming into contact with the metal layer. In this case, the entire metal layer may be taken as the electrical connection <b>94</b>. Here, the separate upper electrode <b>92</b> may be formed in the regions excluding the upper rim of the opening <b>5</b>, or may be formed to cover the opening <b>5</b>. If this separate upper electrode is a eutectic bonding electrode, it is preferential that the separate upper electrode is not formed along the upper rim of the opening <b>5</b> to make the upper electrode flat (e.g. see <b>97</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0367" num="0366">Meanwhile, it is desirable that a plurality of openings <b>5</b> is distributed across the light emitting face of the semiconductor light emitting device, and that the electrical connection <b>94</b> formed in each of the openings <b>5</b> may be additionally provided or connected with a p-side connection electrode or an n-side connection electrode on the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>, for promoting current spreading or uniform current distribution (e.g. see <b>83</b>, <b>73</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 50</figref>; and <b>71</b>, <b>73</b>, <b>75</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref>). The p-side connection electrode or the n-side connection electrode may be unitarily formed with the electrical connection <b>94</b> in the opening <b>5</b> using the same process, or may be formed to cover the electrical connection <b>94</b> using a separate process. Further, in one embodiment, an insulating layer <b>95</b> or a passivation layer may be formed for covering the p-side connection electrode or the n-side connection electrode, and a p-side bonding pad <b>105</b> and an n-side bonding pad may be formed on the insulating layer <b>95</b> (e.g. see <b>85</b>, <b>75</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</figref>; and <b>85</b>, <b>81</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref>). In this case, the p-side connection electrode and the n-side connection electrode can be taken as the upper electrode, and the p-side bonding pad <b>105</b> and the n-side bonding pad can be taken as a separate bonding pad. Alternatively, the p-side connection electrode and the n-side connection electrode may be taken as an extension of the electrical connection <b>94</b>, and the p-side bonding pad <b>105</b> and the n-side bonding pad formed on the insulating layer <b>95</b> may be taken as the upper electrode <b>92</b>. It is necessary to ensure a sufficient spacing T<b>2</b> between the upper electrode <b>92</b> stretched along the upper rim of the opening <b>5</b> and the bonding pad <b>97</b>, by selecting a suitable thickness for the insulating layer <b>95</b>.</div>

The n-contact regions <b>63</b>, <b>64</b> are composed of an n-contact region <b>63</b> in form of islands, and an n-contact region <b>64</b> in form of a long stretched branch. Next, the light absorption barrier film <b>41</b> is formed on the second semiconductor layer <b>50</b>, in correspondence with the lower electrode <b>52</b>, <b>88</b> to be formed. The light absorption barrier film <b>41</b> may also be formed in part of the n-contact regions <b>63</b>, <b>64</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0371" num="0370"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 75</figref> is a schematic view illustrating an exemplary embodiment of a process for forming an opening, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 76</figref> is a schematic view illustrating an exemplary embodiment of a method for forming an upper rim of the opening. The non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> is formed on the current spreading conductive film <b>60</b>, and an etching process (e.g. plasma etching) is carried out to form the opening <b>63</b>, <b>65</b>. While the openings <b>63</b>, <b>65</b> in this embodiment are open upwards of the semiconductor light emitting device, as an alternative, they may be open towards the sides.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0372" num="0371">As the etching process proceeds, the opening gradually takes its form as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 75</figref> (<i>a</i>), and part of the top face of the lower electrode <b>52</b> is exposed as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 75 (<i>b</i>)</figref> (e.g. see <b>65</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>; <b>65</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref>; <b>5</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</figref>; and <b>5</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71</figref>). The height difference between the upper rim of the opening and the top face of the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> is reduced more in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 75 (<i>b</i>)</figref>, rather than in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 75 (<i>a</i>)</figref>. As the etching process proceeds further, as can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 75 (<i>c</i>)</figref>, the surroundings of the lower electrode <b>52</b> is exposed through the opening <b>65</b>, and the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> will have slant faces formed by the opening <b>65</b>. The openings <b>63</b>, <b>65</b> expose the n-side ohmic contact pad and the p-side ohmic contact pad <b>52</b>. In this embodiment, the openings <b>63</b>, <b>65</b> expose the n-contact region around the n-side ohmic contact pad, and the current spreading conductive film <b>60</b> around the p-side ohmic contact pad <b>52</b>. Also, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 75 (<i>c</i>)</figref>, preferentially, the upper rim of the opening <b>63</b>, <b>65</b> and the top face of the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> are configured to be connected and form a flat plane, such that an etch-exposed face (to be described) created during the opening <b>63</b>, <b>65</b> formation process forms the upper rim of the opening <b>63</b>, <b>65</b>, thereby reducing the height difference between the upper rim of the opening <b>63</b>, <b>65</b> and other parts of the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>. Next, the upper electrode <b>85</b> and the electrical connection <b>82</b> are formed. Optionally, a process may be added to remove materials produced on the top face of the lower electrode, prior to forming the upper electrode <b>85</b> and the electrical connection <b>82</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0373" num="0372">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 76</figref>, as a result of the etching process in this embodiment, a part of the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> in correspondence to the opening <b>63</b>, <b>65</b> as well as a raised part of the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> around the opening <b>63</b>, <b>65</b> are etched together. For this etching process, an etching mask PR may be configured to have different etching rates in the part in correspondence to the opening <b>63</b>, <b>65</b> and in the part of the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> around the opening <b>63</b>, <b>65</b>. For example, as can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 76 (<i>a</i>)</figref>, the mask in a part corresponding to the ohmic contact pad <b>52</b> is open, and different etching rates are applied to slant face regions A<b>2</b> surrounding the ohmic contact pad <b>52</b> to thereby create slant faces on the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> by the opening <b>63</b>, <b>65</b>, and again different etching rates are applied to rim regions Al surrounding the slant face regions A<b>2</b> to thereby obtain etch-exposed faces Al on the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>. These etch-exposed faces Al form the upper rim of the opening <b>63</b>, <b>64</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 76 (<i>b</i>)</figref>. This etching process may be done by a single etching process or multiple etching processes, or by a combined dry-wet etching process. As these etch-exposed faces Al form the upper rim of the opening <b>63</b>, <b>65</b>, a step or height difference T<b>1</b> between the upper rim and the top face of the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> on the outside the lower electrode <b>52</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>88</b>, <b>78</b> is reduced. For example, a height difference T<b>1</b> between the height from the top face of the current spreading conductive film <b>60</b> to the top face of the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> and the height from the top face of the current spreading conductive film <b>60</b> to the upper rim A<b>1</b> (the etch-exposed face) of the opening <b>63</b>, <b>65</b> is now significantly smaller than the height difference T<b>1</b> described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71</figref>. Preferentially, the etching process conditions may be adjusted to obtain a flat face without almost no height difference T<b>1</b>. Moreover, since sufficient spacing T<b>2</b> can now be ensured between the upper electrode <b>92</b> and the bonding pad <b>105</b> that can be formed above the upper electrode <b>92</b>, it is possible to prevent the occurrence of a possible electrical short between the upper electrode <b>92</b> and the bonding pad <b>105</b>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0375" num="0374">The upper electrode <b>75</b>, <b>85</b> is formed on the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> by deposition or plating, and electrical connection <b>81</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> is formed in the opening <b>63</b>, <b>65</b>. In the examples illustrated, the upper electrode <b>75</b>, <b>85</b> and the electrical connection <b>81</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> are unitarily formed, and the electrical connection <b>81</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> is brought into contact with the top and lateral faces of the lower electrode <b>52</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>88</b>, <b>78</b>; and with the current spreading conductive film <b>60</b> and the first semiconductor layer <b>30</b>, which are exposed through the opening <b>63</b>, <b>65</b>. In this way, the contact face between the electrical connection <b>81</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> and the lower electrode <b>52</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>88</b>, <b>78</b> is increased as compared with the electrode part illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71</figref>, and a more stable interconnection structure can be obtained among the current spreading conductive film <b>60</b>—the lower electrode <b>52</b>, <b>88</b>—the electrical connection <b>81</b>, <b>82</b>, and among the first semiconductor layer <b>30</b>—the lower electrode <b>56</b>, <b>78</b>—the electrical connection <b>71</b>, <b>72</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0376" num="0375">Further, with the opening <b>63</b>, <b>65</b> having a width greater than the width of the lower electrode <b>52</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>88</b>, <b>78</b>, the opening <b>63</b>, <b>65</b> can be subjected to a strong, sufficient etching action to make its etch-exposed face of the opening <b>63</b>, <b>65</b> into the upper rim A<b>1</b> thereof. In doing so, the height difference T<b>1</b> between the upper rim of the opening <b>63</b>, <b>65</b> and other parts of the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> is reduced to a nearly insignificant level or none, thereby being flat. As a result, the upper electrode <b>75</b> of the first electrode part and the upper electrode <b>85</b> of the second electrode part are spaced apart on the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>, with their edges facing each other, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</figref>, which is a very useful structure for an eutectic bonding electrode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0377" num="0376">Since a part of the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> corresponding to the p-side finger electrode <b>88</b> is raised upwards higher than other parts, and a part of the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> corresponding to the n-side branch electrode <b>78</b> is not in a favorable state either to be made flat, the upper electrode <b>75</b>, <b>85</b> is patterned in a manner not to cover the finger electrode <b>78</b>, <b>88</b>. For example, as can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</figref>, the upper electrode <b>75</b> (the n-side bonding pad) of the first electrode part is patterned in a manner not to cover the finger electrode <b>88</b> (the p-side finger electrode) of the second electrode part, and the upper electrode <b>85</b> (the p-side bonding pad) of the second electrode part is patterned in a manner not to cover the finger electrode <b>78</b> (the n-side finger electrode) of the first electrode part. Also, as described above, benefiting from the reduced height difference T<b>1</b> of the upper rim A<b>1</b> of the opening <b>63</b>, <b>65</b>, the upper electrode <b>75</b>, <b>85</b> can be made flat even when the upper electrode <b>75</b>, <b>85</b> is adapted to cover the opening <b>63</b>, <b>65</b>, i.e. to cover the upper rim A<b>1</b> of the opening <b>63</b>, <b>65</b>. For instance, the upper electrode <b>75</b> (the n-side bonding pad) of the first electrode part is formed in a manner to cover the island-like lower electrode <b>56</b> (the n-side ohmic contact pad) of the first electrode, and the upper electrode <b>85</b> (the n-side bonding pad) of the second electrode part is formed in a manner to cover the lower electrode <b>52</b> (the p-side ohmic contact pad) of the second electrode part.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0378" num="0377">Meanwhile, unlike the island-like ohmic contact pads, the ohmic contact pad <b>56</b>, <b>52</b> connected with the finger electrode <b>78</b>, <b>88</b> is not symmetrical due to the finger electrode <b>78</b>, <b>88</b> that is stretched to one side. Therefore, the joint portion where the finger electrode <b>78</b>, <b>88</b> and the ohmic contact pad <b>56</b>, <b>52</b> are connected can be formed in such a way that it has a height difference less than those in other parts of the upper rim A<b>1</b> of the opening <b>63</b>, <b>65</b>, and it is slightly raised upwards higher than other parts of the upper rim A<b>1</b> of the opening <b>63</b>, <b>65</b>. If the upper electrode <b>75</b>, <b>85</b> covers this joint portion between the finger electrode <b>78</b>, <b>88</b> and the ohmic contact pad <b>56</b>, <b>52</b>, it can be unfavorable for making them flat. Therefore, in these examples, the upper electrode <b>75</b>, <b>85</b> covers the ohmic contact pad <b>56</b>, <b>52</b>, but it does not cover the part of the ohmic contact pad <b>56</b>, <b>52</b> connected with the finger electrode <b>75</b>, <b>85</b>. For example, referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</figref>, an escape groove <b>87</b> is formed at the edge of the upper electrode <b>75</b>, <b>85</b>, for escaping the part of the ohmic contact pad connected with the finger electrode <b>78</b>, <b>88</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0379" num="0378">If the upper electrode <b>75</b>, <b>85</b> is so thick that the raised or embossed part <b>99</b> of the upper rim A<b>1</b> of the opening <b>63</b>, <b>65</b> due to the finger electrode <b>78</b>, <b>88</b> may be ignored, things like an exposing groove <b>97</b> would not be required. However, as the upper electrode <b>75</b>, <b>85</b> is likely to have a thickness limit and includes an uneven part due to the embossed part <b>99</b>, an electrical short with a structure that can be formed on the upper electrode <b>75</b>, <b>85</b>, e.g. a separate bonding pad on the insulating layer (see <b>105</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 80</figref>) may occur, and further a defect may arise therefrom. Accordingly, it is preferential to have patterning (e.g. <b>87</b>) without the embossed part <b>99</b>, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77 (<i>b</i>)</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 78 (<i>b</i>)</figref>. On the other hand, if the raised or embossed part is protruded upwards more than the upper electrode <b>75</b>, <b>85</b> as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77 (<i>c</i>)</figref>, a separate bonding pad <b>97</b> may be applied onto the upper electrode <b>75</b>, <b>85</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0380" num="0379">The present invention also includes an etching method for flattening a more raised part corresponding to the finger electrode <b>78</b>, <b>88</b> of the upper rim A<b>1</b> of the opening <b>64</b>, <b>65</b>, or making the part to a similar level with other parts, by adjusting a mask pattern and etching conditions.</div>

Preferentially, a sufficient area of the lower electrode <b>52</b> (the ohmic contact pad) comes into contact with the electrical connection <b>82</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0408" num="0407">For example, the semiconductor light emitting device according to the comparative example suggested in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 83 (<i>a</i>)</figref> and the exemplary embodiment of a semiconductor light emitting device according to the present disclosure suggested in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 83 (<i>b</i>)</figref> have the same width (D<b>1</b>) and height (D<b>2</b>), and the same spacing D<b>3</b> between the edge <b>77</b> of the first electrode and the edge <b>87</b> of the second electrode. Here, the plurality of semiconductor layers <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>50</b> as seen in a top plan view has a quadrangular shape, and thus the diagonal length (e.g. C<b>1</b>-C<b>2</b> direction) is longer than the edge <b>31</b> at one side of the plurality of semiconductor layers <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>. As such, the area A<b>2</b> between the edge <b>77</b> of the first electrode and the edge <b>87</b> of the second electrode is larger than the area A<b>1</b>. As a result, the light absorption loss by the first electrode <b>75</b> and the second electrode <b>85</b> is reduced more than the semiconductor light emitting device according to the comparative example suggested in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 83 (<i>a</i>)</figref>, and the brightness is therefore improved. Given that the devices have the same width D<b>1</b>, the height D<b>2</b> and the spacing D<b>3</b>, the areas of the first and second electrodes <b>75</b>, <b>85</b> are slightly smaller in the semiconductor light emitting device suggested in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 83 (<i>b</i>)</figref> than those in the comparative example suggested in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 83 (<i>a</i>)</figref>. Yet, considering that major heat emission is done by the metallic electrical connections <b>71</b>, <b>72</b>, <b>81</b>, <b>82</b> formed in the openings, the difference between two devices in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 83 (<i>a</i>)</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 83 (<i>b</i>)</figref> is rather insignificant in terms of heat emission.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0409" num="0408">Meanwhile, in order to promote current spreading or uniform current density, it is preferential to array finger electrodes symmetrically with respect to the corner.

However, if seen with respect to the corner C<b>2</b>, the p-side finger electrode <b>88</b> is not located at the center, but leaned towards one side. On the other hand, in the semiconductor light emitting device according to the disclosure suggested in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 83 (<i>b</i>)</figref>, the p-side finger electrode <b>88</b> and the p-side ohmic contact pad <b>52</b> are symmetrically arranged at the center of the corner C<b>3</b>, C<b>4</b> in the second diagonal direction. This finger electrode being stretched in the diagonal direction is closely related to the fact that the edge <b>77</b> of the first electrode and the edge <b>87</b> of the second electrode are obliquely formed as described above. In conclusion, it is found that the edge <b>77</b> of the first electrode and the edge <b>87</b> of the second electrode formed obliquely can be advantageous for improving uniformity of the current density in relation to the finger electrode array.</div>

Each of the p-side finger electrode <b>88</b>, the p-side ohmic contact pad <b>52</b>, the n-side finger electrode <b>78</b> and the n-side ohmic contact pad <b>56</b> may have a multilayered structure. This will be explained further later.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0415" num="0414">Subsequently, a non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> is formed. For example, a dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>covering the current spreading conductive film <b>60</b> and the p-side finger electrode <b>88</b>, and covering the p-side ohmic contact pad <b>52</b>, the n-side finger electrode <b>78</b> and the n-side ohmic contact pad <b>56</b>; a DBR <b>91</b> <i>a</i>; and a clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>are formed. The dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>or the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>may be omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0416" num="0415">The DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>is composed of a stack of several periods (repetitions) of alternating layers of SiO<sub>2 </sub>and TiO<sub>2</sub>, for example. In addition, the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>may be a combination of a highly reflective material such as Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, HfO, ZrO or SiN, and a dielectric thin film (typically SiO<sub>2</sub>) having a lower refractive index than the material. When the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>is made of TiO<sub>2</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub>, it is preferentially subjected to an optimum process designed in consideration of the reflectivity as a function of the incident angle and the wavelength, using the ¼ optical thickness of the wavelength of light coming out of the active light as a reference. It is not absolutely required for each layer to have a thickness corresponding to ¼ of the optical thickness of the wavelength. The number of combinations is suitably in a range from 4 to 20 pairs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0417" num="0416">For reflecting and guiding light, the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>preferentially has an effective refractive index larger than a refractive index of the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b</i>. When the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>is made of SiO<sub>2</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub>, with SiO<sub>2 </sub>having the refractive index of 1.46 and TiO<sub>2 </sub>having the refractive index of 2.4, the effective refractive index of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>has a value between 1.46 and 2.4. Therefore, the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>may be made of SiO<sub>2</sub>, and it preferentially has a thickness ranging from 0.2 μm to 1.0 μm. As the deposition of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>needs to be done with high precision, the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>having a uniform thickness may be formed before the deposition such that the DBR <b>91</b> <i>b </i>can be prepared in a stable manner, and light reflection can also benefit therefrom.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0418" num="0417">The clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>can also be made of a metallic oxide such as Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, or a dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>such as SiO<sub>2 </sub>or SiON, or a material such as MgF, CaF or the like. The clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>may also be formed of SiO<sub>2 </sub>having the refractive index of 1.46 that is smaller than the effective refractive index of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a</i>. Preferentially, the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>has a thickness which desirably ranges from λ/4n to 3.0 μm, in which λ denotes a wavelength of the light generated in the active layer <b>40</b>, and n denotes a refractive index of a material of the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f</i>. When λ is 450 nm (4500 Å), the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>can be formed in a thickness of 771 Å (4500/4×1.46=771 Å) or more.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0419" num="0418">Considering that the top layer of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>made of multiple pairs of SiO<sub>2</sub>/TiO<sub>2 </sub>can be composed of a SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer having a thickness of λ/4n, it is desirable that the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>is thicker than λ/4n to be distinguished from the top layer of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>that is underlaid beneath the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f</i>. However, it is not desirable for the top layer of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>to be too thick (e.g., 3 μm or more) because this would impose a burden on the subsequent processes for forming a plurality of first semiconductor layer-side openings <b>63</b> and a plurality of second semiconductor layer-side openings <b>65</b> and only increase the material cost without contributing to the improvement of the efficiency. Therefore, an appropriate upper limit of the thickness of the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>would be between 1 μm and 3 μm, so as to relieve the burden on the subsequent processes for forming the plurality of first semiconductor layer-side openings <b>63</b> and the plurality of second semiconductor layer-side openings <b>65</b>. But still, it is not totally prohibited to make the top layer as thick as 3.0 μm or more.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0420" num="0419">When the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>comes into direct contact with the metal layer (e.g. the p-side finger electrode <b>88</b>, the n-side finger electrode <b>78</b>, the first electrode <b>75</b> and the second electrode <b>85</b>), part of the light travelling through the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>might be absorbed by the metal electrode. As described above, by introducing the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>and the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>having a lower refractive index than the refractive index of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a</i>, it becomes possible to significantly reduce an amount of light being absorbed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0421" num="0420">Optionally, the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>may be omitted. Also, although not desirable in terms of an optical waveguide, there is no reason to exclude the configuration composed of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>and the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f</i>, when the overall technical idea of this disclosure is taken into consideration. Alternatively, a TiO<sub>2 </sub>dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b </i>may also be used in place of the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a</i>. Further, as an alternative, the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>may be omitted if the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>includes a SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer on the top thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0422" num="0421">Accordingly, the dielectric film <b>91</b> <i>b</i>, the DBR <b>91</b> <i>a </i>and the clad film <b>91</b> <i>f </i>form the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> and serve as an optical waveguide, and they preferentially have a combined thickness of 1 to 8 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0423" num="0422">A large portion of the light incident on the non-conductive reflective film is reflected towards the first semiconductor layer <b>30</b>, but part of the light may be absorbed by or reflected from the first and second electrodes <b>75</b>, <b>85</b> in contact with the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>, or escaped via an area between the edge <b>77</b> of the first electrode and the edge <b>87</b> of the second electrode. In the semiconductor light device according to this embodiment, the edge <b>77</b> of the first electrode and the edge <b>87</b> of the second electrode are obliquely against the edge of the plurality of semiconductor layers, thereby having an increased area A<b>2</b> therebetween. As a result, the light absorption loss by the first electrode <b>75</b> and the second electrode <b>85</b> is reduced, and the brightness is therefore improved.</div>

As described above, the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> is formed, and then the first semiconductor layer-side opening and the second semiconductor layer-side opening <b>65</b> are formed in the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> by etching (e.g. plasma etching) (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 81</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 85</figref>). While the first semiconductor layer-side opening and the second semiconductor layer-side opening <b>65</b> are open upwards of the semiconductor light emitting device, as an alternative, they may be open towards the sides. The first and second semiconductor-layer side openings <b>63</b>, <b>65</b> are formed in correspondence to one end of the n-side finger electrode <b>78</b>, the n-side ohmic contact pad <b>56</b>, one end of the p-side finger electrode <b>88</b> and the p-side ohmic contact pad <b>52</b>, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0425" num="0424">For example, as an etching process proceeds as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 85(<i>a</i>)</figref>, part of the top face of the p-side ohmic contact pad <b>52</b> gets exposed as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 85(<i>b</i>)</figref>. As the process continued gradually, a height difference between the upper rim of the opening <b>65</b>, i.e. an etch-exposed face as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 85(<i>b</i>)</figref>, and the top face of the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> is reduced. With further etching, the surroundings of the p-side ohmic contact pad <b>52</b> is exposed through the opening <b>65</b> as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 85(<i>c</i>)</figref>, and the non-conductive reflection film <b>91</b> has slant faces formed by the opening <b>65</b>. Moreover, in this embodiment, the upper rim of the opening <b>63</b>, <b>65</b> and the top face of the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> are configured to be connected and form a flat plane, such that the etch-exposed face created during the opening <b>63</b>, <b>65</b> formation process forms the upper rim of the opening <b>63</b>, <b>65</b>, thereby reducing the height difference between the upper rim of the opening <b>63</b>, <b>65</b> and other parts of the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>. Next, the second electrode <b>85</b> is formed in such a way that it comes into contact with the additional second electrical connection <b>82</b> in the second semiconductor layer-side opening <b>65</b> and with the top and lateral faces of the p-side ohmic contact pad <b>52</b>, or it encompasses the top and lateral faces of the p-side ohmic contact pad <b>52</b>. As a result, a larger contact face is obtained, and a stable electrical connection is established. Since the process for forming the first semiconductor layer-side opening <b>63</b> is very similar to the above description, it will not be explained here to avoid redundancy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0426" num="0425"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 86</figref> is a schematic view illustrating an example of a layer structure of the lower electrode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0427" num="0426">Harmful materials for electrical conducting, which have been produced during forming the opening (e.g. <b>63</b>, <b>65</b>), can be removed from the top face of the lower electrode (e.g. <b>56</b>, <b>78</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>88</b>) by an additional process, before the upper electrode (e.g. <b>75</b>, <b>85</b>) and the electrical connection (e.g. <b>71</b>, <b>72</b>, <b>81</b>, <b>82</b>) are formed. For example, in dry etching for forming a plurality of openings <b>63</b>, <b>65</b>, halogen gases containing an F group (e.g. CF<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>8</sub>, SF<sub>6 </sub>or the like) may be used as an etching gas. If the opening formation process proceeds in absence of the p-side finger electrode <b>88</b>, the n-side finger electrode <b>78</b>, the p-side ohmic contact pad <b>52</b> and the n-side ohmic contact pad <b>56</b>, it is inevitable that the surface of the current spreading conductive film <b>60</b> and the surface of the first semiconductor layer <b>30</b> become rough, and this can be unfavorable for an electrical contact. In this context, the p-side finger electrode <b>88</b>, the n-side finger electrode <b>78</b>, the p-side ohmic contact pad <b>52</b> and the n-side ohmic contact pad <b>56</b> are metal pads for interconnection that prevents such an electrical contact failure. Their presence reduces the contact resistance against the current spreading conductive film <b>60</b> and the first semiconductor layer <b>30</b>, and allows the electrical connection <b>71</b>, <b>72</b>, <b>81</b>, <b>82</b> to establish stable interconnection with the current spreading conductive film <b>60</b> and the first semiconductor layer <b>30</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0428" num="0427">Meanwhile, each of the p-side finger electrode <b>88</b>, the n-side finger electrode <b>78</b>, the p-side ohmic contact pad <b>52</b> and the n-side ohmic contact pad <b>56</b> can have a multilayered structure, as suggested in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 86</figref>. For example, they each have a contact layer <b>51</b> in contact with the current spreading conductive film <b>60</b> or with the first semiconductor layer <b>30</b>, an anti-oxidation layer <b>58</b> formed on the contact layer <b>51</b>, and an anti-etching layer <b>59</b> formed on the anti-oxidation layer <b>58</b>. Alternatively, they each have a contact layer <b>51</b>, a reflective layer <b>53</b>, a diffusion barrier layer <b>57</b>, an anti-oxidation layer <b>58</b>, and an anti-etching layer <b>59</b>, which are arranged sequentially.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0429" num="0428">The contact layer <b>51</b> is typically made of a material such as Cr or Ti, and other materials such as Ni, TiW or the like, or highly reflective materials such as Al, Ag or the like may also be used. The reflective layer <b>53</b> may be made of a highly reflective metal (e.g. Ag, Al or a combination thereof). The reflective layer <b>53</b> reflects light generated in the active layer <b>40</b> towards the plurality of semiconductor layers <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>. The reflective layer <b>53</b> may be omitted. The diffusion barrier layer <b>57</b> prevents the material of the reflective layer <b>53</b> or the material of the anti-oxidation layer <b>58</b> from diffusing into other layers. The diffusion barrier layer <b>57</b> may be made of at least one selected from Ti, Ni, Cr, W, TiW or the like. If the diffusion barrier layer <b>57</b> needs to be highly reflective, Al, Ag or the like may be used. The anti-oxidation layer <b>58</b> may be made of Au, Pt or the like, and any material that would not be oxidized easily when exposed to the outside and brought into contact with oxygen is also useful. Au, a highly electrically conductive material, is typically used for the anti-oxidation layer <b>58</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0430" num="0429">The anti-etching layer <b>59</b> is a layer exposed during dry etching for forming the first semiconductor layer-side opening <b>63</b> and the second semiconductor layer-side opening <b>65</b> in the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>. When the anti-etching layer <b>59</b> is made of Au, it shows weak bonding strength towards the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b>, and part of Au may be damaged or ruined during etching. Hence, the anti-etching layer <b>59</b> is preferentially made of a material such as Ni, W, TiW, Cr, Pd, Mo or the like, instead of Au, in order to retain the bonding strength towards the non-conductive reflective layer <b>91</b>, thus improving reliability. Meanwhile, during dry etching, the anti-etching layer <b>59</b> protects the p-side finger electrodes <b>88</b>, the p-side ohmic contact pad <b>52</b>, the n-side finger electrode <b>78</b> and the n-side ohmic contact pad <b>56</b>, and in particular it prevents damages on the anti-oxidation layer <b>58</b>. The etching gas used in dry etching for forming the opening <b>65</b> may produce harmful materials for electrical conducting, including a material such as an insulation material or impurities, on the top layer of the electrode. This material is removed by wet etching following the opening formation etching process, such that the anti-oxidation layer <b>58</b> in correspondence to the opening <b>63</b>, <b>65</b> is exposed. The material as well as the anti-etching layer <b>59</b> are etched and removed together. With the material having been removed, the p-side finger electrodes <b>88</b>, the p-side ohmic contact pad <b>52</b>, the n-side finger electrode <b>78</b> and the n-side ohmic contact pad <b>56</b> may have a better electrical contact among them, and deterioration of the electrical properties of the semiconductor light emitting device is avoided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0431" num="0430">In one embodiment, the p-side finger electrode <b>88</b> and the p-side ohmic contact pad <b>52</b> have a stack of Cr (contact layer)/Al (reflective layer)/Ni (diffusion barrier layer)/Au (anti-oxidation layer)/Cr (anti-etching layer) arranged sequentially. Also, having removed a part of the anti-etching layer <b>59</b> in correspondence to the second semiconductor layer-side opening <b>65</b> to avoid deterioration of the electrical properties, in one embodiment, the p-side finger electrode <b>88</b> and the p-side ohmic contact pad <b>52</b> may have a stack of Cr (contact layer)/Al (reflective layer)/Ni (diffusion barrier layer)/Au (anti-oxidation layer) arranged sequentially, in which the anti-oxidation layer <b>58</b> may come into contact with an electrical connection <b>81</b>, <b>82</b> (to be described). The n-side finger electrode <b>78</b> and the n-side ohmic contact pad <b>52</b> can also have the same layer structure as the p-side finger electrode <b>88</b>. If the Al reflective layer is made thick, Al may be burst out. In this case, the bursting may be avoided by alternately stacked Al/Ni layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0432" num="0431">Referring back to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 85 (<i>d</i>)</figref>, the first electrode <b>75</b> and the second electrode <b>85</b> may be deposited on the non-conductive reflective film <b>91</b> using a stud bump, sputtering equipment, E-beam equipment, for example. During the process of forming the first and second electrodes <b>75</b>, <b>85</b>, electrical connections <b>71</b>, <b>72</b>, <b>81</b>, <b>82</b> are also formed in the openings <b>63</b>, <b>65</b>. The first electrode <b>75</b> and the second electrode <b>85</b> can be electrically connected with an electrode prepared in the outside (package, COB, sub-mount, or the like) by means of a stud bump, conductive paste or eutectic bonding. In the case of eutectic bonding, it is important that the first electrode <b>75</b> and the second electrode <b>85</b> have comparable heights without much difference. In the semiconductor light emitting device according to this embodiment, the height difference of the upper rim of the opening, and therefore unevenness can be reduced during the aforementioned process of forming an opening, resulting in an advantageous structure for eutectic bonding. When the semiconductor light emitting device is electrically connected to the outside through eutectic bonding, the top part of the first and second electrodes <b>75</b>, <b>85</b> may be formed of a eutectic bonding material such as an Au/Sn alloy or an Au/Sn/Cu alloy.
