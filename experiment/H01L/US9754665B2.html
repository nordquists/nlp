<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The instant application claims the benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 62/288,616 filed on Jan. 29, 2016, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to the field of semiconductor devices and specifically to three-dimensional non-volatile memory devices, such as a three-dimensional resistive random access memory (ReRAM) devices, and methods of making the same.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Resistance Random Access Memory, or “ReRAM,” is a non-volatile memory device employing reversible change in resistance in a thin film with application of electrical voltage bias across the film. Application of the electrical voltage bias in one manner can cause decrease in the resistance of the thin film, for example, by formation of filaments that function as leakage current paths or by increasing a crystallinity of the thin film. Application of a different type of electrical voltage bias can cause reversal of the resistance of the thin film to an original high-resistance state, such as by removal of the filaments from the thin film or by decreasing the crystallinity of the thin film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Thus, data can be stored in a ReRAM cell by changing the resistance of the thin film, which can be a solid-state material. The thin film is referred to as a memory film or a read/write film. Examples of ReRAM devices are described in World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Publication No. WO2007004843 A1 to Hong et al. and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2013/0043455 A1 to Bateman.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">A vacancy-modulated conductive oxide (VMCO) resistive random access memory (ReRAM) device is a ReRAM in which the resistance of a memory element is modulated by separation or recombination of oxygen vacancies and interstitial oxygen ions. When the interstitial oxygen ions combine with the oxygen vacancies, a zone with a low density of charge carriers is formed due to elimination of oxygen vacancies, thereby increasing the resistance of the memory element. This operation is herein referred to as a “resetting” operation. When the oxygen ions are separated from the oxygen vacancies, a zone with a high density of charge carriers is formed due to the presence of vacancies, thereby decreasing the resistance of the memory element. This operation is herein referred to as a “setting” operation.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY</heading>

The at least one layer is selected from of a metal layer selected from Ti, Zr, Hf, Ta, Nb, and V, and an interfacial metal oxide layer consisting essentially of oxygen and at least one elemental metal selected from Ti, Zr, Hf, Ta, Nb, and V.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">As discussed above, the present disclosure is directed to a three-dimensional resistive random access memory (ReRAM) devices and other three-dimensional devices, and methods of making the same, the various aspects of which are described below. The embodiments of the disclosure can be employed to form various semiconductor devices such as three-dimensional monolithic memory array devices comprising ReRAM devices. The drawings are not drawn to scale. Multiple instances of an element may be duplicated where a single instance of the element is illustrated, unless absence of duplication of elements is expressly described or clearly indicated otherwise. Ordinals such as “first,” “second,” and “third” are employed merely to identify similar elements, and different ordinals may be employed across the specification and the claims of the instant disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">As used herein, a “layer” refers to a material portion including a region having a thickness. A layer may extend over the entirety of an underlying or overlying structure, or may have an extent less than the extent of an underlying or overlying structure. For example, a layer may be located between any pair of horizontal planes between, or at, a top surface and a bottom surface of the continuous structure. A layer may extend horizontally, vertically, and/or along a tapered surface. A substrate may be a layer, may include one or more layers therein, and/or may have one or more layer thereupon, thereabove, and/or therebelow.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">As used herein, a “layer stack” refers to a stack of layers. As used herein, a “line” or a “line structure” refers to a layer that has a predominant direction of extension, i.e., having a direction along which the layer extends the most.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">As used herein, a “field effect transistor” refers to any semiconductor device having a semiconductor channel through which electrical current flows with a current density modulated by an external electrical field. As used herein, an “active region” refers to a source region of a field effect transistor or a drain region of a field effect transistor. A “top active region” refers to an active region of a field effect transistor that is located above another active region of the field effect transistor. A “bottom active region” refers to an active region of a field effect transistor that is located below another active region of the field effect transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">A monolithic three dimensional memory array is one in which multiple memory levels are formed above a single substrate, such as a semiconductor wafer, with no intervening substrates. The term “monolithic” means that layers of each level of the array are directly deposited on the layers of each underlying level of the array. In contrast, two-dimensional arrays may be formed separately and then packaged together to form a non-monolithic memory device. For example, non-monolithic stacked memories have been constructed by forming memory levels on separate substrates and vertically stacking the memory levels, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,915,167 titled “Three Dimensional Structure Memory.” The substrates may be thinned or removed from the memory levels before bonding, but as the memory levels are initially formed over separate substrates, such memories are not true monolithic three dimensional memory arrays.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">The various three dimensional memory devices of the present disclosure can include a ReRAM device, and can be fabricated employing the various embodiments described herein. It is understood that a criss-cross array of memory elements that can be accessed by any access scheme can be employed for the resistive memory devices of the present disclosure, and the exemplary structures of the present disclosure are described herein merely provide non-limiting examples of implementation of the memory devices of the present disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1D</figref>, a first exemplary structure for forming a resistive random access memory device is illustrated, which can be an in-process ReRAM device. As used herein, a “prototype” structure or an “in-process” structure refers to a transient structure that is subsequently modified in the shape or composition of at least one component therein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">The first exemplary structure includes a substrate <b>6</b>, which includes an insulating layer at an upper portion thereof. In one embodiment, the substrate <b>6</b> can be a stack of at least two material layers such as a stack of an underlying substrate material layer and an overlying substrate insulating layer. The substrate material layer can be a semiconductor material layer, a conductive material layer, or an insulating material layer that can provide structural support to the overlying structures, and may have a thickness greater than 50 microns, and typically in a range between 300 microns and 3 mm. In one embodiment, the substrate material layer can be a semiconductor wafer, such as a silicon wafer as known in the art. The substrate insulating layer can include an insulating material, and can have a thickness in a range from 100 nm to 3 microns, although lesser and greater thicknesses can also be employed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">In case the substrate material layer includes a semiconductor material, peripheral semiconductor devices for operation of a memory array device can be formed in, or on, the substrate material layer. For example, sense amplifiers, input-output (I/O) circuitry, control circuitry, and any other necessary peripheral circuitry can be formed on, or in, the substrate material layer. Additional devices that can be formed in, or on, the substrate material layer include, but are not limited to, global bit line select transistors for selecting global bit lines to be activated, local bit line select transistors for selecting local bit lines to be activated, and word line select transistor for selecting word lines to be activated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">As used herein, a “semiconductor material” refers to a material having electrical conductivity in the range from 1.0×10<sup>−6 </sup>S/cm to 1.0×10<sup>5 </sup>S/cm, and is capable of producing a doped material having electrical conductivity in a range from 1.0 S/cm to 1.0×10<sup>5 </sup>S/cm upon suitable doping with an electrical dopant. As used herein, an “electrical dopant” refers to a p-type dopant that adds a hole to a valence band within a band structure, or an n-type dopant that adds an electron to a conduction band within a band structure. As used herein, a “conductive material” refers to a material having electrical conductivity greater than 1.0—10<sup>5 </sup>S/cm. As used herein, an “insulating material” or a “dielectric material” refers to a material having electrical conductivity less than 1.0×10<sup>−6 </sup>S/cm. A “semiconducting material” refers to a material having electrical conductivity in a range from 1.0×10<sup>−6 </sup>S/cm to 1.0×10<sup>5 </sup>S/cm. All measurements for electrical conductivities are made at the standard condition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">Global bit lines <b>10</b> are formed over the substrate <b>6</b>. The global bit lines <b>10</b> are parallel electrically conductive lines that are laterally spaced apart in a first horizontal direction hd<b>1</b>, and extending in a second horizontal direction hd<b>2</b>. The global bit lines <b>10</b> can be formed, for example, by depositing at least one conductive material layer, and patterning the at least one conductive material layer employing a combination of lithographic methods and an anisotropic etch. The at least one conductive material layer can include, for example, at least one elemental metal (such as W, Co, Cu, and Al), a conductive doped semiconductor material, an intermetallic alloy including at least two elemental metals, a conductive metallic nitride, or a conductive metallic carbide. For example, the at least one conductive material layer can include a metallic barrier layer (such as a layer of TiN, TaN, or WN) and a metal layer (such as a layer of W, Ti, Ta, Cu, Al, or an alloy thereof). The space between the global bit lines <b>10</b> can be filled with a dielectric material (such as silicon oxide). The dielectric material can be subsequently planarized to remove excess portions from above a horizontal plane including the top surfaces of the global bit lines <b>10</b> to form separator dielectric material portions <b>12</b>. Each global bit lines <b>10</b> and each separator dielectric material portions <b>12</b> can extend along the second horizontal direction hd<b>2</b>. A one-dimensional array of the global bit lines <b>10</b> and the separator dielectric material portions <b>12</b> can extend along the first horizontal direction hd<b>2</b> with a periodicity that is equal to the sum of the width of a global bit line <b>10</b> and the width of a separator dielectric material portion <b>12</b>. Alternatively, the one-dimensional array of the global bit lines <b>10</b> and the separator dielectric material portions <b>12</b> may be formed by depositing a dielectric material layer, forming trenches extending along the second horizontal direction hd<b>2</b> and laterally spaced from one another along the first horizontal direction hd<b>1</b>, and filling the trenches with at least one conductive material to form the global bit lines <b>10</b> therein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">A two-dimensional array of select devices can be formed on the global bit lines <b>10</b> such that multiple select devices are formed on each global bit line <b>10</b>. In one embodiment, the select devices can be transistor such as vertical thin film transistors employing a polycrystalline semiconductor channel. Examples of suitable transistors for the select devices are described, for example, in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/206,196, filed Mar. 12, 2014, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. In case the select devices are field effect transistors, the select transistors are herein referred to access transistors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">Bit line access transistors are subsequently formed on global bit line <b>10</b>. Each access transistor can be a vertical field effect transistor, and can include a bottom active region <b>14</b>B (which can be a source region or a drain region), a semiconductor channel <b>14</b>C, and a top active region <b>14</b>T (which can be a drain region if the underlying bottom active region <b>14</b>B is a source region, and a source region if the underlying bottom active region <b>14</b>C is a drain region). As used herein, an “active region” refers to a source region or a drain region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">The bit line access transistors can be formed by forming a semiconductor layer stack <b>14</b> including a first doped semiconductor layer for forming the bottom active regions <b>14</b>B, a semiconductor channel material layer for forming the semiconductor channels <b>14</b>C, and a second doped semiconductor layer for forming the top active regions <b>14</b>T, which has a same type of doping as the first doped semiconductor layer. The semiconductor layer stack <b>14</b> is patterned employing a combination of lithographic methods and an anisotropic etch such that each patterned portion of the semiconductor layer stack <b>14</b> overlies an area of a respective global bit line <b>10</b> and is laterally spaced from one another by trenches extending along the second horizontal direction hd<b>2</b>. Subsequently, a dielectric material (such as silicon nitride and/or silicon oxide) is deposited in the trenches and planarized to remove the dielectric material from above rails of the semiconductor layer stack <b>14</b> that extend along the second horizontal direction hd<b>2</b>. The remaining portions of the semiconductor layer stack <b>14</b> and the planarized dielectric material portions constitute alternating rail structures in which rails of semiconductor layer stack <b>14</b> and rails of the planarized dielectric material extend along the second horizontal direction hd<b>2</b> and alternate along the first horizontal direction hd<b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">The remaining portions of the semiconductor layer stack <b>14</b> and the planarized dielectric material portions are patterned to form trenches that extend along the first horizontal direction hd<b>1</b>. Each patterned portion of the semiconductor layer stack <b>14</b> includes a vertical stack of a bottom active region <b>14</b>B, a semiconductor channel <b>14</b>C, and a top active region <b>14</b>T. Each patterned portion of the dielectric material constitutes a dielectric pillar structure <b>27</b>, which can be located between a pair of vertical stacks of a bottom active region <b>14</b>B, a semiconductor channel <b>14</b>C, and a top active region <b>14</b>T that are spaced from each other along the first horizontal direction hd<b>1</b>. Each alternating sequence of dielectric pillar structures <b>27</b> and vertical stacks of a bottom active region <b>14</b>B, a semiconductor channel <b>14</b>C, and a top active region <b>14</b>T that extend along the first horizontal direction hd<b>1</b> forms a composite rail structure (<b>14</b>B, <b>14</b>C, <b>14</b>T, <b>27</b>).

The oxygen interstitials (Oi) generated from region <b>87</b> drift into vacancy rich titanium oxide layer <b>86</b> to recombine with the oxygen vacancies (Vo) within the titanium oxide layer. The recombination of Oi and Vo makes the titanium oxide material less conductive due to elimination of Vo, and the cell is switched into a high resistance state (HRS). In other words, the composition of the oxygen deficient titanium oxide layer <b>86</b> becomes stoichiometric (i.e., titanium dioxide) or closer to stoichiometric upon recombination of Oi and Vo. The graphs in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref> show the Oi concentration as a function of distance in the device before and after the reset operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>, operation of a prior VCMO ReRAM during a set switching process is illustrated. During the set operation, opposite polarity voltage is applied across the stack (e.g., a negative voltage applied to layer <b>86</b>), and Ti—O bonds are broken in the titanium oxide layer <b>86</b> to generate Oi and Vo pairs. Oi will drift back to the interface between layers <b>81</b> and <b>86</b> along the set electric field E<sub>set</sub>. Oi bond to silicon in layer <b>81</b> to form the interfacial silicon oxide region <b>87</b>. Thus, consistent performance during the set operation requires consistent generation of the oxygen interstitials and oxygen vacancies. The graphs in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> show the Oi concentration as a function of distance in the device before and after the set operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">However, endurance of VMCO resistive random access memory cells suffers from fast degradation of low resistance state (LRS), in either single pulse cycling or incremental step pulse programming (ISPP) cycling. The shift of the LRS toward a high resistance state (HRS) closes the resistance window down, and limits the cell endurance in the range of about thousand cycles. It is desirable to increase the number of cycles for use of the VMCO ReRAM cells for storage class memory (SCM) applications by consistent generation of the oxygen interstitials and oxygen vacancies over more cycles than that in the prior art VMCO ReRAM cells of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref>.</div>

In one embodiment, the semiconductor material portion <b>81</b> includes an amorphous semiconductor material layer selected from silicon, germanium, a silicon-germanium alloy, a silicon-carbon alloy, a silicon-germanium-carbon alloy, and a III-V compound semiconductor material. Alternatively, a polycrystalline or single crystalline semiconductor material layer may be employed for the semiconductor material portion <b>81</b>. The thickness (along the direction perpendicular to the interface between the semiconductor material layer <b>81</b> and the metal layer <b>84</b>) can be in a range from 10 nm to 120 nm, although lesser and greater thicknesses can also be employed.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">The titanium oxide portion <b>86</b> includes a titanium oxide layer, and is located at the other end of the first exemplary resistive memory element <b>280</b>. As used herein, titanium oxide refers to a dielectric compound of titanium and oxygen having a composition of TiO<sub>2-δ</sub>, in which 0≦δ≦0.3, such as 0.01≦δ≦0.2. The oxygen deficiency in the titanium oxide material occurs naturally due to the tendency of the titanium oxide material to generate oxygen vacancies to increase entropy. The thickness of the titanium oxide portion <b>86</b> (along the direction perpendicular to the interface between the titanium oxide portion <b>86</b> and the interfacial metal oxide layer <b>85</b>) can be in a range from 20 nm to 200 nm, such as from 40 nm to 120 nm, although lesser and greater thicknesses can also be employed.

The metal layer <b>84</b> can include a single elemental metal or two or more elemental metals selected from Ti, Zr, Hf, Ta, Nb, and V (e.g., a single metal layer, an alloy of the above metals or a stack of layers of the above metals). The metal layer <b>84</b> exhibits electronic characteristics similar to elemental titanium or is made of elemental titanium. Selection of at least one elemental metal having the same, or similar, outer electronic shell structures as titanium enables formation and/or stabilization of the metal oxide material in the interfacial metal oxide layer <b>85</b>. In one embodiment, the metal layer <b>84</b> can consist essentially of an elemental metal selected from Ti, Zr, Hf, Ta, Nb, and V or intermetallic alloys thereof. In one embodiment, the metal layer can consist essentially of a same set of at least one elemental metal as at least one elemental metal that is present in the interfacial metal oxide layer <b>85</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">The interfacial metal oxide layer <b>85</b> can consist essentially of oxygen and at least one elemental metal selected from titanium, a Group IVB element different from titanium (e.g., Zr or Hf), or a group VB element having one more electron in a second-from-outside shell than titanium (e.g., V, Nb, or Ta). Thus, the interfacial metal oxide layer <b>85</b> can consist essentially of oxygen and at least one elemental metal selected from Ti, Zr, Hf, Ta, Nb, and V (i.e., an oxide of the metal of layer <b>84</b>). The interfacial metal oxide layer <b>85</b> can be disposed between the metal layer <b>84</b> and the titanium oxide portion <b>86</b>. The interfacial metal oxide layer <b>85</b> can have a thickness in a range from 0.5 nm to 3 nm, although lesser and greater thicknesses can also be employed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">In one embodiment, the interfacial metal oxide layer <b>85</b> comprises a non-stoichiometric metal oxide with oxygen deficiency. For example, the metal layer <b>84</b> may can be a titanium layer, and the interfacial metal oxide layer <b>85</b> can have a composition of TiO<sub>2-∈</sub>, in which ∈ is a variable number that changes with distance from the titanium oxide portion <b>86</b>.

The 50% of the volume of the interfacial metal oxide layer <b>85</b> can be at a center portion of interfacial metal oxide layer <b>85</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">In one embodiment, the interfacial metal oxide layer <b>85</b> has an oxygen concentration gradient such that a concentration of oxygen increases with distance from the semiconductor material portion <b>81</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0102">Without wishing to be bound by a particular theory, it is believed that the oxygen vacancy distribution in the titanium oxide portion <b>86</b> changes depending on the programmed state of the resistive memory element <b>280</b> as follows. For example, in a set state, which is a low resistance state, the oxygen vacancy concentration in the titanium oxide portion <b>86</b> can be a strictly decreasing function with distance from the interface between portion <b>86</b> and the interfacial metal oxide layer <b>85</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>. The oxygen vacancies in the titanium oxide portion <b>86</b> enable conduction through the titanium oxide portion <b>86</b> in the set state of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>. Thus, the titanium oxide portion <b>86</b> is in a high conductivity state (i.e., a low resistivity state).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0103">Upon application of a positive RESET bias voltage (on the order of 4 V to 12V) to the titanium oxide portion <b>86</b> relative to the voltage applied to the semiconductor material portion <b>81</b> in the structure of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>, the oxygen interstitials migrate from the interfacial metal oxide layer <b>85</b> into the titanium oxide portion <b>86</b>. The oxygen interstitials combine with the oxygen vacancies in the titanium oxide portion such that the concentration of the oxygen vacancies in the titanium oxide portion <b>86</b> decreases, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>. The reduction in the concentration of oxygen vacancies in the titanium oxide portion <b>86</b> reduces electrical conduction through the titanium oxide portion <b>86</b> in the reset state of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>. Thus, the titanium oxide portion <b>86</b> is in a low conductivity state (i.e., a high resistivity state). In this reset state, the interfacial metal oxide layer <b>85</b> is depleted of oxygen after the reset transition, and the value of a within the interfacial metal oxide layer <b>85</b> increases. If the interfacial metal oxide layer <b>85</b> is completely depleted of oxygen in the reset state to leave only metal atoms, then layer <b>85</b> may not be present between the metal layer <b>84</b> and the titanium oxide portion <b>86</b>. Alternatively, not all oxygen is depleted from layer <b>85</b> and at least a portion of layer <b>85</b> remains between the metal layer <b>84</b> and the titanium oxide portion <b>86</b> in the reset state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0104">Upon application of a negative SET bias voltage (on the order of −12 V to −4 V) to the titanium oxide portion <b>86</b> relative to the voltage applied to the semiconductor material portion <b>81</b> in the structure of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>, titanium-oxygen bonds are broken in the titanium oxide portion <b>86</b> to generate oxygen vacancies and oxygen interstitials in the titanium oxide portion <b>86</b>. The oxygen interstitials migrate from the titanium oxide portion <b>86</b> to the interfacial metal oxide layer <b>85</b> to provide the set state illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>. In this set state, the interfacial metal oxide layer <b>85</b> acts as an oxygen reservoir for a future reset transition, and the value of a within the interfacial metal oxide layer <b>85</b> decreases. While it is believed that the set and reset states described above are achieved due to oxygen interstitial migration, it is possible that oxygen vacancy migration may also occur in an opposite direction in addition to or instead of oxygen interstitial migration. It is believed that the device is non-filamentary in the set state. In other words, it is believed that no conductive filaments are formed in region <b>86</b> in the set state, and instead a bulk Vo increase throughout the height of region <b>86</b> (i.e., due to Oi generation and migration from region <b>86</b> to layer <b>85</b>) is responsible for the low resistance state in the device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0105">The resistive memory element <b>280</b> of the embodiments of the present disclosure should provide enhanced endurance (i.e., higher number of cycles) with respect to the prior art resistive memory element illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref> because the interfacial metal oxide layer <b>85</b> functions as an improved oxygen reservoir. Without wishing to be bound by a particular theory, it is believed that the metal (e.g., Ti, etc.) layer <b>84</b> and the interfacial (metal rich) metal oxide layer <b>85</b> function as a better oxygen ion scavenger than silicon in region <b>81</b> during the set operation due to thermodynamic driving force. In other words, during the set operation, it is believed that more Oi would be generated and drawn to the metal layer <b>84</b> (or any remaining metal rich interfacial oxide layer <b>85</b>) in the device of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref> than would be drawn to the amorphous silicon layer <b>81</b> in the prior art device of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref> by the thermodynamic driving force. Specifically, it is believed that the presence of the metal layer <b>84</b> creates favorable thermodynamic conditions which facilitate breaking of titanium-oxygen bonds in the titanium oxide region <b>86</b> and generation of Oi and Vo pairs in this region <b>86</b>. The Oi diffuse (i.e., drift) from region <b>86</b> toward the metal layer <b>84</b> and react with the metal atoms in the metal layer <b>84</b> or in the remaining interfacial metal oxide layer <b>85</b> (if layer <b>85</b> is present before the set operation) to re-form the interfacial metal oxide layer <b>85</b> on the metal layer <b>84</b> or to increase the oxygen concentration in the remaining layer <b>85</b>. During the reset operation, the higher oxygen content in the interfacial metal layer <b>85</b> (than in the silicon oxide region <b>87</b> in the prior art device) is used to provide additional Oi which flow into region <b>86</b> and recombine with the Vo in the region <b>86</b>.</div>

Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>, a metal layer <b>84</b> having the composition described above can be formed on a semiconductor material portion <b>81</b> having the composition described above. The metal layer <b>84</b> can be formed by atomic layer deposition or chemical vapor deposition. In one embodiment, the metal layer <b>84</b> can be deposited in a non-oxidizing environment so that the composition of the metal layer <b>84</b> does not change during or after deposition. Subsequently, a titanium oxide portion <b>86</b> having the composition described above can be deposited on the metal layer <b>84</b>. Atomic layer deposition or chemical vapor deposition can be employed to form the titanium oxide portion <b>86</b>. During or after deposition of the titanium oxide portion <b>86</b> directly on a surface of the metal layer <b>84</b>, oxygen can diffuse from the titanium oxide portion <b>86</b> into the metal layer <b>84</b>. The at least one elemental metal in the metal layer <b>84</b> is reactive, and thus, is capable of scavenging oxygen from the titanium oxide portion <b>86</b>. If desired, an anneal (for example, at a temperature in a range from 300 degrees to 550 degrees) can be performed to increase diffusion of oxygen atoms from the titanium oxide portion <b>86</b> into an interfacial portion of the metal layer <b>84</b>. The interfacial portion of the metal layer <b>84</b> into which the diffused oxygen atoms are incorporated becomes the interfacial metal oxide layer <b>85</b> described above. In other words, the interfacial metal oxide layer <b>85</b> is formed by diffusion of oxygen atoms from the titanium oxide portion <b>86</b> through an interface between the metal layer <b>84</b> and the titanium oxide portion <b>86</b>. The interfacial metal oxide layer <b>85</b> comprises a non-stoichiometric metal oxide with oxygen deficiency (i.e., more oxygen deficient than region <b>86</b>). The interfacial metal oxide layer <b>85</b> is formed with an oxygen concentration gradient such that a concentration of oxygen increases with distance from the semiconductor material portion <b>81</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0108">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>, the method illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref> can be modified to form a thinner metal layer <b>84</b>, and to deposit an interfacial metal oxide layer <b>85</b> in a subsequent processing step. In this case, the thickness of the deposited metal layer <b>84</b> as deposited can be substantially the same as the target thickness in the structures illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</figref>. The interfacial metal oxide layer <b>85</b> can be deposited employing a deposition process that is modified from the deposition process for the titanium oxide portion <b>86</b>. Specifically, the interfacial metal oxide layer <b>85</b> can be formed employing an oxygen-containing environment, but which lacks sufficient oxygen to form a stoichiometric or oxygen rich metal oxide layer. For example, to form an oxygen deficient (metal rich) titanium oxide, the environment may have a reduced partial pressure of oxygen and/or reduced exposure time to oxygen-containing gases during the deposition process compared to those used to form stoichiometric or nearly stoichiometric titanium dioxide. Alternatively, plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) which includes ammonia in the deposition ambient may be used to deposit the oxygen deficient interfacial metal oxide layer <b>85</b>. Subsequently, a titanium oxide portion <b>86</b> can be formed on layer <b>85</b> employing the same processing step describe above.

A titanium oxide portion <b>86</b> can be formed on a preexisting surface in a first, second, or third exemplary structure. A metal layer <b>84</b> can be deposited on the titanium oxide portion <b>86</b>. An interfacial metal oxide layer <b>85</b> can be formed by the same mechanism that forms the interfacial metal oxide layer <b>85</b> in the method illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>. Alternatively, an interfacial metal oxide layer <b>85</b> and a metal layer <b>84</b> can be sequentially formed as two separate material layers employing the deposition processes of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref> applied in reverse order. In this case, oxygen atoms are incorporated into the interfacial metal oxide layer <b>85</b> during deposition of the interfacial metal oxide layer <b>85</b>.

The second exemplary resistive memory element <b>380</b> can be derived from the first exemplary resistive memory element <b>280</b> by incorporating an additional electrically conductive layer <b>83</b> into the at least one interfacial layer (<b>84</b>, <b>85</b>). Layer <b>83</b> is formed between the metal layer <b>84</b> and the semiconductor material portion <b>81</b>, and does not form a compound with the semiconductor material portion <b>81</b> (for example, by formation of a metal-semiconductor alloy such as a metal silicide) and functions as a tunneling barrier material. The additional electrically conductive layer <b>83</b> has a thickness in a range from 0.5 nm to 1.5 nm (such as from 0.5 nm to 1.0 nm), and includes a material that can be conformally deposited by atomic layer deposition or chemical vapor deposition. Thus, the additional electrically conductive layer <b>83</b> is preferably a high work function metal or metal compound (e.g., having a higher work function than layer <b>84</b>) which typically does not form a silicide by reaction with silicon in region <b>81</b>. For example, the additional electrically conductive layer <b>83</b> can be a ruthenium, titanium nitride or tantalum nitride layer.
