<heading id="h-0001">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">Deposition of tungsten-containing materials using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques is an integral part of many semiconductor fabrication processes. These materials may be used for horizontal interconnects, vias between adjacent metal layers, contacts between first metal layers and devices on the silicon substrate, and high aspect ratio features. In a conventional deposition process, a substrate is heated to a predetermined process temperature in a deposition chamber, and a thin layer of tungsten-containing material that serves as a seed or nucleation layer is deposited. Thereafter, the remainder of the tungsten-containing material (the bulk layer) is deposited on the nucleation layer. Conventionally, the tungsten-containing materials are formed by the reduction of tungsten hexafluoride (WF<sub>6</sub>).</div>
<heading id="h-0002">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">One aspect of the subject matter described herein relates to a method of depositing a low-fluorine tungsten-containing film on a substrate. The method involves exposing the substrate to alternating pulses of a fluorine-containing tungsten precursor and a reducing agent to thereby deposit the tungsten-containing film on the substrate, where a chamber pressure of a chamber housing the substrate during the fluorine-containing tungsten precursor pulses is less than 10 Torr. The fluorine concentration in the tungsten-containing film may be less than 10<sup>19 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>. In some embodiments, the fluorine concentration in the tungsten film is less than 10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>. According to various embodiments, the chamber pressure may be less than 7 Torr or less than 5 Torr. In some embodiments, the tungsten-containing film is a tungsten nucleation layer. In some embodiments, the tungsten-containing film is deposited on a first tungsten-containing film deposited via a fluorine-free process. In some embodiments, the tungsten-containing film is deposited on a barrier layer. Examples of reducing agents include silicon-containing, boron-containing, and germanium-containing reducing agents. In some embodiments, the fluorine-containing tungsten precursor pulses include hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>). According to various embodiments, the tungsten-containing film may have low resistivity, for example, less than 130 μΩ/cm or less than 110 μΩ/cm. The method may further include depositing a tungsten bulk layer by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on the tungsten-containing film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Another aspect of the subject matter described herein relates to a method including depositing a first tungsten-containing film on a substrate by a fluorine-free process and depositing a second tungsten-containing film the first tungsten film by atomic layer deposition using a fluorine-containing precursor, where a chamber pressure of a chamber housing the substrate during deposition of the second tungsten-containing film is less than 10 Torr. In some embodiments, the first tungsten-containing film is deposited on a barrier layer. In some embodiments, the first tungsten-containing film is deposited on a silicon oxide. According to various embodiments, the chamber pressure may be less than 7 Torr or less than 5 Torr. According to various embodiments, the fluorine concentration in the second tungsten-containing film is less than 10<sup>19 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less than 10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Further aspects can be implemented in apparatus configured to implement any of the methods described herein. For example, another aspect of the subject matter described herein relates to an apparatus for processing substrates, including (a) at least one process chamber comprising a pedestal configured to hold a substrate; (b) at least one outlet for coupling to a vacuum; (c) one or more process gas inlets coupled to one or more process gas sources; and (d) a controller for controlling operations in the apparatus, the controller including machine-readable instructions for introducing a reducing agent and a fluorine-containing tungsten precursor in alternating pulses to the process chamber, where the chamber pressure is less than 10 Torr.</div>

<heading id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. The present invention may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well known process operations have not been described in detail to not unnecessarily obscure the present invention. While the invention will be described in conjunction with the specific implementations, it will be understood that it is not intended to limit the invention to the implementations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">Described herein are methods of tungsten deposition and related systems and apparatus. Examples of applications include logic and memory contact fill, DRAM buried wordline fill, vertically integrated memory gate/wordline fill, and 3-D integration with through-silicon vias (TSVs). In some embodiments, the methods may be used for tungsten feature fill. Such features can include vertical features, such as vias, and horizontal features, such as vertical NAND (VNAND) wordlines. The methods may be used for conformal or bottom-up/inside-out fill.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">Aspects of the methods and apparatus described herein relate to deposition of tungsten-containing layers such as tungsten nucleation layers. Various embodiments of the methods involve exposing a substrate to alternating pulses of a tungsten precursor and a reducing agent at low chamber pressure to thereby deposit a tungsten nucleation layer on the surface of the substrate. According to various embodiments, chamber pressure may be maintained at or below 10 Torr. In some embodiments, chamber pressure may be maintained at or below 7 Torr, or even lower, such as at or below 5 Torr. The methods may be implemented with a fluorine-containing tungsten precursor, but result in very low or undetectable amounts of fluorine in the deposited nucleation layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1G</figref> are schematic examples of various structures in which a low fluorine layer may be deposited using a fluorine-containing precursor according to the processes described herein. In some embodiments, the structures include features to be filled with tungsten or a tungsten-containing material. In some embodiments, a feature can be characterized by one or more of: a narrow opening, a re-entrant opening, constrictions within the feature, and a high aspect ratio. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows an example of a cross-sectional depiction of a vertical feature <b>101</b> to be filled with tungsten. The feature can include a feature hole <b>105</b> in a substrate <b>103</b>. The substrate may be a silicon wafer, e.g., a 200-mm wafer, a 300-mm wafer, or a 450-mm wafer, including wafers having one or more layers of material such as dielectric, conducting, or semi-conducting material deposited thereon. The feature may be formed in one or more of these layers. For example, the feature may be formed at least partially in a dielectric layer. In some implementations, the feature hole <b>105</b> may have an aspect ratio of at least about 2:1, at least about 4:1, at least about 6:1 or higher. The feature hole <b>105</b> may also have a dimension near the opening, e.g., an opening diameter or line width, of between about 10 nm to 500 nm, for example between about 25 nm to 300 nm. The feature hole <b>105</b> can be referred to as an unfilled feature or simply a feature. The feature <b>101</b>, and any feature, may be characterized in part by an axis <b>118</b> that extends through the length of the feature, with vertically-oriented features having vertical axes and horizontally-oriented features having horizontal axes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows an example of a feature <b>101</b> that has a re-entrant profile. A re-entrant profile is a profile that narrows from a bottom, closed end, or interior of the feature to the feature opening. According to various implementations, the profile may narrow gradually and/or include an overhang at the feature opening. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows an example of the latter, with an under-layer <b>113</b> lining the sidewall or interior surfaces of the feature hole <b>105</b>. The under-layer <b>113</b> can be for example, a diffusion barrier layer, an adhesion layer, a nucleation layer, a combination of thereof, or any other applicable material. Non-limiting examples of under-layers can include dielectric layers and conducting layers, e.g., silicon oxides, silicon nitrides, silicon carbides, metal oxides, metal nitrides, metal carbides, and metal layers. In particular implementations an under-layer can be one or more of Ti, TiN, WN, TiAl, and W. The under-layer <b>113</b> forms an overhang <b>115</b> such that the under-layer <b>113</b> is thicker near the opening of the feature <b>101</b> than inside the feature <b>101</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">In some implementations, features having one or more constrictions within the feature may be filled. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> shows examples of views of various filled features having constrictions. Each of the examples (a), (b) and (c) in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> includes a constriction <b>109</b> at a midpoint within the feature. The constriction <b>109</b> can be, for example, between about 15 nm-20 nm wide. Constrictions can cause pinch off during deposition of tungsten in the feature using conventional techniques, with deposited tungsten blocking further deposition past the constriction before that portion of the feature is filled, resulting in voids in the feature. Example (b) further includes a liner/barrier overhang <b>115</b> at the feature opening. Such an overhang could also be a potential pinch-off point. Example (c) includes a constriction <b>112</b> further away from the field region than the overhang <b>115</b> in example (b).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">Horizontal features, such as in 3-D memory structures, can also be filled. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref> shows an example of a horizontal feature <b>150</b> that includes a constriction <b>151</b>. For example, horizontal feature <b>150</b> may be a word line in a VNAND structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">In some implementations, the constrictions can be due to the presence of pillars in a VNAND or other structure. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>, for example, shows a plan view of pillars <b>125</b> in a VNAND or vertically integrated memory (VIM) structure <b>148</b>, with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref> showing a simplified schematic of a cross-sectional depiction of the pillars <b>125</b>. Arrows in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref> represent deposition material; as pillars <b>125</b> are disposed between an area <b>127</b> and a gas inlet or other deposition source, adjacent pillars can result in constrictions <b>151</b> that present challenges in void free fill of an area <b>127</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">The structure <b>148</b> can be formed, for example, by depositing a stack of alternating interlayer dielectric layers <b>154</b> and sacrificial layers (not shown) on a substrate <b>100</b> and selectively etching the sacrificial layers. The interlayer dielectric layers may be, for example, silicon oxide and/or silicon nitride layers, with the sacrificial layers a material selectively etchable with an etchant. This may be followed by etching and deposition processes to form pillars <b>125</b>, which can include channel regions of the completed memory device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">The main surface of substrate <b>100</b> can extend in the x and y directions, with pillars <b>125</b> oriented in the z-direction. In the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1E and 1F</figref>, pillars <b>125</b> are arranged in an offset fashion, such that pillars <b>125</b> that are immediately adjacent in the x-direction are offset with each other in the y-direction and vice versa. According to various implementations, the pillars (and corresponding constrictions formed by adjacent pillars) may be arranged in any number of manners. Moreover, the pillars <b>125</b> may be any shape including circular, square, etc. Pillars <b>125</b> can include an annular semi-conducting material, or circular (or square) semi-conducting material. A gate dielectric may surround the semi-conducting material. The area between each interlayer dielectric layer <b>129</b> can be filled with tungsten; thus structure <b>148</b> has a plurality of stacked horizontally-oriented features that extend in the x and/or y directions to be filled.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1G</figref> provides another example of a view horizontal feature, for example, of a VNAND or other structure including pillar constrictions <b>151</b>. The example in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1G</figref> is open-ended, with material to be deposited able to enter horizontally from two sides as indicated by the arrows. (It should be noted that example in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1G</figref> can be seen as a 2-D rendering 3-D features of the structure, with the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1G</figref> being a cross-sectional depiction of an area to be filled and pillar constrictions shown in the figure representing constrictions that would be seen in a plan rather than cross-sectional view.) In some implementations, 3-D structures can be characterized with the area to be filled extending along two or three dimensions (e.g., in the x and y or x, y and z-directions in the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>), and can present more challenges for fill than filling holes or trenches that extend along one or two dimensions. For example, controlling fill of a 3-D structure can be challenging as deposition gasses may enter a feature from multiple dimensions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">Examples of feature fill for horizontally-oriented and vertically-oriented features are described below. It should be noted that in most cases, the examples applicable to both horizontally-oriented or vertically-oriented features. Moreover, it should also be noted that in the description below, the term “lateral” may be used to refer to a direction generally orthogonal to the feature axis and the term “vertical” to refer to a direct generally along the feature axis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">Distribution of a material within a feature may be characterized by its step coverage. For the purposes of this description, “step coverage” is defined as a ratio of two thicknesses, i.e., the thickness of the material inside the feature divided by the thickness of the material near the opening. For purposes of this description, the term “inside the feature” represents a middle portion of the feature located about the middle point of the feature along the feature's axis, e.g., an area between about 25% and 75% of the distance or, in certain embodiments, between about 40% and 60% of the distance along the feature's depth measured from the feature's opening, or an end portion of the feature located between about 75% and 95% of the distance along the feature's axis as measured from the opening. The term “near the opening of the feature” or “near the feature's opening” represents a top portion of the feature located within 25% or, more specifically, within 10% of the opening's edge or other element representative of the opening's edge. Step coverage of over 100% can be achieved, for example, by filling a feature wider in the middle or near the bottom of the feature than at the feature opening.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">While the description below focuses on tungsten feature fill, aspects of the disclosure may also be implemented in filling features with other materials. For example, feature fill using one or more techniques described herein may be used to fill features with other materials including other tungsten-containing materials (e.g., tungsten nitride (WN) and tungsten carbide (WC)), titanium-containing materials (e.g., titanium (Ti), titanium nitride (TiN), titanium silicide (TiSi), titanium carbide (TiC) and titanium alumide (TiAl)), tantalum-containing materials (e.g., tantalum (Ta), and tantalum nitride (TaN)), and nickel-containing materials (e.g., nickel (Ni) and nickel silicide (NiSi). Further, the methods and apparatus disclosed herein are not limited to feature fill, but can be used to deposit tungsten on any appropriate surface including forming blanket films on planar surfaces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, the methods described herein involve deposition of a tungsten nucleation layer prior to deposition of a bulk layer. A nucleation layer is typically a thin conformal layer that facilitates subsequent deposition of bulk tungsten-containing material thereon. According to various embodiments, a nucleation layer may be deposited prior to any fill of the feature and/or at subsequent points during fill of the feature with tungsten or a tungsten-containing material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">In certain implementations, the nucleation layer is deposited using a pulsed nucleation layer (PNL) technique. In a PNL technique, pulses of a reducing agent, optional purge gases, and tungsten-containing precursor are sequentially injected into and purged from the reaction chamber. The process is repeated in a cyclical fashion until the desired thickness is achieved. PNL broadly embodies any cyclical process of sequentially adding reactants for reaction on a semiconductor substrate, including atomic layer deposition (ALD) techniques. PNL techniques for depositing tungsten nucleation layers are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,635,965; 7,005,372; 7,141,494; 7,589,017, 7,772,114, 7,955,972 and 8,058,170, and U.S. Patent Publication No. 2010-0267235, all of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties. Nucleation layer thickness can depend on the nucleation layer deposition method as well as the desired quality of bulk deposition. In general, nucleation layer thickness is sufficient to support high quality, uniform bulk deposition. Examples may range from 5 Å-100 Å.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">Fluorine (F) in deposited tungsten films and tungsten precursors may react during further integration operations to form highly reactive hydrofluoric acid (HF). HF can eat into oxide in oxide stacks, for example, or otherwise negatively affect integration. Conventional methods of depositing tungsten nucleation layers that use fluorinated precursors, such as tungsten hexafluoride (WF<sub>6</sub>), result in some amount of fluorine in the nucleation layers. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a process flow diagram illustrating certain operations in an example of a method of depositing a tungsten nucleation layer. The method described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> results in a tungsten nucleation layer having low fluorine content.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">The method described below with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> involves exposing a substrate to alternating pulses of a reducing agent and fluorine-containing tungsten precursor. According to various embodiments, exposure to these alternating pulses may involve temporal switching or spatial switching. Temporal switching may be performed if the substrate remains stationary in a particular environment such as a chamber. Spatial switching may involve moving the substrate to a different environment. While the below description chiefly refers to temporal switching (and so assumes that the substrate remains in a particular chamber environment throughout the deposition), it is understood that the method can also be implemented by spatial switching.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">At block <b>202</b>, the process involves pulsing a reducing agent in a chamber housing a wafer or other substrate. The reducing agent is a compound that can reduce (and/or forming a decomposition product that can reduce) a tungsten precursor to form tungsten (W). The reducing agent may be a stronger reducing agent than hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>), with examples including silicon-containing reducing agents such as silanes, boron-containing reducing agents such as boranes, and germanium-reducing agents such as germanes. Specific examples include silane (SiH<sub>4</sub>), disilane (Si<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>), borane (BH<sub>3</sub>), diborane (B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>), germane (GeH<sub>4</sub>) and digermane (Ge<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>). Other reducing agents such as hydrazines may be employed. In some embodiments, the reducing agent or a decomposition product thereof may be adsorbed or other otherwise deposited onto the substrate surface and available to react. At block <b>204</b>, excess reducing agent that is not deposited on the substrate surface is purged from the chamber. A purge operation may not be performed in some embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">At block <b>206</b>, a fluorine-containing tungsten precursor such as WF<sub>6 </sub>is pulsed in the chamber housing the substrate, the chamber being at a low chamber pressure during the pulse. Low pressure is less than 10 Torr. In some implementations, the pressure is less than 7 Torr, less than 5 Torr, or 3 Torr or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">In the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the substrate remains in a single chamber during the process. As such, the chamber may be at low pressure during any of the operations of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In some embodiments, the chamber pressure is substantially constant during the process. One having ordinary skill in the art will understand that a substantially constant chamber pressure includes a chamber pressure that has minor fluctuations due to the introduction of different gas flows, etc. In some embodiments, however, chamber pressure can be higher in block <b>202</b> than in block <b>206</b>. The fluorine-containing tungsten precursor reacts with the reducing agent or decomposition product to form a layer or sub-layer of a tungsten film. As described further below, by performing block <b>206</b> at low pressure, the amount of fluorine incorporated into the film is significantly reduced. Blocks <b>202</b>-<b>206</b> may be optionally repeated one or more times to build up a desired thickness of tungsten. Block <b>208</b>. Various modifications may be made to the process depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In some embodiments, for example, block <b>206</b> may be performed prior to block <b>202</b> such that the fluorine-containing tungsten precursor may be pulsed prior to the reducing agent pulse. As such, the fluorine-containing precursor or a decomposition product thereof may be adsorbed onto the substrate available to react with the incoming pulse of reducing agent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a plot showing fluorine (F) concentration profiles for tungsten (W)/titanium nitride TiN/undoped silicon glass (USG) stacks, with profiles shown for a stack having a W layer deposited at 3 Torr, 10 Torr and 40 Torr by ALD, respectively. Tungsten hexafluoride and diborane were used as the tungsten precursor and reducing agent, respectively. Each profile is characterized by a relatively flat portion up to a depth of about 275 Å, followed by a rise in F concentration at the W/TiN interface, and a decrease as the depth increases into the TiN/USG interface and USG layer. The rise shown in the W layer is an artifact of the measurement process, and likely reflects F content in the TiN layer. As such, the F content in the W layer is best indicated by the flat portion of the profile.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">Notably, while the 10 Torr film (line <b>304</b>) has significantly lower fluorine content than the 40 Torr film (line <b>306</b>), the ALD film deposited at less than 10 Torr (line <b>302</b>) has over 100× fluorine content reduction as compared to films deposited at 10 Torr (line <b>304</b>) and 40 Torr (line <b>306</b>). The flat portion of line <b>302</b> is at 10<sup>17 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, below the detection level of the tool used to measure fluorine, indicating that the fluorine level may be lower than 10<sup>17 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>. This measurement level also corresponds to tungsten deposited using a fluorine-free precursor, indicating that the low pressure (&lt;10 Torr) process may be used to deposit an essentially fluorine-free tungsten nucleation layer using a fluorine-containing precursor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">The low pressure process also reduces the amount of fluorine in an underlying dielectric layer in some embodiments. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a plot showing fluorine F concentration profiles for tungsten W/TiN/thermal oxide with the W deposited by ALD on thin (30 Å) TiN barrier layers. Profiles of three 300 Å W nucleation/30 Å TiN/1000 Å thermal oxide stacks are shown, with the 300 Å W tungsten nucleation layers deposited at 3 Torr, 10 Torr and 40 Torr, respectively. Here, the F concentration in the 3 Torr W layer is below the F detection level (as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Further, the lower pressure process results in lower F concentration in the thermal oxide layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">As indicated above, the low pressure ALD deposition of a tungsten nucleation layer using a fluorine-containing tungsten precursor results in fluorine content comparable to films deposited using fluorine-free precursors or by physical vapor deposition (PVD) of a solid tungsten target. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a plot showing F concentration profiles for W/TiN/thermal oxide stacks. Profiles are shown for the following W deposition methods: ALD at 40 Torr using WF<sub>6 </sub>(line <b>506</b>), ALD at 10 Torr using WF<sub>6 </sub>(line <b>504</b>), ALD at 3 Torr using WF<sub>6 </sub>(line <b>502</b>), ALD at 40 Torr using a fluorine-free tungsten (FFW) precursor (line <b>505</b>), and PVD (line <b>503</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows that the F percentage in the bulk of the W ALD film is greatest for the 40 Torr ALD process, followed by the 10 Torr ALD process. F content in the 10 Torr ALD film is approximately equal to that in the FFW film. The F content is lowest in the 3 Torr ALD and PVD films. Notably, there is less F measured in the 3 Torr WF<sub>6 </sub>film than a FFW film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">At the TiN/oxide interface, the F content is highest for the 40 Torr ALD film, followed by (in order) the 10 Torr ALD film, the 3 Torr ALD film, and the FFW and PVD films.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">The non-linear correlation of fluorine content to chamber pressure seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref> was unexpected, in part because fluorine in WF<sub>6</sub>-based ALD deposited films is generally fairly unresponsive to variations in other process parameters such as temperature. Raising the substrate temperature can reduce fluorine content to some extent, but not enough to approach that of a FFW film. Further, an increase in temperature results in a decrease in step coverage. By contrast, the low pressure processes disclosed herein can result in excellent step coverage (e.g., at least 90%). It should also be noted that CVD deposition using fluorine-based tungsten precursors does not respond to chamber pressure in the manner shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>. Without being bound by a particular theory, it is believed that low chamber pressure during an ALD process may allow fluorine (F<sub>2</sub>) or other F-containing byproducts of the reaction to diffuse out of the W film or leave the surface of the W film as it is deposited.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">In the process of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a carrier gas may be used to deliver the reactants to the chamber. If used, the carrier gas typically has a much higher flow rate than the reactants such that the chamber pressure may be approximated by the partial pressure of the carrier gas. The carrier gas may also function as the purge gas between reactant pulses, or a separate purge gas may be used. An inert component such as argon, xenon, krypton, nitrogen, or helium may be used as a carrier gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">According to various implementations, hydrogen may or may not be run in the background in addition to or instead of another carrier gas. In some embodiments, hydrogen is not run in the background, such that the nucleation layer deposition is a hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>)-free process. Adding H<sub>2 </sub>can improve fluorine reduction, possibly due to the generation of HF.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">In addition to preventing the deleterious effects of fluorine contamination, the low pressure process can result in reduced resistivity. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows resistivity measurements for a 40 Torr ALD process (with H<sub>2 </sub>in the background) and a 3 Torr ALD process with no H<sub>2</sub>. WF<sub>6 </sub>was used as the tungsten containing precursor and B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6 </sub>as the reducing agent. Resistivity is significantly lower for the low pressure process, which may be due to the reduced amount of F impurity in the film. It should be noted that the films deposited in generating the data in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> were amorphous, with the resistivity of the 3 Torr film very low for an amorphous film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">It is noted that the 3 Torr ALD depositions used to generate the data in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref> were performed on different tools than the 10 Torr and 40 Torr ALD depositions due to limitations in the tool used to deposit at 10 Torr and 40 Torr.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, a first tungsten layer may be deposited by a fluorine-free process prior to depositing a tungsten layer by ALD at low pressure using a fluorine-containing tungsten precursor. Such processes may be useful, for example, to reduce fluorine content in an underlying layer or at an interface between layers. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a process flow diagram illustrating certain operations in an example of a method of depositing tungsten. The method includes depositing a first tungsten layer in a non-fluorine process (<b>702</b>). The first tungsten layer may be deposited, for example, on a barrier or adhesion layer, such as a titanium (Ti), TiN, Ti/TiN, tungsten nitride (WN), or other layer. In some implementations the first tungsten may be deposited directly on a dielectric layer, such as a silicon oxide layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">Examples of non-fluorine processes include ALD and CVD processes that use no fluorine-containing precursors. Examples of fluorine-free tungsten precursors that may be used include tungsten hexacarbonyl (W(CO)<sub>6</sub>), tungsten chlorides such as tungsten hexachloride (WCl<sub>6</sub>) and tungsten pentachloride (WCl<sub>5</sub>), and organotungsten precursors such as W<sub>2</sub>(NMe<sub>2)</sub>6, W(OEt)<sub>6</sub>, W(OnPr)<sub>6</sub>, (tBuN═)<sub>2</sub>W(NMe<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, (tBuN═)<sub>2</sub>W(NEtMe)<sub>2</sub>, W(Cp)<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, W(NEt<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(NEt)<sub>2</sub>, W(iPrCp)<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, (tBuN═)<sub>2</sub>W(HNMe)<sub>2</sub>, W(EtCp)<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2 </sub>and derivatives thereof. Further examples include ethylcyclopentadienyl-dicarbonylnitrosyl-tungsten (EDNOW), methylcyclopentadienyl-dicarbonylnitrosyl-tungsten (MDNOW), and ethylcyclopentadienyl)tricarbonylhydridotungsten (ETHW), available from Praxair, as well as tungsten bis(alkylimino)bis(alkylamino) compounds having the following structure:</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">The first tungsten layer may be deposited to a thickness sufficient to prevent fluorine from a fluorine-containing tungsten process in a subsequent deposition from reaching an underlying material. Example thicknesses may range from 10 Å to 100 Å, though thicknesses outside these ranges may be implemented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">The method continues by depositing a second tungsten layer by low pressure ALD using a fluorine-containing precursor. Block <b>704</b>. The second tungsten layer may be a tungsten nucleation layer deposited directly on the first tungsten layer. Block <b>704</b> may involve a process as described above with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">Deposition rate for block <b>704</b> may be significantly higher than for block <b>702</b>. As such, block <b>702</b> may result in a fluorine-free layer that protects an underlying layer from fluorine with block <b>704</b> resulting in a faster deposition with very low fluorine content.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, deposition of a tungsten nucleation layer may be followed by one or more treatment operations prior to tungsten bulk deposition. Treating a deposited tungsten nucleation layer to lower resistivity is described for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,772,114 and 8,058,170 and U.S. Patent Publication No. 2010-0267235, incorporated by reference herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">Low pressure ALD deposition of a tungsten layer may be followed by tungsten bulk deposition. Tungsten bulk deposition can occur by a CVD process in which a reducing agent and a tungsten-containing precursor are flowed into a deposition chamber to deposit a bulk fill layer in the feature. An inert carrier gas may be used to deliver one or more of the reactant streams, which may or may not be pre-mixed. Unlike PNL or ALD processes, the CVD operation generally involves flowing the reactants continuously together until the desired amount is deposited. In certain implementations, the CVD operation may take place in multiple stages, with multiple periods of continuous and simultaneous flow of reactants separated by periods of one or more reactant flows diverted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">Various tungsten-containing gases including, but not limited to, WF<sub>6</sub>, WCl<sub>6</sub>, WCl<sub>5</sub>, W(CO)<sub>6 </sub>or the organotungsten precursors listed above can be used as the tungsten-containing precursor. In certain implementations, the tungsten-containing precursor is a halogen-containing compound, such as WF<sub>6</sub>. In certain implementations, the reducing agent is hydrogen gas, though other reducing agents may be used including silane (SiH<sub>4</sub>), disilane (Si<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) hydrazine (N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>), diborane (B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) and germane (GeH<sub>4</sub>). In many implementations, hydrogen gas is used as the reducing agent in the CVD process. In some other implementations, a tungsten precursor that can decompose to form a bulk tungsten layer can be used. Bulk deposition may also occur using other types of processes including ALD processes. Still further, bulk deposition may occur using a sequential CVD process. Descriptions of such processes are given in concurrently-filed U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/723,270. Examples of temperatures may range from 200° C. to 500° C. According to various implementations, any of the CVD W operations described herein can employ a low temperature CVD W fill, e.g., at about 250° C. to 350° C. or about 300° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">Deposition may proceed according to various implementations until a certain feature profile is achieved and/or a certain amount of tungsten is deposited. In some implementations, the deposition time and other relevant parameters may be determined by modeling and/or trial and error. For example, for an initial deposition for an inside out fill process in which tungsten can be conformally deposited in a feature until pinch-off, it may be straightforward to determine based on the feature dimensions the tungsten thickness and corresponding deposition time that will achieve pinch-off. In some implementations, a process chamber may be equipped with various sensors to perform in-situ metrology measurements for end-point detection of a deposition operation. Examples of in-situ metrology include optical microscopy and X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) for determining thickness of deposited films.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">It should be understood that the any of the tungsten films described herein may include some amount of other compounds, dopants and/or impurities such as nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, boron, phosphorous, sulfur, silicon, germanium and the like, depending on the particular precursors and processes used. The tungsten content in the film may range from 20% to 100% (atomic) tungsten. In many implementations, the films are tungsten-rich, having at least 50% (atomic) tungsten, or even at least about 60%, 75%, 90%, or 99% (atomic) tungsten. In some implementations, the films may be a mixture of metallic or elemental tungsten (W) and other tungsten-containing compounds such as tungsten carbide (WC), tungsten nitride (WN), etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">CVD, ALD and low pressure ALD deposition of these materials can include using any appropriate precursors. For example, CVD and ALD deposition of tungsten nitride can include using halogen-containing and halogen-free tungsten-containing and nitrogen-containing compounds as described further below. CVD and ALD deposition of titanium-containing layers can include using precursors containing titanium with examples including tetrakis(dimethylamino)titanium (TDMAT) and titanium chloride (TiCl<sub>4</sub>), and if appropriate, one or more co-reactants. CVD and ALD deposition of tantalum-containing layers can include using precursors such as pentakis-dimethylamino tantalum (PDMAT) and TaF<sub>5 </sub>and, if appropriate, one or more co-reactants. CVD and ALD deposition of cobalt-containing layers can include using precursors such as tris(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato)cobalt, bis(cyclopentadienyl)cobalt, and dicobalt hexacarbonyl butylacetylene, and one or more co-reactants. CVD and ALD deposition of nickel-containing layers can include using precursors such as cyclopentadienylallylnickel (CpAllylNi) and MeCp<sub>2</sub>Ni. Examples of co-reactants can include N<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, SiH<sub>4</sub>, Si<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>, and AlCl<sub>3</sub>.

Thus, for example, diborane and tungsten hexafluoride may be alternately introduced to the surface of the semiconductor substrate, at the station, using an individual gas supply system that creates a localized atmosphere at the substrate surface. Another station may be used for fluorine-free tungsten deposition, or CVD. Two or more stations may be used to deposit tungsten in a parallel processing.
