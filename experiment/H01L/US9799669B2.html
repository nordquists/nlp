<heading id="h-0002">FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to the field of semiconductor devices and specifically to three-dimensional non-volatile memory devices, such as vertical NAND strings and other three-dimensional devices, and methods of making the same.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Recently, ultra high density storage devices have been proposed using a three-dimensional (3D) stacked memory structure sometimes referred to as Bit Cost Scalable (BiCS) architecture. For example, a 3D NAND stacked memory device can be formed from an array of alternating conductive and dielectric layers. A memory opening is formed through the layers to define many memory layers simultaneously. A NAND string is then formed by filling the memory opening with appropriate materials. A straight NAND string extends in one memory opening, while a pipe- or U-shaped NAND string (p-BiCS) includes a pair of vertical columns of memory cells. Control gates of the memory cells may be provided by the conductive layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">During formation of memory cells for the BiCS architecture, a memory film layer is deposited in each memory opening through an alternating stack of first material layers and second material layers. In order to protect vertical portions of the memory film layer during a subsequent anisotropic etch, a first semiconductor material layer may be conformally deposited on the contiguous memory film layer. The horizontal bottom portion of the memory film layer can be removed from each memory opening by an anisotropic etch to physically expose a first electrode or the substrate underlying the memory opening. A second semiconductor material layer is subsequently deposited directly on the first electrode or the substrate exposed in the memory opening and on the first semiconductor material layer. The first and second semiconductor material layers collectively function as a semiconductor channel of each memory cell in the NAND string.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, a method of fabricating a memory device is provided. A stack of alternating layers of a first material and a second material different from the first material is formed over a substrate including a semiconductor material. A portion of the stack is etched to form a memory opening extending from a top surface of the stack to a top surface of the substrate. A memory film layer is formed within the memory opening, and a sacrificial material layer is formed on the memory film layer. Horizontal portions of the sacrificial material layer and the memory film layer are etched to physically expose a portion of the top surface of the substrate underneath the memory opening, while leaving a vertical portion of the sacrificial material layer remaining on a vertical portion of the memory film layer. The sacrificial material layer is removed selective to a remaining portion of the memory film layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, a three-dimensional memory device is provided, which includes a substrate having a major surface, and an alternating stack of insulating material layers and control gate electrodes located over the substrate. The alternating stack has a memory opening extending through the alternating stack in a direction substantially perpendicular to the major surface. The three-dimensional memory device further includes a memory film located at a peripheral region of the memory opening, a semiconductor channel including a vertical portion extending substantially perpendicular to the major surface and contacting an inner sidewall of the memory film, and a single crystalline doped semiconductor material portion located within, or on, the substrate. A sidewall of the upper portion of the semiconductor channel in contact with the memory film is laterally offset with respect to a sidewall of the lower portion of the semiconductor channel in contact with the memory film. The semiconductor channel does not include a substantially contiguous interface composed of grain boundaries, not contacting the memory film, and vertically extending through the semiconductor channel between a plurality of the control gate electrodes.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">As discussed above, the present disclosure is directed to three-dimensional non-volatile memory devices, such as vertical NAND strings and other three-dimensional devices, and methods of making the same, the various aspects of which are described below. The embodiments of the disclosure can be employed to form various semiconductor devices such as three-dimensional monolithic memory array devices comprising a plurality of NAND memory strings. The drawings are not drawn to scale. Multiple instances of an element may be duplicated where a single instance of the element is illustrated, unless absence of duplication of elements is expressly described or clearly indicated otherwise. Ordinals such as “first,” “second,” and “third” are employed merely to identify similar elements, and different ordinals may be employed across the specification and the claims of the instant disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">The two step semiconductor material deposition process in the prior art creates a substantially contiguous interface between the semiconductor layers. The substantially contiguous interface extends substantially throughout the entire extent of the first and second semiconductor material layers. A substantially contiguous set of grain boundaries typically run along the interface. The present inventors realized that the presence of the substantially contiguous set of grain boundaries between the first and second semiconductor material layers in prior art semiconductor channels is a significant source of defects in the semiconductor channel, increases the overall grain boundary area (i.e., the grain interface area), and often has the effect of reducing the average grain size in the semiconductor channel. Electrical characteristics of the memory cells can deteriorate due the large number of lattice defects that are concentrated at the grain boundary interfaces. The smaller the grain size, and the larger the interface area between grain boundaries, the larger the number of defects in semiconductor channel. Further, in order to form a contiguous film having a uniform thickness, each of the first and second semiconductor material layers needs to have a thickness greater than a minimum thickness required for uniform thickness. Due to such constraints, the two step doped semiconductor material deposition process as known in the art may lead to deterioration of boosting potential and program disturb, deterioration of the cell current, an increase in the variability of the memory cells, and/or an increase in the program noise.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">A memory film layer is formed in a memory opening through an alternating stack of first material layers and second material layers for a three dimensional, vertical NAND string. A sacrificial material layer is deposited on the memory film layer. Horizontal portions of the sacrificial material layer and the memory film layer at the bottom of the memory opening are removed by an anisotropic etch to expose a first electrode or the substrate underlying the memory opening, while vertical portions of the sacrificial material layer protect vertical portions of the memory film layer. After selective removal of the sacrificial material without removing the memory film, a single semiconductor material layer can be formed on the first electrode or the substrate, and directly on the memory film as a single “uninterrupted” material layer, i.e., a material layer that does not include any interfacial layer therein as a consequence of being deposited in a single deposition step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">In one embodiment, the single semiconductor material layer can be a doped semiconductor material layer. In another embodiment, the single semiconductor material layer may not be an intentionally doped semiconductor material. If not intentionally doped, the single semiconductor material layer still may have a certain level of doping by p-type dopants or n-type dopants. In the case the single semiconductor material layer is a polysilicon layer, the type of doping may be p-type in one example, and the atomic concentration of the p-type dopants may be in a range from 5.0×10<sup>16</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>to 5.0×10<sup>17 </sup>cm/<sup>3</sup>, although higher or lower atomic concentrations can also occur depending on the process employed. The semiconductor material layer, whether doped intentionally or unintentionally, does not include any contiguous set of grain boundaries that runs parallel to the interface between the semiconductor material layer and the memory film. Dopant implantation and/or surface treatment of the first electrode or the substrate; vertical recessing of first electrode or the substrate; lateral recessing of the memory film selective to the sacrificial material layer; and/or formation of an epitaxial semiconductor material portion of the channel may be optionally performed prior to formation of the semiconductor material layer. Surface treatment of the semiconductor material layer may also be performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">A monolithic three dimensional memory array is one in which multiple memory levels are formed above a single substrate, such as a semiconductor wafer, with no intervening substrates. The term “monolithic” means that layers of each level of the array are directly deposited on the layers of each underlying level of the array. In contrast, two dimensional arrays may be formed separately and then packaged together to form a non-monolithic memory device. For example, non-monolithic stacked memories have been constructed by forming memory levels on separate substrates and vertically stacking the memory levels, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,915,167 titled “Three Dimensional Structure Memory.” The substrates may be thinned or removed from the memory levels before bonding, but as the memory levels are initially formed over separate substrates, such memories are not true monolithic three dimensional memory arrays. The substrate may include integrated circuits fabricated thereon, such as driver circuits for a memory device</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">The various three dimensional memory devices of the present disclosure include a monolithic three-dimensional NAND string memory device, and can be fabricated employing the various embodiments described herein. The monolithic three dimensional NAND string is located in a monolithic, three dimensional array of NAND strings located over the substrate. At least one memory cell in the first device level of the three dimensional array of NAND strings is located over another memory cell in the second device level of the three dimensional array of NAND strings.</div>

In this case, the substrate semiconductor layer <b>10</b> can be the top semiconductor layer of an SOI substrate, a semiconductor material layer in a bulk portion, or a top semiconductor portion of in an SOI region of a hybrid substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">The substrate semiconductor layer <b>10</b> is a semiconductor material layer, and can include at least one elemental semiconductor material, at least one III-V compound semiconductor material, at least one II-VI compound semiconductor material, at least one organic semiconductor material, or other semiconductor materials known in the art. The substrate <b>8</b> has a major surface <b>9</b>, which can be, for example, a topmost surface of the substrate semiconductor layer <b>10</b>. The major surface <b>9</b> can be a semiconductor surface. In one embodiment, the major surface <b>9</b> can be a single crystalline semiconductor surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">As used herein, a “semiconductor material” refers to a material having a resistivity in the range from 1.0×10<sup>−5 </sup>Ohm-cm to 1.0×10<sup>5 </sup>Ohm-cm, and is capable of producing a doped material having a resistivity in a range from 1.0×10<sup>−5 </sup>Ohm-cm to 1.0 Ohm-cm upon suitable doping with an electrical dopant. As used herein, an “electrical dopant” refers to a p-type dopant that adds a hole to a balance band within a band structure, or an n-type dopant that adds an electron to a conduction band within a band structure. As used herein, a “major surface” refers to a planar surface having a greater area than at least another surface that may be another planar surface or a curved surface. As used herein, a planar surface is a surface that is contained within a Euclidean two-dimensional plane or deviating from a Euclidean two-dimensional plane only by variations caused by surface bowing and/or surface roughness of a magnitude inherently present in commercially available semiconductor substrates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">The substrate semiconductor layer <b>10</b> can include a single crystalline semiconductor material, a polycrystalline semiconductor material, and/or an amorphous semiconductor material. In one embodiment, the substrate semiconductor layer <b>10</b> can be a single crystalline semiconductor material layer.

Portions of the substrate semiconductor layer <b>10</b> can be suitably doped with p-type dopants (e.g., the semiconductor layer <b>10</b> may be a p-well region in the substrate <b>8</b>) or n-type dopants.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">The optional first electrodes <b>12</b> include a doped semiconductor material. The first electrodes <b>12</b> can be formed as doped portions of the substrate semiconductor layer <b>10</b>, i.e., by doping portions of the substrate semiconductor layer <b>10</b> with p-type dopants or n-type dopants. In one embodiment, the first electrodes <b>12</b> can be formed as source regions or drain regions for monolithic three-dimensional NAND string memory devices to be subsequently formed. The first electrodes <b>12</b> may be suitably patterned to be electrically shorted to neighboring first electrodes <b>12</b> along one direction and/or electrically isolated from neighboring first electrodes <b>12</b> along another direction in an array configuration for the monolithic three-dimensional NAND string memory devices. Alternatively, the source or drain regions in the substrate may be formed at a later step in the process by ion implantation through a back side opening, as will be described in more detail below. While embodiments employing a semiconductor substrate for the substrate <b>8</b> are illustrated herein, embodiments employing non-semiconductor substrates are also contemplated herein, provided that the first electrodes <b>12</b> including a conductive material (which may be doped semiconductor material) can be formed in, or on, a non-semiconductor substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">Optionally, select gate electrodes (not shown) can be formed within, or on top of, the substrate semiconductor layer <b>10</b> employing previously known methods, or methods yet to be invented, for implementing the array of vertical NAND strings. For example, a lower select gate device level may be fabricated as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/133,979, filed on Dec. 19, 2013, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/225,116, filed on Mar. 25, 2014, and/or U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/225,176, filed on Mar. 25, 2014, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">In one embodiment, a top surface of each first electrode <b>12</b> can be physically exposed at the front side (upper side) of the substrate <b>8</b>. Alternatively, a protective film (not shown), such as a silicon dioxide layer, may be provided on the top surface of the substrate <b>8</b> in order to provide temporary protection for the substrate semiconductor layer <b>10</b> and/or the first electrodes <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a stack of alternating layers of a first material and a second material different from the first material is formed over the substrate <b>8</b>. The stack of the alternating layers is herein referred to as an alternating stack (<b>32</b>, <b>34</b>). In one embodiment, the alternating stack (<b>32</b>, <b>42</b>) can include first material layers <b>32</b> composed of the first material, and second material layers <b>42</b> composed of a second material different from that of first material layers <b>32</b>. The second material layers may comprise electrically conductive material which forms the control gate electrodes of the NAND string. Alternatively, the second material layers <b>42</b> may comprise electrically insulating or conductive sacrificial layers which are removed through the back side openings and replaced with metal control gate electrodes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">The first material can be at least one electrically insulating material. As such, each first material layer <b>32</b> can be an insulating material layer. Electrically insulating materials that can be employed for the first material layers <b>32</b> include, but are not limited to silicon oxide (including doped or undoped silicate glass), silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, organosilicate glass (OSG), spin-on dielectric materials, dielectric metal oxides that are commonly known as high dielectric constant (high-k) dielectric oxides (e.g., aluminum oxide, hafnium oxide, etc.) and silicates thereof, dielectric metal oxynitrides and silicates thereof, and organic insulating materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">The second material layers <b>42</b> can function as control gate electrodes made of at least one conductive material. In this case, each second material layer <b>42</b> can be a conductive material layer. Conductive materials that can be employed for the second material layers <b>42</b> that constitute the control gate electrodes include, but are not limited to, a doped semiconductor material, elemental metals, intermetallic alloys, conductive nitrides of at least one elemental metal, a silicate of at least one metal, conductive carbon allotropes, organic conductive materials, and combinations thereof. For example, the second material can be doped polysilicon, tungsten, tungsten nitride, tantalum, tantalum nitride, titanium, titanium nitride, cobalt, copper, aluminum, an alloy thereof, or a combination thereof. Alternatively, the second material layers <b>42</b> may comprise sacrificial layers, such as silicon nitride or polysilicon sacrificial layers. In this case, at least one, and/or each, of the second material layers <b>42</b> can be a sacrificial material layer. In an illustrative example, the second material layers <b>42</b> can be silicon nitride layers that can be subsequently removed, for example, by a wet etch employing phosphoric acid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">In one embodiment, the first material layers <b>32</b> can include silicon oxide, and second material layers can include silicon nitride sacrificial layers or doped polysilicon or doped amorphous silicon layers that can be subsequently converted into doped polysilicon through a thermal anneal at an elevated temperature. The first material of the first material layers <b>32</b> can be deposited, for example, by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). For example, if silicon oxide is employed for the first material layers <b>32</b>, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) can be employed as the precursor material for the CVD process. The second material of the second material layers <b>42</b> can be formed, for example, by physical vapor deposition (PVD; sputtering), chemical vapor deposition, electroplating, electroless plating, or combinations thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">The second material layers <b>42</b> can be suitably patterned to function as the control gate electrodes of the monolithic three-dimensional NAND string memory devices to be subsequently formed. Each second material layer <b>42</b> may comprise a portion having a strip shape extending substantially parallel to the major surface <b>9</b> of the substrate <b>8</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">The thicknesses of the first material layers <b>32</b> and the second material layers <b>42</b> can be in a range from 8 nm to 128 nm, although lesser and greater thicknesses can be employed for each first material layer <b>32</b> and for each control gate electrode <b>42</b>. In one embodiment, the thicknesses of the first material layers <b>32</b> and the second material layers <b>42</b> can be in a range from 20 nm to 50 nm. The number of repetitions of the pairs of a first material layer <b>32</b> and a second material layer (e.g., control gate electrode or sacrificial material) <b>42</b> can be in a range from 2 to 1,024, and typically from 8 to 256, although a greater number of repetitions can also be employed. The top and bottom gate electrodes in the stack may function as the select gate electrodes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, a lithographic material stack <b>48</b> can be formed over the top surface of the alternating stack (<b>32</b>, <b>42</b>). The lithographic material stack <b>48</b> can include, for example, an organic planarization layer (OPL) <b>45</b>, such as amorphous carbon, an antireflective coating (ARC) layer <b>46</b>, and a photoresist layer <b>47</b>. The photoresist layer <b>47</b> can be lithographically patterned, for example, by lithographic exposure and development, to form openings therein. The pattern of the openings corresponds to the areas of memory openings to be subsequently formed through the alternating stack (<b>32</b>, <b>42</b>). For example, the pattern of the openings in the patterned photoresist layer <b>47</b> can be circular, elliptical, polygonal, or of a closed curvilinear shape. As used herein, a “closed” shape refers to a two-dimensional shape that is defined by a contiguous periphery that begins and ends at a same point without crossing itself, i.e., a shape defined by a periphery that can be traced throughout the entirety of the periphery to come back to the starting point without crossing any portion of the periphery during the tracing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">In one embodiment, each shape for an opening in the photoresist layer <b>47</b> (and the corresponding shape for a memory opening to be subsequently formed) can be identical, or can be related to a neighboring shape through symmetry. In this case, the pattern of the opening in the photoresist layer <b>47</b> can be a periodic pattern. In one embodiment, the shapes of the openings in the patterned photoresist layer <b>47</b> can be substantially circular or substantially elliptical. In one embodiment, the sizes (e.g., a diameter or a major axis) of the openings in the patterned photoresist layer <b>47</b> can be in a range from 30 nm to 300 nm, although lesser and greater dimensions can also be employed. A hard mask layer (not shown) may be optionally employed, for example, between the lithographic material stack <b>48</b> and the top surface of the alternating stack (<b>32</b>, <b>42</b>). While an embodiment in which the lithographic material stack <b>48</b> includes an organic planarization layer (OPL) <b>45</b>, an ARC layer <b>46</b>, and a photoresist layer <b>47</b> is illustrated herein, any alternative lithographic material layer (e.g., photoresist) or any alternative lithographic material stack can be employed in lieu of the lithographic material stack <b>48</b> illustrated herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, the pattern in the patterned photoresist layer <b>47</b> can be transferred through the ARC layer <b>46</b> and the OPL <b>45</b>, and subsequently through the entirety of the alternating stack (<b>32</b>, <b>42</b>) by at least one anisotropic etch that employs the patterned photoresist layer <b>47</b>, and/or any patterned portion of the ARC layer <b>46</b> and the OPL <b>45</b>, and/or any patterned portion of a hard mask layer, if present, as an etch mask. A plurality of etch chemistries may be employed to etch through the various materials of the ARC layer <b>46</b>, the OPL <b>45</b>, the optional hard mask layer, and the alternating stack (<b>32</b>, <b>42</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">Portions of the alternating stack (<b>32</b>, <b>42</b>) underlying the openings in the photoresist layer <b>45</b> are etched to form memory openings <b>49</b>. In other words, the transfer of the pattern in the photoresist layer <b>47</b> through the alternating stack (<b>32</b>, <b>42</b>) forms the memory opening <b>49</b> through the alternating stack (<b>32</b>, <b>42</b>). The chemistry of the anisotropic etch process employed to etch through the materials of the alternating stack (<b>32</b>, <b>42</b>) can alternate to optimize etching of the first and second materials in the alternating stack (<b>32</b>, <b>42</b>). The anisotropic etch can be, for example, a series of reactive ion etches. Optionally, a sacrificial etch stop layer (not shown) may be employed between the alternating stack (<b>32</b>, <b>42</b>) and the substrate <b>8</b>.

In one aspect, the total area of a discontinuity (e.g., lack of grain boundary) within the interface is sufficiently high that the number of additional defects is high enough to degrade characteristics of the cell channel, leading to degradation of mobility, cell current, sub-threshold slope, variability, boosting potential, etc. For example, in one embodiment, the total area of a discontinuity (e.g., lack of grain boundary) within the interface is 20% or less, such as zero to 10%, for example 1 to 5% of the entire area of the interface and the discontinuity. However, in other embodiments, the number total area of the discontinuity may be higher. The discontinuity may occur due to grain growth during an annealing step which may eliminate a small portion of the grain boundaries at the interface. In other words, surfaces of grain boundaries between the outer surface of the through-stack channel <b>60</b> and the inner surface of the through-stack channel <b>60</b> cannot be adjoined to form a contiguous layer extending over an entire interface between the through-stack channel <b>60</b> and the memory film <b>50</b> and not containing a hole therein. The feature of the lack of any contiguous interface made of a subset of grain boundaries located between the outer surface of the through-stack channel <b>60</b> and the inner surface of the through-stack channel <b>60</b> is the result of a single deposition process employed to form the semiconductor material layer <b>60</b>C of the embodiments of the present disclosure. In other words, because the semiconductor material layer <b>60</b>C is formed during a single deposition process, a stack of multiple semiconductor materials does not exist in any of the through-stack channels <b>60</b>. Correspondingly, there is no contiguous interface between two material layers between the inner sidewall of a through-stack channel <b>60</b> and the outer sidewall of the through-stack channel <b>60</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">Thus, unlike prior art structures in which a semiconductor channel is formed by multiple deposition processes and inherently includes a contiguous interface of a large number of grain boundaries and/or defects that extends over the entire area of the interface between a semiconductor channel and a memory film, the through-stack channel <b>60</b> of the present disclosure does not include any contiguous interface of a large number of grain boundaries and/or defects that runs parallel to the interface between the through-stack channel <b>60</b> and the memory film <b>50</b>. By forming the semiconductor material layer <b>60</b>C employing a single deposition process in the embodiments of the present disclosure, the through-stack channel <b>60</b> of the present disclosure can provide lesser grain boundaries and higher conductivity than prior art semiconductor material layers having similar overall dimensions and similar material compositions.</div>

In this case, the sacrificial material layers can be replaced with control gate electrodes including a conductive material at a subsequent processing step, which can be, for example, after formation of the semiconductor channels and prior to, or after, formation of the second electrodes <b>72</b>.
