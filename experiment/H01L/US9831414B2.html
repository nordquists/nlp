<heading id="h-0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to surface mounted piezoelectric vibrators structurally characterized in that a package is constructed of a base having an opening on its upper-surface side and a housing portion formed in its interior, and a cover that seals the opening, and a piezoelectric vibration element and an integrated circuit element are housed in the housing portion of the base (hereinafter, simply referred to as “piezoelectric vibrator”). The invention more particularly relates to improvements in such package constructions of the piezoelectric vibrators.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Very accurate vibratory frequencies can be constantly obtained with the piezoelectric vibrators in which piezoelectric vibration elements, for example, crystal pieces, are used. Such piezoelectric vibrators are, therefore, conventionally employed in diverse fields as reference frequency sources for electronic devices. The piezoelectric vibrators typically have a structure in which an integrated circuit element is housed in a housing portion of a base with insulating properties having an opening on its upper-surface side, a piezoelectric vibration element is securely supported in the upper direction of the integrated circuit element, and a cover is provided to hermetically seal the piezoelectric vibration element. One can simplify the structure of such a piezoelectric vibrator with a relatively small number of components by customizing a one-chip integrated circuit element in which an inverter amplifier, for example, CMOS, is provided as a vibration amplifier, contributing to cost reduction. In recent years, flip-chip bonding is often employed in such piezoelectric vibrators because this bonding technique, in contrast to wire bonding, reduces the piezoelectric vibrators in size and height. An example is disclosed in JP2001-291742A, wherein pads of an integrated circuit element are flip-chip bonded, by means of metallic bumps made of such a material as gold, to internal terminal pads in the housing portion of a ceramic base by supersonic thermocompression bonding.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates the circuit configuration of a piezoelectric vibrator to be housed in the base.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">In the drawing, <b>100</b> is an integrated circuit element, and <b>200</b> is a piezoelectric vibration element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">The integrated circuit element <b>100</b> includes, for example, inverter amplifiers AMP<b>1</b> and AMP<b>2</b>, a feedback resistor Rf, a limiting resistor Rd, and capacitors C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>. Referring to the other reference symbols, P<b>1</b> to P<b>3</b> are signal input and output units of the integrated circuit element <b>100</b>, and P<b>4</b> and P<b>5</b> are signal input and output units of the piezoelectric vibration element <b>200</b>. An alternating current signal or high frequency signal i<b>1</b> is outputted from the output unit P<b>3</b> of the integrated circuit element <b>100</b>. An alternating current signal i<b>2</b> flows between the input and output units P<b>5</b> and P<b>4</b> of the piezoelectric vibration element <b>200</b> and the input and output units P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> of the integrated circuit element <b>100</b>. The integrated circuit element and the piezoelectric vibration element are thus connected in the circuit and housed in the base. In the base, the input and output units P<b>1</b> to P<b>5</b> for the signals i<b>1</b> and i<b>2</b> are connected by means of the pads of the integrated circuit element, internal terminal pads of the base, pads of the piezoelectric vibration element, and wiring patterns.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">When such a piezoelectric vibrator is miniaturized, its operation is easily adversely affected by unwanted radiation (hereinafter, called radiation noise) generated by alternating current signals and/or high frequency signals flowing from the internal terminal pad for output of the base connected to the output pad of the integrated circuit element (which corresponds to the signal output unit P<b>3</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) to the wiring patterns for output (signal output units of the integrated circuit element).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">The piezoelectric vibrator undergoes the occurrence of phase differences and potential differences due to different waveforms between signals flowing through the signal output units of the integrated circuit element and signals flowing through the internal terminals pad for input which connect the signal input and output units of the piezoelectric vibration element and also flowing through the wiring patterns which connect these pads (connecting portions of the piezoelectric vibration element) although these signals have the same frequency. These phase and current differences may prompt interactions between the integrated circuit element signals and the piezoelectric vibration element signals, possibly resulting in operational problems. Conventionally, the piezoelectric vibration element signals at the connecting portions for the piezoelectric vibration element are sine wave signals, whereas the integrated circuit element signals at the output units of the integrated circuit element are rectangular wave signals. Therefore, the integrated circuit element signals include high frequency components that generate radiation noise as well as principal vibrations. As the frequency of the piezoelectric vibrator becomes higher, the high frequency noise components are more easily radiated as electromagnetic waves. The electromagnetic wave thus radiated may adversely affect the piezoelectric vibration element signals which are vibration sources.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">The invention has an object to provide a piezoelectric vibrator hardly adversely affected by radiation noise even when miniaturized and achieving remarkable electric characteristics and high operational reliability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">To accomplish the object, the invention provides, according to a first aspect thereof, a piezoelectric vibrator, comprising:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">a base with insulating properties, having a rectangular outer shape in plan view, the base including a plurality of ceramic substrate layers stacked in at least three layers and castellations extending in vertical directions and respectively formed at four corners of the rectangular shapes of the plurality of ceramic substrate layers, the base further including a housing portion having a plurality of internal terminal pads formed therein, and an exterior portion having at least four external terminals formed on an outer bottom surface thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">an integrated circuit element electrically connected to a part of the plurality of internal terminal pads; and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">a piezoelectric vibration element electrically connected to another part of the plurality of internal terminal pads and further electrically connected to the integrated circuit element, wherein</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">the at least four external terminals are formed proximate to and in non-contact with the castellations formed at the four corners, and one of the at least four external terminals constitutes an external terminal for output of alternating current,</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">the part and the another part of the plurality of internal terminal pads are formed on respective surfaces of the ceramic substrate layers which are different layers (hereinafter, different layer surfaces),</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">externally exposed wiring patterns that provide connection between the part of the plurality of internal terminal pads and the another part of the plurality of internal terminal pads are formed on upper surfaces of first and second castellations alone, the first and second castellations being provided at one of pairs of corners among the four corners of the rectangular shape of the ceramic substrate layer constituting a middle layer between the ceramic substrate layers respectively constituting uppermost and lowermost layers of the ceramic substrate layers stacked in at least three layers,</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">the first castellation is a castellation located opposite to a third castellation in a long-side direction of the base, the third castellation being provided at one of the four corners of the rectangular shape proximate to the external terminal for output of alternating current, and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">the second castellation is a castellation provided at one of the four corners diagonally opposite to the third castellation on the rectangular shape of the base in plan view.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">As to a part of the wiring patterns that provide connection between first pads and second pads respectively for use with the integrated circuit element and the piezoelectric vibration element, the two different layer surfaces are connected only by the externally exposed wiring patterns formed on the upper surfaces at a pair of corners on the middle ceramic substrate layer. According to the invention providing such a technical feature, of conductive paths (wiring patterns) connecting the first pads and second pads respectively for use with the integrated circuit element and the piezoelectric vibration element, a conductive path connecting the two different layer surfaces can be located away from the external terminal for AC output.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">At the time of occurrence of radiation noise due to alternating current and/or high frequency signals flowing in the external terminal for AC output, the externally exposed wiring patterns constituting the conductive paths that connect the different layer surfaces of the ceramic substrate layers, because of a larger portion of their areas facing a radiation noise source than the other wiring patterns, are more easily and greatly influenced by adverse impacts resulting from the radiation noise. According to the invention, wherein the externally exposed wiring patterns are located at positions distant from the external terminal for AC output, can minimize such adverse impacts caused by the radiation noise.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">The piezoelectric vibrators increasingly miniaturized are subject to more restrictions regarding positions at which the external terminals, wiring patterns, and internal terminal pads are formed, and the externally exposed wiring patterns are more closely located to the external terminal for AC output and thereby more easily adversely affected. The invention can minimize such adverse impacts due to the radiation noise without discouraging the miniaturization of surface mounted piezoelectric vibrators.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">The externally exposed wiring patterns may also be used as external measurement terminals that measure characteristics of the piezoelectric vibration element. This obviates the need for additional castellations on long and short sides of the base in order for the external measurement terminals to be provided. If additional castellations are formed on long and short sides of the base, particularly in the piezoelectric vibrators reduced in dimensions, the already existing issues become more pronounced; narrower space of the base housing, undermined strength of the base, and difficulty in securing an area to be sealed by a cover. The invention makes it unnecessary to address these issues, and leads to more accurate measurements because the measurements can be performed in the piezoelectric vibrators finalized as a product.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">The four external terminals are formed proximate to and in non-contact with the castellations at the four corners on the outer bottom surface of the base, and the externally exposed wiring patterns are formed on the upper surfaces of the castellations, which are formed at a pair of corners on the middle ceramic substrate layer, alone. This prevents the occurrence of unfavorable events, for example, a solder used to join the piezoelectric vibrator to a circuit substrate progresses upward along the castellations of the base, or a metal-based sealing material used to join the cover to a sealing area of the base runs downward along the castellations of the base, thereby consequently avoiding the risk of short circuits between the external terminals and the external measurement terminals, and between the sealing material used to join the cover and the external measurement terminals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">According to a second aspect of the invention, in addition to the technical features described above, the piezoelectric vibrator is preferably characterized in that the piezoelectric vibration element mounted in the housing portion of the base is hermetically sealed with a cover attached to a joint area on an upper surface of the ceramic substrate layer constituting the uppermost layer and formed as a rectangular frame surrounding a rectangular space centrally located, the castellations of the ceramic substrate layer constituting the uppermost layer are formed at only four corners on an outer side of the rectangular frame of the ceramic substrate layer constituting the uppermost layer, and a chamfer or a curvature is formed at each of four corners on an inner side of the rectangular frame of the ceramic substrate layer constituting the uppermost layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">The castellations of the uppermost ceramic substrate layer are formed at only four corners on the outer side of the frame, and the chamfers or curvatures are formed at four corners on the inner side of the frame proximate to these castellations. This technical feature, in addition to the advantageous effect described above, allows further miniaturization of the piezoelectric vibrator without narrowing the joint area for the cover, while improving the strength of the base at the same time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">According to a third aspect of the invention, in addition to the technical features described above, the piezoelectric vibrator is preferably characterized in that the integrated circuit element has a rectangular shape and includes pads formed on a main surface thereof, the pads being flip-chip bonded to the part of the plurality of internal terminal pads by means of bumps,</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">the pads of the integrated circuit element include:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">two opposing first pads formed proximate to a first side of the integrated circuit element;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">two opposing second pads formed proximate to a second side opposite to the first side of the integrated circuit element; and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">two opposing third pads respectively formed between the first pads and the second pads, one of the two opposing second pads outputting alternating current,</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">the plurality of internal terminal pads of the base include:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">two opposing first internal terminal pads electrically connected to the piezoelectric vibration element and joined to the two opposing first pads of the integrated circuit element;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">two opposing second internal terminal pads joined to the two opposing second pads; and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">two opposing third internal terminal pads joined to the two opposing third pads and interposed between the two opposing first internal terminal pads and the two opposing second internal terminal pads,</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">the two opposing third internal terminal pads and two wiring patterns that respectively extend the two opposing third internal terminal pads are formed on the same surface along a part of perimeter of the two opposing first internal terminal pads to respectively form conducive paths for blocking radiation noise, and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">the two opposing first internal terminal pads and the two opposing second internal terminal pads are spaced apart with the conducive paths for blocking radiation noise interposed therebetween.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">In addition to the advantageous effects described above, by thus forming the third internal terminal pads and the wiring patterns that respectively extend the third internal terminal pads on the same surface along a part of perimeter of the first internal terminal pads, the first internal terminal pads electrically connected to the piezoelectric vibration element can be isolated from the second internal terminal pads, in one of which is the AC output is included, by the third internal terminal pads and the associated wiring patterns formed on the same surface. By virtue of this structural advantage, any radiation noise generated by high frequency signals and/or alternating current flowing through one of the second internal terminal pads is blocked by the conductive paths formed by the third internal terminal pads and the wiring patterns that respectively extend the third internal terminal pads. The radiation noise, most of which is thus blocked, hardly arrives at the first internal terminal pads formed on the same surface and connected to the piezoelectric vibration element easily adversely affected by the noise. This successfully prevents unwanted radiation (radiation noise) generated by the AC output of the second internal terminal pad from adversely affecting the piezoelectric vibration element electrically connected to the first internal terminal pads.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">Conventionally, the piezoelectric vibrators undergo the occurrence of phase differences and potential differences due to different signal waveforms between signals flowing through the AC output in one of the second internal terminal pads and signals flowing through the first internal terminal pads connected to the piezoelectric vibration element although these signals have the same frequency. These phase and current differences may prompt interactions between the AC output of the second internal terminal pad and the first internal terminal pads, possibly resulting in operational problems. On the other hand, the invention controls any operational problems caused by such interactions because the first internal terminal pads electrically connected to the piezoelectric vibration element are shut off from the second internal terminal pads in one of which the AC output is included by the conductive paths formed by the third internal terminal pads and the wiring patterns that respectively extend the third internal terminal pads on the same plane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">According to a fourth aspect of the invention, in addition to the technical features described above, the piezoelectric vibrator is preferably characterized in that the piezoelectric vibration element is an AT-cut crystal piece.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">According to a fifth aspect of the invention, in addition to the technical features described above, the piezoelectric vibrator is preferably characterized in that the base includes a bottom portion constituting a lowermost layer, a first bank portion constituting a middle layer, and a second bank portion constituting an uppermost layer, the bottom portion constituting the lowermost layer is constructed of a single plate made of a ceramic material and having a rectangular shape in plan view, the first bank portion constituting the middle layer is made of a ceramic material and formed in a frame shape in plan view on the bottom portion constituting the lowermost layer, the second bank portion constituting the uppermost layer is made of a ceramic material and formed in a frame shape in plan view on the first bank portion constituting the middle layer,</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">the housing portion of the base corresponding to the lowermost layer includes a first housing portion formed by the first bank portion constituting the middle layer to house therein the integrated circuit element, and a second housing portion formed by the second bank portion constituting the uppermost layer to house therein the piezoelectric vibration element, and the plurality of internal terminal pads are formed on an inner bottom surface of the first housing portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">According to a sixth aspect of the invention, in addition to the technical features described above, the piezoelectric vibrator is preferably characterized in that the base includes an intermediate plate portion constituting a middle layer, a third bank portion constituting an upper layer, and a fourth bank portion constituting a lower layer, the intermediate plate portion constituting the middle layer is constructed of a single plate made of a ceramic material and having a rectangular shape in plan view, the third bank portion constituting the upper layer is made of a ceramic material and formed on the intermediate plate portion constituting the middle layer, the fourth bank portion constituting the lower layer is made of a ceramic material and formed in a frame shape in plan view below the intermediate plate portion constituting the middle layer, the housing portion of the base includes a third housing portion formed by the third bank portion constituting the upper layer to house therein the piezoelectric vibration element, and a fourth housing portion formed by the fourth bank portion constituting the lower layer to house therein the integrated circuit element, and the first to third internal terminal pads are formed on an inner bottom surface of the fourth housing portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">According to a seventh aspect of the invention, in addition to the technical features described above, the piezoelectric vibrator preferably further comprises two first wiring patterns that respectively extend the two opposing first internal terminal pads to first and second castellations of the four castellations provided at the four corners of the rectangular shape of the base, two second wiring patterns that respectively extend the two opposing second internal terminal pads to remaining two castellations of the four castellations located opposite to the first and second castellations, and two wiring patterns for noise blocking extending in a short-side direction of the base from the two wiring patterns that respectively extend the two opposing third internal terminal pads to an end part of an inner bottom surface of the base.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">The examples described so far succeed in minimizing adverse impacts provoked by radiation noise without discouraging the miniaturization of the piezoelectric vibrators <b>6</b> and <b>8</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">By forming the third internal terminal pads NT<b>5</b> and NT<b>6</b> and the third wiring patterns H<b>5</b> and H<b>6</b> (partly) along two sides of the first internal terminal pads NT<b>1</b> and NT<b>2</b>, the first internal terminal pads NT<b>1</b> and NT<b>2</b> electrically connected to the piezoelectric vibration element <b>3</b> and the second internal terminal pad NT<b>3</b> for AC output can be spaced apart with the third internal terminal pads NT<b>5</b> and NT<b>6</b> and the third wiring patterns H<b>5</b> and HG interposed therebetween. Because of this structural advantage, radiation noise, if generated by high frequency signals and/or alternating current flowing in the second internal terminal pad NT<b>3</b>, can be mostly blocked by the conductive paths formed by the third internal terminal pads NT<b>5</b> and NT<b>6</b> and the third wiring patterns H<b>5</b> and H<b>6</b>, and hardly arrives at the first internal terminal pads NT<b>1</b> and NT<b>2</b> connected to the piezoelectric vibration element <b>3</b> more likely to be adversely affected by radiation noise. Thus, any adverse impacts of radiation noise generated by the AC output of the second the internal terminal pad NT<b>3</b> are controlled not to affect the piezoelectric vibration element <b>3</b> electrically connected to the first internal terminal pads NT<b>1</b> and NT<b>2</b>. Another particular advantage is to be able to suppress possible problems caused by interactions between the second internal terminal pad NT<b>3</b> for AC output and the first internal terminal pads NT<b>1</b> and NT<b>2</b> electrically connected to the piezoelectric vibration element <b>3</b> because the first internal terminal pads NT<b>1</b> and NT<b>2</b> are shut off from the second internal terminal pad NT<b>3</b> by the conductive paths formed by the third internal terminal pads NT<b>5</b> and NT<b>6</b> and the third wiring patterns H<b>5</b> and H<b>6</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">When the internal terminal pads NT<b>1</b> to NT<b>6</b> of the bases <b>1</b> and <b>7</b> and the pads <b>21</b> to <b>26</b> of the integrated circuit element <b>2</b> are flip-chip bonded by means of the bumps C, any positional displacement of the bumps C relative to the pads and/or any positional displacement between the pads and the internal terminal pads is absorbed by the first and second internal terminal pads NT<b>1</b>, NT<b>2</b>, NT<b>3</b>, and NT<b>4</b> formed in large widths. This prevents such an unfavorable event that the bumps run off the edges of the internal terminal pads NT<b>1</b> to NT<b>6</b> at the time of bonding. Because the first internal terminal pads NT<b>1</b> and NT<b>2</b> and the second internal terminal pads TN<b>3</b> and TN<b>4</b> are formed in larger widths than the third internal terminal pads NT<b>5</b> and NT<b>6</b>, integrated circuit elements <b>2</b> of various types with slightly different plane areas and/or with pads somewhat differently located can be similarly mounted on the bases <b>1</b> and <b>7</b>. This provides a diversified range of products and facilitates cost reduction. The piezoelectric vibrators <b>6</b> and <b>8</b> thus structurally characterized can be miniaturized by reducing distances between the first internal terminal pads NT<b>1</b> and NT<b>2</b> and the second and second internal terminal pads NT<b>3</b> and NT<b>4</b> without undermining the radiation noise blocking effect by the third internal terminal pads formed in smaller widths. The invention, while succeeding in miniaturizing the piezoelectric vibrators <b>6</b> and <b>8</b>, can improve mountability in flip-chip bonding of the integrated circuit element <b>2</b>, bonding reliability, and versatility.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0101">This structural advantage helps to equalize the variability of height dimensions of the respective pads when warped in a direction orthogonal to the specific sides of the housing portion in which the integrated circuit element is housed, more specifically, height dimensions of the paired first pads <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> and first internal terminal pads NT<b>1</b> and NT<b>2</b>, paired second pads <b>23</b> and <b>24</b> and second internal terminal pads NT<b>3</b> and NT<b>4</b>, and paired third pads <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> and third internal terminal pads NT<b>5</b> and NT<b>6</b>. To flip-chip bond the internal terminal pads of the bases <b>1</b> and <b>7</b> and the pads of the integrated circuit element by means of bumps by supersonic thermocompression bonding, an equal pressing force can be dispersedly applied to pairs of bumps C respectively used in the paired first pads <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> and first internal terminal pads NT<b>1</b> and NT<b>2</b>, paired second pads <b>23</b> and <b>24</b> and second internal terminal pads NT<b>3</b> and NT<b>4</b>, and paired third pads <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> and third internal terminal pads NT<b>5</b> and NT <b>6</b>. This avoids the risk of strength variability. The two third internal terminal pads NT<b>5</b> and NT<b>6</b> are substantially oppositely arranged along the virtual line L<b>2</b> orthogonal to the specific sides passing through the center point O of the housing portion in which the integrated circuit element is housed. To flip-chip bond the internal terminal pads NT<b>1</b> to NT<b>6</b> of the bases <b>1</b> and <b>7</b> and the pads <b>21</b> to <b>26</b> of the integrated circuit element <b>2</b> by means of the bumps C by supersonic thermocompression bonding, the center point of the integrated circuit element <b>2</b> can be located near an apex of warps in two directions (near the center point O according to the present example); a direction along the specific sides of the housing portion in which the integrated circuit element is housed, and a direction orthogonal to the direction. As a result, an equal pressing force and an equal compression strength are applied to the bumps C at six positions in total of the paired first pads <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> and first internal terminal pads NT<b>1</b> and NT<b>2</b>, paired second pads <b>23</b> and <b>24</b> and second internal terminal pads NT<b>3</b> and NT<b>4</b>, and paired third pads <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> and third internal terminal pads NT<b>5</b> and NT<b>6</b>. This provides an increased bonding strength and a higher reliability. Thus, the invention, while succeeding in miniaturizing the piezoelectric vibrators <b>6</b> and <b>8</b>, can stabilize the bonding strength of the bumps C in the flip-chip bonding of the integrated circuit element <b>2</b>, thereby ensuring more reliable electromechanical bonding.</div>
