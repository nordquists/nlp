<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Micron-scale device fabrication is dominated by micro-electro-mechanical structures (MEMS) technology, which typically involves a single planar substrate and serial processes. Meanwhile, centimeter-scale manufacturing is covered by a multitude of conventional machining processes. Manufacturing at the millimeter scale, however, is plagued with fabrication and assembly issues that greatly impact the cost and performance of micro-robots and other functional mechanical devices at this scale.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Three-dimensional structures and methods for their fabrication are described herein. Various embodiments of the structures and methods may include some or all of the elements, features and steps described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">A three-dimensional structure can be formed by stacking a plurality of patterned layers and bonding the plurality of patterned layers (i.e., layers having a patterned shape/features formed, e.g., by machining) at selected locations to form a laminate structure with inter-layer bonds. The laminate structure can then be expanded into an expanded three-dimensional configuration by selectively distorting at least one of the layers to produce gaps between layers while maintaining at least some of the inter-layer bonds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">The layers in the structure can include at least one rigid layer and at least one flexible layer, wherein the rigid layer includes a plurality of rigid segments, and the flexible layer can extend between the rigid segments to serve as a joint. The flexible layers are substantially less rigid than the rigid layers and can have a rigidity that is at least an order of magnitude (i.e., greater than 10× or greater than 100×) greater than the rigidity; likewise, the flexible layer can have at least 10 times or at least 100 times the flexibility of the rigid layers. The layers can then be stacked and bonded at selected locations to form a laminate structure with inter-layer bonds, and the laminate structure can be distorted or flexed to produce an expanded three-dimensional structure, wherein the layers are joined at the selected bonding locations and separated at other locations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">The methods and structures described herein can be used, for example, across and beyond the entire millimeter-scale manufacturing process (e.g., for apparatus with dimensions from 100 μm to 10 mm), and they enable mass production of precisely fabricated mechanisms, machines, and autonomous robots at this scale. Some of the manufacturing techniques described herein may be the same as or similar or analogous to those used for multi-layer printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing, while some of the assembly techniques may be the same as or similar or analogous to assembly techniques used for MEMS, paper origami, and pop-up books; and additional techniques used in those contexts may be adapted for use with this invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">When compared to traditional MEMS, the methods described herein are extremely versatile with respect to the materials that can be used. In addition, traditional MEMS are largely limited to bulk addition of materials, whereas the methods described herein can be used not only to add precisely patterned layers, but also full sub-components, such as integrated circuits, flex circuits, actuators, batteries, etc. The thermal requirements of the multi-layer, super-planar structures described herein can also be much lower, and the fabrication-equipment costs can be much lower, as well. Further still, processing steps in these methods on the various layers can be performed simultaneously in parallel, while much of MEMS processing takes place sequentially in series.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">These methods can also be used to fabricate a wide variety of devices and structures within a device, including I-beams; large actuated mirrors for use as optical switches; steerable antennae; high-speed, high-power physical switching; and robotic flying devices.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">The foregoing and other features and advantages of various aspects of the invention(s) will be apparent from the following, more-particular description of various concepts and specific embodiments within the broader bounds of the invention(s). Various aspects of the subject matter introduced above and discussed in greater detail below may be implemented in any of numerous ways, as the subject matter is not limited to any particular manner of implementation. Examples of specific implementations and applications are provided primarily for illustrative purposes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">Unless otherwise defined, used or characterized herein, terms that are used herein (including technical and scientific terms) are to be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their accepted meaning in the context of the relevant art and are not to be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein. For example, if a particular composition is referenced, the composition may be substantially, though not perfectly pure, as practical and imperfect realities may apply; e.g., the potential presence of at least trace impurities (e.g., at less than 1 or 2% by weight or volume) can be understood as being within the scope of the description; likewise, if a particular shape is referenced, the shape is intended to include imperfect variations from ideal shapes, e.g., due to machining tolerances.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">Although the terms, first, second, third, etc., may be used herein to describe various elements, these elements are not to be limited by these terms. These terms are simply used to distinguish one element from another. Thus, a first element, discussed below, could be termed a second element without departing from the teachings of the exemplary embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">Spatially relative terms, such as “above,” “upper,” “beneath,” “below,” “lower,” and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe the relationship of one element to another element, as illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the apparatus in use or operation in addition to the orientation described and/or depicted in the figures. For example, if the apparatus in the figures is turned over, elements described as “below” or “beneath” other elements or features would then be oriented “above” the other elements or features. Thus, the exemplary term, “above,” may encompass both an orientation of above and below. The apparatus may be otherwise oriented (e.g., rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">Further still, in this disclosure, when an element is referred to as being “on,” “connected to” or “coupled to” another element, it may be directly on, connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present unless otherwise specified.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments and is not intended to be limiting of exemplary embodiments. As used herein, the singular forms, “a,” “an” and “the,” are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Additionally, the terms, “includes,” “including,” “comprises” and “comprising,” specify the presence of the stated elements or steps but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other elements or steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">The apparatus of this disclosure, as described herein, can be utilized in a variety of applications, including the PARITy drivetrain described in PCT Application No. US2011/24479, entitled, “Passive Torque Balancing in a High-Frequency Oscillating System.”</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">The apparatus is a multi-layer, super-planar structure. By “planar,” we mean a layer or plane that can be distorted, flexed or folded (these terms may be used interchangeably herein). An embodiment of this structure can be achieved, for example, by forming a five-layer composite with the following sequence of layers: rigid layer, adhesive layer, flexible layer, adhesive layer, rigid layer. Alternatively, a thinner composite can be formed from a stacking of just a rigid layer, an adhesive layer, and a flexible layer, though this structure is not symmetric. The rigid layers are machined to have gaps that correspond to fold lines, while the flexible layer is continuous, thereby providing a joint where the flexible layer extends across the gaps machined from the rigid layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">Characterization of the structure as being “super-planar” means taking multiple planar layers and selectively connecting them. An analogy here can be drawn to circuit boards, where electrical vias connect circuits on different layers. Here, in contrast, the structure is made with “mechanical vias.” By stacking multiple planar layers, the range of achievable devices is greatly expanded. The super-planar structure also enables features and components to be packed into the structure that would not fit if the device could only be made out of one planar sheet. Advantageously, super-planar structures with mechanisms that operate normal to the plane can now be made with these techniques. In practice, forming Sarrus linkages between planar layers is an advantageous strategy for designing an assembly mechanism/scaffold. Other mechanisms can attach to the Sarrus links to effect the intended component rotations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">The multi-layer super-planar structure can be fabricated via the following sequence of steps, which are further described, below: (1) machine each planar layer, (2) machine or pattern adhesives, (3) stack and laminate the layers under conditions to effect bonding, (4) post-lamination machining of the multi-layer structure, (5) post-lamination treatment of the multi-layer structure, (6) freeing an assembly degree of freedom in each structure, (7) locking connections between structural members, (8) freeing any non-assembly degrees of freedom, and (9) separating finished parts from a scrap frame.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">A schematic representation of the PC-MEMS process is provided in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, illustrating how the basic operations of micromachining <b>101</b>, lamination and pick-and-place <b>102</b>, folding <b>103</b>, locking <b>104</b>, and additional micromachining <b>105</b> can be arranged to manufacture PC-MEMS machines <b>106</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">These assembly techniques can include the formation of folding joints <b>21</b>, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, wherein (a) features are first micro-machined <b>101</b> in individual material layers, and the resulting chips <b>13</b> are removed; (b) during lamination, dowel pins <b>20</b> align material layers while heat and pressure are applied; here, two rigid carbon-fiber layers <b>12</b> bonded to a flexible polyimide-film layer <b>16</b> with adhesive <b>14</b> form a five-layer laminate <b>15</b> referred to as a “linkage sub-laminate”; (c) micro-machining cuts mechanical bridges <b>17</b> that constrain individual elements, allowing the creation of articulated structures; and (d) a completed folding joint <b>21</b> is formed and removed from the surrounding scaffold <b>19</b>. The castellated pattern allows this flexure joint <b>21</b> to approximate an ideal revolute joint. All assembly folds in a more-complex assembly can be incorporated into a single “pop-up” degree of freedom, which can be locked in place by a soldering process after pop up and then released by micro-machining.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0007" num="0000">A) Mobee</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">In one embodiment, this fabrication method can produce a monolithic bee (mobee) structure <b>26</b>, shown, e.g., in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, including a rigid airframe <b>27</b>, a piezoelectric actuator <b>24</b>, a single-degree-of-freedom power transmission, and two wings <b>28</b>. The mobee <b>26</b> can include eight sub-components (e.g., an actuator <b>24</b>, an airframe <b>27</b>, a slider-crank, a transmission, two wing hinges, and two wings <b>28</b>) all co-fabricated in a single multi-layer laminate, integrating a diverse palette of layers of materials including carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer, polyimide film, piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate (PZT) for the actuator <b>24</b>, brass for pads <b>47</b> for locking the joints, and titanium for the wing spars <b>52</b>. In one embodiment, the mobee <b>26</b> has a 39-mm wingspan, an 18-mm length, an out-of-plane height of 2.4 mm, and a mass of 90 mg; and the wings <b>28</b> can reciprocate at a large angle (e.g., exceeding 120°). Furthermore, the parallel processes of “pop-up” folding and dip-solder locking replace the manual folding, assembling, and glueing used in previous processes. Elimination of all skilled manual steps enables panelized mass production of the mobee <b>26</b>. The processes described herein can likewise be used to form a wide variety of other structures, in addition to the mobee <b>26</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">1) Machining of Layers</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">In one embodiment, the multi-layer structure is formed from a multitude of thin (1.5-μm to about 150-μm thick) layers of various materials, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3<i>a</i>-<i>c</i> </figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3<i>a</i> </figref>, layers of carbon fiber <b>12</b>, adhesive <b>14</b>, and polyimide <b>16</b> are stacked with a spacer layer <b>39</b> separating respective linkages <b>35</b> and <b>37</b>, above and below. A mid-plate <b>23</b> with a raised section <b>33</b> for supporting the piezoelectric actuator <b>24</b> is also inserted between the spacer layer <b>39</b> and the lower linkage <b>37</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">These layers are laser micro-machined (e.g., by a diode-pumped solid-state pulsed laser) with desired features, usually cutting all the way through the layer to create individual planar structures, as shown, e.g., in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>. Each layer is micro-machined so as to leave a unified (contiguous) part with robust connections to surrounding alignment holes. The micro-machining can produce complex in-plane features with dimensions as small as 10 μm. In particular embodiments, many copies of the mobee device <b>26</b> are formed on a laminate panel, and the machining process removes sufficient material to form each part and part feature, while leaving thin tabs to connect each device to the surrounding laminate; in this regard, the arrangement of devices in a laminate panel can be similar to that of a batch of circuit boards attached to a surrounding laminate structure by thin, easily breakable tabs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">In this case, the tabs (bridges) <b>17</b> (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) connecting the devices to the surrounding laminate will be removed after lamination or assembly. Layers of metal, composite, polymer, etc., are machined or formed by virtually any method; and virtually any material may be used. Example machining methods include laser cutting from sheet material, photo-chemical etching, punching, electroforming, electric discharge machining, etc.—basically any method that has appropriate resolution and compatibility with the desired material. Machined layers may then be subjected to additional processes, such as cleaning/etching to remove machining debris, plating (e.g., plating fluxed copper on a layer to facilitate adhesion of solder thereto), preparation for bonding, annealing, etc. The unified nature of each layer makes handling and post-processing easy. Advantageously, each layer can be a different material and can be machined and treated differently from each of the other layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">Each layer can also advantageously be formed of a material that is sufficiently rigid, strong and tough to allow holes <b>22</b> for alignment pins <b>20</b> and other features to be machined into the layer, to facilitate easy handling, and to not distort when placed into the layup and when restrained by alignment pins <b>30</b>. In other embodiments, layers that do not have the structural stability to support alignment features can nevertheless be used by attaching such layers, in bulk form, to a rigid frame that meets these objectives without introducing enough additional thickness to disturb the other layers or parts in the laminate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">In particular examples, a very thin polymer film (e.g., 2-5 microns thick) is included among the layers. Due to its thinness and insulating qualities, the thin polymer film is prone to wrinkling and electrostatic handling issues. To address this tendency, the thin polymer film can be lightly stretched, in bulk form, to a flat and controlled state and then bonded to a thin frame that is made, for example, of thin metal or fiberglass composite. Next, the thin polymer layer can be machined with the fine part features (e.g., tiny holes in the polymer at precise locations), and the alignment hole features can be machined into the frame material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">In additional embodiments, the device can be designed to mitigate thin-layer handling issues. For example, a part within the device can be designed such that all machining pertinent to a fragile layer is performed post-lamination; and, thus, this layer will not require precision alignment when put into the laminate, though the material is advantageously capable of being placed into the laminate sufficiently flat and extending over a sufficient area to cover the desired parts of the device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">In exemplary embodiments, bulk polymer films (formed, e.g., of polyester, polyimide, etc.); metal sheets and foils [formed, e.g., of stainless steel, spring steel, titanium, copper, invar (FeNi36), nickel-titanium alloy (nitinol), aluminum, etc.]; copper-clad laminates; carbon fiber and glass fiber composites; thermoplastic or thermoset adhesive films; ceramic sheets; etc.; can be laser machined to make the layers that are laminated to form the multi-layer structure. The laser machining can be performed, e.g., with a 355-nm laser (from DPSS Lasers Inc. of Santa Clara, Calif.) with a spot size of about 7 microns on materials with typical thicknesses of 1-150-μm, although thicker layers can be machined with such a laser, well. Accordingly, this type of laser allows for very high resolution and an ability to machine almost any type of material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">2) Machining or Patterning Adhesives</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">Adhesion between layers is achieved by patterning adhesive onto one or both sides of a non-adhesive layer or by using free-standing adhesive layers (“bondplies”) <b>14</b>. In the latter case, an intrinsically adhesive layer <b>14</b>, e.g., in the form of a sheet of thermoplastic or thermoset film adhesive, or an adhesive laminate, such as a structural material layer with adhesive pre-bonded to one or both sides. The adhesive layer <b>14</b> is machined like the other layers. Specific examples of sheets that can be used as the adhesive layer <b>14</b> include sheet adhesives used in making flex circuits (e.g., DuPont FR1500 adhesive sheet) or polyimide film <b>16</b> coated with FEP thermoplastic adhesive <b>14</b> on one or both sides. Free-standing sheet adhesives can be acrylic-based for thermosets; alternatively, the adhesive can be thermoplastic, wherein the thermoplastic film can be formed of polyester, fluorinated ethylene propylene (or other fluoropolymer), polyamide, polyetheretherketone, liquid crystal polymer, thermoplastic polyimide, etc. Any of these adhesives can also be applied on one or both sides to a non-adhesive carrier. In additional embodiments, a layer may serve both as a structural layer <b>12</b> and as a thermoset adhesive <b>14</b>—for example, liquid crystal polymer or thermoplastic polyimide. Furthermore, for special types of structural layers, a variety of wafer bonding techniques that do not require an adhesive may be employed, such as fusion bonding.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">In another technique for achieving adhesion between layers, adhesive <b>14</b> is applied and patterned directly on a non-adhesive layer <b>12</b>. This technique can be used where, for example, the type of adhesive desired may not be amenable to free-standing form. Examples of such an adhesive <b>14</b> include solders, which are inherently inclined to form a very thin layer, or adhesives that are applied in liquid form (by spraying, stenciling, dipping, spin coating, etc.) and then b-stage cured and patterned. B-staged epoxy films are commonly available, but they usually cannot support themselves unless they are quite thick or reinforced with scrim.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">The resulting bond can be a “tack bond,” wherein the adhesive <b>14</b> is lightly cross-linked to an adjacent layer before laser micromachining with sufficient tack to hold it in place for subsequent machining and with sufficient strength to allow removal of the adhesive backing layer. The tack bonding allows for creation of an “island” of adhesive <b>14</b> in a press layup that is not part of a contiguous piece, which offers a significant increase in capability. Another reason for tacking the adhesive <b>14</b> to an adjacent structural layer is to allow for unsupported “islands” of adhesive <b>14</b> to be attached to another layer without having to establish a physical link from that desired adhesive patch to the surrounding “frame” of material containing the alignment features. In one embodiment, a photoimagable liquid adhesive, such as benzocyclobutene, can be applied in a thin layer, soft baked, and then patterned using lithography, leaving a selective pattern of adhesive. Other photoimagable adhesives used in wafer bonding can also be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">The adhesive <b>14</b> is patterned while initially tacked to its carrier film, aligned to the structural layer <b>12</b> using pins <b>20</b>, and then tacked to at least one adjoining layer in the layup <b>29</b> with heat and pressure (e.g., at 200° C. and 340 kPa for one hour). Alternatively, the adhesive layer can be patterned by micro-machining it as a free sheet. Tack bonding can involve application of heat and pressure at a lower intensity and for less time than is required for a complete bond of the adhesive. In yet another embodiment, the adhesive film <b>14</b> can be tack bonded in bulk, and then machined using, for example, laser skiving/etching. Advantageously, use of this variation can be limited to contexts where the machining process does not damage the host layer. Both of these variations were tried using DuPont FR1500 adhesive sheet and laser skiving.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">3) Stacking and Laminating the Layers</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">To form the multi-layer laminate structure <b>31</b>, a multitude of these layers (e.g., up to 15 layers have been demonstrated) are ultrasonically cleaned and exposed to an oxygen plasma to promote bonding and aligned in a stack by passing several vertically oriented precision dowel pins <b>20</b> respectively through several alignment apertures <b>22</b> in each of the layers, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4, 5, and 7</figref>, and by using a set of flat tooling plates with matching relief holes for the alignment pins <b>20</b>. In other embodiments, other alignment techniques (e.g., optical alignment) can be used. All layers can be aligned and laminated together.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">Linkages in the laminated layers can be planar (where all joint axes are parallel); or the joint axes can be non-parallel, allowing for non-planar linkages, such as spherical joints.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">In the fifteen-layer example, the final layup <b>29</b> included the following layers, which formed a pair of linkages (i.e., structures wherein flexible layers <b>16</b> are bonded to rigid segments <b>12</b> and extend across the gaps between the rigid segments <b>12</b>), thereby enabling flexure of the rigid segments <b>12</b> relative to one another at the flexible layer <b>16</b> in the gaps between the rigid segments <b>12</b>, wherein those exposed sections of the flexible layer <b>16</b> effectively serve as joints.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0090">The choice of the flexible layers <b>16</b>, which can be formed of a polymer—polyimide in this example—is based upon compatibility with the matrix resin in the carbon fiber. The cure cycle can reach a maximum temperature of 177° C. using a curing profile of four hours. Polyimide film (available, e.g., as KAPTON film from E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company), for example, has a sufficiently high service temperature (up to 400° C.) to survive the curing step. The polyimide film can have a thickness of, e.g., 7.5 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0091">The rigid layers <b>12</b> in this embodiment are standard cured carbon fiber sheets (e.g., with three layers of unidirectional fibers, wherein the fiber layers are oriented at 0°, 90°, and 0° to provide thickness in two orthogonal directions) having a thickness of, e.g., 100 μm. Fifteen layers are used because the adhesive sheet <b>14</b> (e.g., in the form of a B-staged acrylic sheet adhesive, commercially available, e.g., as DuPont PYRALUX FR1500 acrylic sheets) in this embodiment is separate from each layer of structural material in the layup <b>29</b> of this embodiment. Accordingly, the adhesive sheet <b>14</b> can be laser machined into a pattern differing from any structural layer, and aligned layups <b>29</b> of many layers can be made. This capability enables the fabrication of parts with many linkage layers that are perfectly or near-perfectly aligned.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0092">After the layers are stacked to form the layup <b>29</b>, pressure and heat are applied, typically in a heated platen press to cure/crosslink the adhesive layers. Specifically, the layup <b>29</b> can be cured in a heated press, autoclave, or other device that provides the atmosphere (or lack thereof), temperature, and pressure to achieve the bonding conditions required by the adhesive. One embodiment of the curing process uses 50-200 pounds-per-square-inch (psi) clamping pressure, 350° F. (177° C.) temperature, and two-hours cure time (optionally with temperature ramping control) to cure DuPont PYRALUX FR1500 acrylic sheets in a heated press with temperature, pressure, and atmosphere control.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0093">Though a single-step lamination process has been demonstrated, a process with two sequential lamination steps may be preferred in various embodiments because it provides a third technique for altering layering composition and because it may ease the problem of chip removal. A separate printed-circuit micro-electromechanical-system (PC-MEMS) structure called a “midplate” <b>23</b> can be included to alter the layer stack underneath the PZT plate <b>24</b> during initial lamination then removed, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, allowing precise accounting for the thickness of the piezoelectric plate <b>24</b>. The midplate <b>23</b> can be in the form of a simple reusable PC-MEMS laminate of a flat carbon-fiber plate containing alignment holes and a central polyimide boss <b>33</b> designed to support the lower PZT plate <b>24</b>. This initial lamination results in two sub-laminates <b>35</b> and <b>37</b>, each with a layered structure including a sequence of carbon <b>12</b>, adhesive <b>14</b>, polyimide <b>16</b>, adhesive <b>14</b>, and carbon <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3<i>b </i>and 3<i>c</i> </figref>. The midplate <b>23</b> replaces adhesive layer <b>14</b> on top of the lower sub-laminate <b>37</b>. The upper sub-laminate <b>35</b> also includes the two PZT plates <b>24</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0094">An adhesive layer <b>14</b> is tacked to the lower sub-laminate <b>37</b> and micro-machined, while the upper sub-laminate <b>35</b> is micro-machined to sever mechanical bridges on the central carbon spacer layer <b>39</b>. After chips are removed from the central carbon spacer layer <b>39</b>, these two sub-laminates <b>35</b> and <b>37</b> are stacked and laminated together to produce the laminate structure <b>31</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> <i>c. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0095">The corresponding single-step process utilizes discrete shims underneath the lower PZT plate <b>24</b> for support. In addition, machining steps often create unwanted material regions, or “chips,” which must be physically removed. When the spacer layer <b>39</b> is micro-machined after initial lamination, all chips from micro-machining can easily be removed from the exposed surface. Post-lamination machining in a single-step process results in trapped chips that must be highly engineered to enable physical removal from the internal spacer layer <b>39</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0096">4) Post-Lamination Machining</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0097">The laminate <b>31</b> is then machined (e.g., by severing tabs with a laser) to release the device(s) <b>26</b> from a surrounding frame structure in the laminate <b>31</b>. In some embodiments, additional machining that is not involved with freeing the device <b>26</b> from the external frame (circumscribing the device <b>26</b> in the laminate <b>31</b>) is reserved for after lamination (e.g., post-lamination machining of a layer that is structurally weak or that, for some other reason, cannot be precisely aligned since the weak layer is better supported after lamination).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0098">5) Post-Lamination Treatment</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0099">A post-lamination treatment can include plating or coating on an exposed layer; and/or the post-lamination treatment can include the addition of a material, such as solder paste, by silk screening or some other method, e.g., for the later joint “locking” step, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Additional components may be attached to the laminate <b>31</b> using a pick-and-place methodology. Pick-and-place operations can be used to insert discrete components into layups <b>29</b> before press lamination.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0100">For example, a stimulus responsive material <b>24</b>, such as an electroactive material, can be inserted among the layers to serve as an actuator. In one embodiment, a lead zirconate titanate piezoelectric plate <b>24</b> is mounted on a spring clip <b>25</b> in the carbon layer <b>12</b> (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) and has been demonstrated to create a functional bimorph cantilever actuator within a device. A broad range of discrete components can be inserted this way, such as mirrors or other optical components, micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), discrete sensors, etc. These components may alternatively be added earlier—e.g., before lamination at some point in the stack-up process—or they can be added after the subsequent assembly of the device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0101">Press lamination and laser micro-machining can be conducted multiple times. For example, five layers can be laser micro-machined, then press laminated, then laser micro-machined again. Another three layers can be separately laser micro-machined, then press laminated, then laser micro-machined again. These two partial layups can then be press laminated together with a single adhesive layer between them, for a final layup of nine layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0102">6) Freeing the Assembly Degree of Freedom in Each Part</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0103">The resulting laminate can then be laser micro-machined and/or scrap materials can be removed from the laminate to “release” functional components in each part. The parts, as laminated, may unfold to have many actuated and passive mechanical degrees of freedom; though, in some embodiments, restraining these non-assembly degrees of freedom during the assembly folding process is advantageous. For example, elements of a flexural linkage can be held in place (i.e., locked)—to prevent the linkages from flexing—by a rigid bar element alongside the elements or by a fixed tab forming an integral bridge between the elements and the surrounding structure. Using a machining process (e.g., punch die or laser cutting), the tabs or other features that restrain the assembly degree of freedom are severed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0104">7) Assembly</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0105">As fabricated, the mobee can be a flat multi-layer laminate with limited three dimensional structure. Its components undergo a variety of assembly trajectories to realize the final fully three-dimensional topology. A co-fabricated mechanical transmission called an “assembly scaffold” couples all of these assembly trajectories into a single degree of freedom. The mobee emerges from the manufacturing process as a three-degree-of-freedom machine, though internal mechanical connections eliminate these active degrees of freedom during assembly. The resulting mechanism uses 137 folding joints to assume a fully three-dimensional topology in one motion, similar to those created by paper folding in pop-up books.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0106">Assembly of the mobee <b>26</b> can include two parallel plates <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> of the assembly scaffold <b>19</b>, one constructed from each linkage sub-laminate <b>35</b> and <b>37</b>, coupled mechanically to form a Sarrus linkage <b>67</b>. These plates <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> surround mobee's mechanical components and are constrained to a single linear degree of freedom separating the plates <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> along their normal axes. Interior linkages <b>44</b> and <b>45</b>, driven by plate separation, are connected to each of mobee's core components to realize all desired assembly trajectories, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9<i>a </i>and 9<i>b</i> </figref>. When the top horizontally oriented plate <b>42</b> of the scaffold <b>19</b> is lifted, interior linkages drive the mobee's assembly folds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0107">The Sarrus-linkage-assembly scaffold <b>19</b> provides a versatile framework to produce diverse assembly motions coupled together into a single degree of freedom. Rotations to a wide range of angles about any axis in a linkage plane can be achieved through an appropriately designed interior linkage. The mobee also incorporates more complex interior linkages to translate the wings <b>28</b> and the actuator <b>24</b> along three separate arcs without rotation during folding assembly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0108">One plate <b>42</b>/<b>43</b> of the assembly scaffold <b>19</b> is secured to an external jig, which drives six dowel pins <b>20</b> through clearance holes in the secured plate to separate the opposing plate <b>43</b>/<b>42</b>. Separating the scaffold plates <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> initiates a single-degree-of-freedom folding assembly, causing the mobee's components to assemble into their final three-dimensional configuration. Various mechanical elements interfere upon completed folding, creating a joint stop. Tabs in one scaffold plate <b>42</b>/<b>43</b> can be folded manually and inserted into slots in the opposing plate <b>43</b>/<b>42</b>, creating support pylons that hold the assembly scaffold <b>19</b> in its folded state, allowing it to be removed from the external jig.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0109">Assembly of the final device <b>26</b> (including unfolding of the linkages <b>44</b> and <b>45</b> into multiple planes) can be performed manually by external actuation, or assembly can happen spontaneously. Where assembly is spontaneous, if one or more of the layers is pre-strained, the relaxation of the pre-strained layers can lead to the assembly of the device as soon as the assembly degree of freedom is freed. The layer that is pre-strained can be, for example, a patterned spring formed of spring steel or another spring-capable material, such as a superelastic nickel titanium alloy (nitinol) or an elastomer material that can survive the lamination conditions without annealing or degradation. The dowel pins and the pin alignment holes in the pre-strained layer can be configured to maintain this tension when the pre-strained layer is in the stack through lamination. The pre-strain can be in the form, for example, of tension or compression, though compression may require consideration of tendencies of linkages to buckle out of plane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0110">In other embodiments, actuators can be built into the laminate to effect assembly. For example, a piezoelectric bending actuator, shape memory layer, or other type of actuator can be laminated into the structure as a pick-and-place component or inserted as an integral part of a layer in the layup <b>29</b>; and the actuator can be actuated, e.g., by supplying electrical current or by changing temperature, to assemble the expanded, three-dimensional structure <b>26</b>. In one embodiment, the actuator is a bimorph cantilever including two 127-μm nickel-plated lead zirconate titanate (PZT) piezoelectric plates (PSI-5H4E, Piezo Systems, Inc.) coated with chromium to provide protection during the downstream locking process and bonded to a central carbon-fiber layer. Quasi-kinematic mating features and planar spring clips in the carbon-fiber layer <b>12</b> or titanium layer <b>41</b> can hold each plate in alignment during lamination.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0111">Advantageously, in some embodiments, the assembly of all parts is actuated via a single assembly degree of freedom so that assembly proceeds in parallel for an entire panel, rather than part by part. Assembly can be effected in several ways, depending on the design and complexity of the part. For example, a human operator can actuate the assembly degree of freedom manually or semi-automatically. In one embodiment, the assembly degree of freedom is in the form of a plate connected to a Sarrus linkage <b>67</b> that is pulled up or pushed down, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9<i>a </i>and 9<i>b</i> </figref>. Spherical joints or four-bar mechanisms can be attached to the Sarrus linkage, raising and folding other components into their three-dimensional position. Note that by having multiple rigid-flex planar layers and selective adhesion, complex mechanisms and collections of mechanisms can be released in the assembly step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0112">8) Joint Locking of Assembled Part</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0113">After assembly into a final three-dimensional structure, structural members can be bonded together in a fixed configuration (i.e., locked, fixed or frozen). In one embodiment, adhesive can be manually applied to structural members and/or joints, though this approach may not be ideal if many parts are being made. Alternatively, adjacent members that have come together to form a locked joint can be automatically laser welded. If adjacent members <b>45</b> and <b>46</b> have metal pads <b>17</b> (e.g., formed of brass) on them, then wave or dip soldering can form strong filleted bonds <b>48</b> between the members. Alternatively, solder paste can be applied, for example, by screen printing before assembly to the laminate; and then, after assembly, a re-flow step in a hot oven creates the bonds. Other variations include the use of two-part adhesives, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0114">In one embodiment, the mobee <b>26</b> includes 52 brass pads <b>47</b> distributed across outer surfaces of its linkage sub-laminates, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10<i>a </i> </figref>and shown with arrows in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10<i>a</i> </figref>. After folding, pads on disparate links align into 24 “bond points,” in the form of either two pads <b>47</b> meeting at right angles, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10<i>c </i>and 10<i>d</i> </figref>, or three pads forming the corner of a cube. The structure, held in its folded state, is submerged in a water soluble flux (e.g., Superior Supersafe No. 30) and then pre-heated in an oven at 100° C. for 10 minutes. It is then submerged in 260° C. tin-lead eutectic solder for approximately 1 second. Finally, the structure is ultrasonically cleaned in distilled de-ionized water to remove the water-soluble flux residue. The result of this soldering process is the formation of solder fillets <b>48</b> at all bond points, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10<i>d</i> </figref>, eliminating the assembly degree of freedom and locking all disparate machine components together.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0115">9) Freeing the Non-Assembly Degrees of Freedom</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0116">Any non-assembly degrees of freedom in the part <b>26</b> can be unlocked by removing any features (e.g., connected tabs) that restrain them via, e.g., laser machining.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0118">Now that the individual parts are fully assembled and ready for operation, the parts <b>26</b> can be separated from the scrap frame (e.g., an outer frame to which the parts are connected by bridges of material) of the scaffold <b>19</b> by laser machining, punching, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0119">Another monolithic “robotic bee,” “robobee” or “mobee” <b>26</b> with a PARITy drivetrain fabricated with this technique using the 15 layers, described above, is illustrated before pop-up assembly (i.e., lying flat) in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>; a US penny is placed adjacent to the robotic bee <b>26</b> to provide a size reference.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0121">Raised planes in the mobee <b>26</b> are formed, e.g., by making three intersecting orthogonal cuts in multiple layers to form the mechanical vias that can be folded 90° to extend vertically and by bonding layers at the ends of the mechanical vias to maintain connections between the layers after the three-dimensional assembly. The rectangular voids that are evident around the mobee <b>26</b> (shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-19</figref>) are left when the mechanical vias are folded out of that base plane. The mobee <b>26</b> will be laser cut out of the frame after the joints are locked. This version incorporates biomimetic wing spars <b>52</b> manufactured out of titanium as well as brass pads with a thickness, e.g., of 12.5 μm at folding locations to lock the joints when the device is dip soldered. The titanium can be clamped flat and stress relieved at 550° C. for one hour prior to assembly to reduce or eliminate curvature induced by micro-machining. The wing membranes will be added at a later step in the process. The mobee <b>26</b> includes carbon fiber components <b>12</b> for high stiffness, lightweight structural components, polyimide film <b>16</b> for resilient flexures, grade <b>25</b> titanium alloy <b>41</b> for robust and complex wing spars <b>52</b>, and half hard brass for solder pads <b>47</b> for automated joint-locking.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0148">Layers <b>1</b>-<b>13</b> of the earlier design appear in this embodiment of the monolithic bee as layers <b>3</b>-<b>15</b>. In this new embodiment, layers <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> allow solder pads to be placed on the bottom of the device, whereas layers <b>16</b> and <b>17</b> <i>a </i>allow solder pads to be placed on top of the device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0149">The hexagonal scaffold plate <b>50</b> and the smaller plate <b>51</b> suspended parallel above it and within which the bee <b>26</b> is suspended via linkages (seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13-19</figref>) form a Sarrus linkage <b>67</b> and are constrained by connecting linkages to have one degree of freedom; the smaller plate <b>51</b> can linearly translate upwards from the hexagonal plate <b>50</b>. This is the assembly degree of freedom. All components of the bee <b>26</b> are connected by linkages to these two plates; and a laser can later to be used to cut these linkages and release the bee <b>26</b>. As the Sarrus linkage <b>67</b> is actuated, each individual component of the bee <b>26</b> is folded up into its desired final configuration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0150">Layer Sharing:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0119" num="0151">There is no adhesive layer between the topmost brass <b>40</b> and titanium <b>41</b> layers (layers <b>17</b> <i>a </i>and <b>17</b> <i>b</i>, respectively) in the above outline. These two sub-layers can be thought of as sharing the same layer because they are non-overlapping and both engage with the adhesive layer <b>14</b> (layer <b>16</b> in the above outline), e.g., glue, to bond with the carbon fiber layer <b>12</b> (layer <b>15</b> in the above outline).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0152">Two ways to accomplish layer sharing are described, as follows. In the first, multiple layers occupy non-overlapping areas in the x-y plane. For example, four alignment pins <b>26</b> can be used. The brass layer <b>40</b> (<b>17</b> <i>a</i>) can cover half of the full area of the device, while the titanium layer <b>41</b> (<b>17</b> <i>b</i>) can cover the other half. The brass <b>40</b> can be used to form solder pads <b>47</b>, while the titanium <b>41</b> can be used to form the wing spars <b>52</b>. Each sub-layer (<b>17</b> <i>a </i>and <b>17</b> <i>b</i>) can engage with just two out of the four alignment pins <b>20</b> [i.e., two pins can engage with the brass sub-layer (<b>17</b> <i>a</i>), while the two other pins can engage with the titanium sub-layer (<b>17</b> <i>b</i>)]. Taken to the extreme, the layer can be split into many sub-layers if each sub-layer is engaged with enough alignment pins. For example, a single layer with six sub-layers can look like a map of New England, with each state made out of a different material, and with two alignment pins per state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0153">A second way of achieving layer sharing (implemented in this embodiment of the monolithic bee) is by applying pressure to layers that are unsupported from below to bend the layers into the space below. Basically, if a large hole is cut in a thin layer, the application of pressure to the layer immediately above it (or below it) can be designed to warp and bend that adjacent layer around the edge of the hole, filling in the hole. In this embodiment, the brass layer <b>40</b> (<b>17</b> <i>a</i>) covers the entire laminate area, but is machined with a large wing-shaped hole (shown via the white outline <b>54</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>). The titanium layer (<b>17</b> <i>b</i>) is stacked on top of the brass layer <b>40</b> (<b>17</b> <i>a</i>). The wing spar pattern <b>52</b> is machined into the titanium <b>41</b>, with a bridge connecting the wing spar <b>52</b> to the bulk titanium sheet. Nominally, this wing spar pattern <b>52</b> is suspended above the hole cut out of the brass layer <b>40</b>. The titanium layer <b>41</b>, however, is designed such that it will bend slightly when lamination pressure is applied, allowing the wing to engage with adhesive layer (<b>16</b>) through the hole in the brass layer <b>40</b> when pressure is applied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0154">Dip Solder Pads:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0155">Brass pads <b>47</b> for dip soldering are evident in the images of the monolithic bee shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-19</figref> (particularly in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>). The brass pads <b>47</b> are gold in color (contrasted with the bright yellow polyimide film forming joints) and many rectangular pads <b>47</b> can be seen in the vicinity of the base of the actuator <b>24</b>. The device is submerged in flux and then in solder, causing solder fillets <b>48</b> to form on all of the brass pads <b>47</b> in close proximity, locking the assembly degrees of freedom in the mobee <b>26</b>. Once this locking has taken place, the interior mobee <b>26</b> is cut out of the large surrounding assembly mechanism.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0156">Wing Membrane Laminating:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0157">After initial lamination, pop-up assembly, and joint locking, there are no membranes on the wing spars <b>52</b> of the monolithic bee <b>26</b> due to the difficulty of any membrane <b>53</b> surviving the dip soldering process. The mobee <b>26</b> is released from the surrounding Sarrus hinge assembly mechanism <b>67</b>, but its active degrees of freedom are not yet released. The mobee <b>26</b> is then taken through a second lamination step where the wing spars <b>52</b> are sandwiched between two layers of 1.5 um polyester film (a thermoplastic). Heat and pressure (e.g., 120° C., 340 kPa for 15 minutes) cause the two films to bond to each other, sealing them to the spars <b>52</b>—and thereby forming the membrane <b>53</b>. The device is then placed into the laser to cut the wing outline <b>54</b>. Only then are the active degrees of freedom of the bee <b>26</b> released. The resulting wing <b>28</b> is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0158">11) Operation</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0159">After the manual attachment of three wires to the piezoelectric actuator <b>24</b>, the mobee <b>26</b> is ready to operate. Applying an oscillating voltage to the piezoelectric actuator causes reciprocating flapping motion of the wings <b>28</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>), e.g., at 100 Hz. As a completed machine, the mobee <b>26</b> can be constitutively similar to the earlier Harvard microrobotic fly (HMF); the mobee <b>26</b> distinguishes itself by the precision and scalability of the manufacturing process used to produce it.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0008" num="0000">B) Additional Embodiments</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0160">Flexure mechanisms and assembly folds result from the patterning and lamination of alternating rigid and compliant layers, similar to rigid-flex circuit board construction. We extend these methods with the concept of a superplanar topology; adhesive layers are patterned with a laser to allow selective mechanical connection between multiple rigid-flex planar layers. These “mechanical vias” enable the creation of complex multi-layer mechanisms, such as Sarrus linkages, which can actuate normal to the working plane. Device components may now reside on separate planar layers, reducing interference during folding and allowing greater complexity than is possible with a single flat pattern. Provided, below, is a detailed explanation of the fabrication method and present three example parts to illustrate its potential. The last device demonstrated achieves self-assembly by introducing a pre-strained layer into the part laminate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0161">Laminate Fabrication</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0162">The process begins with the production of multilayer laminates. Each layer is first bulk machined to define part geometry. Layers (post-machining) remain contiguous to preserve the structural integrity of each layer and to provide a connection from each device component to the alignment pins. Most features can be machined, leaving small tabs or bridges connecting parts to the surrounding bulk material, similar to break-off tabs in panelized circuit boards or the part panels found in plastic model kits. At a later step, a second round of machining frees the individual parts. Any method of machining that is compatible with the layer materials and meets the accuracy requirements of a particular application can be used, such as deep reactive ion etching (DRIE), photo-chemical machining and electroforming (for metals), laser machining, and punching.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0163">For our research purposes, we used laser micromachining for its mask-less nature and for its compatibility with a wide range of materials. We employed an Nd:YVO4 DPSS laser, q-switched and frequency tripled to 355 nm. The maximum average power of the laser was approximately 1.5 Watts, which we found sufficient for machining layers in the 1 to 150 micron thickness range. The beam was focused to a spot approximately 8 microns in diameter using a telecentric objective lens. Full-range accuracy and repeatability of beam/part positioning was 2 microns or better. A laser of this type easily machines most materials, excepting glass and others that are highly transmissive of 355-nm radiation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0164">After each layer is machined, optional steps, such as electropolishing, ultrasonic cleaning and plasma treatment, may be performed to prepare each layer for lamination. In rigid printed-circuit-board (PCB) fabrication, circuit layers are usually bonded by interleaving pre-impregnated fiberglass-epoxy composite sheets (prepregs) or adhesive bondply layers. For this work, we used acrylic sheet adhesives. These adhesives are most commonly used to coat polyimide (or other polymer) film to form bondply (on two sides) or coverlay (on one side) laminates, but are also available in free-standing sheet form. PCB sheet adhesives are highly engineered materials with tailored thermal expansion properties and with very little flow during the bonding cycle. We used DuPont FR1500 acrylic sheet adhesive, 0.0005 inches (12.5 microns) thick. First, the acrylic sheet adhesive was machined with alignment holes. Second, the acrylic sheet adhesive was added as a free-standing layer to the stack or, alternatively, tack-bonded to an adjacent layer. For either technique, laser machining is used to pattern the adhesive. Other adhesives or methods of adhesion cab be used, but we find the combination of properties present in this type of adhesive to be well suited for MEMS-scale microfabrication.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0165"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> illustrates the laminate stack and alignment tooling used for this work. The part layers are 25 mm on a side. Each outer layer <b>66</b> represents possible pressure-distribution, conformal and release layers. Between the outer layers <b>66</b>, the following layers are stacked in sequence bottom-to-top: carbon-fiber layer <b>12</b>, adhesive layer <b>14</b>, polyimide film <b>16</b>, adhesive layer <b>14</b>, pre-strained spring steel layer <b>68</b>, adhesive layer <b>14</b>, polyimide film <b>16</b>, adhesive layer <b>14</b>, and carbon-fiber layer <b>12</b>. The carbon-fiber layer <b>12</b> is our standard 0-90-0 three-layer laminate with thickness of approximately 100 μm. The adhesive layer <b>14</b> is DuPont PYRALUX FR1500 with 12.5 μm thickness. The polyimide layer <b>16</b> is 7.6 μm-think KAPTON polyimide film. Finally, the spring steel layer <b>68</b> is 0.003-inches (76 μm) thick and laser machined with planar springs. The alignment holes are placed in positions such that this layer <b>68</b> must be stretched during stacking, extending the planar springs and storing energy in the laminate. These springs drive pop-up self-assembly once the device is completed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0166">Multiple part layups <b>29</b> may be bonded simultaneously, using rigid separator plates between stacks. Alignment accuracy is determined by several factors, such as the accuracy of the alignment holes <b>22</b> and pins <b>20</b>, coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) of the layer materials and the size of the laminate. For alignment, we used standard precision dowel pins ( 1/16 inch) and alignment holes typically undersized by a few microns to benefit from elastic averaging. In practice, post-lamination alignment is better than 5 microns. The exact numbers were difficult to measure, as this accuracy approaches the material-uniformity and edge-roughness limits of our materials and machining process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0167">We first demonstrated these methods by making a fairly complex part from a very simple layup; with just two rigid layers <b>12</b> separated by a single adhesive layer <b>14</b>, we can make a linked chain <b>56</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</figref> illustrate the process with a simple two-link version. Essentially, the outline <b>57</b> of two interlocked rings is machined into each rigid layer. However, where they overlap, one rigid layer <b>12</b> (top or bottom) continues, and the other has a gap; for the other intersection, the reverse. The adhesive layer <b>14</b> is machined to prevent bonding between the two rigid layers <b>12</b> at both overlap regions. Selective adhesion is an enabler of this part.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0168">After laser machining, the layers are aligned using pins <b>20</b>, and bonded. Note that in this application, the adhesive layer <b>14</b> is free-standing. We found that PCB-type acrylic sheet adhesives (only 12.5 microns thick) have sufficient strength and stability to support themselves and maintain accurate alignment in the layup. The chain is “singulated” after bonding by completing the outline cut. A chain <b>56</b> so-fabricated with 549 links is shown in the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</figref>. The rigid layers are carbon fiber composite, each 95 microns thick. They were cut from a pre-cured 0-90-0 laminate of unidirectional carbon fiber (33 grams/m<sup>2 </sup>per ply) impregnated with cyanate ester resin. This material is very strong, stiff and light; and it laser machines easily and has a low coefficient of thermal expansion. After lamination and singulation, the chain <b>56</b> is simply lifted out of the scaffold frame <b>19</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0169">Structure by Folding</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0170">The chain <b>56</b> provides a good example of the complexity possible when selective adhesion is used in laminated construction. Increasing the number of layers does allow parts of greater complexity; however, this 3D printing approach runs into several limitations: as part thickness grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to make singulation cuts deep in the part; excess supporting material typically must be removed; and structural elements aligned normal to the working plane are weakened by interleaved adhesive layers. As described, herein, we have explored folding as an alternative approach for making 3D structures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0171">There are many examples of folding, including origami, sheet metal construction and rigid-flex PCBs. A flat pattern is folded at creases, at score lines, or at flexible hinges. To form flat patterns in our process, we machine “links” out of a rigid material, separated by narrow gaps spanned by a compliant material. These flexures serve as assembly folds or mechanism joints. Structures of incredible complexity are possible through origami folding and modern algorithms can yield crease patterns directly from a 3D model.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0172">A downside to folding is typically the challenge of assembly. When working with a single rigid-flex planar layer, forming complex shapes typically requires many sequential folds and thus many assembly degrees of freedom. If the goal is batch production, assembly ideally will occur using only a single degree of freedom. A motivating example is a pop-up book, where a single rotation results in the folding and assembly of many interconnected components. Unlike origami, pop-up book scenes—when closed and unfolded—include multiple folding layers. Using the laminated construction process described herein, similar structures can be created.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0177">Mounted to the top plate <b>32</b>′ are three planks <b>36</b>, each of which is pivotably mounted to the top plate <b>32</b>′ via a fold and fixed to a respective triangular face <b>34</b> adjacent to the top-most triangular face <b>34</b>′, as can be better seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43-48</figref>, which show the pop-up assembly with the scaffold plates <b>32</b> removed for clarity of illustration. Different prime values for the triangular faces (i.e., faces <b>34</b>, <b>34</b>′, and <b>34</b>) are provided for ease of illustration and characterization, though references herein to “face <b>34</b>” can refer to any of these faces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0178">As the top plate <b>32</b>′ rises relative to the bottom plate <b>32</b>″, the planks <b>36</b> pivot downward and pull the respective triangular faces <b>34</b> to which they are attached upward, along with the other triangular faces <b>34</b> to which each is interconnected about its edges.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0147" num="0179">At its base, the icosahedron <b>62</b> is mounted to an inner rotatable disk <b>38</b> (see, e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>), which includes a plurality of outward-extending tabs <b>63</b> that extend under slots <b>64</b> on the lower scaffold plate <b>32</b>″, acting as a plane linear bearing, for reciprocal axial rotation therein.

The rotatable disk <b>38</b> is turned by the pull of linkages <b>65</b> extending down via a pivot point from the top plate <b>32</b>′.
