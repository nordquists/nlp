No. 8,669,133, filed May 14, 2010, which is a divisional of U.S. Pat. No. 7,732,844, filed Mar. 6, 2007, which claims priority to provisional U.S. patent application Ser.

<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">In semiconductor technologies, image sensors are used for sensing a volume of exposed light projected towards the semiconductor substrate. Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor devices are widely used in various applications such as digital still camera (DSC) applications. These devices utilize an array of active pixels or image sensor cells, including photodiode elements and MOS transistors, to collect photo energy to convert images to streams of digital data. However, image sensor devices suffer from electrical cross-talk.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, consider optical applications such as DSC, which require high-performance imaging with low electrical cross-talk, low noise, and superior optical performance. An image sensor including photodiodes and MOS transistors can be used in these applications. The photodiodes and MOS transistors can be formed in a P<sup>−</sup> silicon semiconductor layer disposed on a P<sup>+</sup> silicon substrate, and an incident light generates electron-hole pairs in the P<sup>−</sup> silicon layer. The generated electrons outside depletion region will diffuse into neighboring photodiode and causes electrical cross-talk. The electrical cross-talk will degrade spatial resolution, reduce overall optical sensitivity and result in poor color separation. The electrical signal of light targeted for one image sensor element also may spread to other image sensors, which causes crosstalk. Improvements of the image sensor and/or the corresponding substrate are desired.</div>

<heading id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">It is to be understood that the following disclosure provides many different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of the invention. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. In addition, the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals and/or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and/or configurations discussed. Moreover, the formation of a first feature over or on a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the first and second features are formed in direct contact, and may also include embodiments in which additional features may be formed interposing the first and second features, such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">An image sensor device and a method making the same will be described below with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 7</figref>. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, provided is a semiconductor device <b>100</b> having a semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> of a first type of dopant as illustrated. In the present embodiment, the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> includes silicon. The substrate <b>110</b> may alternatively or additionally include other elementary semiconductor such as germanium. The substrate <b>110</b> may also include a compound semiconductor such as silicon carbide, gallium arsenic, indium arsenide, and indium phosphide. The first type of dopant is negative-type (N-type) dopants in one embodiment. The substrate <b>110</b> of the N-type dopants is doped by phosphorus or arsenic. The dopant concentration and resistivity is optimized so as to reduce impact to photodiode junction profile through bulk diffusion. The substrate <b>110</b> can be heavily doped or lightly doped. In one embodiment, the substrate <b>110</b> has a dopant concentration ranging from about 10<sup>14 </sup>to about 10<sup>20 </sup>cm<sup>−3</sup>. The resistivity of the substrate <b>110</b> may range between about 0.002 and about 50 ohm-cm. The doping may be implemented using a process such as ion implantation or diffusion in various steps and techniques.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a semiconductor layer <b>115</b> having a second type of dopant is formed on the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>, in which the second type of dopant is different from the first type of dopant. For example, when the substrate <b>110</b> is N-type doped, then the semiconductor layer is positive type (P-type). Boron or BF2 may be utilized to introduce P-type dopants. The semiconductor layer <b>115</b> may be also a silicon layer if the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> is a silicon substrate. The semiconductor layer <b>115</b> may have a proper thickness and dopant concentration for better image sensor performance. The semiconductor layer <b>115</b> may have a thickness ranging between about 1 and about 20 micrometer. Preferably, the semiconductor layer <b>115</b> may have a thickness from about 1 to about 10 micrometer. More preferably, the semiconductor layer <b>115</b> may have a thickness from about 2 to about 8 micrometer. A semiconductor layer that is too thin is subject to degraded optical performance of a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor or other sensor formed therein. The semiconductor layer <b>115</b> may have resistivity ranging from about 1 to about 50 ohm-cm, preferably about 8 to about 12 ohm-cm in one embodiment. The semiconductor layer <b>115</b> may have a dopant concentration ranging from about 10<sup>14 </sup>to about 10<sup>16 </sup>cm<sup>−3</sup>. The semiconductor layer <b>115</b> may be formed by an epitaxy growth of a layer of crystalline silicon on the silicon substrate or other semiconductor material. In one embodiment, the epitaxy growth of the silicon layer may be implemented by utilizing a silane (SiH<sub>4</sub>) gas. In furtherance of the embodiment, the silane gas has a temperature about 1000° C. and gas pressure ranging between about 40 and about 760 Torr. The epitaxy growth may further utilize another gas (or gases) with a proper pressure to introduce dopants.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Alternatively, the semiconductor layer <b>115</b> may be formed by applying an ion implantation process to the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> with a proper dose and energy to form a reverse doped semiconductor layer from the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Since the semiconductor layer <b>115</b> has a reverse type of dopant from the dopants of the semiconductor substrate <b>110</b>, minority diffusion is reduced during applications. Furthermore, the semiconductor substrate is designed operable to have a voltage bias applied thereon during applications. For example, a positive voltage such as V<sub>dd </sub>may be applied to the N-type semiconductor substrate <b>110</b> through a guard ring formed in the substrate. The voltage bias will generate a depletion region having an electrical field between the N-type substrate and the P-type semiconductor layer. The electrical field will attract electrons moving downward to the substrate and prevent electrons diffusing into neighboring image sensors (such as photodiodes). The electrical cross-talk is thus greatly reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a plurality of isolation features <b>120</b> such as shallow trench isolation (STI) are formed in the semiconductor layer <b>115</b> to define various regions for making image sensor elements and various transistors. In one example, the image sensor elements include photodiodes. The shallow trench isolation features <b>120</b> may be formed by a suitable technique known in the art. For example, the STI features may be formed by a set of processes including patterning the semiconductor layer by a conventional photolithography, etching the semiconductor layer by a plasma etching process to form various trenches, and filling the trenches by a dielectric material such as silicon oxide by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process. The CVD process may utilize a high density plasma CVD (HDPCVD) to achieve a better planar surface of the STI features. Additionally, a sacrificial layer <b>125</b> may be formed on the semiconductor layer <b>115</b> for subsequent processes. The sacrificial layer <b>125</b> may have a thickness more than about 100 angstrom and may include a silicon oxide layer thermally grown on the silicon semiconductor layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a P-type well (P-well) <b>135</b> is formed in the semiconductor layer of the P-type of dopant. The formation of the P-well may implement forming a patterned photoresist layer <b>130</b> on the sacrificial layer <b>125</b> and performing an ion implantation process to the semiconductor layer through the exposed sacrificial layer <b>125</b> within the openings of the patterned photoresist layer <b>130</b>. The ion implantation process may utilize boron as doping impurity, and further utilize an implantation energy ranging between about 100 and about 200 KeV, and implantation dose ranging between 10<sup>13 </sup>and 3×10<sup>13 </sup>cm<sup>−2</sup>. The P-well <b>135</b> has a depth from about 0.5 micrometer to about 1 micrometer in one embodiment.</div>

The various transistors may include a transfer gate transistor, a reset gate transistor, a source follower, a row select transistor, and may further include other MOS transistors such as N-type MOS (NMOS) transistors.

Each transistor may include a source, a drain and a gate, wherein the gate further include a gate dielectric and a gate electrode. Furthermore, a N-well <b>140</b> may be formed in the semiconductor layer <b>115</b>. approximate to the P-well <b>135</b>. Various p-type MOS (PMOS) transistors may be formed in the N-well <b>140</b>. The sacrificial layer <b>125</b> can be removed during the formation of the various NMOS and PMOS transistors.

In one example for 0.18 micrometer technology node, the implant energy ranges from about 50 to about 500 KeV, and the implant dose ranges from about 10<sup>12 </sup>to about 10<sup>13 </sup>cm<sup>−2</sup>. The n-type photodiode <b>150</b> has a depth from about 0.05 micrometer to about 0.1 micrometer in one example. A p-type doped region <b>150</b> <i>b</i>, also referred to as a p-type pinned layer, is formed in the photodiode <b>150</b> using p-type impurity such as boron or BF<sub>2</sub>.
