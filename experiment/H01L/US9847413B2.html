<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">Priority is claimed from U.S. patent application 61/294,427 filed Jan. 12, 2010, which is hereby incorporated by reference, and also from U.S. patent application 61/307,007 filed Feb. 23, 2010, which is also hereby incorporated by reference.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present application relates to semiconductor devices, and particularly to power semiconductor devices which use intentionally introduced permanent electrostatic charge in trenches which adjoin regions where current flows in the ON state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Note that the points discussed below may reflect the hindsight gained from the disclosed inventions, and are not necessarily admitted to be prior art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Power MOSFETs are widely used as switching devices in many electronic applications. In order to minimize the conduction power loss it is desirable that power MOSFETs have a low specific on-resistance (R<sub>SP </sub>or R*A), which is defined as the product of the on-resistance of the MOSFET multiplied by the active die area. In general, the on-resistance of a power MOSFET is dominated by the channel resistance and the drift region resistances which include the substrate resistance, spreading resistance and the epitaxial (epi) layer resistance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, the so called super-junction structure has been developed to reduce the drift region resistance. The super-junction structure consists of alternating highly doped p-type and n-type pillars or layers. For a given breakdown voltage, the doping concentrations of n-type pillar (the n-type drift region) can be one order of magnitude higher than that of conventional drift region provided that the total charge of n-type pillar is designed to be balanced with charge in the p-type pillar. In order to fully realize the benefits of the super-junction, it is desirable to increase the packing density of the pillars to achieve a lower R<sub>SP</sub>. However, the minimum pillar widths that can be attained in practical device manufacturing set a limitation on the reducing the cell pitch and scaling the device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Recently, inventions (see for example US application 20080191307 and US application 20080164518) have been disclosed to address this issue by incorporating fixed or permanent positive charge (Q<sub>F</sub>) to balance the charge of a p-type pillar in a diode or voltage blocking structure. The permanent charge can also form an electron drift region in a power MOSFET, by forming an inversion layer along the interface between the oxide and P epi layer. By making use of that concept, the area scaling limitation due to inter-diffusion of p-type pillar and n-type pillar was mitigated. Consequently, a small cell pitch and high packing density of pillars and channels was achieved, reducing the device total on-resistance (and specific on-resistance R<sub>SP</sub>). In addition, the structure of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> has a key advantage over conventional super-junction devices in that there is no JFET effect to limit the current so smaller cell pitches are highly desirable.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">The present inventors have realized that there are several different device structures that can use higher Q<sub>F </sub>than that of the device structure shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> without degrading breakdown voltage. Thus, among other teachings, the present application describes some ways to reduce the specific on-resistance R<sub>SP</sub>, for a given breakdown voltage specification, by actually increasing the maximum breakdown voltage.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0028">The numerous innovative teachings of the present application will be described with particular reference to presently preferred embodiments (by way of example, and not of limitation). The present application describes several inventions, and none of the statements below should be taken as limiting the claims generally.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0029">The present application describes several new device and fabrication concepts, and many different ways to implement them. A number of these concepts and embodiments will be described in detail, but it must be remembered that the new concepts described here include some very broadly applicable points.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0030">The present inventors have realized that it is possible to reduce the specific on-resistance R<sub>SP </sub>by increasing the permanent charge Q<sub>F</sub>, while ALSO still meeting the required breakdown voltage. It is also possible, and desirable, to reduce the intrinsic capacitances of the device such as gate-to-drain capacitance (Cgd).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0031"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows one example of a trench transistor as described in the published applications referenced above. Here insulated gate electrodes <b>212</b> are present in the upper parts of trenches <b>207</b>, and the semiconductor structure near the front surface includes a p-type body region <b>206</b> which is contacted by a p+ body contact diffusion <b>210</b>, as well as an n+ source region <b>208</b>. Positive permanent charge <b>216</b> is present near the trench sidewalls, and provides improved charge balancing when the epitaxial layer <b>204</b> is depleted under reverse bias. The permanent charge also forms an induced drift region by forming an inversion layer along the interface between the oxide and the P-type layer. Using this concept, the scaling limitation due to inter-diffusion of p-type pillar and n-type pillar can be eliminated. Consequently, a small cell pitch and high packing density of pillars (and of channel area) can be realized, to thereby reduce the device total on resistance and R<sub>SP</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0032"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a first example of an innovative structure. This example shows a trench MOSFET structure built on p-type epitaxial layer <b>104</b>, an insulated gate <b>112</b> and a buried or embedded field plate <b>121</b> inside a trench which is otherwise filled with dielectric <b>114</b>. The insulated gate <b>112</b> and embedded field plate <b>121</b> are formed using conducting material such doped polysilicon. The buried field plate electrode <b>121</b> preferably contacts the source electrode <b>101</b> at least at some places of the device or alternatively is left floating. The gate electrode <b>112</b> can invert nearby portions of a p-type body region <b>106</b> which is contacted by a p+ body contact diffusion <b>110</b>, as well as an n+ source region <b>108</b>. Positive permanent or fixed net electrostatic charge <b>116</b> is present near the trench sidewalls, and provides improved charge balancing when the epitaxial layer <b>104</b> is depleted under reverse bias. Under these conditions the buried field plate electrode <b>121</b> causes the electric field to spread even more uniformly and hence a higher breakdown and/or a lower R<sub>SP </sub>is achieved. Furthermore, the buried field plate <b>121</b> helps to shield the gate electrode to reduce gate-drain capacitance Cgd.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0033">In the ON state the permanent charge forms an induced drift region by forming an inversion layer along the interface between the oxide and the P-type layer <b>104</b>. An adequate gate bias forms a channel region where excess electrons are present. Under these conditions electrons can flow from source <b>108</b>, through the channel portion of p-type body region <b>106</b> and inversion layer in drift region <b>104</b> (which in this example is simply a portion of the p-type epitaxial layer <b>104</b>), to the drain <b>102</b>. Source metallization <b>101</b> makes ohmic contact to source diffusion <b>108</b> and to p+ body contact region <b>110</b>, and drain metallization <b>103</b> makes contact to the drain <b>102</b>. Thus the source, gate, and body in combination form a current-controlling structure, which (depending on the gate voltage) may or may not allow injection of majority carriers into the drift region. It is noted that the oxide thickness at the channel region is thinner than that at the lower part of the trenches (along the sidewall and bottom) to withstand the higher voltage drop in this region. Furthermore, the dielectric material <b>114</b> thicknesses between the gate electrode and buried field plate electrode, along trench sidewalls and trench bottom are all independent design parameters.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0034">One class of embodiments describes devices which include trenches with walls covered by a dielectric material such as silicon dioxide that contains permanent or net electrostatic charges and a buried field plate electrode made of conducting material such doped polysilicon. At reverse bias voltage the positive permanent charge compensates negative charge of the P region depletion charge as well as charge created on the buried polysilicon field plate. The electric field lines emanating from the positive permanent charge terminate on both the P region's depletion region negative charge as well as the buried field plate. This results in higher breakdown voltage for the same Q<sub>F</sub>, or alternatively higher Q<sub>F </sub>values for the same breakdown voltage, as compared to the MOSFET structure shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0035"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A, 3B, and 3C</figref> show simulation results for the two-dimensional potential contours at the onset of avalanche breakdown. The structures used in the simulations include versions with and without a buried field plate electrode, but otherwise all other parameters are identical. The cell pitch is 3 μm with trench width of about 1.5 μm and mesa width of about 1.5 μm. It should be noted that only a half cell is used for simulations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0036">In the previously proposed structure shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the positive charge Q<sub>F </sub>provides improved balancing of the negative depletion charge of the P drift region <b>204</b>. The same effect occurs in the new structure of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, but (in addition) the electric field lines emanating from the positive permanent charge <b>116</b> terminate on both the buried field plate <b>121</b> and negative charge of the P region <b>104</b>. This results in a lower maximum electric field, and hence a higher breakdown voltage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0037">Comparison of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 3C</figref> shows this in more detail. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> it can be seen that (with a permanent positive charge of e.g. Q<sub>F</sub>=2.2e12 cm<sup>−2</sup>, in a structure like that of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) with the source and buried field plate grounded the breakdown voltage is increased from 40 volts (as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) to 107 volts, due to the synergistically combined effects of the buried field plate and the electrostatic charge. Correspondingly, it can be seen that a higher voltage drop appears across the dielectric (e.g. silicon dioxide) at the trench sidewalls and bottom, i.e. between the buried field plate and silicon. This implies that the thickness of this dielectric must be large enough to withstand the additional voltage drop which results from this different isopotential map.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0038">In this example, the p-type epi doping was taken to be 1.3e16 cm<sup>−3</sup>, but of course other target values can be used. There will also be some normal process variation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0039"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> shows simulation results for a structure with the same dimensions as that simulated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, but with an important difference: in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> the density of the immobile electrostatic charge has been set to Q<sub>F</sub>=1e10 cm<sup>−2</sup>, which would be in the range of unintentional background charge. (This value is dependent on the particular process sequence, but any interface to crystalline semiconductor material is likely to have some amount of charge per unit area.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0040">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 3C</figref>, the lines drawn onto the structural elements are isopotential contours. In each case, the applied voltage has been divided into equal increments, to show these contours. Since the applied voltages in these two figures are different, the increment between neighboring isopotential contours is different, but the pattern of the isopotential contours is informative. The field plate itself, being a conductor, is all at a single voltage, so no lines of isopotential actually intersect the surface of the field plate. However, many lines of isopotential can be followed through the semiconductor material and the dielectric material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0041">By comparing these contours in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 3C</figref>, it can be seen that the potential contours are much more evenly spaced in the semiconductor material, in the structure of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. This can be better understood by looking at a plot of voltage versus depth: <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref> shows voltage (potential) as a function of depth for the structure simulated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref> shows potential as a function of depth for the structure simulated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>. The flat portion at the right of each of these curves shows the drain voltage, which is different for the two simulations. Note that the curve in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref> has more of a steady rise, whereas the curve in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref> is flatter at the left side, and has a sharper rise near the flat portion at the right.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0042">The next pair of Figures is based on the same pair of simulations: <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref> shows the magnitude of the electric field as a function of depth for the structure simulated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3G</figref> shows the magnitude of the electric field as a function of depth for the structure simulated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>. In each case breakdown will occur when the electric field reaches the critical value of about 3.3E5 V/cm anywhere in the conduction path. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref> it happens that this occurs near both the surface and the N+ P drift junction of the device, but a more important difference is that the electric field away from the location of breakdown averages out to be a much higher fraction of the critical electric field in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref> than in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3G</figref>. Since these two examples have the same dimensions and (in most respects) parameters, the higher average field, away from the location of breakdown, means that a higher total voltage drop can be accommodated in the case of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> than in the case of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>. (In practice, breakdown of the junction between N+ substrate <b>102</b> and p-type epitaxial layer <b>104</b> might limit the breakdown of the structure simulated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> to even less than 53 Volts.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0043">This is a somewhat qualitative observation. As one way to quantify it, we can note that in the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the local maximum of the electric field occurs at scaled depth −7.2, and the third of the drift region closest to the depth of that maximum (i.e. between scaled units −7.2 and −5.5 on the y-axis) contains only about 37% of the total voltage drop. By contrast, in the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, the local maximum of the electric field occurs at scaled depth −1.0, and the third of the drift region closest to the depth of that maximum (i.e. between scaled units −1.0 and −3 on the y-axis) contains almost 100% of the total voltage drop (i.e. 53V between scaled depths −7.2 and −1.0). Stated differently, the two-thirds of the drift region thickness which are not adjacent to the location of breakdown carry more than 60% of the total voltage drop in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, but none of the total voltage drop in the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0044">Another way to characterize the differences which result from the combination of a field plate with an optimal level of fixed electrostatic charge, in the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is to note how much voltage drop occurs in the top one-third of the drift layer. In the simulation of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, about 35V is dropped across this thickness, whereas in the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> almost no voltage is dropped across this thickness. That is, the presence of the field plate creates a local maximum near the bottom corner of the field plate, but the presence of fixed electrostatic charge increases the electric field in the top third of the drift region, and hence permits a larger total voltage to be withstood before breakdown.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0045">Another way to describe the important differences between the cases simulated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 3C</figref> is to note that the electric field profiles of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3F and 3G</figref> both have two local maxima, but the ratios of maximum to minimum are very different. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref> the lesser of the two maxima is about 95% of the critical field, whereas in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3G</figref> the lesser maximum is only about 40% of the critical voltage. Thus another of the teachings of the present application is that is desirable to have an electric field profile which, at breakdown, has a secondary local maximum of at least 50% of the overall maximum field in the drift region (i.e. the critical breakdown field). It is even more preferable to have the secondary local maximum be at least 70% of the maximum field, and more preferable yet to have the secondary local maximum in the range of 85% to 100% of the maximum.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0046"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> shows another example of a trench MOSFET structure. This example is generally somewhat similar to that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, except that the trench top portion width <b>407</b>A is wider than the bottom portion <b>407</b>B. The wider top of the trench results in an easier process to fill the trench with dielectric material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0047"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> shows another example of a trench MOSFET structure which is generally somewhat similar to that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, except that the trench sidewall oxide is stepped. This results in a wider buried field plate width in the top portion of the trench <b>421</b>A than the lower portion <b>421</b>B. This results in a gradation of the field plate field shaping effect, i.e. more uniform electric field distribution or higher breakdown voltage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0048"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> shows another example of a trench MOSFET structure which is generally somewhat similar to that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, except that a lightly doped N drift layer <b>402</b>A is formed on top of the heavily doped N+ substrate <b>402</b>B. This increases the breakdown voltage of the substrate diode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0049"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> shows yet another example of a trench MOSFET structure which is generally somewhat similar to that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, except that gate electrode <b>412</b> extends to the bottom of the trench. In the ON state the gate bias enhances the inversion charge in the drift region and results in lower R<sub>SP</sub>. However, the gate drain capacitance Cgd is increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0050"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> shows one example of a trench MOSFET structure which is generally somewhat similar to that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, except that the buried field plate electrode <b>521</b> extends upwards and is surrounded by the insulated gate electrode <b>512</b>. This provides a simpler processing than the device shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> particularly for higher voltage devices where wider trench widths can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0051"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> shows another example of a trench MOSFET structure which is generally somewhat similar to that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, except that the p-type drift layer <b>504</b> is replaced by a lightly doped N− drift layer <b>502</b>A that is formed on top of the heavily doped N+ substrate <b>502</b>B. It should be noted that in the ON state the positive permanent charge <b>516</b> creates an induced accumulation layer in the N− drift region <b>502</b>A that enhances current conduction and results in a lower Rsp. The doping of the N− drift layer <b>502</b>A is chosen to support the desired breakdown voltage. Furthermore using an N− drift layer a conventional termination structure can be used.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0053">In another class of examples the insulated gate is located on top of the silicon surface rather than inside a trench. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> shows one example of a trench MOSFET structure built on p-type epitaxial layer and an insulated planar gate <b>612</b> and a buried or embedded field plate <b>621</b> formed inside the trench which is otherwise filled with dielectric <b>614</b>.

Positive permanent or fixed net electrostatic charge <b>616</b> is present near the trench sidewalls, and provides improved charge balancing when the epitaxial layer <b>604</b> is depleted under reverse bias. Under these conditions the buried field plate electrode <b>621</b> causes the electric field to spread even more uniformly and hence a higher breakdown and/or a lower R<sub>SP </sub>is achieved. Furthermore, the buried field plate <b>621</b> helps to shield the gate electrode to reduce gate-drain capacitance Cgd.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0054">In the ON state the permanent charge forms an induced drift region by forming an inversion layer along the interface between the oxide and the P-type layer <b>604</b>. An adequate gate bias forms a channel region where excess electrons are present. Under these conditions electrons can flow laterally from source <b>608</b>, through the channel portion of p-type body region <b>606</b> to an optional surface n layer <b>630</b>. Electrons then flow vertically through the inversion drift region <b>604</b> (which in this example is simply a portion of the p-type epitaxial layer <b>604</b>), to the drain <b>602</b>. Source metallization <b>601</b> makes ohmic contact to source diffusion <b>608</b> and to p+ body contact region <b>610</b>, and drain metallization <b>603</b> makes contact to the drain <b>602</b>. Thus the source, gate, and body in combination form a current-controlling structure, which (depending on the gate voltage) may or may not allow injection of majority carriers into the drift region.
