<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure relates to semiconductor devices and methods of manufacturing the same, more particularly, to semiconductor devices including one-time programmable elements and methods of manufacturing the same.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Non-volatile memory devices may be classified into one-time programmable (OTP) devices and multi-time programmable (MTP) devices. Only one programming operation may be performed on the OPT device due to an inner circuit of the OPT device. Therefore, an additional programming operation may not be performed on the OTP device. The OTP devices may include, for example, a fuse, an anti-fuse, and an electrically programmable fuse (e-fuse). In some cases, it may be impossible to erase data programmed in the OPT device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">The OPT devices may be used in security systems because of their aforementioned characteristics. Recently, high-performance OPT devices have been increasingly demanded.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">This disclosure will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which exemplary embodiments of the inventive concepts are shown. The advantages and features of the inventive concepts and methods of achieving them will be apparent from the following exemplary embodiments that will be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be noted, however, that the inventive concepts are not limited to the following exemplary embodiments, and may be implemented in various forms. Accordingly, the exemplary embodiments are provided only to disclose the inventive concepts and let those skilled in the art know the category of the inventive concepts. In the drawings, embodiments of the inventive concepts are not limited to the specific examples provided herein and are exaggerated for clarity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to limit the invention. As used herein, the singular terms โa,โ โanโ and โtheโ are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. As used herein, the term โand/orโ includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items. It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being โconnectedโ or โcoupledโ to another element, it may be directly connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements may be present.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">Similarly, it will be understood that when an element such as a layer, region or substrate is referred to as being โonโ another element, it can be directly on the other element or intervening elements may be present. In contrast, the term โdirectlyโ means that there are no intervening elements. Similarly, unless the context indicates otherwise, the term โcontactโ refers to two items touching, without any intervening elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">It will be further understood that the terms โcomprisesโ, โcomprising,โ, โincludesโ and/or โincludingโ, when used herein, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">Additionally, the embodiment in the detailed description will be described with sectional views as ideal exemplary views of the inventive concepts. Accordingly, shapes of the exemplary views may be modified according to manufacturing techniques and/or allowable errors. Therefore, the embodiments of the inventive concepts are not limited to the specific shape illustrated in the exemplary views, but may include other shapes that may be created according to manufacturing processes. Areas exemplified in the drawings have general properties, and are used to illustrate specific shapes of elements. Thus, this should not be construed as limited to the scope of the inventive concepts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">It will be also understood that although the terms first, second, third etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. Unless the context indicates otherwise, these terms are only used to distinguish one element from another element. Thus, a first element in some embodiments could be termed a second element in other embodiments without departing from the teachings of the present disclosure. Exemplary embodiments of aspects of the present inventive concepts explained and illustrated herein include their complementary counterparts. The same reference numerals or the same reference designators denote the same elements throughout the specification.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">Moreover, exemplary embodiments are described herein with reference to cross-sectional illustrations and/or plane illustrations that are idealized exemplary illustrations. Accordingly, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, exemplary embodiments should not be construed as limited to the shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, an etching region illustrated as a rectangle will, typically, have rounded or curved features. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to limit the scope of example embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">Terms such as โsame,โ โplanar,โ or โcoplanar,โ as used herein when referring to orientation, layout, location, shapes, sizes, amounts, or other measures do not necessarily mean an exactly identical orientation, layout, location, shape, size, amount, or other measure, but are intended to encompass nearly identical orientation, layout, location, shapes, sizes, amounts, or other measures within acceptable variations that may occur, for example, due to manufacturing processes. The term โsubstantiallyโ may be used herein to reflect this meaning.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">Although corresponding plan views and/or perspective views of some cross-sectional view(s) may not be shown, the cross-sectional view(s) of device structures illustrated herein provide support for a plurality of device structures that extend along two different directions as would be illustrated in a plan view, and/or in three different directions as would be illustrated in a perspective view. The two different directions may or may not be orthogonal to each other. The three different directions may include a third direction that may be orthogonal to the two different directions. The plurality of device structures may be integrated in a same electronic device. For example, when a device structure (e.g., a memory cell structure or a transistor structure) is illustrated in a cross-sectional view, an electronic device may include a plurality of the device structures (e.g., memory cell structures or transistor structures), as would be illustrated by a plan view of the electronic device. The plurality of device structures may be arranged in an array and/or in a two-dimensional pattern.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> are circuit diagrams illustrating a semiconductor device according to some embodiments of the inventive concepts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a semiconductor device according to certain embodiments includes a plurality of transistor structures (e.g., TW, TR, TWโฒ and TRโฒ) and a bit line (e.g., BL). For example, one bit line BL may be electrically connected to four transistor structures TW, TR, TWโฒ and TRโฒ.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">Two transistor structures TW and TR may function as one bit. For example, one transistor structure TW of the two transistor structures TW and TR may be used in a write operation, and the other transistor structure TR of the two transistor structures TW and TR may be used for a read operation. The transistor structure TR may be a transistor for the read operation and may be disposed to be adjacent to the bit line BL. The transistor structure TW may be, for example, an anti-fuse.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">For example, the four transistor structures TW, TR, TWโฒ and TRโฒ (i.e., two transistor structures TW and TWโฒ for the write operation, and two transistor structures TR and TRโฒ for the read operation) may constitute one cell (e.g., one memory cell). Adjacent cells may be insulated from each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a circuit diagram illustrating a programmed semiconductor device according to embodiments of the inventive concepts. Hereinafter, one bit will be described as an example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a ground voltage may be applied to the bit line BL and a substrate on which the two transistor structures TR and TW constituting the one bit are formed. A turn-on voltage V<sub>turn-on </sub>may be applied to the transistor TR for the read operation, and a voltage V<sub>high </sub>higher than the turn-on voltage V<sub>turn-on </sub>may be applied to the transistor structure TW for the write operation. For example, a voltage of about 2V may be applied to the transistor TR for the read operation, and a voltage of about 5V may be applied to the transistor structure TW for the write operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">When the voltages such as described above are applied, a breakdown phenomenon may occur in an insulating thin layer (e.g., an oxide layer) between an active region and a gate electrode of the transistor structure TW applied with the high voltage (see, e.g., <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, discussed further below). Thus, the transistor structure TW for the write operation may be changed into a resistor, thus functioning as an anti-fuse, and the one bit may be programmed by a resistance difference of the transistor structure TW for the write operation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a perspective view illustrating a semiconductor device according to some embodiments of the inventive concepts, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is an exemplary plan view illustrating the semiconductor device of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2C and 2D</figref> are exemplary cross-sectional views taken along lines I-Iโฒ and II-IIโฒ of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, respectively. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref> is an exemplary cross-sectional view illustrating the semiconductor device of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> after an insulation thin layer breakdown.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">In the present embodiment, a semiconductor device including a fin-type one-time programmable (OTP) anti-fuse element will be described as an example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A through 2E</figref>, the semiconductor device may include fin-type active patterns <b>105</b> and conductive structures on a substrate <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">The substrate <b>100</b> may include silicon, germanium, or silicon-germanium or may be a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">The fin-type active patterns <b>105</b>, also referred to herein as protruding active portions or protruding active regions, may extend in a first direction on the substrate <b>100</b>. For example, the first direction may be an x-axis direction. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the fin-type active patterns <b>105</b> may constitute a plurality of columns parallel to a second direction perpendicular to the first direction when viewed from a plan view. The fin-type active patterns <b>105</b> in one column may be spaced apart from the fin-type active patterns <b>105</b> constituting another column adjacent to the one column in the first direction. The fin-type active patterns <b>105</b> in each column may be spaced apart from each other in the second direction. The fin-type active patterns <b>105</b> may be two-dimensionally arranged in the first and second directions when viewed from a plan view. The fin-type active patterns <b>105</b> may have bar-shapes extending in the first direction when viewed from a plan view. Each of the fin-type active patterns <b>105</b> may protrude from the substrate <b>100</b> in a third direction. For example, the third direction may be a z-axis direction. Though the fin-type active patterns <b>105</b> are shown as being arranged horizontally, according to the orientation of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, they may be referred to as being arranged in columns. Thus, in certain embodiments as exemplified in the figures, the reference to rows and columns is merely relative to other elements shown.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">According to some embodiments of the inventive concepts, the fin-type active pattern <b>105</b> may include an edge portion EG and a center portion CT, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>. The edge portion EG of one fin-type active pattern <b>105</b> is adjacent to another fin-type active pattern <b>105</b> adjacent to the one fin-type active pattern <b>105</b> in the first direction. The center portion CT of the fin-type active pattern <b>105</b> is disposed between both edge portions EG of the fin-type active pattern <b>105</b>. The edge portion EG may also be referred to herein as an end portion or an end region, for example having a terminal end, and the center portion CT may be referred to herein as a mid-section of the fin-type active pattern <b>105</b>. As such, each fin-type active pattern <b>105</b> may have two opposite terminal ends located at opposite end portions, and may have a center portion extending between the two opposite end portions. Each terminal end may extend from a terminal edge of the fin-type active pattern <b>105</b> toward the center portion CT of the fin-type active pattern <b>105</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments, the fin-type active patterns <b>105</b> may be formed by etching a bulk substrate. In other embodiments, the fin-type active patterns <b>105</b> may be formed by performing a selective epitaxial growth (SEG) process on the substrate <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">The fin-type active patterns <b>105</b> may be electrically insulated from each other, for example, by a device isolation layer <b>110</b>. The device isolation layer <b>110</b> may be formed of an insulative material, and may include, for example, at least one of an oxide, a nitride, and an oxynitride.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">The device isolation layer <b>110</b> may be disposed between the fin-type active patterns <b>105</b> to expose sidewalls of upper portions of the fin-type active patterns <b>105</b>.

The second conductive line pattern <b>123</b> <i>b </i>may function as the gate electrode of the transistor TR for the read operation illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">The insulating thin layer <b>120</b> may be disposed between the conductive line patterns <b>125</b> and the fin-type active patterns <b>105</b>. The insulating thin layer <b>120</b> may include, for example, an oxide (e.g., silicon oxide).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">Generally, all conductive line patterns used as gate electrodes of a transistor for write operation and a transistor for read operation may cross over center portions of fin-type active patterns. However, in the present embodiment, a portion of the first conductive line pattern <b>123</b> <i>a </i>crosses over the edge portions EG of the fin-type active patterns <b>105</b>, and another portion of the first conductive line pattern <b>123</b> <i>a </i>is disposed on the device isolation layer <b>110</b> adjacent to the edge portions EG. Thus, the first conductive line pattern <b>123</b> <i>a </i>may cover an end sidewall parallel to the second direction of the edge portion EG as well as a top surface and both sidewalls parallel to the first direction of the edge portion EG. As a result, the first conductive line pattern <b>123</b> <i>a </i>may cover vertex regions of the edge portion EG. Each vertex region of the edge portion EG may be a point region where three edges of the edge portion meet each other. These vertex regions may also be referred to as corner portions, or point corner portions. Note however, that the point corner portion may not converge to a sharp point as depicted in the figures, but may have a slightly rounded corner where the top surface, sidewall, and end sidewall meet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">Stated differently, a first conductive line <b>123</b> <i>a </i>may be disposed on an edge portion of the fin-type active pattern <b>105</b> and on the device isolation layer <b>110</b> adjacent to the edge portion of the fin-type active pattern. The first conductive line <b>123</b> <i>a </i>may continuously cover a top surface of the edge portion of the first fin-type active pattern <b>105</b>, an end sidewall of the edge portion EG of the first fin-type active pattern <b>105</b>, and a terminal edge between the top surface and the end sidewall. Further, the first conductive line may cover at least a first point corner portion of the fin-type active pattern <b>105</b> (e.g., it may cover two such point corner portions connected by the terminal edge).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">An electric field generated in the write operation may be concentrated at the vertex region of the edge portion EG. Thus, the insulating thin layer <b>120</b> may be easily broken at the vertex region of the edge portion EG by joule heating during write operation. As such, the first conductive line <b>123</b> <i>a </i>forms part of a breakdownable corner gate structure that may function as an anti-fuse, or corner gate structured anti-fuse. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, after a corner portion <b>126</b> of the insulating thin layer <b>120</b> breaks down, the first conductive line <b>123</b> <i>a </i>may form an electrical connection to the substrate <b>100</b>, and thus may function as a resistor. Additionally, an area of the broken region of the insulating thin layer <b>120</b> may be reduced. As a result, a voltage used for the write operation may be reduced. Due to the low voltage write operation, a size of a charge pump may be reduced, and interference (e.g., a parasitic capacitance) between adjacent cells may be reduced. For example, in certain embodiments, the size of the charge pump may be reduced by about 5% due to the low voltage write operation, so that an entire area of a chip may be reduced by about 5.5%.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">Generally, a dummy pattern may be disposed at the position where the first conductive line pattern <b>123</b> <i>a </i>according to the present embodiment is disposed. However, a general dummy pattern is not formed in the present embodiment. Rather, the first conductive line pattern <b>123</b> <i>a </i>is part of an anti-fuse, which, after being broken down, may form a resistor. Accordingly, the first conductive line pattern <b>123</b> <i>a </i>may function as an anti-fuse, whereby a write voltage is applied in order to program it. As a result of omitting extra dummy patterns, an area of a bit cell array of the semiconductor device may be reduced. Redundant bits may be further formed in an available space secured by the reduction of the bit cell array. For example, in certain embodiments, because the dummy pattern is not used, the area of the bit cell array may be reduced by about 33%, and a redundancy of about 33% may be further secured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">The conductive structure may further include dopant regions <b>127</b> <i>a </i>and <b>127</b> <i>b </i>formed in the fin-type active pattern <b>105</b> exposed at both sides of the conductive line pattern <b>125</b>. Thus, the conductive structure may function as a transistor.
