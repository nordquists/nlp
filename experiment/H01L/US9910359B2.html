<heading id="h-0002">FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure generally relates to illumination systems for illuminating a mask in microlithographic exposure apparatus, and in particular to such systems including an optical integrator configured to produce a plurality of secondary light sources in a pupil plane. The disclosure also relates to a method of operating such illumination systems.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Microlithography (also referred to as photolithography or simply lithography) is a technology for the fabrication of integrated circuits, liquid crystal displays and other microstructured devices. The process of microlithography, in conjunction with the process of etching, is used to pattern features in thin film stacks that have been formed on a substrate, for example a silicon wafer. At each layer of the fabrication, the wafer is first coated with a photoresist which is a material that is sensitive to radiation, such as deep ultraviolet (DUV) light. Next, the wafer with the photoresist on top is exposed to projection light in a projection exposure apparatus. The apparatus projects a mask containing a pattern onto the photoresist so that the latter is only exposed at certain locations which are determined by the mask pattern. After the exposure the photoresist is developed to produce an image corresponding to the mask pattern. Then an etch process transfers the pattern into the thin film stacks on the wafer. Finally, the photoresist is removed. Repetition of this process with different masks results in a multi-layered microstructured component. A projection exposure apparatus typically includes a light source, an illumination system that illuminates the mask with projection light produced by the light source, a mask stage for aligning the mask, a projection objective and a wafer alignment stage for aligning the wafer coated with the photoresist. The illumination system illuminates a field on the mask that may have the shape of a rectangular or curved slit, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">In current projection exposure apparatus a distinction can be made between two different types of apparatus. In one type each target portion on the wafer is irradiated by exposing the entire mask pattern onto the target portion in one go. Such an apparatus is commonly referred to as a wafer stepper. In the other type of apparatus, which is commonly referred to as a step-and-scan apparatus or scanner, each target portion is irradiated by progressively scanning the mask pattern under the projection beam along a scan direction while synchronously moving the substrate parallel or anti-parallel to this direction. The ratio of the velocity of the wafer and the velocity of the mask is equal to the magnification of the projection objective, which is usually smaller than 1, for example 1:4.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">It is to be understood that the term “mask” (or reticle) is to be interpreted broadly as a patterning mechanism. Commonly used masks contain opaque or reflective patterns and may be of the binary, alternating phase-shift, attenuated phase-shift or various hybrid mask type, for example. However, there are also active masks, e.g. masks realized as a programmable mirror array. Also programmable LCD arrays may be used as active masks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">As the technology for manufacturing microstructured devices advances, there are ever increasing demands also on the illumination system. Ideally, the illumination system illuminates each point of the illuminated field on the mask with projection light having a well defined spatial and angular irradiance distribution. The term angular irradiance distribution describes how the total light energy of a light bundle, which converges towards a particular point in the mask plane, is distributed among the various directions of the rays that constitute the light bundle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">The angular irradiance distribution of the projection light impinging on the mask is usually adapted to the kind of pattern to be projected onto the photoresist. Often the angular irradiance distribution depends on the size, orientation and pitch of the features contained in the pattern. The most commonly used angular irradiance distributions of projection light are referred to as conventional, annular, dipole and quadrupole illumination settings. These terms refer to the irradiance distribution in a pupil plane of the illumination system. With an annular illumination setting, for example, only an annular region is illuminated in the pupil plane. Thus there is only a small range of angles present in the angular irradiance distribution of the projection light, and all light rays impinge obliquely with similar angles onto the mask.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">Different approaches are known in the art to modify the angular irradiance distribution of the projection light in the mask plane so as to achieve the desired illumination setting. In the simplest case a stop (diaphragm) including one or more apertures is positioned in a pupil plane of the illumination system. Since locations in a pupil plane translate into angles in a Fourier related field plane such as the mask plane, the size, shape and location of the aperture(s) in the pupil plane determines the angular irradiance distributions in the mask plane. However, any change of the illumination setting involves a replacement of the stop. This makes it difficult to finely adjust the illumination setting, because this would involve a very large number of stops that have aperture(s) with slightly different sizes, shapes or locations. Furthermore, the use of stops inevitably results in light losses and thus in a reduced throughput of the apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Many common illumination systems therefore include adjustable elements that make it possible, at least to a certain extent, to continuously vary the illumination of the pupil plane. Many illumination systems use an exchangeable diffractive optical element to produce a desired spatial irradiance distribution in the pupil plane. If zoom optics and a pair of axicon elements are provided between the diffractive optical element and the pupil plane, it is possible to adjust this spatial irradiance distribution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Recently it has been proposed to use mirror arrays that illuminate the pupil plane. In EP 1 262 836 A1 the mirror array is realized as a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) including more than 1000 microscopic mirrors. Each of the mirrors can be tilted in two different planes perpendicular to each other. Thus radiation incident on such a mirror device can be reflected into (substantially) any desired direction of a hemisphere. A condenser lens arranged between the mirror array and the pupil plane translates the reflection angles produced by the mirrors into locations in the pupil plane. This known illumination system makes it possible to illuminate the pupil plane with a plurality of spots, wherein each spot is associated with one particular microscopic mirror and is freely movable across the pupil plane by tilting this mirror.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">Similar illumination systems are known from US 2006/0087634 A1, U.S. Pat. No. 7,061,582 B2, WO 2005/026843 A2 and WO 2010/006687 A1. US 2010/0157269 A1 discloses an illumination system in which an array of micromirrors is directly imaged on the mask.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">As mentioned further above, it is usually desired to illuminate, at least after scan integration, all points on the mask with the same irradiance and angular irradiance distribution. If points on the mask are illuminated with different irradiances, this usually results in undesired variations of the critical dimension (CD) on wafer level. For example, in the presence of irradiance variations the image of a uniform line on the mask on the light sensitive may also have irradiance variations along its length. Because of the fixed exposure threshold of the resist, such irradiance variations directly translate into widths variations of a structure that shall be defined by the image of the line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">If the angular irradiance distribution varies over the illuminated field on the mask, this also has a negative impact on the quality of the image that is produced on the light sensitive surface. For example, if the angular irradiance distribution is not perfectly balanced, i.e more light impinges from one side on a mask point than from the opposite side, the conjugate image point on the light sensitive surface will be laterally shifted if the light sensitive surface is not perfectly arranged in the focal plane of the projection objective.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">For modifying the spatial irradiance distribution in the illumination field U.S. Pat. No. 6,404,499 A and US 2006/0244941 A1 propose mechanical devices that include two opposing arrays of opaque finger-like stop elements that are arranged side by side and aligned parallel to the scan direction. Each pair of mutually opposing stop elements can be displaced along the scan direction so that the distance between the opposing ends of the stop elements is varied. If this device is arranged in a field plane of the illumination system that is imaged by an objective on the mask, it is possible to produce a slit-shaped illumination field whose width along the scan direction may vary along the cross-scan direction. Since the irradiance is integrated during the scan process, the integrated irradiance (sometimes also referred to as illumination dose) can be finely adjusted for a plurality of cross-scan positions in the illumination field.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">Unfortunately these devices are mechanically very complex and expensive. This is also due to the fact that these devices have to be arranged in or very close to a field plane in which usually the blades of a movable field stop is arranged.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">Adjusting the angular irradiance distribution in a field dependent manner is more difficult. This is mainly because the spatial irradiance distribution is only a function of the spatial coordinates x, y, whereas the angular irradiance distribution also depends on the angles α, β.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">WO 2012/100791 A1 discloses an illumination system in which a first mirror array is used to produce a desired irradiance distribution in the pupil plane of the illumination system. In close proximity to the pupil plane an optical integrator is arranged that has a plurality of light entrance facets. Thus images of the light entrance facets are superimposed on the mask. The light spots produced by the mirror array have an area that is at least five times smaller than the total area of the light entrance facets. Thus it is possible to produce variable light patterns on the light entrance facets. In this manner different angular irradiance distributions can be produced on different portions of the illumination field. It is thus possible, for example, to produce an X dipole and a Y dipole illumination setting at a given time in the illumination field.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">In order to ensure that the portions with different illumination settings are sharply delimited, it is proposed to use a second mirror array configured as a digital mirror device (DMD). This second mirror array is illuminated by the first mirror array and is imaged on the light entrance facets by an objective. By bringing larger groups of micromirrors of the second mirror array in an “off”-state, it is possible to produce irradiance distributions on the light entrance facets that have sharp boundaries.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">However, it turned out that it is difficult to produce so many and so small freely movable light spots with the first mirror array. Furthermore, this prior art illumination system is mainly concerned with producing completely different illumination settings at different portions in the illumination field. For that reason the light entrance facets are usually not completely, but only partially illuminated.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">The present disclosure seeks to provide an illumination system of a microlithographic projection exposure apparatus which is capable of adjusting both the spatial and the angular irradiance distribution in a field dependent manner. This means that it shall be possible to adjust the irradiance and angular irradiance distribution at different points in the illumination field differently.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">In an aspect, the disclosure provides an illumination system including a pupil plane, a mask plane in which a mask to be illuminated by projection light can be arranged, and an optical integrator. The latter is configured to produce a plurality of secondary light sources located in the pupil plane. The optical integrator includes a plurality of light entrance facets each being associated with one of the secondary light sources. Images of the light entrance facets at least substantially superimpose in the mask plane. The illumination system further includes a spatial light modulator that has a light exit surface and is configured to transmit or to reflect impinging projection light in a spatially resolved manner, a pupil forming unit that is configured to direct projection light on the spatial light modulator, and an objective that images the light exit surface of the spatial light modulator onto the light entrance facets of the optical integrator so that an image of an object area on the light exit surface completely coincides with one of the light entrance facets. A control unit is configured to control the pupil forming unit and the spatial light modulator so that the object area is completely illuminated by the pupil forming unit and projection light associated with a point in the object area is at least partially and variably prevented from impinging on the one of the light entrance facets.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">The disclosure is based on the perception that instead of using a spatial light modulator only for producing sharp edges of an irradiance distribution on the light entrance facets, it may also be used to modify the irradiance distribution if the object area imaged on a light entrance facet is completely illuminated so that there would be no need for sharp edges.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">With the spatial light modulator controlled in the manner described above it is possible to dispense with mechanical complex devices that are used in prior art illumination systems to adjust the spatial irradiance distribution along the cross-scan direction, and simultaneously to flexibly adjust the angular irradiance distribution at mask level in a field dependent manner. Since the geometrical optical flux is small in front of the optical integrator, the objective that images the light exit surface of the spatial light modulator on the light entrance facets can be realized with very few and preferably spherical lenses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">Since all components of the illumination system may be purely reflective, the disclosure can principally also be used in EUV illumination systems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">The pupil forming unit may include a diffractive optical element for defining an irradiance distribution on the spatial light modulator that is imaged on the light entrance facets of the optical integrator. For fine adjustments of this irradiance distribution zoom optics and/or a pair of axicon elements may be arranged in the light path between the diffractive optical element and the spatial light modulator.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">A more flexible setting of the irradiance distribution on the spatial light modulator is possible if the pupil forming unit includes a first beam deflection array of first reflective or transparent beam deflection elements. Each beam deflection element is configured to illuminate a spot on the spatial light modulator at a position that is variable by changing a deflection angle produced by the beam deflection element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">The spatial light modulator may be of the transparent or the reflective type and may includes an array of elements that can be used to attenuate, completely block or deflect impinging light. For example, the spatial light modulator may be configured as an LCD panel including a two dimensional array of LCD cells whose optical activity can be controlled individually by the control unit. In modulators of the transparent type the object area is usually illuminated from its back side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">In one embodiment the spatial light modulator includes a second beam deflection array of second reflective or transparent beam deflection elements. Each second beam deflection element is capable to be in an “on”-state, in which it directs impinging light towards the optical integrator, and in an “off”-state, in which it directs impinging light elsewhere, for example on a light absorbing surface. Such a second beam deflection array may be configured as a digital mirror device which may include millions of individual micromirrors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">Generally the larger the number of second beam deflection elements arranged in the object area is, the better is the spatial resolution of the field dependent adjustment of the irradiance and angular irradiance distribution. Preferably at least 10, and even more preferably at least 50, second beam deflection elements are arranged in the object area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">In one embodiment center of adjacent second beam deflection elements arranged in the object area are aligned along a straight line. An image of the straight line forms an angle α to a boundary line of the one of the light entrance facets, wherein a is distinct from m·45° with m=0, 1, 2, 3, . . . . With such an oblique arrangement of the second beam deflection array with respect to the light entrance facets the distance is reduced between cross-scan positions in the illumination field at which the attenuation is different.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">For example, the boundaries of the second beam deflection elements may be arranged in a first rectangular grid, and boundaries of the light entrance facets may be arranged in a second rectangular grid. Then the image of the first rectangular grid formed on the light entrance facets forms the angle α to the second rectangular grid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">If the mask moves along a scan direction while it is illuminated by the illumination system, the irradiance and angular irradiance distribution at a point on the mask is obtained by integrating the irradiances and angular irradiance distributions during the scan process, i.e. while the point on the mask moves through the illumination field. For that reason it may be sufficient to provide only a few second beam deflection elements along the scan direction, but a larger number of second beam deflection elements along the cross-scan direction in order to ensure that the field dependence of the irradiance and angular irradiance distribution can be finely adjusted. This usually implies that a length of the object area along the first direction should be larger than a length of the object area along a second direction which is orthogonal to the first direction. Then the objective should be an anamorphotic objective having a magnification M with |M| being smaller along the first direction than along the second direction. The anamorphotic objective ensures that the image of the elongated object area is not elongated, but coincides with the (usually square) shape of the light entrance facets.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">Instead of or in addition to using an anamorphotic objective, it is possible to use an anamorphotic condenser having a front focal plane which coincides with the pupil plane and having a focal length f being shorter along the first direction than along the second direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">Generally it is preferred if the second beam deflection elements are arranged in an object plane of the objective that is parallel to a plane in which the light entrance facets are arranged. This can be achieved if the second beam deflection elements are configured such that they produce in the “on”-state a deflection of impinging light by an angle distinct from zero. Additionally or alternatively the objective may be non-telecentric on an object side and telecentric on an image side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">Generally the light spots produced by the first beam deflection array on the object area will be larger than the object area. However, the disclosure may also be used if the spots are smaller than the object area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">Since gaps between second beam deflection elements are, via the light entrance facets of the optical integrator, eventually imaged on the illumination field, measures should be taken that this does not compromise the uniformity of the spatial and angular irradiance distribution in the illumination field. To this end a scattering plate may be arranged in a light path between the optical light modulator and the mask plane, preferably close to a field plane. The scattering plate blurs the irradiance distribution on the light entrance facets and thus ensures that no dark lines occur in the illumination field.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">If the object area on the light exit surface of the optical light modulator is considered as an active object area so that projection light associated with a point in the active object area can be prevented from impinging on the one of the light entrance facets, the spatial light modulator may include another object area that is a passive object area so that projection light associated with a point in the passive object area cannot be prevented from impinging on the one of the light entrance facets. Such a combination of active and passive object areas may be expedient particularly in those cases in which the spatial resolution produced by the optical light modulator in an active object area shall be very high. If the optical light modulator is configured as a digital mirror device, for example, this would involve a huge number of micromirrors because also the number of light entrance facets is usually large. Digital mirror devices with such a huge number of micromirrors may not yet be easily available. For that reason it may be expedient to assemble the optical light modulator from smaller active object areas, for example formed by conventional digital mirror devices, and passive object areas, for example realized as plane mirrors, in between. Such an arrangement may be useful because often it is not necessary to modify the irradiance distribution on every light entrance facet, but only on some of them.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">In order maintain the pole balance, the irradiance produced on the spatial light modulator by the pupil forming unit may be higher on the active object area than on the passive object area. This higher irradiance compensates light losses that are caused by preventing light from reaching the light entrance facets.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">Preferably the passive object areas and the active object areas are arranged point-symmetrically to each other with respect to an optical axis of the illumination system. This ensures that the energetic balance (telecentricity) of the light bundles converging to points on the mask can always be adjusted. Then roughly one half of the total area of the light exit surface may be covered by active object areas and the other half by passive object areas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">If the light exit surface of the optical light modulator includes groups of object areas that are separated by areas that are not imaged on the light entrance facets, the objective may be configured to combine images of the active object areas so that the images of the object areas abut on the light entrance facets.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">In particular the objective may include a first array of first optical elements, wherein each first optical element forms a magnified image of one of the object areas in an intermediate image plane, and imaging optics that image the intermediate image plane on the light entrance facets.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">Subject of the disclosure is also a method of operating an illumination system of a microlithographic projection exposure apparatus, including the following steps:

<heading id="h-0007">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<heading id="h-0008">I. General Construction of Projection Exposure Apparatus</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0096"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective and highly simplified view of a projection exposure apparatus <b>10</b> in accordance with the present disclosure. The apparatus <b>10</b> includes a light source <b>11</b> that may be realized as an excimer laser, for example. The light source <b>11</b> in this embodiment produces projection light having a center wavelength of 193 nm. Other wavelengths, for example 257 nm or 248 nm, are envisaged as well.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0097">The apparatus <b>10</b> further includes an illumination system <b>12</b> which conditions the projection light provided by the light source <b>11</b> in a manner that will be explained below in further detail. The projection light emerging from the illumination system <b>12</b> illuminates an illumination field <b>14</b> on a mask <b>16</b>. The mask <b>16</b> contains a pattern <b>18</b> formed by a plurality of small features <b>19</b> that are schematically indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as thin lines. In this embodiment the illumination field <b>14</b> has the shape of a rectangle. However, other shapes of the illuminated field <b>14</b>, for example a ring segment, are also contemplated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0098">A projection objective <b>20</b> including lenses L<b>1</b> to L<b>6</b> images the pattern <b>18</b> within the illumination field <b>14</b> onto a light sensitive layer <b>22</b>, for example a photoresist, which is supported by a substrate <b>24</b>. The substrate <b>24</b>, which may be formed by a silicon wafer, is arranged on a wafer stage (not shown) such that a top surface of the light sensitive layer <b>22</b> is precisely located in an image plane of the projection objective <b>20</b>. The mask <b>16</b> is positioned via a mask stage (not shown) in an object plane of the projection objective <b>20</b>. Since the latter has a magnification β with |β|&lt;1, a minified image <b>18</b>′ of the pattern <b>18</b> within the illumination field <b>14</b> is projected onto the light sensitive layer <b>22</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0099">During the projection the mask <b>16</b> and the substrate <b>24</b> move along a scan direction which corresponds to the Y direction indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The illumination field <b>14</b> then scans over the mask <b>16</b> so that patterned areas larger than the illumination field <b>14</b> can be continuously imaged. The ratio between the velocities of the substrate <b>24</b> and the mask <b>16</b> is equal to the magnification β of the projection objective <b>20</b>. If the projection objective <b>20</b> does not invert the image (β&gt;0), the mask <b>16</b> and the substrate <b>24</b> move along the same direction, as this is indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> by arrows A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b>. However, the present disclosure may also be used in stepper tools in which the mask <b>16</b> and the substrate <b>24</b> do not move during projection of the mask.</div>
<heading id="h-0009">II. Field Dependent Angular Irradiance Distribution</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0100"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an enlarged perspective view of the mask <b>16</b> containing another exemplary pattern <b>18</b>. For the sake of simplicity it is assumed that the pattern <b>18</b> includes only features <b>19</b> that extend along the Y direction. It is further assumed that the features <b>19</b> extending along the Y direction are best imaged on the light sensitive layer <b>22</b> with an X dipole illumination setting.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0101">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> an exit pupil <b>26</b> <i>a </i>associated with a light bundle is illustrated by a circle. The light bundle converges towards a field point that is located at a certain X position of the illumination field <b>14</b> at a first time during a scan cycle. In the exit pupil <b>26</b> <i>a </i>two poles <b>27</b> <i>a</i>, which are spaced apart along the X direction, represent directions from which projection light propagates towards this field point. The light energies concentrated in each pole <b>27</b> <i>a </i>are assumed to be equal. Thus the projection light impinging from the +X direction has the same energy as the projection light impinging from the −X direction. Since the features <b>19</b> are assumed to be uniformly distributed over the pattern <b>18</b>, this X dipole illumination setting should be produced at each field point on the mask <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0102">Another exit pupil denoted by <b>26</b> <i>b </i>is associated with a light bundle that converges towards a field point that is located at another X position of the illumination field <b>14</b> at a later time of the scan cycle. The light energies concentrated in each pole <b>27</b> <i>b </i>are again equal. However, the light associated with the poles <b>27</b> <i>b </i>are tilted compared to the light cones of light that are associated with the ideal pole <b>27</b> <i>a</i>. This means that the field point receives the same amount of projection light, but the directions from which the projection light impinges on the field point are not ideal for imaging the features <b>19</b> on the light sensitive layer <b>22</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0103">A further exit pupil denoted by <b>26</b> <i>c </i>is associated with a point in the illuminated field <b>14</b> that is located at still another X position. Here it is assumed that the directions from which the projection light impinges on the field point are again ideal for imaging the features <b>19</b>. Therefore also the light cones associated with the poles <b>27</b> <i>c </i>have the same cone angle and orientation as the cones associated with the ideal exit pupil <b>26</b> <i>a</i>. However, the poles <b>27</b> <i>c </i>are not balanced, i.e. the light energy concentrated in the poles <b>27</b> <i>c </i>differs from one another. Thus the projection light impinging from the +X direction has less energy than the projection light impinging from the −X direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0104">From the foregoing it becomes clear that the ideal angular irradiance distribution represented by the exit pupil <b>26</b> <i>a </i>is not obtained at each X position in the illumination field <b>14</b>. The angular irradiance distribution is therefore field-dependent, i.e. at different field points the angular irradiance distribution is different.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0105">A field dependence may not only occur along the X direction, but also along the Y direction within the illumination field <b>14</b>. Then one point on the mask <b>16</b> experiences different angular irradiance distributions while it passes through the illumination field <b>14</b> during a scan cycle. If a field dependence along the Y direction (i.e. the scan direction) occurs, it has to be taken into account that the total effect for a particular field point is obtained by integrating the different angular irradiance distributions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0106">There is a wide variety of further field-dependent deviations of a real angular irradiance distribution from the ideal one. For example, the poles in the exit pupil associated with some field points may be deformed, blurred or may not have a desired non-uniform irradiance distribution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0102" num="0107">If field dependent deviations from the ideal angular irradiance distribution occur, this generally has a negative impact on the quality of the pattern image that is formed on the light sensitive layer <b>22</b>. In particular, the dimensions of the structures that are produced with the help of the apparatus <b>10</b> may vary inadvertently, and this may compromise the function of the devices containing these structures. Therefore it is generally desired to eliminate any field dependence of the illumination setting in the illumination field <b>14</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0103" num="0108">Sometimes, however, it is desirable to deliberately introduce a field dependence of the angular irradiance distribution. This may be expedient, for example, if the projection objective <b>20</b> or the mask <b>16</b> have field depending properties that affect the image of the pattern <b>18</b> on the light sensitive layer <b>22</b>. Variations of the imaging properties of the projection objective <b>20</b> may occur as a result of manufacturing tolerances, aging phenomena or non-uniform temperature distributions, for example. A field dependence of the mask <b>16</b> often occurs as a result of features that have different orientations or dimensions, for example. Often field dependent adverse effects can be successfully reduced by selectively introducing a field dependence of the angular irradiance distribution. Since some of these effects change very rapidly, it is sometimes desired to change the field dependence of the angular irradiance distribution during a single scan cycle.</div>
<heading id="h-0010">III. General Construction of Illumination System</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0104" num="0109"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a meridional section through the illumination system <b>12</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. For the sake of clarity, the illustration of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is considerably simplified and not to scale. This particularly implies that different optical units are represented by one or very few optical elements only. In reality, these units may include significantly more lenses and other optical elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0105" num="0110">In the embodiment shown, the projection light emitted by the light source <b>11</b> enters a beam expansion unit <b>32</b> which outputs an expanded and almost collimated light beam <b>34</b>. To this end the beam expansion unit <b>32</b> may include several lenses or may be realized as a mirror arrangement, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0106" num="0111">The projection light beam <b>34</b> then enters a pupil forming unit <b>36</b> that is used to produce variable spatial irradiance distributions in a subsequent plane. To this end the pupil forming unit <b>36</b> includes a first mirror array <b>38</b> of very small mirrors <b>40</b> that can be tilted individually about two orthogonal axes with the help of actuators. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a perspective view of the first mirror array <b>38</b> illustrating how two parallel light beams <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> are reflected into different directions depending on the tilting angles of the mirrors <b>40</b> on which the light beams <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> impinge. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> the first mirror array <b>38</b> includes only 6×6 mirrors <b>40</b>; in reality the first mirror array <b>38</b> may include several hundreds or even several thousands mirrors <b>40</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0107" num="0112">The pupil forming unit <b>36</b> further includes a prism <b>46</b> having a first plane surface <b>48</b> <i>a </i>and a second plane surface <b>48</b> <i>b </i>that are both inclined with respect to an optical axis OA of the illumination system <b>12</b>. At these inclined surfaces <b>48</b> <i>a</i>, <b>48</b> <i>b </i>impinging light is reflected by total internal reflection. The first surface <b>48</b> <i>a </i>reflects the impinging light towards the mirrors <b>40</b> of the first mirror array <b>38</b>, and the second surface <b>48</b> <i>b </i>directs the light reflected from the mirrors <b>40</b> towards an exit surface <b>49</b> of the prism <b>46</b>. The angular irradiance distribution of the light emerging from the exit surface <b>49</b> can thus be varied by individually tilting the mirrors <b>40</b> of the first mirror array <b>38</b>. More details with regard to the pupil forming unit <b>36</b> can be gleaned from US 2009/0116093 A1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0108" num="0113">The angular irradiance distribution produced by the pupil forming unit <b>36</b> is transformed into a spatial irradiance distribution with the help of a first condenser <b>50</b>. The condenser <b>50</b>, which may be dispensed with in other embodiments, directs the impinging light towards a digital spatial light modulator <b>52</b> that is configured to reflect impinging light in a spatially resolved manner. To this end the digital spatial light modulator <b>52</b> includes a second mirror array <b>54</b> of micromirrors <b>56</b> that are arranged in a mirror plane <b>57</b> and can be seen best in the enlarged cut-out C of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and the enlarged cut-out C′ of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In contrast to the mirrors <b>40</b> of the first mirror array <b>38</b>, however, each micromirror <b>56</b> of the second mirror array <b>54</b> has only two stable operating states, namely an “on” state, in which it directs impinging light via a first objective <b>58</b> towards an optical integrator <b>60</b>, and an “off” state, in which it directs impinging towards a light absorbing surface <b>62</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0109" num="0114">The second mirror array <b>54</b> may be realized as a digital mirror device (DMD), as they are commonly used in beamers, for example. Such devices may include up to several million micromirrors that can be switched between the two operating states many thousands times per second.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0110" num="0115">Similar to the pupil forming unit <b>36</b>, the spatial light modulator <b>52</b> further includes a prism <b>64</b> having an entrance surface <b>65</b> that is arranged perpendicular to the optical axis OA and a first plane surface <b>66</b> <i>a </i>and a second plane surface <b>66</b> <i>b </i>that are both inclined with respect to the optical axis OA of the illumination system <b>12</b>. At these inclined surfaces <b>66</b> <i>a</i>, <b>66</b> <i>b </i>impinging light is reflected by total internal reflection. The first surface <b>66</b> <i>a </i>reflects the impinging light towards the micromirrors <b>56</b> of the second mirror array <b>54</b>, and the second surface <b>66</b> <i>b </i>directs the light reflected from the micromirrors <b>56</b> towards a surface <b>68</b> of the prism <b>64</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0111" num="0116">If all micromirrors <b>56</b> of the second mirror array <b>54</b> are in their “on” state, the second mirror array <b>54</b> has substantially the effect of a plane beam folding mirror. However, if one or more micromirrors <b>56</b> are switched to their “off” state, the spatial irradiance distribution of the light emerging from the mirror plane <b>57</b> is modified. This can be used, in a manner that will be explained further below in more detail, to produce a field dependent modification of the angular light distribution on the mask <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0112" num="0117">As it already has been mentioned above, the light emerging from the prism <b>64</b> passes through the first objective <b>58</b> and impinges on the optical integrator <b>60</b>. Since the light passing through the first objective <b>58</b> is almost collimated, the first objective <b>58</b> may have a very low numerical aperture (for example 0.01 or even below) and thus can be realized with a few small spherical lenses. The first objective <b>58</b> images the mirror plane <b>57</b> of the spatial light modulator <b>52</b> onto the optical integrator <b>60</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0113" num="0118">The optical integrator <b>60</b> includes, in the embodiment shown, a first array <b>70</b> and a second array <b>72</b> of optical raster elements <b>74</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a perspective view of the two arrays <b>70</b>, <b>72</b>. Each array <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> includes, on each side of a support plate, a parallel array of cylinder lenses extending along the X and the Y direction, respectively. The volumes where two cylinder lenses cross form optical raster elements <b>74</b>. Thus each optical raster element <b>74</b> may be regarded as a microlens having cylindrically curved surfaces. The use of cylinder lenses is advantageous particularly in those cases in which the refractive power of the optical raster elements <b>74</b> shall be different along the X and the Y direction. A different refractive power is involved if the square irradiance distribution on the optical integrator <b>60</b> shall be transformed into a slit-shaped illumination field <b>14</b>, as this is usually the case. The surface of the optical raster elements <b>74</b> pointing towards the spatial light modulator <b>52</b> will be referred to in the following as light entrance facet <b>75</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0114" num="0119">The optical raster elements <b>74</b> of the first and second array <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> respectively, are arranged one behind the other in such a way that one optical raster element <b>74</b> of the first array <b>70</b> is associated in a one to one correspondence with one optical raster element <b>74</b> of the second array <b>72</b>. The two optical raster elements <b>74</b>, which are associated with each other, are aligned along a common axis and define an optical channel. Within the optical integrator <b>60</b> a light beam which propagates in one optical channel does not cross or superimpose with light beams propagating in other optical channels. Thus the optical channels associated with the optical raster elements <b>74</b> are optically isolated from each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0115" num="0120">In this embodiment a pupil plane <b>76</b> of the illumination system <b>12</b> is located behind the second array <b>72</b>; however, it may equally be arranged in front of it. A second condenser <b>78</b> establishes a Fourier relationship between the pupil plane <b>76</b> and a field stop plane <b>80</b> in which an adjustable field stop <b>82</b> is arranged.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0116" num="0121">The field stop plane <b>80</b> is optically conjugated to a raster field plane <b>84</b> which is located within or in close proximity to the light entrance facets <b>75</b> of the optical integrator <b>60</b>. This means that each light entrance facet <b>75</b> in the raster field plane <b>84</b> is imaged onto the entire field stop plane <b>80</b> by the associated optical raster element <b>74</b> of the second array <b>72</b> and the second condenser <b>78</b>. The images of the irradiance distribution on the light entrance facet <b>75</b> within all optical channels superimpose in the field stop plane <b>80</b>, which results in its very uniform illumination of the mask <b>16</b>. Another way of describing the uniform illumination of the mask <b>16</b> is based on the irradiance distribution which is produced by each optical channel in the pupil plane <b>76</b>. This irradiance distribution is often referred to as secondary light source. All secondary light sources commonly illuminate the field stop plane <b>80</b> with projection light from different directions. If a secondary light source is “dark”, no light impinges on the mask <b>16</b> from a (small) range of directions that is associated with this particular light source. Thus it is possible to set the desired angular light distribution on the mask <b>16</b> by simply switching on and off the secondary light sources formed in the pupil plane <b>76</b>. This is accomplished by changing the irradiance distribution on the optical integrator <b>60</b> with the help of the pupil forming unit <b>36</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0117" num="0122">The field stop plane <b>80</b> is imaged by a second objective <b>86</b> onto a mask plane <b>88</b> in which the mask <b>16</b> is arranged with the help of a mask stage (not shown). The adjustable field stop <b>82</b> is also imaged on the mask plane <b>88</b> and defines at least the short lateral sides of the illumination field <b>14</b> extending along the scan direction Y.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0118" num="0123">The pupil forming unit <b>36</b> and the spatial light modulator <b>52</b> are connected to a control unit <b>90</b> which is, in turn, connected to an overall system control <b>92</b> illustrated as a personal computer. The control unit <b>90</b> is configured to control the mirrors <b>40</b> of the pupil forming unit <b>36</b> and the micromirrors <b>56</b> of the spatial light modulator <b>52</b> in such a manner that the angular irradiance distribution in the mask plane <b>88</b> is uniform, or a desired field dependence angular irradiance distribution is obtained.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0012" num="0000">1. Pupil Forming</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0125"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> schematically illustrates how the pupil forming unit <b>36</b> produces an irradiance distribution on the micromirrors <b>56</b> of the spatial light modulator <b>52</b>. For the sake of simplicity the prisms <b>46</b>, <b>64</b> are not shown.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0126">Each mirror <b>40</b> of the first mirror array <b>38</b> is configured to illuminate a spot <b>94</b> on the mirror plane <b>57</b> of the spatial light modulator <b>52</b> at a position that is variable by changing a deflection angle produced by the respective mirror <b>40</b>. Thus the spots <b>94</b> can be freely moved over the mirror plane <b>57</b> by tilting the mirrors <b>40</b> around their tilt axes. In this way it is possible to produce a wide variety of different irradiance distributions on the mirror plane <b>57</b>. The spots <b>94</b> may also partly or completely overlap, as this is shown at <b>95</b>. Then also graded irradiance distributions may be produced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0127"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a perspective view, similar to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, on the second mirror array <b>54</b> contained in the spatial light modulator <b>52</b>. Here it is assumed that the pupil forming unit <b>36</b> has produced an irradiance distribution on the second mirror array <b>54</b> that consists of two square poles <b>27</b> each extending exactly over 6×6 micromirrors <b>56</b>. The poles <b>27</b> are arranged point-symmetrically along the X direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0128">The objective <b>58</b> forms an image of this irradiance distribution on the light entrance facets <b>75</b> of the optical integrator <b>60</b>, as this is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Here it is assumed that all micromirrors <b>56</b> are in the “on”-state so that the irradiance distribution formed on the second mirror array <b>54</b> is identically reproduced (apart from a possible scaling due to a magnification of the objective <b>58</b>) on the light entrance facets <b>75</b> of the optical integrator <b>60</b>. For the sake of simplicity images of gaps that separate adjacent micromirrors <b>56</b> of the second mirror array <b>54</b> are disregarded. The regular grid shown on the light entrance facets <b>75</b> represent an image of the borderlines of the micromirrors <b>56</b>, but this image does not appear outside the poles <b>27</b> and is shown only in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> for illustrative reasons.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0013" num="0000">2. Field Dependence</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0129">Since the light entrance facets <b>75</b> are located in the raster field plane <b>84</b>, the irradiance distribution on the light entrance facets <b>75</b> is imaged, via the optical raster elements <b>74</b> of the second array <b>72</b> and the second condenser <b>78</b>, on the field stop plane <b>80</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0130">This will now be explained with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> which is an enlarged and not to scale cut-out from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Here only two pairs of optical raster elements <b>74</b> of the optical integrator <b>60</b>, the second condenser <b>78</b> and the intermediate field stop plane <b>80</b> are shown schematically.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0131">Two optical raster elements <b>74</b> that are associated with a single optical channel are referred to in the following as first microlens <b>101</b> and second microlens <b>102</b>. The microlenses <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> are sometimes referred to as field and pupil honeycomb lenses. Each pair of microlenses <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> associated with a particular optical channel produces a secondary light source <b>106</b> in the pupil plane <b>76</b>. In the upper half of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> it is assumed that converging light bundles L<b>1</b> <i>a</i>, L<b>2</b> <i>a </i>and L<b>3</b> <i>a </i>illustrated with solid, dotted and broken lines, respectively, impinge on different points of the light entrance facet <b>75</b> of the first microlens <b>101</b>. After having passed the two microlenses <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> and the condenser <b>78</b>, each light bundle L<b>1</b> <i>a</i>, L<b>2</b> <i>a </i>and L<b>3</b> <i>a </i>converges to a focal point F<b>1</b>, F<b>2</b> and F<b>3</b>, respectively. From the upper half of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> it becomes clear that points, where light rays impinge on the light entrance facet <b>75</b>, and points where these light rays pass the field stop plane <b>80</b> (or any other conjugated field plane), are optically conjugate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0132">The lower half of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates the case when collimated light bundles L<b>1</b> <i>b</i>, L<b>2</b> <i>b </i>and L<b>3</b> <i>b </i>impinge on different regions of the light entrance facet <b>75</b> of the first microlens <b>101</b>. This is the more realistic case because the light impinging on the optical integrator <b>60</b> is usually substantially collimated. The light bundles L<b>1</b> <i>b</i>, L<b>2</b> <i>b </i>and L<b>3</b> <i>b </i>are focused in a common focal point F located in the second microlens <b>102</b> and then pass, now collimated again, the field stop plane <b>80</b>. Again it can be seen that, as a result of the optical conjugation, the region where a light bundle L<b>1</b> <i>b</i>, L<b>2</b> <i>b </i>and L<b>3</b> <i>b </i>impinges on the light entrance facet <b>75</b> corresponds to the region which is illuminated in the field stop plane <b>80</b>. As a matter of course, these considerations apply separately for the X and the Y direction if the microlenses <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> have refractive power both along the X and Y direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0133">Therefore each point on a light entrance facet <b>75</b> directly corresponds to a conjugated point in the intermediate field stop plane <b>80</b> (and hence in the illumination field <b>14</b> on the mask <b>16</b>). If it is possible to selectively influence the irradiance on a point on a light entrance facet <b>75</b>, it is thus possible to influence the irradiance of a light ray that impinges on the conjugated point in the illumination field <b>14</b> from a direction that depends on the position of the light entrance facet <b>75</b> with respect to the optical axis OA of the illumination system. The larger the distance between the light entrance facet <b>75</b> from the optical axis OA is, the larger is the angle under which the light ray impinges on the point on the mask <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0014" num="0000">3. Modifying Irradiance on Light Entrance Facets</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0134">In the illumination system <b>12</b> the spatial light modulator <b>52</b> is used to modify the irradiance on points on the light entrance facets <b>75</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> it can be seen that each pole <b>27</b> extends over a plurality of small areas that are images of the micromirrors <b>56</b>. If a micromirror is brought into an “off” state, the conjugated area on the light entrance facet <b>75</b> will not be illuminated, and consequently no projection light will impinge on a conjugated area on the mask from the (small) range of directions that is associated with this particular light entrance facet <b>75</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0135">This will be explained in more detail with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11<i>a </i>and 11<i>b </i> </figref>which are top views on the micromirrors <b>56</b> of the spatial light modulator <b>52</b> and on the light entrance facets <b>75</b> of the optical integrator <b>60</b>, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0136">The thick dotted lines on the second mirror array <b>54</b> divide its mirror plane <b>57</b> into a plurality of object areas <b>110</b> each including 3×3 micromirrors <b>56</b>. The objective <b>58</b> forms an image of each object area <b>110</b> on the optical integrator <b>60</b>. This image will be referred to in the following as image area <b>110</b>′. Each image area <b>110</b>′ completely coincides with a light entrance facet <b>75</b>, i.e. the image areas <b>110</b>′ have the same shape, size and orientation as the light entrance facets <b>75</b> and are completely superimposed on the latter. Since each object area <b>110</b> includes 3×3 micromirrors <b>56</b>, the image areas <b>110</b>′ also include 3×3 images <b>56</b>′ of micromirrors <b>56</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0137">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11<i>a </i> </figref>there are eight object areas <b>110</b> that are completely illuminated by the pupil forming unit <b>36</b> with projection light. These eight object areas <b>110</b> form the two poles <b>27</b>. It can be seen that in some of the object areas <b>110</b> one, two or more micromirrors <b>56</b> <i>d </i>represented as black squares have been controlled by the control unit <b>90</b> such that they are in an “off”-state in which impinging projection light is not directed towards the objective <b>58</b>, but towards the absorber <b>62</b>. By switching micromirrors between the “on” and the “off” state it is thus possible to variably prevent projection light from impinging on corresponding regions within the image areas <b>110</b>′ on the light entrance facets <b>75</b>, as this is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11<i>b</i> </figref>. These regions will be referred to in the following as dark spots <b>56</b> <i>d′. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0138">As has been explained above with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the irradiance distribution on the light entrance facets <b>75</b> is imaged on the field stop plane <b>80</b>. If a light entrance facet <b>75</b> contains one or more dark spots <b>56</b> <i>d</i>′, as this is illustrated in the upper portion of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the irradiance distribution produced in the mask plane <b>88</b> by the associated optical channel will have dark spots at certain X positions, too. If a point on a mask passes through the illumination field <b>14</b>, the total scan integrated irradiance will thus depend on the X position of the point in the illuminated field <b>14</b>, as this is shown in the graph of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. Points in the middle of the illumination field <b>14</b> will experience the highest scan integrated irradiance, because they do not pass through dark spots, and points at the longitudinal ends of the illumination field <b>14</b> will receive total irradiances that are reduced to different extents. Thus the field dependence of the angular light distribution on the mask <b>16</b> can be modified by selectively bringing one or more micromirrors <b>56</b> of the spatial light modulator <b>52</b> from an “on”-state into the “off”-state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0139">In a foregoing it has to be assumed that each object area <b>110</b>, which is imaged on one of the light entrance facets <b>75</b>, contains only 3×3 micromirrors <b>56</b>. Thus the resolution along the cross-scan direction X that can be used to modify the field dependence of the angular light distribution is relatively coarse. If the number of micromirrors <b>56</b> within each object area <b>110</b> is increased, this resolution can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0140"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates a top view on one of the light entrance facets <b>75</b> for an embodiment in which 20×20 micromirrors <b>56</b> are contained in each object area <b>110</b>. Then more complicated scan integrated irradiance distributions along the X direction can be achieved on the mask <b>16</b>, as this is illustrated in the graph shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0015" num="0000">4. Clipping</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0141">In the foregoing it has been assumed that the pupil forming unit <b>36</b> illuminates poles <b>27</b> on the second mirror array <b>54</b> that exactly extend over four adjacent object areas <b>110</b>. Generally, however, it will be difficult to produce such an irradiance distribution with sharp edges.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0142">The spatial light modulator <b>52</b> may also be used to clip a blurred irradiance distribution in the mirror plane <b>57</b> by bringing those micromirrors <b>56</b> into the “off”-state that lie outside the object areas <b>110</b> that shall be illuminated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0143">This is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref> in which an irradiance distribution <b>96</b> on the second mirror array <b>54</b> are shown. Here it is assumed that the movable light spots <b>94</b> produced by the mirrors <b>40</b> of the pupil forming unit <b>36</b> are superimposed to form four poles. If all micromirrors <b>56</b> of the spatial light modulator <b>52</b> are in the “on” state as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the blurred irradiance distribution <b>96</b> would be imaged on the light entrance facets <b>75</b>. If those micromirrors <b>56</b> surrounding the desired object areas <b>110</b> are brought into the “off”-state as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, they form a frame that delimits the poles and thus produces sharp edges of the intensity distribution on the light entrance facets.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0016" num="0000">5. Relative Rotation</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0144">In the embodiments described so far it has been assumed that the micromirrors <b>56</b> are aligned parallel to the borderlines of the object areas <b>110</b>. The rectangular grid formed by the micromirrors <b>56</b> is then parallel to the rectangular grid which is formed by the light entrance facets <b>75</b>. This results in irradiance distributions as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 15</figref> in which the irradiance along one “column” of micromirrors <b>56</b> is always uniform. Thus only stepped irradiance distributions can be produced on the light entrance facets <b>75</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0145">Sometimes it is desirable to produce irradiance distributions that are not stepped, but contain inclined portions. This can be achieved if the two rectangular grids are not arranged parallel to each other, but with an angle α, as this is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. Here the images <b>56</b>′ of the micromirrors <b>56</b> form a grid <b>114</b> which forms an angle α with the lateral sides of the light entrance facet <b>75</b>. Then the centers of adjacent micromirrors <b>56</b> are aligned along a straight line having an image <b>116</b> that forms the same angle α to a boundary line of the light entrance facet <b>75</b>. If this angle α is distinct from m·45° with m=0, 1, 2, 3, . . . , the irradiance distribution will not have the shape of stepped profiles as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 15</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0146"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is a graph that illustrates the scan integrated irradiance distribution along the X direction for the rotated arrangement shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. Some particular X positions are indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> with broken lines. If the angle α is distinct from m·45° with m=0, 1, 2, 3, . . . , the degeneration is reduced so that a desired attenuation can be obtained at more different X positions. In other words, it is thus possible to effectively increase the resolution along the X direction that is available to modify the field dependence of the angular irradiance distribution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0017" num="0000">6. Gaps—Lateral Displacement</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0147">As mentioned further above, it is usually inevitable that small gaps are formed between adjacent micromirrors <b>56</b> of the second mirror array <b>38</b>. Images of these gaps are formed on the light entrance facets <b>75</b> and also on the mask <b>16</b>. If these images extend parallel to the cross-scan direction X, this is of little concern because of the integrating effect that results from the scan operation. However, dark lines extending parallel to the scan direction Y could not be compensated by the integrating effect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0143" num="0148"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20<i>a </i> </figref>shows in the upper portion a top view on one of the light entrance facets <b>75</b> in which the images of the gaps are denoted by <b>118</b>′. The graph in the lower portion of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20<i>a </i> </figref>illustrates the irradiance distribution along the cross-scan direction X that is produced by this particular light entrance facet <b>75</b> in the mask plane <b>88</b>. If all light entrance facets <b>75</b> would produce dark lines <b>120</b> at the same X positions, no projection light would reach points on the mask <b>16</b> at these positions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0144" num="0149"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20<i>b </i>and 20<i>c </i> </figref>show other light entrance facets <b>75</b> in which the gap images <b>118</b>′ are laterally displaced along the cross-scan direction X to different degrees. Consequently also the dark lines <b>120</b> in the irradiance distributions shown in the lower portion of these figures are laterally displaced. Since the irradiance distributions produced by each optical channel are superimposed in the mask plane <b>88</b>, the dark lines <b>120</b> are averaged out, as this is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. The larger the number of light entrance facets <b>75</b> is and the smaller the dark lines <b>120</b> are, the more approximates the irradiance distribution I(x) in the mask plane <b>88</b> a uniform distribution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0018" num="0000">6. Gaps—Scattering Plate</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0150">Alternatively or additionally, a scattering plate <b>122</b> may be arranged in an optical path between the optical light modulator <b>52</b> and the mask plane <b>88</b> in order to avoid dark lines on the mask plane <b>88</b> caused by gap images <b>118</b>′. Suitable positions of the scattering plate <b>122</b> are between the optical light modulator <b>52</b> and the objective <b>58</b>, between the objective <b>58</b> and the optical integrator <b>60</b>, or in the vicinity of the field stop plane <b>80</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0151"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is a schematic meridional section showing several micromirrors <b>56</b> of the spatial light modulator <b>52</b>, the objective <b>58</b> and the scattering plate <b>122</b> arranged in between. A gap <b>118</b> between two adjacent micromirrors <b>56</b> is assumed to have a width d, and the axial distance between the scattering plate <b>122</b> and the light exit surface <b>57</b> of the spatial light modulator <b>52</b> is denoted by b. If the characteristic scattering angle β of the scattering plate <b>122</b> is approximately d/b, the image of the gap <b>118</b> formed on the light entrance facet <b>75</b> is sufficiently blurred. If the scattering angle β is significantly larger than d/b, the desired spatial resolution for the field dependence of the irradiance and the angular irradiance distribution is reduced. If the scattering angle β is too small, the images of the gaps will still be prominent on the light entrance facets <b>75</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0019" num="0000">7. Rectangular Object Areas</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0147" num="0152">In the embodiments described above it has been assumed that the number of micromirrors <b>56</b> along the scan direction Y and the cross-scan direction X is identical. Then a rectangular grid of square micromirrors <b>56</b> perfectly fits into a square light entrance facet <b>75</b> of the optical integrator <b>60</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0148" num="0153">The number N<sub>X </sub>of micromirrors <b>56</b> along the cross-scan direction X determines the resolution that is available for adjusting the field dependence of the irradiance and the angular irradiance distribution. This number should be as high as possible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0149" num="0154">The number N<sub>Y </sub>of micromirrors <b>56</b> along the scan direction Y may be significantly smaller because of the integrating effect caused by the scan operation. Illustratively speaking, a plurality of optical channels adjacent along the scan direction Y may contribute to the reduction of the irradiance on a point on the mask <b>16</b> during a scan cycle. This does not apply to optical channels that are adjacent along the cross-scan direction X.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0150" num="0155">This suggests that the object area <b>110</b> may well be rectangular, with the length along the cross-scan direction X being larger (for example two times and preferably at least five times larger) than the length of the object area along the scan direction Y. Assuming micromirrors <b>56</b> having equal dimensions along the directions X and Y, this implies that the number N<sub>X </sub>of micromirrors <b>56</b> along the cross-scan direction X is larger than the number N<sub>Y </sub>along the scan direction Y.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0156">If a rectangular object area <b>110</b> shall be imaged on a square light entrance facet <b>75</b>, the objective <b>58</b> has to be anamorphotic. More specifically, the absolute value of the magnification M has to be smaller along the cross-scan direction X than along the scan direction Y, i.e. |M<sub>X</sub>|&lt;|M<sub>Y</sub>|. This is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> in which two cylinder lenses <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> of the objective <b>58</b> are arranged between a single rectangular object area <b>110</b> and the light entrance facet <b>75</b> of an optical raster element <b>74</b>. If the length of the object area <b>110</b> along the cross-scan direction X is Lx and the length along the scan direction Y is L<sub>Y</sub>, |M<sub>X</sub>/M<sub>Y</sub>| should be equal to L<sub>Y</sub>/L<sub>X</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0152" num="0157">A similar result is achieved if not the objective <b>58</b>, but the subsequent condenser <b>78</b> is anamorphotic so that its focal length f is different for the X and Y directions. If the objective <b>58</b> is rotational symmetric so that M<sub>X</sub>=M<sub>Y</sub>, the irradiance distributions on the light entrance facets <b>75</b> will be rectangular with the same aspect ratio L<sub>X</sub>/L<sub>Y </sub>as the object area <b>110</b>. This rectangular irradiance distribution is then expanded by the anamorphotic condenser <b>78</b> so that a square irradiance distribution is obtained in the field stop plane <b>80</b> and the subsequent mask plane <b>88</b>. This approach may involve a redesign of the optical integrator <b>60</b> because the condenser's different focal lengths along the directions X, Y have to be compensated by the refractive power of the optical raster elements <b>74</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0020" num="0000">8. Arrangement of Mirror Plane</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0153" num="0158">It is usually preferred if the chief rays of the projection light impinge perpendicularly on the optical integrator <b>60</b>. Then also the mirror plane <b>57</b>, which is imaged by the objective <b>58</b> on the light entrance facets <b>75</b>, is arranged perpendicularly to the optical axis OA, as this is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. In such a parallel arrangement of the micromirrors <b>56</b> and the light entrance facets <b>75</b> the micromirrors <b>56</b> have to produce a deflection angle which is distinct from zero if they are in the “on”-state. This is different to conventional digital mirror devices (DMD) in which all mirror surfaces are arranged in a single plane if they are in the “on”-state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0154" num="0159">Additionally or alternatively, the second mirror array <b>54</b> and the light entrance facets <b>75</b> may be arranged in off-axis regions of the object field and the image field of the objective <b>58</b>, respectively. As it is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, it is then possible to use an objective <b>58</b> such that it is not telecentric on the object side, but telecentric on the image side. This means that chief rays forming an angle with the optical axis OA on the object side are nevertheless parallel to the optical axis OA on the image side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0021" num="0000">9. Grouping Object Areas</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0155" num="0160">If the number of micromirrors <b>56</b> in each object area <b>110</b> and also the number of optical channels (and thus of the light entrance facets <b>75</b>) shall be large, the total number of micromirrors <b>56</b> in the second mirror array <b>54</b> may become huge. Since it might be difficult to provide a single second mirror array <b>54</b> that includes such a huge number of micromirrors <b>56</b>, it is envisaged to split up the second mirror device into several sub-units. More specifically, the second mirror array <b>54</b> may be combined from several groups of object areas, wherein the groups are separated from each other by dark areas (i.e. an area from which no projection light emerges) that are not imaged on the light entrance facets. Each group may be realized as a single device, for example a digital mirror device (DMD).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0156" num="0161"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> is a schematic meridional section through the second mirror array <b>54</b> and the objective <b>58</b> according to this embodiment. It is assumed that the second mirror array <b>54</b> includes two groups <b>54</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>54</b>-<b>2</b> each realized as digital mirror device (DMD). Each group <b>54</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>54</b>-<b>2</b> includes three object areas <b>110</b> that extend over a plurality of micromirrors <b>56</b>. The two groups <b>54</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>54</b>-<b>2</b> are separated by a dark area <b>130</b> which is absorptive and on which no projection light should be directed by the pupil forming unit <b>36</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0157" num="0162">The objective <b>58</b> is configured to combine the images <b>110</b>′ of the object areas <b>110</b> so that they abut at least substantially seamlessly on the optical integrator <b>60</b>. There each image area <b>110</b>′ completely coincides with one of the light entrance facets <b>75</b>. To this end the objective <b>58</b> produces magnified images of the object areas <b>110</b> in an intermediate image plane <b>132</b> with the help of a first array of lenses <b>134</b>. The objective <b>58</b> further includes an array of second lenses <b>136</b> that is arranged in the intermediate image plane <b>132</b>. Common imaging optics <b>138</b> then image the intermediate image plane <b>134</b>, in which the magnified images of the groups already abut, on the light entrance facets <b>75</b> of the optical integrator <b>60</b>. In this way the dark areas <b>130</b> between the groups <b>54</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>54</b>-<b>2</b> is not imaged by the objective <b>58</b> on the optical integrator <b>60</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0022" num="0000">10. Active and Passive Areas</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0158" num="0163">Instead of providing a huge number of micromirrors <b>56</b> so that the light irradiance distribution on every light entrance facet <b>75</b> can be modified, it may be envisaged to modify the light irradiance distribution not on all, but only on some light entrance facets <b>75</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0164">This approach is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> which is a top view on the second mirror <b>54</b>. Groups <b>54</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>54</b>-<b>6</b> including at least one and preferably several object areas <b>110</b> each including a plurality of micromirrors <b>56</b> are arranged within the mirror plane <b>57</b>. Also in this embodiment each group may be realized as a digital mirror device (DMD). Since object areas <b>110</b> are referred to in the following as active object areas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0165">The entire area outside the groups <b>54</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>54</b>-<b>6</b> is configured as a plane reflective surface <b>140</b> which is provided with openings <b>142</b> in which the groups <b>54</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>54</b>-<b>6</b> are received. The reflective surface <b>140</b> may be considered as being formed as a combination of passive object areas that are also imaged on the light entrance facets <b>75</b>, but in which no spatial light modulation is possible. The entire second mirror array <b>54</b> thus has the effect of a plane mirror in which the deflection angle of certain portions (namely the portions where the groups <b>54</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>54</b>-<b>6</b> are arranged) can be individually controlled.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0166">This approach exploits the fact that it is usually not necessary to modify the irradiance distribution on every light entrance facet <b>75</b> for corrective purposes. Correction of the pole balance in the case of a dipole illumination setting, for example, involves only that the irradiance in one pole is reduced; the irradiance distribution in the other pole may remain as it is. For that reason the groups <b>54</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>54</b>-<b>6</b> are arranged point-symmetrically with respect to the optical axis OA. For any arbitrary arrangement of poles it is then possible to reduce the irradiance in a field dependent manner using the active object areas <b>110</b> contained in the group that is illuminated by one of the poles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0167">In this context it may be expedient to concentrate more projection light in the pole that illuminates a group with the active object areas. This pole is then used to perform the desired field dependent corrections of the irradiance and/or the angular irradiance distribution. The (albeit small) light loss which is inevitably involved in such a correction compensates the originally unbalanced illumination of the poles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0168">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> this is illustrated for two poles <b>27</b> <i>a</i>, <b>27</b> <i>b</i>. The pole <b>27</b> <i>a </i>which one is located in the third group <b>54</b>-<b>3</b> is brighter than the other pole <b>27</b> <i>b </i>in the passive area <b>140</b>.</div>

In this illumination system the pupil forming unit <b>52</b> is replaced by a diffractive optical element <b>142</b>, zoom optics <b>144</b> and a pair of axicon elements <b>146</b>, <b>148</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0170">The spatial light modulator <b>52</b> in this embodiment is formed by an LCD panel including a two dimensional array of minute LCD cells whose optical activity can be controlled individually by the control unit <b>90</b>. If the projection light produced by the light source <b>11</b> is not sufficiently polarized, an additional polarizer may be inserted in the light path in front of the spatial light modulator <b>52</b>.</div>
