<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of copending U.S. application Ser. No. 12/874,392, filed on Sep. 2, 2010 which is incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<heading id="h-0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention hereinafter disclosed relates to a light-emitting element including a light-emitting layer between a pair of electrodes. The present invention also relates to a light-emitting device in which the light-emitting element is used and a lighting device and an electronic device in each of which the light-emitting device is used.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, a light-emitting element in which a light-emitting organic compound or a light-emitting inorganic compound is used as a light-emitting substance has been actively developed. In particular, a light-emitting element called an electroluminescence (hereinafter, EL) element has a simple structure in which a light-emitting layer containing a light-emitting substance is provided between electrodes, and has attracted attention as a next-generation flat panel display element because of its characteristics such as thinness, lightweight, high response speed, and direct current low voltage driving. In addition, a display in which such a light-emitting element is used has a feature in that it is excellent in contrast and image quality and has a wide viewing angle. Moreover, such a light-emitting element is a plane light source; therefore, such a light-emitting element is considered to be applied as a light source such as a backlight of a liquid crystal display and lighting.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Current is applied to a light-emitting layer provided between a pair of electrodes in a light-emitting element to excite a light-emitting substance contained in the light-emitting layer, whereby a predetermined emission color can be obtained. Supplying a large amount of current to the light-emitting layer is considered in order to increase emission luminance of such a light-emitting element; however, such a method hinders a reduction in power consumption. In addition, applying a large amount of current also leads to acceleration of deterioration of the light-emitting element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Hence, a light-emitting element is proposed whose emission luminance is increased by stacking a plurality of light-emitting layers and applying current which has the same current density as current applied in the case of a light-emitting element having a single light-emitting layer (e.g., Patent Document 1).</div>

<heading id="h-0004">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In Patent Document 1, a light-emitting element is proposed in which a plurality of light-emitting units (hereinafter in this specification, the light-emitting unit is also referred to as an “EL layer”) are provided and separated by a charge-generation layer. More specifically, a light-emitting element is disclosed in which a charge-generation layer formed of vanadium pentoxide is provided over a metal-doped layer functioning as an electron-injection layer of a first light-emitting unit, and further a second light-emitting unit is stacked over the metal-doped layer with the charge-generation layer interposed therebetween. However, in the light-emitting element having such a structure, mutual interaction occurs between the metal-doped layer and the charge-generation layer formed of the oxide at their interface and the interface has a high electric field; thus, high voltage is needed for driving the light-emitting element, unfortunately.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">There is a problem in that if a layer which has a peak of an absorption spectrum in a wavelength range of 400 nm to 800 nm that is a visible light region exists in an electron-generation layer, light emission from a light-emitting substance is absorbed into the layer, which results in a decrease in light extraction efficiency. Specifically, a peak of an absorption spectrum in a wavelength range of 420 nm to 720 nm causes a pronounced reduction in efficiency. This problem becomes more serious when a plurality of light-emitting units are stacked.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">In view of the above problem, it is an object of the present invention to provide a light-emitting element which can be driven at low voltage. It is another object to provide a light-emitting element with high luminous efficiency. It is another object to provide a light-emitting device the power consumption of which is reduced by manufacturing the light-emitting device using the light-emitting element. It is another object to provide an electronic device or a lighting device the power consumption of which is reduced by using the light-emitting device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">One embodiment disclosed in this specification is a light-emitting element having a structure in which n (n is a natural number of two or more) EL layers are provided between an anode and a cathode, where between the m-th (m is a natural number, 1≦m≦n−1) EL layer and the (m+1)-th EL layer, a first layer containing any of an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal, a rare earth metal, an alkali metal compound, an alkaline earth metal compound, and a rare earth metal compound, a second layer which contains a substance having high electron-transport properties and is in contact with the first layer, and a charge-generation layer which contains a substance having high hole-transport properties and an acceptor substance and is in contact with the second layer are provided in this order over the anode. The charge-generation layer does not have a peak of an absorption spectrum in a visible light region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">One embodiment disclosed in this specification is a light-emitting element having a structure in which n (n is a natural number of two or more) EL layers are provided between an anode and a cathode, where between the m-th (n is a natural number, 1≦m≦n−1) EL layer and the (m+1)-th EL layer, a first layer containing a substance having high electron-transport properties and a donor substance, a second layer which contains a substance having high electron-transport properties and is in contact with the first layer, and a charge-generation layer which contains a substance having high hole-transport properties and an acceptor substance and is in contact with the second layer are provided in this order over the anode. The charge-generation layer does not have a peak of an absorption spectrum in a visible light region.</div>

Further, the donor substance is preferably an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal, a rare earth metal, an alkali metal compound, an alkaline earth metal compound, or a rare earth metal compound.</div>

Of carriers generated in the layer, holes are injected into the (m+1)-th EL layer and electrons move to the second layer. It is preferable that the substance having high hole-transport properties be a carbazole derivative or aromatic hydrocarbon. In addition, it is preferable that the substance having high hole-transport properties does not contain an amine skeleton.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">Further, in the above structure, as the substance having high electron-transport properties that is contained in the second layer, a substance whose LUMO level is preferably greater than or equal to −5.0 eV, more preferably greater than or equal to −5.0 eV and less than or equal to −3.0 eV is preferably used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">Furthermore, with the light-emitting element having the above structure, low driving voltage can be realized; therefore, low power consumption of a light-emitting device (e.g., an image display device or a light-emitting device) in which the light-emitting element is used as a light-emitting element can be realized. Thus, a light-emitting device and an electronic device in each of which the light-emitting element having the above structure is used are also included as one embodiment of the present invention.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">Hereinafter, Embodiments and Examples will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. Note that it is easily understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention disclosed in this specification can be carried out in many different modes, and the modes and details disclosed herein can be modified in various ways without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. Therefore, the present invention should not be construed as being limited to the description of Embodiments and Examples. In the drawings for explaining Embodiments and Examples, the same parts or parts having a similar function are denoted with the same reference numerals, and description of such parts is omitted.</div>
<heading id="h-0007">Embodiment 1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">In Embodiment 1, one embodiment of a light-emitting element will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">In an element structure illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a first EL layer <b>103</b> and a second EL layer <b>107</b> each including a light-emitting region are interposed between a pair of electrodes (i.e., an anode <b>101</b> and a cathode <b>102</b>), and between the first EL layer <b>103</b> and the second EL layer <b>107</b>, an electron-injection buffer <b>104</b>, an electron-relay layer <b>105</b>, and a charge-generation layer <b>106</b> are stacked in this order over the anode <b>101</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">The charge-generation layer <b>106</b> is a layer containing a substance having high hole-transport properties and an acceptor substance, where holes and electrons that are carriers of the light-emitting element are generated. The holes generated in the charge-generation layer <b>106</b> move to the second EL layer <b>107</b> while the electrons move to the electron-relay layer <b>105</b>. Moreover, since the electron-relay layer <b>105</b> has high electron-transport properties, it can quickly transport the electrons to the electron-injection buffer <b>104</b>. Furthermore, since the electron-injection buffer <b>104</b> can reduce injection barriers at the time when the electrons are injected into the first EL layer <b>103</b>, it can increase the efficiency of electron injection into the first EL layer <b>103</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">A substance having high electron-injection properties can be used for the electron-injection buffer <b>104</b>: for example, an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal, a rare earth metal, a compound of the above metal (e.g., an alkali metal compound (an oxide such as lithium oxide, a halide, or carbonate such as lithium carbonate or cesium carbonate), an alkaline earth metal compound (e.g., an oxide, a halide, or carbonate), or a rare earth metal compound (e.g., an oxide, a halide, or carbonate). Alternatively, the electron-injection buffer <b>104</b> may contain a substance having high electron-transport properties and a donor substance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a band diagram of the element structure of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, reference numeral <b>111</b> denotes the Fermi level of the anode <b>101</b>; <b>112</b>, the Fermi level of the cathode <b>102</b>; <b>113</b>, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the first EL layer <b>103</b>; <b>114</b>, the LUMO level of the electron-relay layer <b>105</b>; <b>115</b>, the acceptor level of an acceptor in the charge-generation layer <b>106</b>; and <b>116</b>, the LUMO level of the second EL layer <b>107</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the holes injected from the anode <b>101</b> are injected into the first EL layer <b>103</b>. In contrast, the electrons generated in the charge-generation layer <b>106</b> move to the electron-relay layer <b>105</b>, and then injected into the first EL layer <b>103</b> through the electron-injection buffer <b>104</b>, and recombined with the holes, whereby light is emitted. In addition, the holes generated in the charge-generation layer <b>106</b> move to the second EL layer <b>107</b> and recombined with the electrons injected from the cathode <b>102</b> in the second EL layer <b>107</b>, whereby light is emitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">In the light-emitting element described in this embodiment, since the electron-relay layer <b>105</b> functions as a layer for sufficiently injecting electrons generated in the charge-generation layer <b>106</b> into the first EL layer <b>103</b>, the electron-relay layer <b>105</b> is preferably formed using a material whose LUMO level is a level between the acceptor level of the acceptor in the charge-generation layer <b>106</b> and a LUMO level <b>113</b> of the first EL layer <b>103</b>. Specifically, a material whose LUMO level is greater than or equal to about −5.0 eV is preferably used, and a material whose LUMO level is greater than or equal to −5.0 eV and less than or equal to −3.0 eV is more preferably used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">The acceptor substance contained in the charge-generation layer <b>106</b> has strong acceptor properties, and the substance having high electron-injection properties or the donor substance contained in the electron-injection buffer <b>104</b> has strong donor properties; therefore, when the charge-generation layer <b>106</b> and the electron-injection buffer <b>104</b> are in contact with each other, electrons are donated and accepted at the interface between the charge-generation layer <b>106</b> and the electron-injection buffer <b>104</b>, which leads to an increase in driving voltage of the light-emitting element. In addition, the driving voltage of the light-emitting element might be increased when a PN junction is formed at the interface between the charge-generation layer <b>106</b> and the electron-injection buffer <b>104</b>. However, in the light-emitting element described in this embodiment, the charge-generation layer <b>106</b> and the electron-injection buffer <b>104</b> can be prevented from being in contact with each other by the electron-relay layer <b>105</b>; thus, the acceptor substance contained in the charge-generation layer <b>106</b> and the substance having high electron-injection properties or the donor substance contained in the electron-injection buffer <b>104</b> can be prevented from interacting with each other by the electron-relay layer <b>105</b>. In addition, the electron-relay layer <b>105</b> is formed using a material whose LUMO level falls within the above-described range, whereby a high electric field of the interface between the electron-relay layer <b>105</b> and the electron-injection buffer <b>104</b> is prevented, and the electrons generated in the charge-generation layer <b>106</b> can be efficiently injected into the first EL layer <b>103</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">Further, as illustrated in the band diagram of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the electrons that have moved to the electron-relay layer <b>105</b> from the charge-generation layer <b>106</b> are easily injected into the LUMO level <b>113</b> of the first EL layer <b>103</b> because of a reduced injection barrier due to the electron-injection buffer <b>104</b>. Note that the holes generated in the charge-generation layer <b>106</b> move to the second EL layer <b>107</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">Next, a material that can be used for the above-described light-emitting element will be specifically described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">The anode <b>101</b> is preferably formed using a metal, an alloy, an electrically-conductive compound, a mixture thereof, or the like having a high work function (specifically, a work function of greater than or equal to 4.0 eV). Specifically, indium tin oxide (ITO), indium tin oxide containing silicon or silicon oxide, indium zinc oxide (IZO), indium oxide containing tungsten oxide and zinc oxide, and the like can be given, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">Films of these conductive metal oxides are usually formed by a sputtering method. Alternatively, the films may be formed by application of a sol-gel method or the like. For example, a film of indium zinc oxide (IZO) can be formed by a sputtering method using a target in which zinc oxide is added to indium oxide at 1 wt % to 20 wt %. Indium oxide containing tungsten oxide and zinc oxide can be formed by a sputtering method using a target in which tungsten oxide and zinc oxide are added to indium oxide at 0.5 wt % to 5 wt % and 0.1 wt % to 1 wt %, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">Besides, the following can be given: gold (Au), platinum (Pt), nickel (Ni), tungsten (W), chromium (Cr), molybdenum (Mo), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), palladium (Pd), titanium (Ti), a nitride of a metal material (e.g., titanium nitride), molybdenum oxide, vanadium oxide, ruthenium oxide, tungsten oxide, manganese oxide, titanium oxide, and the like. Alternatively, a conductive polymer such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PEDOT/PSS) or polyaniline/poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PAni/PSS) may be used. Note that, in the case where a charge-generation layer to be in contact with the anode <b>101</b> is provided as part of the first EL layer <b>103</b>, a variety of conductive materials such as Al and Ag can be used for the anode <b>101</b> regardless of the magnitude of their work functions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">The cathode <b>102</b> can be formed using a metal, an alloy, an electrically-conductive compound, a mixture of thereof, or the like having a low work function (specifically, a work function of less than or equal to 3.8 eV). As specific examples of such a cathode material, the following can be given: an element that belongs to Group 1 or 2 of the periodic table, that is, an alkali metal such as lithium (Li) or cesium (Cs), an alkaline earth metal such as magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), or strontium (Sr), an alloy containing these (e.g., an MgAg alloy or an AlLi alloy), a rare-earth metal such as europium (Eu) or ytterbium (Yb), an alloy containing these, and the like. Note that a film of an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal, or an alloy thereof can be formed by a vacuum evaporation method. Alternatively, an alloy containing an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal can be formed by a sputtering method. Further alternatively, a film can be formed using silver paste or the like by an ink-jet method or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">Alternatively, the cathode <b>102</b> can be formed using a stack of a film of a metal such as aluminum and a thin film of an alkali metal compound, an alkaline earth metal compound, or a rare earth metal compound (e.g., lithium fluoride (LiF), lithium oxide (LiOx), cesium fluoride (CsF), calcium fluoride (CaF<sub>2</sub>), or erbium fluoride (ErF<sub>3</sub>)). Note that in the case where the charge-generation layer to be in contact with the cathode <b>102</b> is provided as part of the second EL layer <b>107</b>, a variety of conductive materials such as Al, Ag, ITO, and indium tin oxide containing silicon or silicon oxide can be used for the cathode <b>102</b> regardless of the magnitude of their work functions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">Note that in the light-emitting element described in this embodiment, at least one of the anode and the cathode may have light-transmitting properties. The light-transmitting properties can be ensured with the use of a transparent electrode such as ITO, or by a reduction in the thickness of an electrode.</div>

The present inventors found out that in the case where the charge-generation layer <b>106</b> is formed using an acceptor substance and a compound which does not contain an amine skeleton, the charge-generation layer <b>106</b> serves as a charge-generation layer although no absorption based on charge transfer interaction between the substance having high hole-transport properties and the acceptor substance occurs. This allows a charge-generation layer which does not have an absorption peak in a visible light region to be easily formed; thus, a decrease in luminous efficiency due to absorption of light can be prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">Note that as described in Patent Document 1, conventionally, it is conventionally important that a charge transfer complex be formed in a charge-generation layer by oxidation-reduction reaction. In addition, according to Patent Document 1, when the ionization potential of an organic compound is 5.7 eV or higher, the oxidation-reduction reaction between the organic compound and an acceptor substance is less likely to occur. Thus, in order to promote the occurrence of oxidation-reduction reaction, a substance the ionization potential of which is 5.7 eV or lower, specifically, a substance having high electron-donor properties, such as arylamine, has been needed as an organic compound. However, when oxidation-reduction reaction occurs between such a compound having an arylamine skeleton and an acceptor substance, absorption based on charge transfer interaction is generated in the visible light region and the infrared region. In fact, the absorption spectrum disclosed in Patent Document 1 shows that new absorption is generated at wavelengths of around 500 nm and 1300 nm by mixing a compound having an arylamine skeleton with oxide vanadium. In addition, when the compound having an arylamine skeleton is mixed with 7,7,8,8-tetracyano-2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroquinodimethane (abbreviation: F<sub>4</sub>-TCNQ), new absorption is generated at wavelengths of around 700 nm, 900 nm, and 1200 nm. In that case, an absorption peak especially in the visible light region triggers a decrease in luminous efficiency. However, formation of a charge transfer complex has been conventionally considered to be indispensable for a charge-generation layer and absorption to be inevitable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">In contrast, in one embodiment of the present invention, the charge-generation layer <b>106</b> is formed using an acceptor substance and a compound which does not contain an amine skeleton; however, the charge-generation layer <b>106</b> functions as a charge-generation layer although no absorption based on charge transfer interaction is exhibited in a visible light region and an infrared region. In such a charge-generation layer, electric charge might be generated by application of an electric field, and holes and electrons might be injected into the EL layer. This aspect is different from that of a conventional charge-generation layer. In fact, 9-[4-(10-phenyl-9-anthracenyl)phenyl]-9H-carbazole (abbreviation: CzPA) that is a carbazole derivative not containing an amine skeleton does not generate absorption based on charge transfer interaction even if it is mixed with molybdenum oxide that is an acceptor substance, probably because the ionization potential of CzPA of 5.7 eV (AC-2, product of Riken Keiki Co., Ltd.) is pretty high for a value of ionization potential. However, the charge-generation layer <b>106</b> functions as a charge-generation layer; thus, a compound which does not contain an amine skeleton and an acceptor substance can be used in one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the ionization potential of the compound which does not contain an amine skeleton is preferably greater than or equal to 5.7 eV.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">Note that as examples of the compound not containing an amine skeleton, the following can be preferably given: the above-described carbazole derivatives such as CBP (abbreviation), TCPB (abbreviation), CzPA (abbreviation), PCzPA (abbreviation), and 1,4-bis[4-(N-carbazolyl)phenyl]-2,3,5,6-tetraphenylbenzene; and aromatic hydrocarbon such as t-BuDNA (abbreviation), DPPA (abbreviation), t-BuDBA (abbreviation), DNA (abbreviation), DPAnth (abbreviation), t-BuAnth (abbreviation), DMNA (abbreviation), 2-tert-butyl-9,10-di(1-naphthyl)anthracene, 9,10-bis[2-(1-naphthyl)phenyl]-2-tert-butylanthracene, 9,10-bis[2-(1-naphthyl)phenyl]anthracene, 2,3,6,7-tetramethyl-9,10-di(1-naphthyl)anthracene, 2,3,6,7-tetramethyl-9,10-di(2-naphthyl)anthracene, 9,9′-bianthryl, 10,10′-diphenyl-9′,9′-bianthryl, 10,10′-bis(2-phenylphenyl)-9,9′-bianthryl, 10,10′-bis[(2,3,4,5,6-pentaphenyl)phenyl]-9,9′-bianthryl, anthracene, DPVBi (abbreviation), and DPVPA (abbreviation). Further, a polymer of a carbazole derivative, such as PVK, may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">As examples of the acceptor substance that is used for the charge-generation layer <b>106</b>, a transition metal oxide and an oxide of a metal belonging to any of Groups 4 to 8 of the periodic table can be given. Specifically, vanadium oxide, niobium oxide, tantalum oxide, chromium oxide, molybdenum oxide, tungsten oxide, manganese oxide, and rhenium oxide are preferable because of their high electron-transport properties. Among them, molybdenum oxide is particularly preferable. Molybdenum oxide has low hygroscopic properties. Besides, an organic compound such as 7,7,8,8-tetracyano-2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroquinodimethane (abbreviation: F<sub>4</sub>-TCNQ), chloranil can be given.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">Furthermore, in optical design, when the thickness of each layer is changed, driving voltage might be increased. For that reason, it is preferable that the optical design be performed on the charge-generation layer <b>106</b> because a change in driving voltage is small even in the case where the thickness of the charge-generation layer <b>106</b> is changed. However, the thickness of the charge-generation layer <b>106</b> having a peak of an absorption spectrum in the visible light region is increased, light emitted from the light-emitting layer is absorbed into the charge-generation layer <b>106</b>, which results in a decrease in light extraction efficiency. Thus, a substance that is used for the charge-generation layer <b>106</b> is preferably a substance that does not have a peak of an absorption spectrum in the visible light region. Using the substance that does not have a peak of an absorption spectrum in the visible light region for the charge-generation layer <b>106</b> makes it possible to improve extraction efficiency of light emitted from the light-emitting layer. In addition, increasing the thickness of the charge-generation layer <b>106</b> can prevent a short circuit of the light-emitting element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">Note that it is preferable that the acceptor substance be added to the charge-generation layer <b>106</b> so that the mass ratio of the acceptor substance to a substance having high hole-transport properties is from 0.1:1 to 4.0:1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">Note that the charge generation layer formed in part of the first EL layer <b>103</b> or the second EL layer <b>107</b> which is described above can be formed using a material similar to that of the charge-generation layer <b>106</b> and can have a structure similar to that of the charge-generation layer <b>106</b>. In addition, a substance that does not have a peak of an absorption spectrum in the visible light region is used for the charge-generation layer formed in part of the first EL layer <b>103</b> or the second EL layer <b>107</b> and the charge-generation layer <b>106</b>, whereby extraction efficiency of light emitted from the light-emitting layer can be further improved. Specifically, a substance which does not have an absorption peak in the wavelength range of 420 nm to 720 nm in a visible light region is used for the charge-generation layer <b>106</b>, whereby luminous efficiency can be substantially improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">The electron-relay layer <b>105</b> is a layer that can quickly receive electrons drawn out by the acceptor substance in the charge-generation layer <b>106</b>. Therefore, the electron-relay layer <b>105</b> is a layer that contains a substance having high electron-transport properties and is preferably formed using a material having a LUMO level between the acceptor level of the acceptor in the charge-generation layer <b>106</b> and the LUMO level of the first EL layer <b>103</b>. Specifically, a material whose LUMO level is about greater than or equal to −5.0 eV is preferably used, and a material whose LUMO level is about greater than or equal to −5.0 eV and less than or equal to −3.0 eV is more preferably used. As examples of the material used for the electron-relay layer <b>105</b>, a perylene derivative and a nitrogen-containing condensed aromatic compound can be given. Note that a nitrogen-containing condensed aromatic compound is preferably used for the electron-relay layer <b>105</b> because of its stability. Furthermore, of nitrogen-containing condensed aromatic compounds, a compound having an electron-withdrawing group such as a cyano group or a fluoro group is preferably used, in which case electrons are more easily received in the electron-relay layer <b>105</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">Here, it is preferable that the thickness of the electron-relay layer <b>105</b> be reduced in order to reduce driving voltage. In addition, reducing the thickness of the electron-relay layer <b>105</b> makes it possible to improve extraction efficiency of light emitted from the light-emitting layer. In particular, most of compounds which are favorable for the electron-relay layer (e.g., a perylene derivative described below) have strong absorption in the visible light region; thus, the electron-relay layer preferably has a small thickness of about 1 nm to 10 nm in terms of light extraction efficiency. Note that since the thickness of the electron-relay layer is preferably reduced as described above, it is preferable that the thickness of the charge-generation layer be changed in performing optical design. Further, in one embodiment of the present invention, the charge-generation layer does not have an absorption peak in the visible light region, and thus light extraction efficiency is not impaired even in the case where the thickness of the charge-generation layer is increased. In other words, a combination of the electron-relay layer for reducing driving voltage and the charge-generation layer which does not have an absorption peak in the visible light region and with which higher efficiency can be achieved is quite effective.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">In this embodiment, the first EL layer <b>103</b> includes a first light-emitting layer <b>103</b> <i>a </i>which exhibits an emission spectrum having a peak in the blue to blue-green wavelength range and a second light-emitting layer <b>103</b> <i>b </i>which exhibits an emission spectrum having a peak in the yellow to orange wavelength range. Further, the second EL layer <b>107</b> includes a third light-emitting layer <b>107</b> <i>a </i>which exhibits an emission spectrum having a peak in the blue-green to green wavelength range and a fourth light-emitting layer <b>107</b> <i>b </i>which exhibits an emission spectrum having a peak in the orange to red wavelength range. Note that the first light-emitting layer <b>103</b> <i>a </i>and the second light-emitting layer <b>103</b> <i>b </i>may be stacked in reverse order. Note also that the third light-emitting layer <b>107</b> <i>a </i>and the fourth light-emitting layer <b>107</b> <i>b </i>may be stacked in reverse order.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">When the anode <b>101</b> side is positively biased and the cathode <b>102</b> side is negatively biased in such a light-emitting element, holes injected from the anode <b>101</b> and electrons generated in the charge-generation layer <b>106</b> and injected through the electron-relay layer <b>105</b> and the electron-injection buffer <b>104</b> are recombined in the first light-emitting layer <b>103</b> <i>a </i>or the second light-emitting layer <b>103</b> <i>b</i>, whereby first light emission <b>330</b> is obtained. Furthermore, electrons injected from the cathode <b>102</b> and holes generated in the charge-generation layer <b>106</b> are recombined in the third light-emitting layer <b>107</b> <i>a </i>or the fourth light-emitting layer <b>107</b> <i>b</i>, whereby second light emission <b>340</b> is obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">The first light emission <b>330</b> is a combination of light emission from both the first light-emitting layer <b>103</b> <i>a </i>and the second light-emitting layer <b>103</b> <i>b</i>; thus, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>, the first light emission <b>330</b> exhibits an emission spectrum having peaks in both the wavelength range of blue to blue-green and the wavelength range of yellow to orange. In other words, the first EL layer <b>103</b> exhibits light emission of a 2-wavelength-type white color or a 2-wavelength-type color that is close to white. Further, the second light emission <b>340</b> is a combination of light emission from both the third light-emitting layer <b>107</b> <i>a </i>and the fourth light-emitting layer <b>107</b> <i>b</i>; thus, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>, the second light emission <b>340</b> exhibits an emission spectrum having peaks in both the wavelength range of blue-green to green and the wavelength range of orange to red. In other words, the second EL layer <b>107</b> exhibits light emission of 2-wavelength-type white color or a 2-wavelength-type color that is close to white, which is different from the light emission of the first EL layer <b>103</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">Accordingly, light emission which covers the wavelength range of blue to blue-green, the wavelength range of blue-green to green, the wavelength range of yellow to orange, and the wavelength range of orange to red can be obtained by the light-emitting element in this embodiment, as a result of combining the first light emission <b>330</b> and the second light emission <b>340</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">In this embodiment, even if, for example, the emission luminance of the first light-emitting layer <b>103</b> <i>a </i>(which exhibits an emission spectrum having a peak in the wavelength range of blue to blue-green) deteriorates over time or changes due to current density, deviation of chromaticity is relatively small because the contribution of the first light-emitting layer <b>103</b> <i>a </i>with respect to the entire spectrum is approximately one quarter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">Note that, although the example has been described in which the first EL layer <b>103</b> exhibits the spectrum having peaks in both the wavelength range of blue to blue-green and the wavelength range of yellow to orange, and the second EL layer <b>107</b> exhibits the spectrum having peaks in both the wavelength range of blue-green to green and the wavelength range of orange to red, the first EL layer <b>103</b> and the second EL layer <b>107</b> each may exhibit the opposite spectrum. In other words, a structure may be employed in which the second EL layer <b>107</b> exhibits the spectrum having peaks in both the wavelength range of blue to blue-green and the wavelength range of yellow to orange, and the first EL layer <b>103</b> exhibits the spectrum having peaks in both the wavelength range of blue-green to green and the wavelength range of orange to red. In addition, each of the first EL layer <b>103</b> and the second EL layer <b>107</b> may have a structure in which a light-emitting layer and layers other than the light-emitting layer are stacked.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">Next, materials that can be used as a light-emitting organic compound for the EL layer of the light-emitting element described in this embodiment will be described. However, materials that can be applied to the light-emitting element described in this embodiment are not limited to those given below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">Blue to blue-green light emission can be obtained, for example, by using perylene, 2,5,8,11-tetra-t-butylperylene (abbreviation: TBP), 9,10-diphenylanthracene, or the like as a guest material, and dispersing the guest material in a suitable host material. The blue to blue-green light emission can also be obtained from a styrylarylene derivative such as 4,4′-bis(2,2-diphenylvinyl)biphenyl (abbreviation: DPVBi), or an anthracene derivative such as 9,10-di-2-naphthylanthracene (abbreviation: DNA) or 9,10-bis(2-naphthyl)-2-t-butylanthracene (abbreviation: t-BuDNA). A polymer such as poly(9,9-dioctylfluolene) may also be used. Further, as a guest material for blue light emission, a styrylamine derivative is preferable. As examples of the styrylamine derivative, N,N′-bis[4-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)phenyl]-N,N′-diphenylstilbene-4,4′-diamine (abbreviation: YGA2S), N,N′-diphenyl-N,N′-bis(9-phenyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)stilbene-4,4′-diamine (abbreviation: PCA2S), and the like can be given. In particular, YGA2S is preferable because it has a peak at around 450 nm. Further, as a host material, an anthracene derivative is preferable; 9,10-bis(2-naphthyl)-2-t-butylanthracene (abbreviation: t-BuDNA) and 9-[4-(10-phenyl-9-anthryl)phenyl]-9H-carbazole (abbreviation: CzPA) are preferable. In particular, CzPA is preferable because of its electrochemical stability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">Blue-green to green light emission can be obtained, for example, by using a coumarin dye such as coumarin 30 or coumarin 6; bis[2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridinato]picolinatoiridium (abbreviation: FIrpic); bis(2-phenylpyridinato)acetylacetonatoiridium (abbreviation: Ir(ppy)<sub>2</sub>(acac)); or the like as a guest material and dispersing the guest material in a suitable host material. The blue-green to green light emission can also be obtained by dispersing perylene or TBP given above in a suitable host material at a high concentration of greater than or equal to 5 wt %. The blue-green to green light emission can also be obtained from a metal complex such as BAlq, Zn(BTZ)<sub>2</sub>, or bis(2-methyl-8-quinolinolato)chlorogallium (Ga(mq)<sub>2</sub>Cl). A polymer such as poly (p-phenylenevinylene) may also be used. Further, an anthracene derivative is preferably used as a guest material of a blue-green to green light-emitting layer, in which case high luminous efficiency can be obtained. For example, when 9,10-bis {4-[4N-(4-diphenylamino)phenyl-N-phenyl]aminophenyl}-2-tert-butylanthracene (abbreviation: DPABPA) is used, highly efficient blue-green light emission can be obtained. Further, an anthracene derivative in which an amino group is substituted into the 2-position is preferably used, in which case highly efficient green light emission can be obtained. In particular, N-(9,10-diphenyl-2-anthryl)-N,9-diphenyl-9H-carbazol-3-amine (abbreviation: 2PCAPA) is suitable because of its long life. As a host material for those materials, an anthracene derivative is preferable; CzPA, which is given above, is preferable because of its electrochemical stability. Further, in the case of manufacturing a light-emitting element which has two peaks in the wavelength range of blue to green is manufactured by combining green light emission with blue light emission, an anthracene derivative having electron-transport properties, such as CzPA, is preferably used as a host material for a blue light-emitting layer and an aromatic amine compound having high hole-transport properties, such as NPB is preferably used as a host material for a green light-emitting layer, in which case light emission can be obtained at an interface between the blue light-emitting layer and the green light-emitting layer. In other words, in such a case, an aromatic amine compound such as NPB is preferable as a host material for a green light-emitting material such as 2PCAPA.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">Yellow to orange light emission can be obtained, for example, by using rubrene, 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-[p-(dimethylamino)styryl]-6-methyl-4H-pyran (abbreviation: DCM1), 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-6-(9-julolidyl)ethenyl-4H-pyran (abbreviation: DCM2), bis[2-(2-thienyl)pyridinato]acetylacetonatoiridium (abbreviation: Ir(thp)<sub>2</sub>(acac)), bis(2-phenylquinolinato)acetylacetonatoiridium (abbreviation: Ir(pq)<sub>2</sub>(acac)), or the like as a guest material and dispersing the guest material in a suitable host material. In particular, a tetracene derivative such as rubrene is preferable as a guest material because of its high efficiency and chemical stability. As a host material in that case, an aromatic amine compound such as NPB is preferable. As another host material, a metal complex such as bis(8-quinolinolato)zinc (abbreviation: Znq2), bis[2-cinnamoyl-8-quinolinolato]zinc (abbreviation: Znsq<sub>2</sub>), or the like can be used as a host material. Further alternatively, a polymer such as poly(2,5-dialkoxy-1,4-phenylenevinylene) may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">Orange to red light emission can be obtained, for example, by using 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2,6-bis[p-(dimethylamino)styryl]-4H-pyran (abbreviation: BisDCM), 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2,6-bis[2-(julolidin-9-yl)ethynyl]-4H-pyran (abbreviation: DCM1), 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-6-(9-julolidyl)ethenyl-4H-pyran (abbreviation: DCM2), bis[2-(2-thienyl)pyridinato]acetylacetonatoiridium (abbreviation: Ir(thp)<sub>2</sub>(acac)), or the like as a guest material and dispersing the guest material in a suitable host material. The orange to red light emission can also be obtained from a metal complex such as bis(8-quinolinolato)zinc (abbreviation: Znq<sub>2</sub>) or bis[2-cinnamoyl-8-quinolinolato) zinc (abbreviation: Znsq<sub>2</sub>). A polymer such as poly(3-alkylthiophene) may also be used. As a guest material which exhibits red light emission, a 4H-pyran derivative such as 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2,6-bis[p-(dimethylamino)styryl]-4H-pyran (abbreviation: BisDCM), 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2,6-bis[2-(julolidin-9-yl)ethynyl]-4H-pyran (abbreviation: DCM1), 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-6-(9-julolidyl)ethynyl-4H-pyran (abbreviation: DCM2), {2-isopropyl-6-[2-(2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1,1,7,7-tetramethyl-1H,5H-benzo[ij]quinolizin-9-yl)ethenyl]-4H-pyran-4-ylidene}propanedinitrile (abbreviation: DCJTI), or {2,6-bis[2-(2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-8-methoxy-1,1,7,7-tetramethyl-1H,5H-benzo[ij]quinolizin-9-yl)ethenyl]-4H-pyran-4-ylidene}propanedinitrile (abbreviation: BisDCJTM) is preferable because of its high efficiency. In particular, DCJTI and BisDCJTM are preferable because they have a light emission peak at around 620 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">As a suitable host material in the above-described structures, a host material which has a shorter wavelength than the light-emitting organic compound or a host material which has a large energy gap is preferably used. Specifically, a hole-transport material or an electron-transport material typified by the examples given in Embodiment 1 can be selected as appropriate. Also, 4,4′-bis(N-carbazolyl)-biphenyl (abbreviation: CBP), 4,4′,4″-tris(N-carbazolyl)triphenylamine (abbreviation: TCTA), 1,3,5-tris[4-(N-carbazolyl)phenyl]benzene (abbreviation: TCPB), or the like may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0136">White light emission which covers the wavelength range of blue to blue-green, the wavelength range of blue-green to green, the wavelength range of yellow to orange, and the wavelength range of orange to red can be obtained by the light-emitting element described in this embodiment, as a result of combining the emission spectrum of the first EL layer and the emission spectrum of the second EL layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">Note that light may be made more like natural light having a continuous emission spectrum in such a manner that the thickness of each stacked layer is adjusted and slight interference of light is deliberately caused so that generation of a projected sharp peak is suppressed and a trapezoidal emission spectrum is obtained. In addition, the position of a peak of an emission spectrum can also be changed by adjusting the thickness of each stacked layer and intentionally causing slight interference of light. By adjusting the thickness of each stacked layer so that a plurality of peak intensities which appear in an emission spectrum are made substantially the same and by decreasing the intervals between the peaks, white light emission having an emission spectrum which is closer to a trapezoidal shape can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0138">Note that in this embodiment, the EL layer is described in which in each of the plurality of light-emitting layers, emission colors that are complementary colors are combined to obtain white light emission. A specific structure of an EL layer which exhibits white light emission by the relationship of complementary colors will be described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139">The EL layer provided in the light-emitting element described in this embodiment has a structure in which, for example, a first layer containing a substance having high hole-transport properties and a first light-emitting substance; a second layer containing a substance having high hole-transport properties and a second light-emitting substance; and a third layer containing a substance having high electron-transport properties and the second light-emitting substance are stacked in this order over the anode <b>101</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0140">Both the first light-emitting substance and the second light-emitting substance need to emit light in order that white light emission is obtained in the EL layers of the light-emitting element described in this embodiment. Thus, in order to adjust the transport properties of carriers in the EL layers, both the substance having high electron-transport properties and the substance having high electron-transport properties are preferably used as host materials. Note that as the substance having high electron-transport properties and the substance having high electron-transport properties which can be used for the EL layers, the substances given as examples in Embodiment 1 can be used as appropriate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0141">Further, as the first light-emitting substance and the second light-emitting substance, substances emitting light of colors that are complementary colors can be selected. As for the complementary colors, color combinations of blue and yellow, blue-green and red, and the like can be given. A substance which emits blue, yellow, blue-green, or red light may be selected as appropriate from, for example, the light-emitting substances given above. Note that the emission wavelength of the second light-emitting substance is made to be shorter than the emission wavelength of the first light-emitting substance, whereby part of excitation energy of the second light-emitting substance is transferred to the first light-emitting substance, so that the first light-emitting substance can be made to emit light. Thus, in the light-emitting element of this embodiment, the emission peak wavelength of the second light-emitting substance is preferably shorter than the emission peak wavelength of the first light-emitting substance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0143" num="0142">In the structure of the light-emitting element described in this embodiment, both light emission from the first light-emitting substance and light emission from the second light-emitting substance can be obtained, and the emission color of the first light-emitting substance and the emission color of the second light-emitting substance are complementary colors, and thus white light emission can be obtained. In addition, the structure of the light-emitting element described in this embodiment is employed, whereby a light-emitting element with a long life can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0144" num="0143">Note that the structure described in this embodiment can be combined with any of the structures described in other embodiments as appropriate.</div>

Further, in each of the EL layers, at least a light-emitting layer is provided, and a hole-injection layer, a hole-transport layer, an electron-transport layer, or an electron-injection layer is provided as appropriate in addition to the light-emitting layer. In other words, the light-emitting element <b>12</b> has a structure similar to the one described in any of Embodiments 1 to 4. A drain region of the transistor <b>11</b> is electrically connected to the first electrode <b>13</b> by a wiring <b>17</b> penetrating a first interlayer insulating film <b>16</b> (<b>16</b> <i>a</i>, <b>16</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>16</b> <i>c</i>).

Further, many oxide semiconductors, for example, zinc oxide (ZnO), indium oxide containing zinc oxide (IZO), oxide containing indium oxide, gallium oxide, and zinc oxide (IGZO), are n-type semiconductors; thus, a transistor in which any of those compounds is contained in an active layer is an n-channel transistor. In a case other than the above, a light-emitting device may have a circuit including either an n-channel transistor or a p-channel transistor, or may have a circuit including both an n-channel transistor and a p-channel transistor.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0183" num="0182">First, the light-emitting element <b>1</b> will be described (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>). Indium tin oxide containing silicon oxide was deposited over a glass substrate <b>2100</b> by a sputtering method to form a first electrode <b>2101</b>. The first electrode <b>2101</b> had a thickness of 110 nm and an area of 2 mm×2 mm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0184" num="0183">Next, the substrate on which the first electrode <b>2101</b> was formed was fixed to a substrate holder provided in a vacuum evaporation apparatus in such a way that a surface of the substrate on which the first electrode <b>2101</b> was formed faced downward, and then the pressure was reduced to about 10<sup>−4 </sup>Pa. After that, 9-[4-(10-phenyl-9-anthryl)phenyl]-9H-carbazole (abbreviation: CzPA) that is a substance having high hole-transport properties and molybdenum(VI) oxide that is an acceptor substance were co-evaporated on the first electrode <b>2101</b> to form a first charge-generation layer <b>2103</b> <i>a </i>containing a composite material of an organic compound and an inorganic compound. The thickness of the first charge-generation layer <b>2103</b> <i>a </i>was 50 nm. The weight ratio of CzPA to molybdenum(VI) oxide was adjusted to be 4:2 (=CzPA:molybdenum oxide). Note that the co-evaporation method is an evaporation method in which evaporation is performed from a plurality of evaporation sources at the same time in one treatment chamber.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0185" num="0184">Next, NPB was deposited to a thickness of 10 nm on the first charge-generation layer <b>2103</b> <i>a </i>by an evaporation method using resistance heating to form a hole-transport layer <b>2103</b> <i>b. </i> </div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0190" num="0189">Next, CzPA that is a substance having high hole-transport properties and molybdenum(VI) oxide that is an acceptor substance were co-evaporated on the electron-relay layer <b>2105</b> to form a second charge-generation layer <b>2106</b>. The thickness of the second charge-generation layer <b>2106</b> was 60 mm. The weight ratio of CzPA to molybdenum(VI) oxide was adjusted to be 4:2 (=CzPA:molybdenum oxide).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0191" num="0190">Next, a second EL layer <b>2107</b> was formed on the second charge-generation layer <b>2106</b>.

Then, lithium fluoride (LiF) was evaporated to a thickness of 1 nm on the electron-transport layer <b>2107</b> <i>c </i>to form an electron-injection layer <b>2107</b> <i>d</i>. Thus, the second EL layer <b>2107</b> including the hole-transport layer <b>2107</b> <i>a</i>, the light-emitting layer <b>2107</b> <i>b</i>, the electron-transport layer <b>2107</b> <i>c</i>, and the electron-injection layer <b>2107</b> <i>d </i>was formed.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0211" num="0210">Methods for manufacturing a light-emitting element <b>2</b> and a comparative light-emitting element <b>3</b> will be described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0212" num="0211">First, the light-emitting element <b>2</b> will be described (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>). Indium tin oxide containing silicon oxide was deposited over a glass substrate <b>2100</b> by a sputtering method to form a first electrode <b>2101</b>. The first electrode <b>2101</b> had a thickness of 110 nm and an area of 2 mm×2 mm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0213" num="0212">Next, the substrate on which the first electrode <b>2101</b> was formed was fixed to a substrate holder provided in a vacuum evaporation apparatus in such a way that a surface of the substrate on which the first electrode <b>2101</b> was formed faced downward, and then the pressure was reduced to about 10<sup>−4 </sup>Pa. After that, 9-phenyl-3-[4-(10-phenyl-9-anthryl)phenyl]-9H-carbazole (abbreviation: PCzPA) that is a substance having high hole-transport properties and molybdenum(VI) oxide that is an acceptor substance were co-evaporated on the first electrode <b>2101</b> to form a first charge-generation layer <b>2103</b> <i>a </i>containing a composite material of an organic compound and an inorganic compound. The thickness of the first charge-generation layer <b>2103</b> <i>a </i>was 50 nm. The weight ratio of PCzPA to molybdenum(VI) oxide was adjusted to be 4:2 (=PCzPA:molybdenum oxide).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0214" num="0213">Next, NPB was deposited to a thickness of 10 nm on the first charge-generation layer <b>2103</b> <i>a </i>by an evaporation method using resistance heating to form a hole-transport layer <b>2103</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0215" num="0214">Furthermore, 9-[4-(10-phenyl-9-anthryl)phenyl]-9H-carbazole (abbreviation: CzPA and N-(9,10-diphenyl-2-anthryl)-N,9-diphenyl-9H-carbazol-3-amine (abbreviation: 2PCAPA) were co-evaporated to form a light-emitting layer <b>2103</b> <i>c </i>with a thickness of 30 nm on the hole-transport layer <b>2103</b> <i>b</i>. Here, the weight ratio of CzPA to 2PCAPA was adjusted to be 1:0.05 (=CzPA:2PCAPA).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0216" num="0215">After that, by an evaporation method using resistance heating, Alq was evaporated to a thickness of 10 nm on the light-emitting layer <b>2103</b> <i>c</i>, and then BPhen was evaporated to a thickness of 10 nm to be stacked thereon, whereby an electron-transport layer <b>2103</b> <i>d </i>was formed.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0219" num="0218">Next, PCzPA that is a substance having high hole-transport properties and molybdenum(VI) oxide that is an acceptor substance were co-evaporated on the electron-relay layer <b>2105</b> to form a second charge-generation layer <b>2106</b>. The thickness of the second charge-generation layer <b>2106</b> was 60 nm. The weight ratio of PCzPA to molybdenum(VI) oxide was adjusted to be 4:2 (=PCzPA:molybdenum oxide).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0220" num="0219">Next, a second EL layer <b>2107</b> was formed on the second charge-generation layer <b>2106</b>.
