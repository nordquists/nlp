<heading id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">In order to increase integrated circuit device density within a given area (e.g., a footprint on an electrical device or board), integrated circuit dice are often stacked on top of one another. One such example may be memory cards where a number of dice are stacked to increase an overall amount of memory. Each die has a number of integrated circuit devices fabricated on a substrate. However, each die within the stack frequently needs to communicate with other dice in the stack (e.g., slave dice typically need to communicate with a master die to perform their functions). Such stacks may be interconnected from one side of the substrate to the other. The interconnections include through-substrate vias (TSVs). When the substrate comprises silicon, the interconnections may also be referred to as through-silicon vias. If the TSVs are defective (e.g., are open or shorted), electrical communications may not occur throughout the stack as intended.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a cross-sectional view of a microelectronics package <b>100</b> having a number of stacked and interconnected integrated circuit dice is shown. The stacked and interconnected dice may form at least a portion of a microelectronics package. The microelectronics package <b>100</b> is shown to include four integrated circuit dice. In this example, the four integrated circuit dice include a master die <b>101</b>, and three slave dice <b>103</b>A, <b>103</b>B, <b>103</b>C, however, any number of integrated circuit die may be incorporated. The three slave dice <b>103</b>A, <b>103</b>B, <b>103</b>C may be identified individually as the first, the second, and the third slave die, respectively. The identification as first, second, and third does not necessarily indicate any type of order or importance and is simply provided for ease in identification throughout the various embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">In other embodiments, the microelectronics package <b>100</b> may contain any other desired number of integrated circuit dice. Each of the integrated circuit dice has a first surface <b>105</b>A and a second surface <b>105</b>B. An arrow <b>110</b> indicates a normal orientation of the dice in which the first surface <b>105</b>A is located at an upper surface of the substrate where the upper surface is generally used during fabrication of integrated circuit devices on the substrate. That is, the upper surface of the substrate is the surface used to form integrated circuit devices on a die.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">A number of through-substrate vias (TSVs) <b>107</b> is shown on each of the four dice, including the master die <b>101</b>, and the slave dice <b>103</b>A, <b>103</b>B, <b>103</b>C. The TSVs <b>107</b> may also be referred to as through-silicon vias, depending upon the substrate type (e.g., silicon or other elemental semiconductors, compound semiconductors, or other substrate types known in the art) from which the dice are formed. The TSVs <b>107</b> may be formed from the first surface <b>105</b>A through the integrated circuit die to the second surface <b>105</b>B (or alternatively, from the second surface <b>105</b>B to the first surface <b>105</b>A). In operation, the TSVs <b>107</b> can be selectively connected to certain metallization layers within the die and therefore allow an interconnection from, for example, integrated circuit devices formed on the first surface <b>105</b>A and through to the second surface <b>105</b>B of the master die <b>101</b>, to connect to one or more of the slave dice <b>103</b>A, <b>103</b>B, <b>103</b>C, in the stack.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">Each of the TSVs <b>107</b> has a conductive bonding pad <b>109</b> formed on either end of the TSVs <b>107</b>. Adjacent ones of the dice are electrically coupled by a conductive electrical connector <b>113</b> that is placed or formed between the conductive bonding pads. The conductive electrical connector <b>113</b> may be, for example, a wirebond, a solder ball, conductive tape, a C4 interconnect (Controlled Collapse Chip Connection), or other suitable electrical connector. The conductive electrical connectors <b>113</b> therefore form electrical interconnects <b>111</b> between each of the adjacent dice. The conductive bonding pads <b>109</b> on the first surface <b>105</b>A of the master die <b>101</b> may be accessible to form an external interface <b>115</b>. The external interface <b>115</b> allows interconnection with other devices such as, for example, a microprocessor. The external interface may be connected to pins (not shown) of the microelectronic package by bonding wires allowing accessibility from outside the package. Similarly, the conductive bonding pads <b>109</b> on the second surface <b>105</b>B of the third slave die <b>103</b>C form an external slave interface <b>121</b> that may be used, for example, to interface with other devices or, alternatively, allow interconnection with other slave dice in a larger stack.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a cross-sectional view showing a microelectronics package <b>200</b> having a number of stacked and interconnected integrated circuit dice with interconnect defects indicates various examples of the types of defects that may occur when such stacks are formed. Any one of these various defect types may cause electrical communication issues between the master die <b>101</b> and one or more of the slave dice <b>103</b>A, <b>103</b>B, <b>103</b>C. For example, a malformed conductive electrical connector <b>201</b> has failed to complete an electrical pathway between adjacent ones of the TSVs <b>107</b>. The malformed conductive electrical connector <b>201</b> may result from an incomplete wirebond or an undersized solder ball. In another defect type, an open TSV <b>203</b> has been incompletely formed between the first surface <b>105</b>A and the second surface <b>105</b>B of the second slave die <b>103</b>B, thus presenting a missing connection (e.g., an open circuit) between the first slave die <b>103</b>A and the second slave die <b>103</b>B. A misaligned conductive electrical conductor <b>205</b> also prevents an improper electrical interconnect between the master die <b>101</b> and the first slave die <b>103</b>A. The misaligned conductive electrical conductor <b>205</b> may be, for example, a C4 interconnect that failed to collapse properly. In still another defect type, a shorted TSV <b>207</b> provides an electrical connection between the TSV and the substrate of the master die <b>101</b>. The shorted TSV <b>207</b> may cause drive and leakage issues depending upon a resistance value of the short and the short-tolerance or design of the connected electrical device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an illustrative embodiment for TSV testing using a scan-chain arrangement <b>300</b> is shown. The scan-chain arrangement may be used to test each of the TSVs in the microelectronics package <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The scan-chain arrangement <b>300</b> is shown to include test pattern transmission and receive circuitry, including transmission circuitry <b>309</b> in the master die <b>101</b> and receive circuitry <b>311</b> in each of the slave dice <b>103</b>A, <b>103</b>B, <b>103</b>C. Note that the receive circuitry <b>311</b> is only shown in the third slave die <b>103</b>C to avoid obscuring detail in the figure. However, a person of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the same or similar types of circuitry may be replicated in the first slave die <b>103</b>A and the second slave die <b>103</b>B of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as well.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">The transmission circuitry <b>309</b> is electrically coupled to the receive circuitry <b>311</b> through a number of electrical communication paths <b>305</b> established through the TSVs. A person of skill in the art, upon reading the disclosure provided herein, will further understand that the transmission circuitry <b>309</b> may also receive data, and similarly, the receive circuitry <b>311</b> may also transmit data. Therefore, the terms transmit and receive are provided simply as identifiers for brevity of notation and are not intended to indicate a sole function of the respective devices. Thus, in some embodiments, the transmission circuitry <b>309</b> and/or the receive circuitry <b>311</b> may operate as a transceiver.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">Overall, the transmission circuitry <b>309</b> sends test data to the receive circuitry <b>311</b> through the electrical communication paths <b>305</b>. The receive circuitry <b>311</b> receives the test data and then stores and transmits the test data back to the transmission circuitry <b>309</b>. A comparison is then made through a comparator <b>315</b> between the test data sent and the test data later received. If there are any differences between the test data sent and the test data later received, one or more defective TSVs can be identified.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">The comparator <b>315</b> may be implemented as, for example, an operational amplifier-based voltage comparator or a software-based comparator, such as a null-level detector. Although the comparator <b>315</b> is shown as being located within the master die <b>101</b>, the comparator <b>315</b> may be located in any device interconnected with the master die <b>101</b>. Further, the comparator <b>315</b> may form a portion of another device in electrical communication with the master die <b>101</b>, such as a coupled controller or microprocessor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">Each connective string <b>313</b>A, <b>313</b>B, . . . , <b>313</b> <i>n</i>, of the serially-connected ones of the TSVs <b>107</b> has a respective transceiver <b>301</b>A, . . . , <b>301</b> <i>n </i>(e.g., master transceivers) located within the master die <b>101</b> and a respective transceiver <b>303</b>A, . . . , <b>303</b> <i>n </i>(e.g., slave transceivers) located in the third slave die <b>103</b>C. A person of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that, depending upon a particular operation or location during testing, the transceivers may function as either a transmitter or a receiver. The transceivers <b>301</b>A, . . . , <b>301</b> <i>n </i>and the transceivers <b>303</b>A, . . . , <b>303</b> <i>n </i>may comprise a number of components known independently in the art including, for example, operational amplifiers, buffers, and follower circuitry. Further, the transceivers <b>301</b>A, . . . , <b>301</b> <i>n </i>and the transceivers <b>303</b>A, . . . , <b>303</b> <i>n </i>may be fabricated or otherwise formed on the various dice during formation of other integrated circuit devices on the respective dice.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">The (serial) connections to the TSVs <b>107</b> may be tested as follows. Each of the transceivers <b>301</b>A, . . . , <b>301</b> <i>n </i>in the master die <b>101</b> writes a predetermined test pattern to the transceivers <b>303</b>A, . . . , <b>303</b> <i>n </i>in the third slave die <b>103</b>C through each of the connective strings <b>313</b>A, <b>313</b>B, . . . , <b>313</b> <i>n</i>. Each of the respective transceivers <b>303</b>A, . . . , <b>303</b> <i>n </i>receives the predetermined test pattern and stores the test data in a test register associated with the respective ones of the transceivers <b>303</b>A, . . . , <b>303</b> <i>n. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">The test registers and the transceivers <b>303</b>A, . . . , <b>303</b> <i>n </i>are electrically coupled with one another to form a scan chain <b>307</b>. The test data from each of the test registers and transceivers <b>303</b>A, . . . , <b>303</b> <i>n </i>are forwarded to the last test register and its respective transceiver <b>303</b> <i>n</i>. In one embodiment, the stored test data from each of the test registers may be scanned using only the last transceiver <b>303</b> <i>n </i>in the third slave die <b>103</b>C, back to the master die <b>101</b> through the last connective string <b>313</b> <i>n</i>. Since the data from the test pattern are only transmitted back through the last connective string <b>313</b> <i>n</i>, the last connective string <b>313</b> <i>n </i>may be considered to be a more useful communication string. However, any one of the connective strings may be used to transmit data. Thus, each of the TSVs <b>107</b> within the last connective string <b>313</b> <i>n </i>should be in electrical communication with one another so that proper and thorough testing can occur. Consequently, the transmission and receive circuitry associated with at least the last connective string <b>313</b> <i>n</i>, being the more useful communication string, may be modified to ensure functionality of the associated TSVs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">Once the transceivers <b>301</b>A, . . . , <b>301</b> <i>n </i>in the master die <b>101</b> receive the data from each of the transceivers <b>303</b>A, . . . , <b>303</b> <i>n</i>, the data are each compared with the originally transmitted test pattern for verification of transmission/receipt accuracy. If a determination is made that the received test data match the transmitted test pattern, then each of the connections between the TSVs <b>107</b> should be intact (e.g., as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). If a determination is made that the received test data does not match the transmitted test pattern, then a repair is likely needed to one or more of the TSVs <b>107</b> in one or more of the connective strings <b>313</b>A, <b>313</b>B, . . . , <b>313</b> <i>n</i>. The repair is performed by substituting a subsequent TSV for the TSV found to be defective. Details of various types of TSV testing and repairs are discussed below. Once repairs are made, the entire test process may be run again until either the test passes or no further repairs can be made.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">With reference now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an illustrative embodiment of a portion of a transmitter/receiver circuit <b>400</b> used for TSV testing in the scan chain of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is shown. As with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the portion of the transmitter/receiver circuit <b>400</b> shows only circuitry associated with the master die <b>101</b> and the third slave die <b>103</b>C. In some embodiments, the first slave die <b>103</b>A and the second slave die <b>103</b>B each may have circuitry similar to or identical to that of the third slave die <b>103</b>C. However, only the master die <b>101</b> and the third slave die <b>103</b>C are shown so as not to obscure the figure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">The TSV <b>107</b> is coupled on opposing ends to the transceivers <b>301</b>A, <b>303</b>A, the transceivers <b>301</b>B, <b>303</b>B, and to a pair of pass transistors <b>401</b>. As discussed above with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a test register <b>403</b> is associated with each of the transceivers. However, the portion of the transmitter/receiver circuit <b>400</b> may have a high failure probability if there are any defects with the TSV <b>107</b> as discussed above with regard to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. For example, if the TSV <b>107</b> is open, then the test pattern data transmitted from the transceiver <b>301</b>A cannot be received by the transceiver <b>303</b>B in the third slave die <b>103</b>C. Further, if the TSV <b>107</b> is shorted to the substrate, for example, as indicated by the shorted TSV <b>207</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, then the transceiver <b>301</b>A may not be able to source sufficient power for the test pattern data to be transmitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows another embodiment of a portion of a transmitter/receiver circuit used for TSV testing in the scan chain of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and incorporating a redundant TSV <b>501</b>. The redundant TSV <b>501</b>, in parallel with the TSV <b>107</b>, reduces the probability of TSV failure due to an open connection. Should the TSV <b>107</b> fail due to, for example, a malformed conductive electrical connector <b>201</b>, a misaligned conductive electrical conductor <b>205</b>, or an open TSV <b>203</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, then the redundant TSV <b>501</b> provides a communication pathway from the master die <b>101</b> to the third slave die <b>103</b>C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">However, the redundant TSV <b>501</b> may not eliminate a TSV failure due to a short between either the TSV <b>107</b> or the redundant TSV <b>501</b> to the substrate. If either of the shorts has enough resistance, such that the transceiver <b>301</b>A can handle the short (e.g., by sourcing sufficient power to the TSV), then testing for shorts in the TSVs may not be necessary. Of course, testing for open TSVs may still be needed depending upon the design of interconnect circuitry and a location of where any open TSVs are located. Determining whether the transceiver <b>301</b>A can handle the short will depend upon, for example, various design parameters associated with integrated circuit devices formed on the various dice. Such techniques for designing integrated circuit devices are known independently in the art. If, however, shorts cannot be tolerated on the TSVs, then another circuit may be considered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an embodiment of the circuit used for TSV testing including a portion of circuitry <b>600</b> for testing TSV faults, including shorts and opens, is shown. The portion of the circuitry <b>600</b> is similar to that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. However, the redundant TSV <b>501</b> is not coupled in parallel with the TSV <b>107</b>. Rather, the transceiver <b>301</b>A and the transceiver <b>303</b>A each have a redundant transceiver <b>601</b> and a redundant transceiver <b>603</b> that are coupled in parallel. The redundant transceiver <b>601</b> and the redundant transceiver <b>603</b> are also electrically coupled to the redundant TSV <b>501</b>. Further, on the output of each of the transceivers, a weak pull-up device <b>605</b>A, <b>605</b>B is included that may be enabled during either open or short testing. Each of the redundant transceiver <b>601</b> and the redundant transceiver <b>603</b> further includes a pass gate <b>607</b>A, <b>607</b>B, respectively, coupled in series between the respective redundant pass gate and the associated subsequent one of the transceiver <b>301</b>B and the transceiver <b>303</b>B, each of which is coupled to a respective test register <b>403</b>A, <b>403</b>B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">During operation of the scan-chain arrangement <b>300</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, if the test pattern data received back from the third slave die by the master die <b>101</b> is different from the transmitted test pattern data, the TSV <b>107</b> may be tested for either an open connection or a shorted connection. As noted above, the portion of the transmitter/receiver circuit <b>500</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> may be used to test for open connection in the TSV <b>107</b>. However, the portion of the circuitry <b>600</b> can test for either an open connection or a shorted connection.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">Both open and short testing of the TSVs can be self enabled (e.g., using a built-in self test (BIST)) upon power up of the devices, for each die in the stack. The TSV testing may begin from either the master die <b>101</b> with results stored in the test register <b>403</b>A on the third slave die <b>103</b>C side, or, alternatively, the testing may begin from the third slave die <b>103</b>C with results being stored in the test register <b>403</b>B on the master die <b>101</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">For example, in one embodiment of short testing, the transceiver <b>301</b>A and the redundant transceiver <b>601</b> are disabled and one of the associated weak pull-up devices <b>605</b>C, <b>605</b>D is enabled. The transceiver <b>303</b>A, the redundant transceiver <b>603</b>, and their associated weak pull-up devices <b>605</b>C, <b>605</b>D, are also disabled. The data are passed through either the TSV <b>107</b> or the redundant TSV <b>501</b>, through to the third slave die <b>103</b>C, with the data then being stored in the test register <b>403</b>A. A comparison is made of the data stored in the test register <b>403</b>A with original transmitted data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">In another embodiment of short testing, the transceiver <b>303</b>A and the redundant transceiver <b>603</b> are disabled and the associated one of the weak pull-up devices <b>605</b>A, <b>605</b>B, is enabled. The transceiver <b>301</b>A, the redundant transceiver <b>601</b>, and their associated weak pull-up devices <b>605</b>C, <b>605</b>D, are disabled. In this case, the data are again passed through either the TSV <b>107</b> or the redundant TSV <b>501</b> and stored in the test register <b>403</b>B. A comparison is made of the data stored in the test register <b>403</b>B with original transmitted data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">The short testing may then conducted for each of the connective strings <b>313</b>A, <b>313</b>B, . . . , <b>313</b> <i>n </i>(e.g., the serial TSV paths). Alternatively, the short testing may only be conducted for the last connective string <b>313</b> <i>n</i>, identified earlier as a potential critical connective string.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">In a more detailed illustrative embodiment of a test situation where the transceiver <b>301</b>A and the transceiver <b>303</b>A are enabled, the associated weak pull-up devices <b>605</b>C, <b>605</b>A are disabled. An open connection in the TSV <b>107</b> prevents the test program data transmitted from the master die <b>101</b> from reaching the third slave die <b>103</b>C, as discussed above. However, should the TSV <b>107</b> fail due to a suspected short, short testing may be performed as follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">The transceiver <b>301</b>A is disabled. The weak pull-up device <b>605</b>C and the pass transistor <b>401</b>A of the third slave die <b>103</b>C are enabled to provide a test path from the master die <b>101</b> through the TSV <b>107</b> and to the test register <b>403</b>A of the third slave die <b>103</b>C. As indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the test path places the master die <b>101</b> end of the TSV <b>107</b> at a high-data value (e.g., at V<sub>DD</sub>). If the TSV <b>107</b> is not shorted, a resultant high-data value is recorded in the test register <b>403</b>A. However, if the TSV <b>107</b> is shorted, a value less than the high-data value is recorded in the test register <b>403</b>A.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">As discussed above, the test value stored in the test register <b>403</b>A may be compared with the high-data value and a determination made whether the values are the same. If the value recorded in the test register <b>403</b>A is less than a predetermined percentage of the high-data value, the TSV <b>107</b> is presumed to be shorted. If the TSV is shorted, a determination of whether the TSV <b>107</b> needs to be replaced with a redundant TSV depends upon whether the value of the resistance can be tolerated within the circuit. The toleration of resistance is discussed in more detail below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">If the TSV <b>107</b> is determined to be defective, due to either an open-circuit or a short-circuit condition, the redundant TSV <b>501</b> may be substituted for the TSV <b>107</b>. The transceiver <b>301</b>A and the transceiver <b>303</b>A are then disabled and the redundant TSV <b>501</b> is tested in a manner similar to that discussed above with reference to the TSV <b>107</b> testing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">For short testing, the redundant transceiver <b>601</b> is disabled. The weak pull-up device <b>605</b>D and the pass gate <b>607</b>A of the third slave die <b>103</b>C are enabled to provide a test path from the master die <b>101</b> through the redundant TSV <b>501</b> and to the test register <b>403</b>A of the third slave die <b>103</b>C. As indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the test path places the master die <b>101</b> end of the redundant TSV <b>501</b> high (e.g., at V<sub>DD</sub>). If the redundant TSV <b>501</b> is not shorted, a resultant high-data value is recorded in the test register <b>403</b>A. However, if the redundant TSV <b>501</b> is shorted, a value less than the high-data value is recorded in the test register <b>403</b>A. As discussed above, the test value stored in the test register <b>403</b>A may be compared with the high-data value and a determination made whether the values are the same. If the value recorded in the test register <b>403</b>A is less a predetermined percentage than the high-data value, the redundant TSV <b>501</b> is presumed to be shorted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">The design of the weak pull-up devices may depend upon a size of the stack (e.g., the total number of one or more master devices and the slave dice), and the lowest value of short resistance that is considered acceptable for proper functionality of the various integrated circuit devices, perhaps based on a predicted number of bit read or write errors to be expected over time. Another factor to be considered is the cumulative effect of each of the pull-up devices coupled to a given connective string of TSVs. For example, if a weak pull-up device in each of the slave dice <b>103</b>A, <b>103</b>B, <b>103</b>C, is enabled simultaneously (e.g., when the testing of different dice coincides), the sourced power from the combination of the three pull-up devices may be significantly greater than if a single pull-up device is enabled separately. That is, the weak pull-up device in one die may get assistance from one or more other pull-up devices located on other dice in the stack. Thus, the size of the weak pull-up device may need to be considered. Calculations and determinations for the strength of a pull-up device are known independently in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">In other embodiments, the weak pull-up device may be designed to increase power as needed during short testing of the TSVs. For example, the pull-up device may start at a normal power setting. Depending upon the result stored in the test register, the weak pull-up device may be programmed or otherwise configured (e.g., during manufacture) to increase power on subsequent testing should initial results prove inconclusive. The power setting may be increased in terms of integral powers (e.g., 2 times, 4 times, 8 times, etc.) or in accordance with some other scheme.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a method <b>700</b> for performing open and short testing on TSVs. With continuing reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, at operation <b>701</b>, a decision to perform an open test is made. This may take the form of an externally-initiated test, or as part of a built-in self test, for example. At operation <b>703</b>, a test pattern is applied to the first end <b>107</b>-<b>1</b> of the TSV <b>107</b>. The test pattern is received from the second end <b>107</b>-<b>2</b> of the TSV <b>107</b> at operation <b>705</b> and stored in the test register <b>403</b>A at operation <b>707</b>. The stored test pattern is then compared with the applied test pattern at operation <b>709</b>. The comparison may be made with, for example, the comparator <b>315</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">A determination is made whether the stored and applied test patterns are the same at operation <b>711</b>. If the test patterns are not the same, the TSV <b>107</b> is presumably open or otherwise defective and the open test is ended at operation <b>713</b>. Other TSVs may be tested by performing the method <b>700</b> again, beginning at operation <b>701</b>. If the test patterns are the same, a determination is made that the TSV <b>107</b> is not open and the method <b>700</b> continues at operation <b>715</b> where the TSV <b>107</b> is tested for a short-connection to the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">At operation <b>717</b>, a high-data value is applied to the first end <b>107</b>-<b>1</b> of the TSV <b>107</b>. As discussed above, the high-data value is developed by enabling the weak pull-up device <b>605</b>C. The data value is then received from the second end <b>107</b>-<b>2</b> of the TSV <b>107</b> at operation <b>719</b> and stored in the test register <b>403</b>A at operation <b>721</b>. The received-data value and the high-data value at then compared at operation <b>723</b>. A determination is made at operation <b>725</b> whether the received-data value matches the high-data value with a predetermined percentage, as discussed above. If so, the short test is ended at operation <b>727</b>. If the two data values do not match within the predetermined percentage, TSV repair operations ensue at operation <b>729</b>. TSV repair is now discussed in detail with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A, 8B, and 9</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, an explanation of a repair methodology is provided. The repair methodology may be invoked should any of the TSVs <b>107</b> or the redundant TSVs <b>501</b> be open or shorted. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> shows an embodiment of a default switch connection for a number of TSVs, including two redundant TSVs <b>805</b>. In this embodiment, 12 TSVs are shown. Each of the TSVs has a three-position switched input <b>801</b> and a three-position switched output <b>803</b>. The three positions may be considered to be three programmable I/Os (input/outputs). Each of the switches can be, for example, a multiplexer, a data selector, or various types of transconductance devices. In some embodiments, each of the switches may be a fused link.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">In an illustrative example, the configuration of the TSVs and associated switched I/Os of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> may be used with memory devices. With a memory device, data (DQ) lines may include eight TSVs for data read (DR) lines, two TSVs for data rising and falling clock signals (e.g., DInR and DInF, respectively), and two redundant TSVs. In this embodiment, TSV 0 and TSV 1 are provided for the DInR and DInF signals, respectively; TSV 2 through TSV 9 are provided for the DR lines (DR0 through DR7), with the two redundant TSVs <b>805</b>, identified in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> as TSV 10 and TSV 11.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">In this embodiment, having two redundant TSVs <b>805</b> per group allows up to two repairs to be made per group. In some embodiments, the redundant TSVs <b>805</b> may be placed at one end of the group so that any shift used to replace a defective TSV with a redundant TSV is unidirectional, as described below with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>. The unidirectional shift simplifies the overall logic by shifting all of the switch positions needed in one direction and not requiring the repairs to wrap to the beginning of the TSV chain.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">The default switch position for the two redundant TSVs <b>805</b> is a grounded input and a non-connected output. To determine whether a repair is needed, the TSVs are first tested for proper conductivity using the scan chain, discussed with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> through <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. If the scan chain test determines that a bad TSV is present, a repair may be made by rerouting the I/O signals from the bad TSV to an adjacent TSV by making appropriate changes on the switched inputs <b>801</b> and the switched outputs <b>803</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, an example of the switch connection of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> is shown after two defective TSVs have been repaired. In the example of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, TSV 7 and TSV 10 have been found to be defective. In this example, the initial test for proper conductivity using the scan chain methodology would first find TSV 7 to be defective (since TSV 10 is one of the redundant TSVs and would not initially be tested). Therefore, since TSV 7 is defective, data formerly entering TSV 7 are now shifted to TSV 8 and the I/Os of TSVs subsequent to TSV 8 are shifted as well. The connection from DR5 through the switched input <b>801</b>-<b>7</b> to TSV 7 has been disabled or removed. Similarly the switched output <b>803</b>-<b>7</b> of TSV 7 to DRO5 has also been disabled or removed. The data line, DR5, is now connected through the switched input <b>801</b>-<b>8</b> to TSV 8. The output of TSV 8, formally connected to DRO6, is now switched through the switched output <b>803</b>-<b>8</b> to DRO5. The data line DR6, formally connected to TSV 8, is rerouted to TSV 9 through input switch <b>801</b>-<b>9</b> and the output of TSV 9 is rerouted to DRO6 through output switch <b>803</b>-<b>9</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">Once TSV 7 has been repaired, the scan chain process is again executed to check for any further defective TSVs. In this example, the second round of the scan chain methodology has determined that TSV 10, one of the redundant TSVs <b>805</b>, is also defective. Ordinarily, if none of the TSVs were found to be defective, the scan chain methodology would only need to be executed once. However, in this case, since TSV 7 was found to be defective, the scan chain methodology was executed a second time and detected one the redundant TSVs <b>805</b> was also defective. Thus the subsequent switching occurring after TSV 7 required the second redundant TSV <b>805</b> (TSV11) to be used for a final repair. Thus, the data line DR7 that was shifted from TSV 9 is now shifted to TSV 11 through the switched input <b>801</b>-<b>11</b>. The output from TSV 11 is switched to DRO7 through the switched output <b>803</b>-<b>11</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">With redundant TSVs <b>805</b>, up to two repairs can be made to account for two defective TSVs. As will be understandable to a person of skill in the art upon reading the disclosure provided herein, more or less than two redundant TSVs <b>805</b> may be incorporated for each group depending upon the degree of protection desired for a particular scan line coupled with the available real estate on a given integrated circuit die.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">An increased number of useful pathways may benefit from an increased number of redundant TSVs. For example, if additional redundant TSVs are contemplated, the three-position switched inputs <b>801</b> and the three-position switched outputs <b>803</b> may be used with an increased number of redundant TSVs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a method <b>900</b> for repairing through-substrate vias. An identification of the defective TSV is confirmed at operation <b>901</b>. At operation <b>903</b>, the associated input and the output switches are each removed or disabled from the defective TSV. The inputs and outputs previously connected to the defective TSV are shifted to a subsequent TSV in operation <b>905</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">A determination is made at operation <b>907</b> as to whether the subsequent TSV is a redundant TSV. If the subsequent TSV is a redundant TSV, then the repair is completed the method <b>900</b> is terminated at operation <b>909</b>. At this point, the newly-switched in TSV (the redundant TSV) may be open and short tested by returning to the method <b>700</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. However, if the subsequent TSV is not a redundant TSV, then the method <b>900</b> continues since the subsequent TSV was previously connected to an external circuit through its respective I/O switches. At operation <b>911</b>, inputs and outputs of the subsequent TSV are shifted to those of the next subsequent TSV. Thereafter, the method <b>900</b> continues until either a redundant TSV is reached at operation <b>907</b> or until the circuit exhausts all available redundant TSVs.</div>
