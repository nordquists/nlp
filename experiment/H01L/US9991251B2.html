<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a variable capacitance device used for a communication device for a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) system or a Near Field Communication (NFC) system, for example.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, variable capacitance elements whose dielectric constant is changed by a control voltage are proposed by Patent Literatures 1 and 2, for example. These variable capacitance elements adopt a laminated structure (i.e., an MIM structure) of a metal, a ferroelectric material, and a metal, and are provided with a ferroelectric thin film so that a large amount of change in the capacitance may be achieved by low voltage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Patent Literature 1: JP 4502609 B1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Patent Literature 2: JP 5000660 B1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">A variable capacitance element including a ferroelectric film has a disadvantage in that that an ESD (Electro-Static Discharge) resistance property is poor compared to an MEMS variable capacitance element or a variable capacitance element of a semiconductor, such as a variable capacitance diode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Moreover, when the thickness of the ferroelectric film is reduced is certain designs, the control sensitivity (the ratio of a change in the capacitance value to a change in the control voltage) will be increased, but the ESD resistance property will deteriorate due to the reduction in the thickness of the ferroelectric film. That is, upon receiving an ESD that exceeds the ESD resistance property, the surge is applied to the ferroelectric film causing the ferroelectric film to break down. Accordingly, there is a restriction in reducing the thickness of the ferroelectric film from the standpoint of the ESD resistance, and the control sensitivity is also restricted.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">An object of the present disclosure is to provide a variable capacitance device with high ESD resistance property.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">A variable capacitance device of the present invention includes a semiconductor substrate, a redistribution layer provided on a main surface of the semiconductor substrate, and a plurality of terminal electrodes including a first input/output terminal, a second input/output terminal and a ground terminal, where a variable capacitance element section that is a ferroelectric thin film is formed in the redistribution layer, the variable capacitance element section being formed from a pair of capacitor electrodes connected to the first input/output terminal and the second input/output terminal, respectively, and a ferroelectric thin film disposed between the pair of capacitor electrodes, and where an ESD protection element connected between the first input/output terminal or the second input/output terminal and the ground terminal is formed in the semiconductor substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the structure described above, the variable capacitance element section is formed in the redistribution layer, and the ESD protection element is formed in the semiconductor substrate. Accordingly, isolation between the variable capacitance element section and the ESD protection element section may be easily secured, and a small variable capacitance device with high ESD resistance and high control sensitivity may be configured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, an electrode pad is provided, on the main surface of the semiconductor substrate, for connecting the ESD protection element to the ground terminal and the first input/output terminal or the second input/output terminal, and the electrode pad is formed of W or WSi. This allows the electrode pad of the semiconductor substrate to be highly thermal resistant, and allows the variable capacitance element section having a ferroelectric thin film layer which needs to be thermally treated at high temperature to be embedded in the redistribution layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, in plan view, the variable capacitance element section is provided at a position not overlapping the ESD protection element and the electrode pad for the ESD protection element. This allows isolation between the variable capacitance element section and the ESD protection element section to be more easily secured, and also, allows flatness of the underlying portion of the variable capacitance element section to be secured, and the reliability of the variable capacitance element section may be increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, a resistance element is provided between the variable capacitance element section and a control voltage application terminal, and the resistance element is formed on a layer, in the redistribution layer, where the variable capacitance element section is provided, opposite the semiconductor substrate. This eliminates the need to provide a resistance element outside, and the number of elements may be significantly reduced. Also, because the resistance element is formed on a layer where the variable capacitance element section is provided, opposite the semiconductor substrate, flatness of the variable capacitance element section is not negatively affected, and also, isolation between the ESD protection element section and the resistance element may be increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, an insulating layer is provided between the variable capacitance element section and the semiconductor substrate. That is, by forming an insulating layer between the semiconductor substrate and the capacitor electrode, isolation between the ESD protection section and the variable capacitance element section may be further increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">Accordingly, the present disclosure provides a small ESD-resistant variable capacitance device with high control sensitivity may be achieved.</div>

<heading id="h-0007">First Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a circuit diagram of a variable capacitance device <b>91</b> according to a first embodiment. The variable capacitance device <b>91</b> includes variable capacitance elements C<b>1</b> to C<b>6</b>, RF resistance elements R<b>11</b> to R<b>19</b>, and ESD protection elements ESDP<b>1</b>, ESDP<b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">A capacitance value of the variable capacitance elements C<b>1</b> to C<b>6</b> is determined based on a control voltage applied between a control voltage input terminal Vt and a ground terminal GND, and a capacitance value between a first input/output terminal P<b>1</b> and a second input/output terminal P<b>2</b> is thereby determined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">Each of the variable capacitance elements C<b>1</b> to C<b>6</b> is a ferroelectric capacitor formed from a ferroelectric film whose dielectric constant is changed by an electric field, and capacitor electrodes sandwiching the ferroelectric film to apply voltage thereto. The dielectric constant of the ferroelectric film changes due to the amount of polarization being changed according to the intensity of an applied electric field, and the capacitance value may thus be determined by the control voltage. The control voltage is applied to each capacitor electrode through the RF resistance elements R<b>11</b> to R<b>19</b>. The RF resistance elements R<b>11</b> to R<b>19</b> have equal resistance values. These RF resistance elements R<b>11</b> to R<b>19</b> apply the control voltage to each of the variable capacitance elements C<b>1</b> to C<b>6</b>, and also, function as choke resistors for preventing leakage of an RF signal applied between the terminals P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> to the control voltage input terminal Vt and the ground terminal GND.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">The ESD protection element ESDP<b>1</b>, formed of a Zener diode, is connected between the first input/output terminal P<b>1</b> and the ground terminal GND, and the ESD protection element ESDP<b>2</b> is connected between the second input/output terminal P<b>2</b> and the ground terminal GND. When an ESD surge is applied to the input/output terminals P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b> from the outside, the configuration causes ESD current to flows to the ground through the ESD protection elements ESDP<b>1</b>, ESDP<b>2</b>. Accordingly, over-voltage is not applied to the variable capacitance elements C<b>1</b> to C<b>6</b>, effectively protecting the variable capacitance elements C<b>1</b> to C<b>6</b>.</div>

The BST film <b>21</b> is used as an adhesion layer to the SiN insulating film <b>14</b>. The BST film <b>21</b> does not affect capacitance, and thus, a film other than the BST film may be used as long as the film acts as an adhesion layer to the SiN insulating film <b>14</b>. Also, instead of the Pt film, other noble metal materials which are highly conductive and highly oxidation resistant and whose melting points are high, such as Au, may be used. BST film <b>23</b> serves as the ferroelectric layer for the variable capacitance element VC, as described herein. Moreover, BST film <b>25</b> serves as an additional adhesion layer.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">In a fourth embodiment, a communication circuit provided with a variable capacitance device will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a circuit diagram of a communication circuit provided with a variable capacitance device. The communication circuit is an example of an NFC module. The communication circuit includes an RFIC <b>111</b>, an antenna coil <b>113</b>, and a variable capacitance device <b>91</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the antenna coil <b>113</b> functions as a radiating element, and magnetically couples with a coil antenna of a communication counterpart.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">Capacitors C<b>21</b>, C<b>22</b> are elements for adjusting a degree of coupling between the RFIC <b>111</b> and the antenna coil <b>113</b>. Also, inductors L<b>11</b>, L<b>12</b> and capacitors C<b>11</b>, C<b>12</b>, C<b>20</b> configure a transmission filter. For example, in a case where the communication circuit operates in a card mode, the RFIC <b>111</b> operates passively, and thus, the RFIC <b>111</b> generates a source voltage from an input signal input to an RX terminal and reads a received signal, and at the time of transmission, performs load modulation of a circuit (load) connected to a TX terminal. Furthermore, in a case where the communication circuit operates in a reader/writer mode, for example, the RFIC <b>111</b> operates actively, and thus, at the time of transmission, the RFIC <b>111</b> opens the RX terminal and transmits a transmission signal from the TX terminal, and at the time of reception, the RFIC <b>111</b> opens the TX terminal and inputs a received signal from the RX terminal. The RFIC <b>111</b> applies a control voltage to the variable capacitance device <b>91</b> through a DA converter <b>112</b>. In this manner, with the communication circuit, impedance from the RFIC <b>111</b> toward the antenna coil <b>113</b> changes depending on the operation mode. The capacitance value of the variable capacitance device <b>91</b> is controlled such that the resonance frequency of an antenna circuit is optimized according to the operation mode (i.e. such that the impedance from the RFIC <b>111</b> toward the antenna coil is matched).</div>
