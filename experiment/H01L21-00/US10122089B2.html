<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a divisional of prior U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/853,977, filed Mar. 29, 2013, entitled “METHOD APPARATUS AND MATERIAL FOR RADIO FREQUENCY PASSIVES AND ANTENNAS,” by Vijay K. Nair, et al., the priority of which is hereby claimed and the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present description relates to the field of radio frequency passive devices and packaging and in particular to passive devices and packaging using small scale antennas on nanomagnetic composites.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Small form factor devices like ultrabook computers, tablets, and smartphones accommodate as many as five to seven antennas or more to cover Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular data networks such as LTE (Long Term Evolution) or 3G (Third Generation Cellular), FM (Frequency Modulation) radio, GPS (Global Positioning System), RFID (Radio Frequency Identification), NFC (Near Field Communication) and DTV (Digital Television broadcasting) services, among others. The number of antennas, their sizes and their RF isolation requirements put severe restrictions on the device's form factor and design. Traditionally discrete components have been used for both antennas and inductors which were typically placed on the motherboard. If antenna size can be significantly reduced, the overall size of the communication device can be reduced or more of the device may be used for other purposes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">As an example a typical popular tablet computer may have four antennas, a planar inverted F cellular band antenna (GSM/WCDMA/LTE) and a Wi-Fi/Bluetooth antennas among others. The cellular band antenna may measure roughly 35 mm by 10 mm and the Wifi/Bluetooth antenna may measure roughly 16 mm by 10 mm. The antennas may also have complex shapes to optimize reception that impact design freedom for the rest of the device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Efficient RF antennas are just one example of small form factor magnetics that are suitable for future microelectronic packages used in mobile, small scale, and wireless systems. Inductors for power delivery and other components are also desired. While discrete components placed on the motherboard have been used for both antennas and inductors, this can significantly impact the size of the final product. The size of such components is physically limited by the materials and electrical specifications. While high relative permeability can allow for smaller devices, high permeability materials tend to also be conductive. This causes eddy current losses and other drawbacks.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">Very small size antennas may be fabricated using a nanomagnetic material layer deposited on an organic package substrate. The antenna can be fabricated on a nano-magnetic composite material layer that is itself laminated or molded on to an organic package substrate. The antenna may then be integrated with other RF components to produce a very small RF package or a module useful, for example, in ultrabooks, tablets, and smartphones.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">The size of an antenna is related to at least three important factors: RF frequency; the permittivity; and the permeability of the antenna substrate material</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">These relationships can be written mathematically as:
<br/>
λ=λ<sub>0</sub>/(ε<sub>r</sub>μ<sub>r</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>  (Eq. 1)
<br/>
where λ is the wavelength in the substrate having permittivity ε<sub>r </sub>and permeability μ<sub>r</sub>; λ<sub>0 </sub>is the free space wave length (c/f); c is the velocity of light in free space and f, the RF frequency for the antenna.
<br/>
η=η<sub>0</sub>/(μ<sub>r</sub>/ε<sub>r</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>  (Eq. 2)
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">where η is the impedance in the substrate having permittivity ε<sub>r </sub>and permeability μ<sub>r</sub>, and η<sub>0 </sub>is the impedance of free space</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">As indicated by these relations (Eqs. 1 and 2), the antenna size depends on λ which in turn depends the product of ε<sub>r </sub>and μ<sub>r</sub>. The impedance η depends on the ratio of μ<sub>r </sub>and ε<sub>r</sub>. As a result, the size of an antenna can be reduced by using a nonmagnetic dielectric material (i.e. a material having μ<sub>r </sub>of 1) that has a high permittivity ε<sub>r</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">However, when the antenna size decreases as permittivity is increased, the impedance also decreases. When the impedance mismatch increases (i.e: η<sub>0</sub>/η), the energy transfer from the antenna is decreased. This in turn lowers antenna efficiency and bandwidth (data rate that the antenna can carry). Magnetic materials of very high permeability are readily available and used in many applications, however they are not suitable for fabricating antennas because the permeability of these materials falls precipitously at high frequencies (i.e. above a few hundred MHz).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">A nanomagnetic composite material layer that has higher permeability and permittivity at RF frequencies can be formed on the top of a semiconductor package. Antenna structures can be designed over the nanomagnetic material resulting in a smaller and more efficient antenna. Antennas can be designed on a nanomagnetic substrate and then attached to the package substrate as surface mount components. A three times or greater reduction in the area of an antenna can be achieved with nanomagnetic materials. For example a 35 mm by 10 mm antenna may be reduced to about 20 mm by 5 mm. A 16 mm by 10 mm antenna may be reduced to about 10 mm by 10 mm. This is close to the size of some semiconductor packages, allowing the antenna for an wireless communication applications to be formed on the package.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">By physically attaching the antenna to the package, RF performance is further improved due to the shorter interconnect distance and reduced RF insertions loss. There is also no need for expensive coaxial RF cable to connect the RF transceiver to an external antenna that might be situated on the rim of a tablet or smartphone. Elimination of the coaxial RF cable reduces RF loss and cost.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">The nano-magnetic composite layer may be synthesized by impregnating magnetic nanoparticles in epoxy resin and then curing the composite material formed by the impregnation. Such a nanocomposite substrate layer retains its magnetic properties at higher frequencies (e.g. up to about 5-10 GHz) with reasonable permittivity (e.g. about 10-20) and permeability (e.g. about 1.5-4). This material can be synthesized using commercially available nanomagnetic particles (e.g. size of about 20 to 50 nm) and epoxy compounds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">As described in more detail below, the synthesized material can be integrated on a package substrate or other surface by screen printing or molding. The antenna structures can be fabricated on top of this nanomagnetic layer to achieve the very small form factor mentioned above. This nanomagnetic material may also by screen printed or laminated on top of the package to reduce the size still further. The antenna structure may be created by plating copper on top of the nanomagnetic layer. Through vias can be created on the nanomagnetic layer to connect the antenna to the RF circuits and ground on the package.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">As described below, nanoparticle magnetic composite layers can be constructed as part of the fabrication of a package. An antenna can then be fabricated on this nanoparticle substrate layer. The antenna can then be integrated with RF transmit and receive circuits within the package to produce a small form factor RF transceiver module with about the same size as an RF circuit package.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional diagram of an RF package with antennas, an optional RF circuitry die and a connection pad. The package <b>10</b> is built on a substrate, in this case a buildup layer or layers (BUL) <b>12</b> which may be attached to a printed circuit board, such as a system board, motherboard or logic board (<b>38</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), with solder balls <b>14</b> of which only two are shown, although there may be many more. The BUL carries a die <b>16</b> that contains RF electronic circuits. Vias <b>27</b> through the BUL connect the die with antenna structures <b>20</b> also attached to the buildup layer(s) <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">The package <b>10</b> contains a nanoparticle magnetic composite <b>22</b> that is selectively laminated over the buildup layer(s) <b>12</b>. Vias <b>24</b> through the composite material connect with conductive paths <b>26</b> through the substrate to connect the antennas <b>20</b> through the composite and the substrate to the die <b>16</b>. The antennas may also be coupled through these vias to external power or other connections <b>14</b> on an external device such as a motherboard (not shown). Alternatively, the antennas <b>20</b> may be constructed on the nanomagnetic material <b>22</b> separately and then later attached to the RF package buildup layer(s) <b>12</b> as a surface mount component.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">The package substrate or BUL <b>12</b> also carries a variety of additional discrete components <b>28</b> coupled to the silicon die and the antennas. These will be referred to as passives, however, the discrete components may be passive or active. The package is covered with a dielectric such as a molding compound <b>30</b> to seal and insulate the antennas, the passives, the vias, and the various connections. The molding compound is selected to be transparent to the radio frequencies which the antennas are intended to receive and transmit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">A passive device component <b>28</b> such as a capacitor may be electrically connected to a line <b>26</b>, such as a signal line to an antenna. In such an embodiment, a direct current (DC) coming from a signal port in the die <b>16</b> may be blocked or rerouted by the passive device <b>28</b> so that the DC current does not travel along the signal line or via <b>24</b> connected to an antenna (which is designed to receive only a radio frequency (RF) signal). In another embodiment, the passive device component may function as a frequency selector for a signal line in the package going to an antenna due to the impedance of the signal coming from a signal port in the die.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">An active device component <b>28</b> such as a power amplifier, a low noise amplifier or RF switch may be first formed based on a gallium arsenide die before being attached to the substrate <b>12</b>. In such an embodiment, the active device like the power amplifier may amplify or send selected RF signal to the antenna <b>20</b> through a via <b>24</b>. The receive signals coming from the antenna may be routed through an antenna switch and a low noise amplifier device to select and amplify the received RF signal. This amplified signal is routed along a signal line <b>26</b> through the substrate <b>12</b> to the die <b>16</b>. In an alternative embodiment, the active device may be a SOC (System on a Chip) die which includes a power amplifier.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a top elevation view of the package <b>10</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in which the antenna structures and composite material can be seen but the substrate and passive components cannot be seen. The antenna structures <b>20</b> can have a variety of different shapes and rest on top of the composite material <b>22</b>. The antennas are coupled at appropriate locations through vias <b>24</b> to other components so that the signals received by the antennas may be carried for down conversion, demodulation, baseband processing and other RF stages and to the die <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown below, the nanoparticle magnetic composite material can be integrated on top of the package substrate and then molded on the top of the package. The antenna structures <b>20</b> may be patterned on that composite surface <b>30</b>. The RF output signal lines from the circuits are connected to these antennas to complete the RF transceiver module. The connection vias <b>24</b> to the RF circuits of the die may be created by drilling in the molding material or in any of a variety of other ways. Vias can be through the entire thickness of the molding material or only partially through the molding material to connect to the top surface of the components embedded in the molding material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 9</figref> are cross-sectional views of a package such as that of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> in progressive stages of manufacture. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a side cross-sectional diagram of an initial configuration of components for a process of forming a single package similar to that of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a temporary carrier <b>34</b> is formed to carry the other components. In an alternative embodiment, the carrier is a fixed substrate. The temporary carrier may be much larger than shown, such as a wafer, so that many packages are formed at the same time across the surface of the carrier. The carrier substrate can be any planar substrate, such as tape, silicon wafer, glass, metal, or polymer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">An adhesive <b>36</b> is applied to the top of the carrier to hold passives <b>28</b>, nanomagnetic antennas <b>23</b>, including the material <b>22</b>, metal <b>20</b>, via <b>24</b> and metal pad <b>2</b>, and any other components to the carrier. The components can be passive device components and active components. Passive components can include band pass filters, capacitors, inductors, resistors, and crystals for clock generation. Active components can include power amplifiers and RF switches.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">The passive components <b>28</b> and the nanomagnetic antennas include pads <b>29</b> that are placed over the top of the carrier. Vias <b>24</b> can then be drilled through the composite material and the antenna structures <b>20</b> patterned over the composite. In another embodiment, the nanomagnetic layer is selectively laminated on the substrate to antenna structures that are designed on top of the nanomagnetic composite material. The passives are typically fabricated in a separate process with connection pads <b>29</b> to allow them to be attached to and connected through a substrate. The composite material and antenna structure may be fabricated separately and then attached to the carrier <b>34</b> or fabricated directly on the temporary carrier.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> a molding compound <b>30</b> is applied over the composite antennas <b>23</b> and passives <b>28</b> to embed the passive components and the nano composite antenna <b>23</b>. The molding compound may then be cured to give solid mechanical support to the components on the package. The molding compound may be applied in any of a variety of manners including spin coating, injection molding, compression molding, and transfer molding. For example, the molding compound can be a thermosetting material such as epoxy resin, phenolic resin, polyimide, and poly-benzoxasole (PBO). The molding compound may also be filled. In an embodiment, the molding compound comprises approximately 90% filler, such as silica particles. The molding compound layer is then fully cured to solidify the alignment of the device components and provide rigidity for handling.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> the molding compound <b>30</b> has been released from the temporary carrier <b>34</b> by dissolving the adhesive. The adhesive may be selected so that it acts as a release agent after the molding compound is fully cured. The adhesive can then be separated from the bottom of the molding compound by proper temperature treatment. Removing the carrier <b>34</b> exposes the metal pads <b>29</b> that were formed on the passives and antennas. The adhesive and carrier may be released by peeling, laser lift off, and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. As illustrated, the exposed surface for each of the device components which was previously in contact with the carrier substrate may be coplanar with the exposed surface of the molding compound layer which was previously in contact with the carrier substrate. This provides a flat surface upon additional substrate layers may be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the package has been flipped. Typically the package will be formed with many other packages on a wafer so the entire wafer is flipped. A new substrate <b>12</b> is built up over the molding compound <b>30</b>. The new substrate is formed with as many copper pathways <b>26</b> at as many levels as are desired to connect the antennas <b>23</b> and the passives <b>28</b> and to support their intended functions. Solder or metal paths <b>27</b> are provided to form vias. In one embodiment, a single redistribution layer (RDL) fan-out and buildup layer are formed as the substrate <b>12</b> on the coplanar surfaces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, the patterned RDL with one or more traces <b>26</b> is first formed, followed by depositing a buildup layer over the RDL and patterning the buildup layer to form a plurality of openings <b>25</b>, which may expose contact pads or traces. A variety of dielectric materials may be used to form the buildup layer. In an embodiment, a photosensitive polyimide is used. In such an embodiment, the photosensitive polyimide is cured by UV irradiation after patterning to form openings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, solder balls <b>14</b>, <b>18</b> are attached to the redistribution layer or substrate <b>12</b> in the openings <b>25</b> which were formed for that purpose. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a die <b>16</b>, formed in a separate process, is attached to the central solder ball structure <b>18</b>. In embodiments, the die <b>16</b> is electrically bonded to the single RDL directly vertically adjacent the passives but on the opposite side of the RDL <b>12</b>. Such a connection can be made by pick and place of the active die <b>16</b> followed by solder reflow, or thermal compression bonding (TCB). As illustrated, the bump pattern for solder balls of the die <b>18</b> are aligned with the discrete components <b>28</b> for minimum lateral routing and fan-out, which can reduce the (x, y) form factor dimensions. Alternatively, the die may be electrically bonded to the substrate with wire bonds (not shown).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the package <b>10</b> carrying the die <b>16</b> and the antennas <b>23</b> is bonded to a circuit board <b>38</b>. A ball grid array <b>14</b> or any other suitable structure may be used to attach the package to the board. The solder balls <b>14</b> may be in the form of conductive bumps arranged along a periphery of the substrate. The inner and outer conductive bumps <b>14</b>, <b>18</b> may be formed using a variety of processes including screen printing or a microball ball grid array (BGA). The conductive bumps <b>14</b> for the PCB have a height larger than the height of the conductive bumps <b>18</b> or solder balls that attach the die to the substrate. These higher bumps may be placed on the substrate prior to electrically bonding the die <b>16</b> to the substrate <b>12</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> all of the conductive bumps large <b>14</b> and small <b>18</b> are placed on the substrate at the same time or with different steps. The die <b>16</b> is then attached to the substrate as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> before the substrate is attached to the PCB.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">The composite material can be formed using an organic, thermosetting resin, similar to a CUF epoxy resin, that has low viscosity or is flow-able at low to moderate temperatures. Upon exposure to higher temperatures above the cross-link activation temperature, the resin can chemically bond to a nanoparticle via surface treatment. A magnetic field is applied during the application of a particular temperature profile such that magnetic particles can rotate freely enabling magnetic domain alignment and then subsequent vitrification or hardening of the alignment. The temperature profile may be used to flow the resin or encourage magnetic domain rotation and chemically couple, i.e. cross-link or covalently bond, the organic resin to the magnetic nanoparticles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">Single-domain magnetic domain nanoparticles may be used. The nanoparticles may include a passivation layer, e.g. SiO<sub>2</sub>. The passivation tends to keep dispersions of the magnetic nanoparticles stable and unaggregated. There are a variety of different ways to passivate the particles. In one embodiment, the particles are passivated with a sol-gel process. Using sol-gel ultrasonic cavitation, particle aggregates are fragmented and reactivity is promoted. In conjunction with the sol-gel processing, silica coated particles can be obtained. Silica coated particles may be more easily dispersed in organic solvents or resins than core particles without a passivation layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">The silica nanoparticles may be surface treated to modify the viscosity and surface energy of the particle and to promote covalent bonding between the particles and the matrix. The silica nano-particles may be coated with any of variety of different surface treatments including an aminosilane such as N-Aminoethyl-3-aminopropyltrimethoxy-silane (AEAPS) as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>. In this case the silane portion of the treatment adheres to the silica particle surface while the amine portion hangs free and can react with an epoxy resin. Other surface treatments, silane or otherwise may be used depending the choice of organic resin for the nanocomposite. Alternatively, a combination of aminosilane and 3-glycidyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTS) as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref> may be employed so that the epoxide ring and amine end group may covalently link and tightly couple the particles with a minimal use of additional organic binder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">In the example fabrication processes described above, the nanocomposite material may be spread into a mold or cavity via shear, similar to a solder paste or other granular organic/inorganic mixtures. Volume fractions of silica nanoparticles to resin in excess of 80 volume percent may be used if an optimized bi-dispersed system is used to spread the resin. In such a case, the ratio of large particle to small particle is as high as possible and the ratio of the volume fraction of large particles divided by the volume fraction of large and small particles, ranges from 0.7 to 0.8. Consequently, all that is needed for the latter, greater than 20 volume percent of the formulation, is a polymeric binder that allows the particles to be easily spread and can covalently crosslink the particles using a thermal profile once the magnetic domain alignment is achieved and an activation temperature is reached.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">By tuning the surface treatment of the passivated, magnetic nanoparticles and the corresponding resin, the dielectric and mechanical properties of the organic material and even the amount of contraction upon crosslinking can be optimized for use as an inductor or with an RF package and antennas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">In the fabrication processes described above, the solution of resin and passivated nanoparticles can be paste printed, slit coated, screen printed or applied by any means feasible into a package cavity or mold. The temperature is then increased to a level (T<sub>align</sub>) below the activation temperature of the resin crosslinking. This reduces the viscosity of the solution and makes it easy for the spherical magnetic nanoparticles to rotate. At this temperature, a magnetic field is applied across the particles to align the domains of the particles. Once alignment is achieved the temperature is increased above the activation temperature. The higher temperatures induce crosslinking. The crosslinking locks the aligned particles into position. Alternatively, other cross-linking stimuli i.e. UV radiation may be used in lieu of or in addition to the thermal heating. As shown and described above, the resulting magnetic nanocomposite material can be applied and cured in a package cavity or when formed in a mold released and then embedded in microelectronic packages or surface mounted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref> shows a nanocomposite material <b>110</b> formed of resin <b>112</b> filled with nanomagnetic particles <b>114</b>. The nano-particles <b>114</b> are randomly oriented as indicated by the arrows. The organic binder is used to fill a generic cubicle cavity and therefore has such a shape. The particular shape of the material and the amount of fill may be modified to suit any particular implementation or complex shape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref> shows the same material <b>110</b> or particle <b>114</b> filled resin <b>112</b> in which the magnetic fields of the nano-particles <b>114</b> are locked in alignment. The particles are aligned by the application of a magnetic field <b>116</b> while the resin is at an elevated temperature T<sub>align</sub>, above the ambient temperature T<sub>amb </sub>and below the resin's activation temperature T<sub>act</sub>. Once the particles are aligned as shown, the temperature is elevated above the activation temperature to a lock temperature T<sub>lock </sub>that locks the magnetic nano-particles into the aligned position.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">In order to further improve the packing density of the nanocomposite, the alignment lock-in process can be done under an applied pressure. Alternatively, a resin that undergoes significant contraction upon crosslinking can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">A variety of different resin formulations may be used, such as resins that are used for capillary underfill applications. The resin may be designed to be low viscosity at temperatures from 90-110° C. and then to crosslink at temperatures in excess of 125° C. This allows the granular mixture to flow easily prior to covalent bonding. The particle size distribution can be adjusted to maximize the volume fraction of particles in the epoxy. For example, the size ratio of big spherical particles to little spherical particles and the corresponding concentration can be optimized to push the maximum packing fraction to 88 volume %.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">As described, a strong magnetic field may be applied across the epoxy composite to align each particle domain to the governing field. While it may be difficult for the packed nanoparticles to move via shear, particle rotation is still easy upon exposure to the magnetic field. Rotation is easy in part because each spherical particle is not linked to its neighbors until the temperature is increased. Local friction and hydrodynamic interactions are therefore minimized. The alignment may be improved by optimizing the passivation thickness of the magnetic particles to ensure independent alignment. The choice of parameters for any particular resin and nanoparticle combination will depend on the particular materials that are selected and the nature of the package materials to which the resin will be applied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">Additional applications utilizing the nanocomposite material and process described above are possible including inductors, both uncoupled and coupled, transformers and other applications which require a magnetic material to be used in a small form factor with high frequency performance. The particular specifications of the nanocomposite material may be adapted to suit a variety of different applications.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref> is a cross-sectional diagram of an uncoupled inductor which might be used in a high frequency voltage regulator circuit or in a variety of other applications. The inductor is built upon a substrate <b>132</b> which may be shared with many other components or used only for the illustrated inductor. The substrate may be silicon, BUL, glass, or any of a variety of other materials dielectric or conducting. In one embodiment dielectric retainers <b>134</b> are formed around the inductor to prevent the material from flowing. In a second embodiment the dielectric retainers are not required if the viscosity of the resin is sufficiently high that it will not flow during the subsequent processing. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref> is a top elevation view of the inductor of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>. The dielectric forms a wall on four sides of the inductor. The rectangular shape is shown as an example. The inductor may be formed in different shapes to satisfy different packaging and performance requirements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">A first layer of the nanocomposite magnetic material <b>136</b> is deposited within the dielectric boundary and processed. A conductor <b>138</b>, such as copper is formed on this magnetic layer <b>136</b> and then a second magnetic layer is deposited, processed and patterned to form a stripline inductor. In this case the conductor is enclosed by additional magnetic material. Additional dielectric or magnetic material may be formed over the conductor and vias <b>140</b> may be formed to provide contact pads to the inductor. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref> shows that the primary copper conductor <b>138</b> is covered by the nanocomposite magnetic material <b>136</b>; however, connections <b>140</b> are accessible to connect the inductor to other components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">Using the straight conductor, a single turn inductor is formed, however, the conductor may have a variety of different shapes to form additional turns or attributes to control the electrical specifications of the device. Coupled inductors can also be fabricated in this manner by adding additional conductor lines. A toroidal inductor may be formed using a single layer of the nanocomposite magnetic material. Windings may then be formed around the magnetic layer in a toroidal configuration. The nanocomposite magnetic material in this case acts a core for the inductor. Other devices may also be formed. The inductor may be a passive in a package with or without an antenna. It may also be used in a power supply or other microelectronic device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is a process flow diagram of forming a nanocomposite material antenna structure as described above. At <b>161</b>, a nanoparticle composite resin material is applied to a substrate. This may be applied by to the substrate by paste printing, screen printing, slit coating, spreading, jet dispensing, or other techniques. Molds or stencils may be used to determine the shape and size of the resulting composite material. The composite, as described above is a nanoparticle filled resin, such as a polymeric binder. The nanoparticles are magnetic and may be first coated in one or more layers with silanes or other materials to improve the disperse-ability with in or compatibility to the resin. The surface treatment may also be selected to increase binding or cross-link-ability with the resin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">The substrate may include additional circuitry or conductive pathways to other circuitry or both. The substrate may also carry other RF devices such as capacitors, resistors and other passive devices. The substrate may alternatively be a temporary carrier that is later removed and replaced with other devices, components, or substrates. As shown above, the substrate may carry one or more dies on the same surface as the nanoparticle composite resin or on the surface of the opposite side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">At <b>162</b>, the composite and the substrate are heated to an alignment temperature, a temperature at which the resin has a low viscosity. This temperature is high enough to allow the magnetic nanoparticles to move about rotationally and perhaps also in shear movement. In some embodiments, this temperature is between 90-110° C., however, the particular temperature depends on the composition of the resin and the nanoparticle filler.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">At <b>163</b> a magnetic field is applied to the composite to align the nanoparticles. The magnetic field is applied at the alignment temperature so that the nanoparticles are able to rotate into alignment with the applied magnetic field. Alternatively, the magnetic field may first be applied and then the composite is heated to allow the nano-particles to align as the temperature increases. After the nanoparticles are aligned at <b>164</b>, the resin is heated to a bond temperature. This temperature is sufficient to lock the nanoparticles into position, for example, by causing covalent bonds between the nanoparticles and the resin. In some embodiments this is a temperature above 125° C., however, the temperature depends on the nature of the resin. At <b>165</b>, the resin is allowed to cure and to cool.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">At <b>166</b>, vias are drilled through the resin and, depending on the particular configuration, through the substrate. The vias are to allow the applied antennas to connect with circuitry or pathways in the substrate or in some other device on the opposite side of the resin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">At <b>167</b> conductive paths are applied into the drilled vias and, depending on the particular configuration, across the top surface of the composite. These paths allow for RF and electrical connections to be made across and through the composite to connect antenna structures to each other and to other devices in the eventual package. The conductive paths may be made from copper, aluminum, silver, or any other suitably conductive material and may be applied by vapor deposition, inkjet deposition, lithography, metal plating or in any of a variety of other ways.</div>
