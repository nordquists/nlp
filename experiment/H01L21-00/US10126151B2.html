<heading id="h-0002">FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure relate to the technical field of semiconductor fabrication, and in particular to a wafer-level chip package structure and a packaging method thereof.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">With the development of the modern society, there are growing interests in the importance of personal identification and personal information security. The fingerprint recognition technology is characterized by high safety, high reliability and simple operation because of uniqueness and invariability of a human fingerprint. Thus the fingerprint recognition technology is widely used in various fields for protecting personal information security. Meanwhile, with the development of science and technology, the information security issue of various electronic products has long been a concern in technology development. The need for information security is even more acute in mobile terminals, such as a cell phone, a laptop computer, a tablet computer, and a digital camera.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">A fingerprint recognition device senses a fingerprint in a capacitive (electric-field) manner or an inductive manner. The fingerprint recognition device extracts a user fingerprint, converts the user fingerprint into an electrical signal and outputs the electrical signal, thereby acquiring fingerprint information of the user. Specifically, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which is a schematic cross-sectional structural diagram of a fingerprint recognition device, which includes a base plate <b>100</b>, a fingerprint recognition chip <b>101</b> coupled to a surface of the base plate <b>100</b>, and a glass base plate <b>102</b> covering a surface of the fingerprint recognition chip <b>101</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Taking a capacitive fingerprint recognition chip as an example, the fingerprint recognition chip <b>101</b> includes one or more capacitor plates. Since the epidermis or subdermal layer of a user's finger has raised ridges and recessed valleys, a distance between the ridge and the fingerprint recognition chip <b>101</b> is different from a distance between the valley and the fingerprint recognition chip <b>101</b> when the user's finger <b>103</b> touches a surface of the glass base plate <b>102</b>. Therefore, a capacitance value between the ridge of the user's finger <b>103</b> and the capacitor plate is different from a capacitance value between the valley of the user's finger <b>103</b> and the capacitor plate. The fingerprint recognition chip <b>101</b> is capable of acquiring the different capacitance values, converting them into corresponding electrical signals and outputting the electrical signals. After gathering the received electrical signals, the fingerprint recognition device can acquire the fingerprint information of the user.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the conventional fingerprint recognition device has a high requirement on the sensitivity of the fingerprint recognition chip, limiting the fabrication and application of the fingerprint recognition device.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">As described in the BACKGROUND, the conventional fingerprint recognition device has a high requirement on the sensitivity of the fingerprint recognition chip, thus the fabrication and application of the fingerprint recognition device are limited.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">Reference is still made to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it is discovered that, the surface of the fingerprint recognition chip <b>101</b> is covered by the glass base plate <b>102</b>, which is provided for protecting the fingerprint recognition chip <b>101</b>, and the user's finger <b>103</b> directly contacts the glass base plate <b>102</b>. Therefore, in order to ensure that the glass base plate <b>102</b> is capable of providing adequate protection, the glass base plate <b>102</b> has a great thickness. However, because of the great thickness of the glass base plate <b>102</b>, the fingerprint recognition chip <b>101</b> is required to have a high sensitivity in order to ensure that the fingerprint of the user can be extracted accurately. However, the fingerprint recognition chips with high sensitivity are difficult to fabricate and expensive to manufacture, which limit the application and promotion of the fingerprint recognition chips.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">Specifically, the capacitive fingerprint recognition device is still taken as an example, when the user's finger <b>103</b> is placed on the surface of the glass base plate <b>102</b>, a capacitor is formed between the user's finger <b>103</b> and the capacitor plate in the fingerprint recognition chip <b>101</b>. The user's finger <b>103</b> and the capacitor plate constitute two plates of the capacitor, and the glass base plate <b>102</b> constitutes a dielectric between the two plates of the capacitor. However, because of the great thickness of the glass base plate <b>102</b>, a capacitance value between the user's finger <b>103</b> and the capacitor plate is great, while a difference of the capacitance value between the ridge and the capacitor plate compared with the capacitance value between the valley and the capacitor plate is small since a height difference between the ridge and the valley of the user's finger <b>103</b> is small. Therefore, the fingerprint recognition chip <b>101</b> is required to have a high sensitivity in order to accurately detect the difference between the capacitance values.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">To solve the above issue, a wafer-level fingerprint recognition chip package structure and a wafer-level fingerprint recognition chip packaging method are provided according to the present disclosure. In the packaging method, instead of the conventional glass base plate, a cover layer is formed on a first surface of a sensing chip (for example, a fingerprint recognition chip), for directly contacting with a user's finger and protecting the sensing chip. Since the cover layer has a smaller thickness than the conventional glass base plate, the distance between the first surface of the sensing chip and a surface of the cover layer can be reduced, such that the sensing chip can easily detect the fingerprint of the user, and accordingly the requirement on the sensitivity of the sensing chip is correspondingly reduced, which enables the wide-spread use of the fingerprint recognition chip package structure. In addition, before separate sensing chips are formed by cutting, the plug structure is formed in the substrate, and the plug structure is exposed by the second surface of the substrate, such that the plug structure is electrically connected with the substrate. Therefore, after the sensing chip is coupled to the substrate, it is not necessary to form an additional conductive structure on the first surface of the sensing chip. Therefore, the cover layer, which is provided for protecting the sensing area, can be formed on the first surface of the substrate before the substrate is cut. The cover layer is cut when the sensing chips are formed by cutting. Therefore, it is not necessary to form the cover layer after the sensing chip is coupled to the surface of the substrate, thus the fingerprint recognition chip packaging method can be simplified, and damages to the sensing area can be reduced, thereby ensuring the accuracy of the fingerprint information acquired by the sensing area. Further, the formed package structure is simple, which facilitates reducing the size of the formed package structure. To make the above objects, features and advantages of the present disclosure more obvious and easy to be understood, the embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail in the following in conjunction with the drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 6</figref> are schematic cross-sectional structural diagrams illustrating a wafer-level fingerprint recognition chip packaging procedure according to an embodiment of the disclosure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a substrate <b>200</b> is provided, which includes several sensing chip areas <b>201</b>. The substrate <b>200</b> has a first surface <b>210</b> and a second surface <b>220</b> which is opposite to the first surface <b>210</b>, and each of the sensing chip areas <b>201</b> includes a sensing area <b>211</b> located on the first surface <b>210</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">The substrate <b>200</b> is a silicon substrate, a silicon germanium substrate, a silicon carbide substrate, a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate, or a germanium-on-insulator (GOI) substrate. In addition, the substrate <b>200</b> is a full wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">The sensing chip area <b>201</b> is provided for forming a sensing chip. Subsequently, the substrate <b>200</b> is cut to separate the several sensing chip areas <b>201</b> with each other, to form separate sensing chips. In this embodiment, the sensing chip areas <b>201</b> are arranged in an array, and a sawing lane area <b>202</b> is further provided between adjacent sensing chip areas <b>201</b>. The sensing chip areas <b>201</b> can be separated with each other by cutting at the sawing lane area <b>202</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">In this embodiment, a sensing area <b>211</b> is formed on the first surface <b>210</b> of the substrate <b>200</b>. The sensing area <b>211</b> is provided for detecting and receiving fingerprint information of a user. Therefore, a capacitive structure or a conductive structure for acquiring the fingerprint information of the user needs to be formed in the sensing area <b>211</b>. In addition, a cover layer needs to be formed subsequently on the sensing area <b>211</b> for protecting the sensing area <b>211</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">In the following, the description is made by taking a case that the capacitive structure is formed in the sensing area <b>211</b> as an example. At least one capacitor plate is formed in the sensing area <b>211</b>. The cover layer is subsequently formed on the first surface <b>210</b> of the substrate <b>200</b>. When the user's finger is placed on the surface of the cover layer, the capacitor plate, the cover layer and the user's finger form a capacitive structure. The sensing area <b>211</b> is capable of acquiring the difference between the capacitance value between the capacitor plate and the ridges on the surface of the user's finger and the capacitance value between the capacitor plate and the valleys on the surface of the user' finger, and the difference between the capacitance values is processed with a chip circuit and outputted, so that the fingerprint information of the user is acquired.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">In this embodiment, in the sensing chip area <b>201</b>, a peripheral area <b>212</b> which surrounds the sensing area <b>211</b> is further formed on the first surface <b>210</b>. A chip circuit and a first solder pad <b>213</b> are formed in the peripheral area <b>212</b>. The chip circuit is electrically connected with the sensing area <b>211</b> and the first solder pad <b>213</b>. The first solder pad <b>213</b> is provided for electrically connecting with the base plate during the packaging procedure. The chip circuit is electrically connected with the capacitive structure or the conductive structure in the sensing area <b>211</b> for processing and outputting the fingerprint information acquired by the sensing area <b>211</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a cover layer <b>203</b> is formed on the first surface <b>210</b> of the substrate <b>200</b>. The cover layer <b>203</b> has a thickness less than 100 microns.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">The cover layer <b>203</b> is provided for protecting the surface of the sensing area <b>211</b>. In this embodiment, at least one capacitor plate is formed in the sensing area <b>211</b>. When the user's finger is placed on the surface of the cover layer <b>203</b>, the capacitor plate, the cover layer <b>203</b> and the user's fingerprint form a capacitive structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">Since the subsequently formed plug structure is located in the sensing chip area <b>201</b> of the substrate <b>200</b>, extended through the substrate <b>200</b>, and provided for electrically connecting the sensing area <b>211</b> and the chip circuit to an external circuit, it is not necessary to form an additional conductive structure on the first surface <b>210</b> of the sensing chip area <b>201</b> when packaging the separate sensing chip area <b>201</b> in a subsequent process. In addition, before the substrate <b>200</b> is cut, the cover layer <b>203</b> is formed on the first surface <b>210</b> of the substrate <b>200</b>, such that the cover layer <b>203</b> is cut together with the substrate <b>200</b>. In subsequent processes, a package structure can be formed only by securing the second surface <b>220</b> of the cut separate sensing chip area <b>201</b> to a surface of a base plate, and electrically connecting the plug structure to the base plate. Therefore, the packaging method of the fingerprint recognition chip can be simplified, and the formed package structure is simple in structure, which facilitates reducing the size of the package structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">In addition, since during subsequent packaging processes, it is not necessary to form an additional conductive structure on the first surface <b>210</b> of the sensing chip area <b>201</b>, the cover layer <b>203</b> may also be formed on the surface of the peripheral area <b>212</b> in addition to the surface of the sensing area <b>211</b>, without influencing subsequent packaging processes. Therefore, after the cover layer <b>203</b> is formed on the surface of the substrate <b>200</b>, it is not necessary to etch and pattern the cover layer <b>203</b>, which simplifies the fabrication procedure, and reduces damages to the first surface <b>210</b> of the substrate <b>200</b>, thereby ensuring the accuracy of the fingerprint information acquired by the sensing area <b>211</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">A material of the cover layer <b>203</b> may be an inorganic nanomaterial, a polymeric material, a glass material and a ceramic material. The cover layer <b>203</b> may be formed by a chemical vapor deposition process, a physical vapor deposition process, an atomic layer deposition process, a screen-printing process, a spin coating process or a spraying process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">In an embodiment, the material of the cover layer <b>203</b> is a polymeric material, which may be epoxy resin, polyimide resin, benzocyclobutene resin, polybenzoxazole resin, polybutylene terephthalate, polycarbonate, polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyolefin, urethane, polyolefin, polyethersulfone, polyamide, polyurethane, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, or polyvinyl alcohol. The cover layer <b>203</b> is formed by a screen-printing process, a spin coating process or a spraying process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">In another embodiment, the material of the cover layer <b>203</b> is an inorganic nanomaterial, which is alumina or cobalt oxide. The cover layer <b>203</b> is formed by a chemical vapor deposition process, a physical vapor deposition process, an atomic layer deposition process, a screen-printing process, a spin coating process or a spraying process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">In other embodiments, the material of the cover layer <b>203</b> is a glass material or a ceramic material, which is a hard material. Therefore, the cover layer <b>203</b> needs to be secured to the first surface of the substrate <b>200</b> with an adhesive layer. The adhesive layer has adhesiveness and may be made of capacitive screen glue.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">The cover layer <b>203</b> has a Mohs hardness greater than or equal to 8 H. The cover layer <b>203</b> has a relatively great hardness. Therefore, the cover layer <b>203</b> is capable of protecting the sensing area <b>211</b> in the sensing chip area <b>201</b> even in a case of having a relatively small thickness. When the user's finger slides on the surface of the cover layer <b>203</b>, no damage is caused to the surface of the sensing chip area <b>201</b>. In addition, because of the relatively great hardness of the cover layer <b>203</b>, the cover layer is less prone to deformation. Therefore, the thickness of the cover layer <b>203</b> hardly changes even when the user's finger presses the surface of the cover layer <b>203</b>, thus the accuracy of the detection result from the sensing area <b>211</b> is ensured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">The cover layer <b>203</b> has a dielectric constant greater than or equal to 7. Because of the relatively great dielectric constant, the cover layer <b>203</b> has an excellent electrical isolation capability, and thus the cover layer <b>203</b> is capable of providing effective protection to the sensing area <b>211</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">The cover layer <b>203</b> has a thickness of 20 microns to 200 microns. Because of the relatively small thickness of the cover layer <b>203</b>, when the user's finger is placed on the surface of the cover layer <b>203</b>, the distance between the finger and the sensing area <b>211</b> is reduced.

The cover layer <b>302</b> may be formed by a screen-printing process, a spraying process or a spin coating process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0140">The cover layer <b>302</b> has a Mohs hardness greater than or equal to 8 H. The cover layer <b>302</b> has a relatively great hardness. Therefore, the cover layer <b>302</b> is capable of protecting the sensing area <b>311</b> of the sensing chip <b>301</b> even in a case of having a relatively small thickness. When the user's finger slides on the surface of the cover layer <b>302</b>, no damage is caused to the surface of the sensing chip <b>301</b>. In addition, because of the relatively great hardness of the cover layer <b>302</b>, the cover layer <b>302</b> is less prone to deformation. Therefore, the thickness of the cover layer <b>302</b> hardly changes even when the user's finger presses the surface of the cover layer <b>302</b>, thus the accuracy of the detection result from the sensing area <b>311</b> is ensured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0141">The cover layer <b>302</b> has a dielectric constant greater than or equal to 7.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0143" num="0142">The cover layer <b>302</b> has a thickness of 20 microns to 200 microns. Because of the relatively small thickness of the cover layer <b>302</b>, when the user's finger is placed on the surface of the cover layer <b>302</b>, the distance between the finger and the sensing area <b>311</b> is reduced. Therefore, the fingerprint of the user's finger can be better detected by the sensing area <b>311</b>, thus the high requirement on the sensitivity of the sensing chip <b>301</b> is reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0144" num="0143">The thickness of the cover layer <b>302</b> is relatively small, and the capacitance value between the user's finger and the capacitor plate is inversely proportional to the thickness of the cover layer <b>302</b>, and directly proportional to the dielectric constant of the cover layer <b>302</b>. Therefore, in a case that the cover layer <b>302</b> has a small thickness and a great dielectric constant, the capacitance value between the user's finger and the capacitor plate is in a detectable range of the sensing area <b>311</b>, thereby avoiding detection failures of the sensing area <b>311</b> due to an excessively great or small capacitance value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0144">In addition, in a case that the cover layer <b>302</b> has a thickness of 20 microns to 200 microns and a dielectric constant greater than or equal to 7, the dielectric constant of the cover layer <b>302</b> increases as the thickness of the cover layer <b>302</b> increases, which increases the capacitance value between the user's finger and the capacitor plate. As a result, the capacitance value is more detectable by the sensing area <b>311</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0145">Since the plug structure <b>303</b> is located in the sensing chip <b>301</b> and in this embodiment the plug structure <b>303</b> is located in an area corresponding to the peripheral area <b>312</b>, the sensing area <b>311</b> can be electrically connected with the wiring layer on the base plate <b>300</b> by means of the plug structure <b>303</b>. Therefore, when the sensing chip <b>301</b> is packaged, it is not necessary to provide an additional conductive structure on the first surface <b>310</b> of the sensing chip <b>301</b>. Thus the fingerprint recognition chip package structure is simple in structure, which facilitates reducing the size of the package structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0147" num="0146">The first surface <b>310</b> of the sensing chip <b>301</b> is completely covered by the cover layer <b>302</b>, thus it is not necessary to provide the cover layer <b>302</b> on the first surface <b>310</b> of the sensing chip <b>301</b> after the sensing chip <b>301</b> is secured to the base plate <b>300</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0161">According to the embodiments of the present disclosure, the fingerprint recognition chip packaging method can be simplified, the requirements on the sensitivity of the sensing chip is reduced, thereby achieving wide-spread use of the packaging method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0162">In the wafer-level fingerprint recognition chip packaging method according to the embodiments of the present disclosure, several sensing chip areas are provided in the substrate, and the several sensing chip areas may be separated with each other by cutting the substrate, thereby forming separate sensing chips. The sensing area on the first surface of the sensing chip area is provided for acquiring finger print information. In addition, instead of the conventional glass base plate, the cover layer is formed on the first surface of the substrate for directly contacting with a user's finger and protecting the sensing chip. Since the cover layer has a smaller thickness as compared with the conventional glass base plate, the distance between the first surface of the sensing chip and the surface of the cover layer can be reduced, such that the sensing chip can better detect the fingerprint of the user, and the requirement on the sensitivity of the sensing chip is reduced accordingly, which enables the wide-spread use of the fingerprint recognition chip package structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0163">In addition, since the plug structure is formed in the substrate, and the plug structure is exposed by the second surface of the substrate, such that the plug structure is electrically connected with an external circuit. The sensing chip can be coupled to the external circuit with the plug structure. Therefore, during subsequent packaging processes, it is not necessary to form an additional conductive structure on the first surface of the sensing chip, thus the cover layer which is provided for protecting the sensing area can be formed on the first surface of the substrate, without influencing subsequent packaging processes. The packaging procedure for forming the wafer-level fingerprint recognition chip package structure is simplified, and damages to the sensing area can be reduced, thereby ensuring the accuracy of the fingerprint information acquired by the sensing area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0164">Further, instead of the conventional glass base plate, the cover layer is formed on the first surface of the sensing chip for directly contacting with a user's finger and protecting the sensing chip. Since the cover layer has a smaller thickness as compared with the conventional glass base plate, the distance between the first surface of the sensing chip and the surface of the cover layer can be reduced, such that the sensing chip can better detect the fingerprint of the user, and the requirement on the sensitivity of the sensing chip is reduced accordingly, which enables the wide-spread use of the fingerprint recognition chip package structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0165">In addition, before separate sensing chips are formed by cutting, the plug structure is formed in the substrate, and the plug structure is exposed by the second surface of the substrate, such that the plug structure is electrically connected with the base plate. Therefore, it is not necessary to form an additional conductive structure on the first surface of the sensing chip after the sensing chip is coupled to the base plate, and the cover layer which is provided for protecting the sensing area can be formed on the first surface of the substrate before cutting the substrate. The cover layer is cut when the sensing chips are formed by cutting. Therefore, it is not necessary to form the cover layer after the sensing chip is coupled to the surface of the substrate, thus the fingerprint recognition chip packaging method can be simplified, and damages to the sensing area can be reduced, thereby ensuring the accuracy of the fingerprint information acquired by the sensing area. Further, the formed package structure is simply, which facilitates reducing the size of the formed package structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0167" num="0166">Further, the cover layer has a Mohs hardness greater than or equal to 8 H. The cover layer has a relatively great hardness. Therefore, the cover layer located on the surface of the sensing area has sufficient strength to protect the sensing area even in a case of having a relatively small thickness. When the user's finger is placed on the surface of the cover layer above the sensing area, the cover is less prone to deformation and wear, thus the fingerprint of the user can be extracted more accurately.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0168" num="0167">Further, the cover layer has a dielectric constant between 7 to 9, which is significantly great, thus the cover layer has an excellent electrical isolation performance, and is capable of providing better protection to the sensing area. The cover layer on the surface of the sensing area can provide effective electrical isolation between the user's finger and the sensing area even in a case of having a relatively small thickness, which allows a relatively great capacitance value between the user's finger and the sensing area in a detectable range.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0169" num="0168">Further, the guard ring which surrounds the sensing chip and the cover layer is provided on the base plate. The guard ring is used as an electrostatic shield for the sensing chip, thereby avoiding reduction in the accuracy of the fingerprint information of the user detected by the sensing area, or eliminating noises in signals outputted by the sensing chip. Thus the information detected by the sensing chip and the signals outputted by the sensing chip can be more accurate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0170" num="0169">In the wafer-level fingerprint recognition chip package structure according to the embodiments of the present disclosure, the plug structure is provided in the sensing chip area of the substrate. One end of the plug structure is electrically connected with the sensing area, and the other end of the plug structure is exposed by the second surface of the substrate. Therefore, the sensing area can be electrically connected with an external circuit outside the sensing chip area by means of the plug structure. Further, since the plug structure is located in the substrate, it is not necessary to provide an additional conductive wire for electrical connection between the sensing chip area and the external circuit, which facilitates reducing the size of the formed package structure when packaging the separate sensing chip area in subsequent processes. In addition, since it is not necessary to form a connection conductive wire on the first surface of the substrate when forming the package structure in subsequent processes, the cover layer can be provided on the first surface of the substrate. The cover layer can directly contact with the user's finger and is provided for protecting the sensing area. The wafer-level fingerprint recognition chip is simple in structure, and it is easy to form the package structure with the separate sensing chip area in subsequent processes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0171" num="0170">Further, the cover layer is located on the first surface of the sensing chip, for replacing the conventional glass base plate. The cover can directly contact with the user's finger for protecting the sensing chip. Moreover, as compared with the conventional glass base plate, the cover layer has a smaller thickness, and thus the distance between the first surface of the sensing chip and the surface of the cover layer can be reduced with the cover layer, such that the sensing chip can better detect the fingerprint of the user. The requirement on the sensitivity of the sensing chip is correspondingly reduced with the package structure, which enables the wide-spread use of the fingerprint recognition chip package structure. In addition, the plug structure is further provided in the sensing chip. One end of the plug structure is electrically connected with the sensing area, and the other end of the plug structure is exposed by the second surface of the sensing chip. Therefore, the sensing chip can be secured to the base plate, and the sensing area can be electrically connected with the base plate by means of the plug structure exposed by the second surface of the sensing chip. The package structure is simple in structure and can be easily assembled, therefore the manufacturing costs of the package structure is lowered, while its production yield is improved.</div>
