<heading id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">The following disclosure provides many different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of the provided subject matter. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. For example, the formation of a first feature over or on a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the first and second features are formed in direct contact, and may also include embodiments in which additional features may be formed between the first and second features, such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact. In addition, the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals and/or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and/or configurations discussed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">Further, spatially relative terms, such as “beneath,” “below,” “lower,” “above,” “upper” and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. The spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. The apparatus may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein may likewise be interpreted accordingly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">The present disclosure will be described with respect to embodiments in a specific context, a polishing layer of a polishing pad having first and second grooves respectively at different horizontal levels. The first and second grooves may be used to accommodate slurry for polishing a wafer. When the second groove in the top surface of the polishing layer exists, the slurry may flow into the second groove and may be stored by the second groove for polishing the wafer. After the second groove is worn out and disappeared, the first groove buried in the polishing layer is exposed through the top surface of the polishing layer. As a result, the slurry may flow into the first groove and may be stored by the first groove for continuously polishing the wafer. The embodiments of the disclosure may also be applied, however, to a variety of polishing pads. Various embodiments will be explained in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view of a chemical-mechanical polishing apparatus <b>100</b> according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the chemical-mechanical polishing apparatus <b>100</b> includes a platen <b>110</b>, a polishing pad <b>120</b>, a slurry feed <b>130</b>, and a carrier device <b>140</b>. The polishing pad <b>120</b> is present on the platen <b>110</b> and has a polishing layer <b>122</b>. The slurry feed <b>130</b> and the carrier device <b>140</b> are present above the polishing layer <b>122</b>. When the chemical-mechanical polishing apparatus <b>100</b> is in operation, the slurry feed <b>130</b> may dispense slurry <b>132</b> onto the polishing layer <b>122</b>, and the polishing pad <b>120</b> may be rotated in a direction D<b>1</b> by the platen <b>110</b>. After the slurry <b>132</b> is distributed over the polishing layer <b>122</b> of the polishing pad <b>120</b>, the carrier device <b>140</b> may push a wafer <b>210</b> in a direction D<b>2</b> against the polishing layer <b>122</b>, such that one side of the wafer <b>210</b> in contact with the polishing layer <b>122</b> may be polished by the slurry <b>132</b>. For further planarization of the wafer <b>210</b>, the carrier device <b>140</b> may rotate (e.g., also in the direction D<b>1</b>) and move on the polishing layer <b>122</b> of the polishing pad <b>120</b> at the same time, but various embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited in this regard.</div>

As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the polishing pad <b>120</b> includes the polishing layer <b>122</b> and a first support layer <b>128</b>. The polishing layer <b>122</b> is present on the first support layer <b>128</b>. The first support layer <b>128</b> is located between the platen <b>110</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and the polishing layer <b>122</b>. The first support layer <b>128</b> is harder than the polishing layer <b>122</b>, such that the first support layer <b>128</b> may provide a supporting force to the polishing layer <b>122</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">The polishing layer <b>122</b> is located on the first support layer <b>128</b> and has a top surface <b>123</b> and a bottom surface <b>125</b>. The bottom surface <b>125</b> faces away from the top surface <b>122</b> and faces the first support layer <b>128</b>. The polishing layer <b>122</b> has at least one first groove <b>124</b> and at least one second groove <b>126</b>. In some embodiments, the second groove <b>126</b> may be a cavity buried at least beneath the top surface <b>123</b> of the polishing layer <b>122</b>. The first groove <b>124</b> is present on the top surface <b>123</b> of the polishing layer <b>122</b>. In some embodiments, the second groove <b>126</b> is a groove having an opening <b>1262</b> on the bottom surface <b>125</b> of the polishing layer <b>122</b>, and the opening <b>1262</b> of the second groove <b>126</b> is covered by the first support layer <b>128</b>, such that the second groove <b>126</b> can be considered a buried groove. On the other hand, the first groove <b>124</b> is an open groove in the top surface <b>123</b> of the polishing layer <b>122</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">In other words, the top surface <b>123</b> of the polishing layer <b>122</b> has the first groove <b>124</b> therein, and the bottom surface <b>125</b> of the polishing layer <b>122</b> has the second groove <b>126</b> therein. The first and second grooves <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> are respectively present at opposite sides of the polishing layer <b>122</b>, and the opening direction D<b>3</b> of the first groove <b>124</b> faces away from the opening direction D<b>4</b> of the second groove <b>126</b>. It is to be noted that the number of the first and second grooves <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> of the polishing layer <b>122</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is for illustration, and various embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited in this regard.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, the first and second grooves <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> of the polishing layer <b>122</b> may be in a concentric arrangement, but various embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited in this regard.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when the slurry <b>132</b> is dispensed onto the polishing layer <b>122</b> of the polishing pad <b>120</b> and the platen <b>110</b> rotates, the slurry <b>132</b> may flow on the top surface <b>123</b> of the polishing layer <b>122</b> and may flow into the first groove <b>124</b>. As a result, the slurry <b>132</b> is accommodated in the first groove <b>124</b> of the polishing layer <b>122</b>, and the slurry <b>132</b> and the polishing layer <b>122</b> are used to polish the wafer <b>210</b> that is in contact with the polishing layer <b>122</b>. After the top surface <b>123</b> of the polishing layer <b>122</b> is ground by a number of wafers <b>210</b> for a period of time, the first groove <b>124</b> may be worn down and either reduced in size or disappear because of being ground by the slurry <b>132</b> and the wafers <b>210</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the first groove <b>124</b> and the second groove <b>126</b> are separated from the top surface <b>123</b> of the polishing layer <b>120</b> at different vertical distances. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the polishing pad <b>120</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> after the second groove <b>126</b> of the polishing pad <b>120</b> is exposed. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when the top surface <b>123</b> of the polishing layer <b>122</b> is ground by the slurry <b>132</b> and the wafer <b>210</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), the thickness of the polishing layer <b>122</b> is worn down, such that the first groove <b>124</b> may be worn down and the second groove <b>126</b> may be exposed through the top surface <b>123</b> of the polishing layer <b>122</b>. Therefore, even if the first groove <b>124</b> is worn down, the second groove <b>126</b> is opened to continuously accommodate the slurry <b>132</b>. That is to say, after the first groove <b>124</b> is worn down because of the top surface <b>123</b> of the polishing layer <b>122</b> being ground by the slurry <b>132</b> and the wafer <b>210</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), the slurry <b>132</b> dispensed onto the top surface <b>123</b> of the polishing layer <b>122</b> may also flow into the second groove <b>126</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, since the second groove <b>126</b> may be exposed to accommodate the slurry <b>132</b> when the first groove <b>124</b> is worn down, the slurry <b>132</b> may be accommodated in both of the residual first groove <b>124</b> and the opened second groove <b>126</b>. As a result of such a design, the first groove <b>124</b> and the second groove <b>126</b> of the polishing layer <b>122</b> may be designed with decreased depths. Since a polish pad having a deep groove generally needs a greater flow rate of polishing slurry than a polish pad having a shallow groove to produce a similar polishing rate. Thus, as the first groove <b>124</b> and the second groove <b>126</b> of the polishing layer <b>122</b> are reduced, the flow rate of the slurry <b>132</b> may also be reduced, yet the polishing rate may be maintained. In other words, the usage amount of the slurry <b>132</b> may be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">Furthermore, due to the polishing layer <b>122</b> has the first and second grooves <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> to accommodate the slurry <b>132</b>, the number of wafers polished by the polishing layer <b>122</b> accommodating the slurry <b>132</b> is increased. Therefore, the life time of the polishing pad <b>120</b> may be extended. Accordingly, when the polishing layer <b>122</b> of the polishing pad <b>120</b> having the first and second grooves <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> is used in the chemical-mechanical polishing apparatus <b>100</b>, the number of preventive maintenances (PM) for the polishing pad <b>120</b> during a period of time may be decreased, so that the operation time of the chemical-mechanical polishing apparatus <b>100</b> may be extended.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">Moreover, if the wafer <b>210</b> is usually polished on an edge portion of the polishing layer <b>122</b>, such as the position of the wafer <b>210</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the second groove <b>126</b> may be formed in the edge portion of the polishing layer <b>122</b> corresponding to the position of the wafer <b>210</b>. Since the portion of the polishing layer <b>122</b> where the wafer <b>210</b> is on is ground faster than the other portion of the polishing layer <b>122</b>, the position of the second groove <b>126</b> in the polishing layer <b>122</b> may be decided depending on the relative position of the wafer <b>210</b> and the polishing layer <b>122</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in some embodiments, the first and second grooves <b>124</b>, <b>126</b> are alternatively arranged in the polishing layer <b>122</b>, and the orthogonal projection of the first groove <b>124</b> on the first support layer <b>128</b> does not overlap the orthogonal projection of the second groove <b>126</b> on the first support layer <b>128</b>. In other words, the central line L<b>1</b> of the first groove <b>124</b> and the central line L<b>2</b> of the second groove <b>126</b> are parallel and spaced apart at a distance d<b>1</b>. Such configuration may ensure that the second groove <b>126</b> is exposed through the top surface <b>123</b> of the polishing layer <b>122</b> after the first groove <b>124</b> is substantially worn out.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, the top surface <b>123</b> of the polishing layer <b>122</b> has a plurality of first grooves <b>124</b> therein and the bottom surface <b>125</b> of the polishing layer <b>122</b> has a plurality of second grooves <b>126</b> therein. The orthogonal projection of each of the second grooves <b>126</b> on the top surface <b>123</b> is between two adjacent first grooves <b>124</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">The polishing pad <b>120</b> may further include a second support layer <b>129</b>, and the first support layer <b>128</b> is located between the second support layer <b>129</b> and the polishing layer <b>122</b>. In some embodiments, the hardness of the second support layer <b>129</b> is greater than the hardness of the first support layer <b>128</b>, and the hardness of the first support layer <b>128</b> is greater than the hardness of the polishing layer <b>122</b>, but various embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited in this regard. As a result of such a design, the second support layer <b>129</b> is used to support the first support layer <b>128</b> and the polishing layer <b>122</b>.</div>

In some embodiments, the bottom portion <b>1241</b> of the first groove <b>124</b> and the bottom portion <b>1261</b> of the second groove <b>126</b> are at the same horizontal level. As a result of such a design, after the first groove <b>124</b> is worn down and may have disappeared, the second groove <b>126</b> may be exposed through the top surface <b>123</b> continuously.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, a perpendicular distance d<b>2</b> between the bottom portion <b>1261</b> of the second groove <b>126</b> and the top surface <b>123</b> may be smaller than or equal to a perpendicular distance d<b>3</b> between the bottom portion <b>1241</b> of the first groove <b>124</b> and the top surface <b>123</b>.
