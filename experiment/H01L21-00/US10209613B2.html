<heading id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention relates generally to extreme ultraviolet lithography blanks, and manufacturing and lithography systems for such extreme ultraviolet lithography blanks.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV, also known as soft x-ray projection lithography) is a contender to replace deep ultraviolet lithography for the manufacture of 0.13 micron, and smaller, minimum feature size semiconductor devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">However, extreme ultraviolet light, which is generally in the 5 to 40 nanometer wavelength range, is strongly absorbed in virtually all materials. For that reason, extreme ultraviolet systems work by reflection rather than by transmission of light. Through the use of a series of mirrors, or lens elements, and a reflective element, or mask blank, coated with a non-reflective absorber mask pattern, the patterned actinic light is reflected onto a resist-coated semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">The lens elements and mask blanks of extreme ultraviolet lithography systems are coated with reflective multilayer coatings of materials such as molybdenum and silicon. Reflection values of approximately 65% per lens element, or mask blank, have been obtained by using substrates that are coated with multilayer coatings that strongly reflect light essentially at a single wavelength within an extremely narrow ultraviolet bandpass; e.g., 12 to 14 nanometer bandpass for 13 nanometer ultraviolet light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">There are various classes of defects in semiconductor processing technology which cause problems. Opaque defects are typically caused by particles on top of the multilayer coatings or mask pattern which absorb light when it should be reflected. Clear defects are typically caused by pinholes in the mask pattern on top of the multilayer coatings through which light is reflected when it should be absorbed. And phase defects are typically caused by scratches and surface variations beneath the multilayer coatings which cause transitions in the phase of the reflected light. These phase transitions result in light wave interference effects which distort or alter the pattern that is to be exposed in the resist on the surface of the semiconductor wafer. Because of the shorter wavelengths of radiation which must be used for sub-0.13 micron minimum feature size, scratches and surface variations which were insignificant before now become intolerable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">While progress has been made in reducing or eliminating particle defects and work has been done on repair of opaque and clear defects in masks, to date nothing has been done to address the problem of phase defects. For deep ultraviolet lithography, surfaces are processed to maintain phase transitions below 60 degrees. Similar processing for extreme ultraviolet lithography is yet to be developed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">For an actinic wavelength of 13 nanometers, a 180 degree phase transition in the light reflected from the multilayer coating may occur for a scratch of as little as 3 nanometers in depth in the underlying surface. This depth gets shallower with shorter wavelengths. Similarly, at the same wavelength, surface variations more abrupt than one (1) nanometer rise over one hundred (100) nanometers run may cause similar phase transitions. These phase transitions can cause a phase defect at the surface of the semiconductor wafer and irreparably damage the semiconductor devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">In the past, mask blanks for deep ultraviolet lithography have generally been of glass but silicon or ultra low thermal expansion materials have been proposed as alternatives for extreme ultraviolet lithography. Whether the blank is of glass, silicon, or ultra low thermal expansion material, the surface of the mask blank is made as smooth as possible by such processes a chemical mechanical polishing, magneto-rheological finishing, or ion beam polishing. The scratches that are left behind in such a process are sometimes referred to as “scratch-dig” marks, and their depth and width depend upon the size of the particles in the abrasive used to polish the mask blank. For visible and deep ultraviolet lithography, these scratches are too small to cause phase defects in the pattern on the semiconductor wafer. However, for extreme ultraviolet lithography, scratch-dig marks are a significant problem because they will appear as phase defects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">Due to the short illumination wavelengths required for EUV lithography the pattern masks used must be reflective mask instead of the transmissive masks used in current lithography. The reflective mask is made up of a precise stack of alternating thin layers of molybdenum and silicon, which creates a Bragg refractor or mirror. Because of the nature of the multilayer stack and the small feature size, any imperfections in the surface of the substrate on which the multilayer stack is deposited will be magnified and impact the final product. Imperfections on the scale of a few nanometers can show up as printable defects on the finished mask and need to be eliminated from the surface of the mask blank before deposition of the multilayer stack.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">Common imperfections include pits, scratches, and particles. Common cleaning techniques remove many of the particles but either generate new pits or amplify existing pits. The pits can come from the polishing or cleaning process or can be from inclusions or flaws in the substrate material itself that are exposed during the cutting and polishing process. Further polishing can be used to remove the pits at the surface, but there is a risk that new pits will be exposed or caused in the process, which limits the usefulness of using polishing alone to smooth and planarize the substrate surface. Another method for substrate smoothing is laser or plasma annealing. These techniques melt and reflow a thin surface layer of the glass substrate, removing local defects. The problem is that they induce longer range roughness or ripples in the substrate surface and so do not provide the substrate flatness required for EUV mask blanks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">In view of the need for the increasingly smaller feature size of electronic components, it is increasingly critical that answers be found to these problems. In view of the ever-increasing commercial competitive pressures, along with growing consumer expectations, it is critical that answers be found for these problems. Additionally, the need to reduce costs, improve efficiencies and performance, and meet competitive pressures adds an even greater urgency to the critical necessity for finding answers to these problems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">Solutions to these problems have been long sought but prior developments have not taught or suggested any solutions and, thus, solutions to these problems have long eluded those skilled in the art.</div>

However, it will be apparent that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In order to avoid obscuring the present invention, some well-known circuits, system configurations, and process steps are not disclosed in detail.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">The drawings showing embodiments of the system are semi-diagrammatic and not to scale and, particularly, some of the dimensions are for the clarity of presentation and are shown exaggerated in the drawing FIGs. Similarly, although the views in the drawings for ease of description generally show similar orientations, this depiction in the FIGs. is arbitrary for the most part. Generally, the invention can be operated in any orientation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">Where multiple embodiments are disclosed and described having some features in common, for clarity and ease of illustration, description, and comprehension thereof, similar and like features will be described with similar reference numerals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">For expository purposes, the term “horizontal” as used herein is defined as a plane parallel to the plane or surface of a mask blank, regardless of its orientation. The term “vertical” refers to a direction perpendicular to the horizontal as just defined. Terms, such as “above”, “below”, “bottom”, “top”, “side” (as in “sidewall”), “higher”, “lower”, “upper”, “over”, and “under”, are defined with respect to the horizontal plane, as shown in the figures.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">Embodiments of the present invention use various established techniques for depositing silicon, silicon oxide, and related films of compatible thermal expansion coefficient by CVD, PVD, ALD, and flowable CVD to fill the pits and bury the defects.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, therein is shown an integrated extreme ultraviolet (EUV) mask production system <b>100</b>. The integrated EUV mask production system <b>100</b> includes a mask blank loading and carrier handling system <b>102</b> into which mask blanks <b>104</b> are loaded. An airlock <b>106</b> provides access to a wafer handling vacuum chamber <b>108</b>. In the embodiment shown, the wafer handling vacuum chamber <b>108</b> contains two vacuum chambers, a first vacuum chamber <b>110</b> and a second vacuum chamber <b>112</b>. Within the first vacuum chamber <b>110</b> is a first wafer handling system <b>114</b> and in the second vacuum chamber <b>112</b> is a second wafer handling system <b>116</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">The wafer handling vacuum chamber <b>108</b> has a plurality of ports around its periphery for attachment of various other systems. The first vacuum chamber <b>110</b> has a degas system <b>118</b>, a first physical vapor deposition system <b>120</b>, a second physical vapor deposition system <b>122</b>, and a preclean system <b>124</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">The second vacuum chamber <b>112</b> has a first multi-cathode source <b>126</b>, a flowable chemical vapor deposition (FCVD) system <b>128</b>, a cure system <b>130</b>, and a second multi-cathode source <b>132</b> connected to it.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">The first wafer handling system <b>114</b> is capable of moving wafers, such as a wafer <b>134</b>, among the airlock <b>106</b> and the various systems around the periphery of the first vacuum chamber <b>110</b> and through slit valves in a continuous vacuum. The second wafer handling system <b>116</b> is capable of moving wafers, such as a wafer <b>136</b>, around the second vacuum chamber <b>112</b> while maintaining the wafers in a continuous vacuum.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">It has been discovered that the integrated EUV mask production system <b>100</b> provides the ideal environment for manufacturing EUV mask blanks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, therein is shown a EUV mask blank <b>200</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The EUV mask blank <b>200</b> has an ultra-low thermal expansion substrate <b>202</b> of glass, silicon, or other ultra-low thermal expansion material. The ultra-low thermal expansion materials include fused silica, fused quartz, calcium fluoride, silicon carbide, silicon oxide-titanium oxide alloy, or other material having a thermal coefficient of expansion within the range of these materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">The top surface of the ultra-low thermal expansion substrate <b>202</b> has imperfections <b>203</b>, such as bumps, pits, and particles, which result from chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) with an abrasive. The scratches that are left behind in such a process are sometimes referred to as “pits” and/or “scratch-dig” marks, and their depth and width depend upon the size of the particles in the abrasive used to polish the EUV mask blank <b>200</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">It has been discovered that the pit and scratch imperfections, generally referred to as pits, in the EUV mask blank <b>200</b> can be eliminated by being filled in by deposition of a planarization layer <b>204</b>. The planarization layer <b>204</b>, or flowable film, can be formed by depositing a flowable CVD film or depositing silicon, silicon oxide, or related films by CVD, PVD, or similar processes in the thickness range of 100 Å to 10,000 Å.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">It has been found that the deposition of the film fills in and levels out surface imperfections that are in the surface of the substrate, such as pits having aspect ratios of 1:6 to 30:1 and up to 32 nm deep and 220 nm wide, which would cause problems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">Also, it has been found that other surface imperfections, such as particles, bumps, and other defects that are on the ultra-low thermal expansion substrate <b>202</b>, may be planarized to eliminate any problems they may cause. The planarization layer <b>204</b> can level out a bump or completely encapsulate a particle from 10 nm to 300 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">It has been discovered that the planarization layer <b>204</b> can provide a flat top surface sufficient for EUV applications or a smooth top surface <b>205</b> of the planarization layer <b>204</b> having a greater planarity than the surface with imperfections <b>203</b> under the planarization layer <b>204</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">In the case of flowable CVD films, no further processing may be required to achieve an acceptably smooth, flat surface on the ultra-low thermal expansion substrate <b>202</b> for the EUV mask blank <b>200</b>. For silicon, silicon oxide, or related films, smoothing after deposition may be required. This smoothing can be done by a variety of polishing methods including, but not limited to CMP, chemical polishing, ion beam polishing or annealing. These smoothing techniques can also be applied to the flowable CVD film if further smoothing is required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">It has been discovered that smoothness on the smooth top surface <b>205</b> of the planarization layer <b>204</b> in the present invention can be below 0.5 nm (nanometer) RMS.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">Thus, the planarization layer <b>204</b> can be used for filling pits and/or defects in an underlying layer or substrate, covering particles on top of the underlying layer or substrate, or smoothing an already planarized underlying layer or substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">A multi-layer stack <b>206</b> is formed above the planarization layer <b>204</b> to form a Bragg reflector. Due to the transmissive nature of the optics and illuminating wavelengths used in EUV, reflective optics are used and the multi-layer stack <b>206</b> may be made of alternating layers of high-Z and low-Z materials, such as molybdenum and silicon, which form a reflector.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">A capping layer <b>208</b> is formed above the multi-layer stack <b>206</b>. The capping layer can be a material such as ruthenium (Ru) or a non-oxidized compound thereof to help protect the multi-layer stack <b>206</b> from oxidation and any chemical etchants to which the EUV mask blank <b>200</b> may be exposed during mask processing. Other material such as titanium nitride, boron carbide, silicon nitride, ruthenium oxide, and silicon carbide may also be used in the capping layer <b>208</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">An absorber layer <b>210</b> is placed over the capping layer <b>208</b>. The absorber layer <b>210</b> is of a material having a high absorption coefficient for a particular frequency of EUV light (about 13.5 nm) and may be a material such chromium, tantalum or nitrides thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">An anti-reflective coating (ARC) <b>212</b> is deposited on the absorber layer <b>210</b>. The ARC <b>212</b> can be of a material such as tantalum oxynitride or tantalum boron oxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">A backside chucking layer <b>214</b> is formed on the rear surface of the ultra-low thermal expansion substrate <b>202</b> for chucking the substrate on or with an electrostatic chuck (not shown).</div>

The EUV mask <b>300</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a critical component of the EUV lithography system <b>700</b> and the EUV lithography system <b>700</b> cannot perform its function without an EUV mask on a properly planarized, flat, and smooth EUV blank.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">The first step is to fill any pits that are present; this can be done by depositing a planarization layer, which is a flowable CVD film or by depositing silicon, silicon oxide, or related films via CVD, PVD, or a similar process. This planarization step will also bury particles, bumps, pits, and other defects that are on or in the EUV blank substrate surface. In the case of flowable CVD films, no further processing may be required to achieve an acceptably smooth, flat surface on the EUV blank substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">For the silicon, silicon oxide, or related films smoothing after deposition will likely be required. This smoothing can be done by a variety of polishing methods including, but not limited to CMP, chemical polishing, ion beam polishing, or annealing. These techniques can also be applied to the flowable CVD films if further smoothing is required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">One advantage of this method is that it is substrate independent and so it can be used on a variety of substrates and qualities of substrates. It has the potential to make it possible to use glass substrates that have the required properties for EUV blanks but do not have atomically flat, smooth surfaces after polishing. This independence makes it possible to use different substrate suppliers and minimizes the impact of unexpected changes to the substrate preparation and polishing by the suppliers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">Embodiments of the invention are targeted mainly at providing an atomically flat and smooth substrate surface for the manufacture of EUV mask blanks, but it could be used for any application that requires an atomically flat, smooth surface, such as EUV mirrors <b>608</b>, <b>610</b>, and others.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">Another approach would be to use flat highly thermally conducting surfaces to grow the multilayer stack on. Historically, glass is used as the substrate for masks, due to the transmissive nature of the optics and illuminating wavelengths used. EUV is absorbed by all materials, thus reflective optics is used. However, reflectivity is not 100% (&lt;70% for current Mo/Si stack), and the absorbed part of the radiation will heat up the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">Current mask glass substrate composition is optimized to give zero thermal expansion coefficient, at the operating temperature, to avoid pattern distortion during resist exposure. If substrates more thermally conducting than glass are used, for example metallic or silicon, heat from EUV exposure can be transferred into a cooled chuck thus eliminating the need for a specialized glass. Furthermore, the mask substrate surface can be smoothed using semiconductor compatible processes such as deposition of a layer such as described above (silicon, silicon dioxide) or by CMP or a combination of both.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">The resulting method, process, apparatus, device, product, and/or system is straightforward, cost-effective, uncomplicated, highly versatile, accurate, sensitive, and effective, and can be implemented by adapting known components for ready, efficient, and economical manufacturing, application, and utilization.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">Another important aspect of the present invention is that it valuably supports and services the historical trend of reducing costs, simplifying systems, and increasing performance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">These and other valuable aspects of the present invention consequently further the state of the technology to at least the next level.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">While the invention has been described in conjunction with a specific best mode, it is to be understood that many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the aforegoing description. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications, and variations that fall within the scope of the included claims.
