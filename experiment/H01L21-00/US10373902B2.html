<heading id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure relates to fully molded semiconductor packages, and more particularly to fully molded fan-out miniaturized modules, fully molded fan-out modules (FMFOM), or miniaturized modules (hereinafter “module” or “modules”). The modules can comprise a plurality of integrated semiconductor devices for wearable technology, for the internet-of-things (IoT) devices, or both.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Semiconductor devices are commonly found in modern electronic products. Semiconductor devices vary in the number and density of electrical components. Discrete semiconductor devices generally contain one type of electrical component, for example, light emitting diode (LED), small signal transistor, resistor, capacitor, inductor, and power metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET). Integrated semiconductor devices typically contain hundreds to millions of electrical components. Examples of integrated semiconductor devices include microcontrollers, microprocessors, charged-coupled devices (CCDs), solar cells, and digital micro-mirror devices (DMDs).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Semiconductor devices perform a wide range of functions such as signal processing, high-speed calculations, transmitting and receiving electromagnetic signals, controlling electronic devices, transforming sunlight to electricity, and creating visual projections for television displays. Semiconductor devices are found in the fields of entertainment, communications, power conversion, networks, computers, and consumer products. Semiconductor devices are also found in military applications, aviation, automotive, industrial controllers, and office equipment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Semiconductor devices exploit the electrical properties of semiconductor materials. The atomic structure of semiconductor material allows its electrical conductivity to be manipulated by the application of an electric field or base current or through the process of doping. Doping introduces impurities into the semiconductor material to manipulate and control the conductivity of the semiconductor device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">A semiconductor device contains active and passive electrical structures. Active structures, including bipolar and field effect transistors, control the flow of electrical current. By varying levels of doping and application of an electric field or base current, the transistor either promotes or restricts the flow of electrical current. Passive structures, including resistors, capacitors, and inductors, create a relationship between voltage and current necessary to perform a variety of electrical functions. The passive and active structures are electrically connected to form circuits, which enable the semiconductor device to perform high-speed calculations and other useful functions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Semiconductor devices are generally manufactured using two complex manufacturing processes, that is, front-end manufacturing, and back-end manufacturing, each involving potentially hundreds of steps. Front-end manufacturing involves the formation of a plurality of semiconductor die on the surface of a semiconductor wafer. Each semiconductor die is typically designed to be identical and contains circuits formed by electrically connecting active and passive components. Back-end manufacturing involves singulating individual semiconductor die from the finished wafer and packaging the die to provide structural support and environmental isolation. The term “semiconductor die” as used herein refers to both the singular and plural form of the words, and accordingly can refer to both a single semiconductor device and multiple semiconductor devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">One goal of semiconductor manufacturing is to produce smaller semiconductor devices. Smaller devices typically consume less power, have higher performance, and can be produced more efficiently. In addition, smaller semiconductor devices have a smaller footprint, which is desirable for smaller end products. A smaller semiconductor die size can be achieved by improvements in the front-end process resulting in semiconductor die with smaller, higher density active and passive components. Back-end processes may result in semiconductor device packages with a smaller footprint by improvements in electrical interconnection and packaging materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Back-end processing of semiconductor die includes a number of surface mount technologies (SMT) that are used to connect semiconductor die or integrated circuits to surfaces of substrates and PCBs without the use of through holes in the PCBs. Quad Flat Packages (QFP) use SMT that includes leads that extend from each of the four sides of the package, sometimes referred to as “gull wing leads.” QFP leads provide electrical Input/Output (I/O) interconnection between the semiconductor die within the package and the PCB or substrate to which the QFP is mounted. Other SMT packages are made without leads and are commonly referred to flat no lead packages. Examples of flat no lead packages are Quad-flat no leads packages (QFNs) and dual-flat no lead (DFN) packages. QFN packages conventionally include a semiconductor die connected by wirebonds to a leadframe that is used for package I/O interconnection.</div>

Accordingly, the disclosed subject matter is intended to embrace all such alterations, modifications and variations that fall within the spirit and scope of the disclosure and the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">Semiconductor devices are generally manufactured using two complex manufacturing processes: front-end manufacturing and back-end manufacturing. Front-end manufacturing involves the formation of a plurality of die on the surface of a semiconductor wafer. Each die on the wafer contains active and passive electrical components, which are electrically connected to form functional electrical circuits. Active electrical components, such as transistors and diodes, have the ability to control the flow of electrical current. Passive electrical components, such as capacitors, inductors, resistors, and transformers, create a relationship between voltage and current necessary to perform electrical circuit functions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">Passive and active components are formed over the surface of the semiconductor wafer by a series of process steps including doping, deposition, photolithography, etching, and planarization. Doping introduces impurities into the semiconductor material by techniques such as ion implantation or thermal diffusion. The doping process modifies the electrical conductivity of semiconductor material in active devices, transforming the semiconductor material into an insulator, conductor, or dynamically changing the semiconductor material conductivity in response to an electric field or base current. Transistors contain regions of varying types and degrees of doping arranged as necessary to enable the transistor to promote or restrict the flow of electrical current upon the application of the electric field or base current.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">Active and passive components are formed by layers of materials with different electrical properties. The layers can be formed by a variety of deposition techniques determined in part by the type of material being deposited. For example, thin film deposition can involve chemical vapor deposition (CVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), electrolytic plating, and electroless plating processes. Each layer is generally patterned to form portions of active components, passive components, or electrical connections between components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">The layers can be patterned using photolithography, which involves the deposition of light sensitive material, e.g., photoresist, over the layer to be patterned. A pattern is transferred from a photomask to the photoresist using light. In one embodiment, the portion of the photoresist pattern subjected to light is removed using a solvent, exposing portions of the underlying layer to be patterned. In another embodiment, the portion of the photoresist pattern not subjected to light, the negative photoresist, is removed using a solvent, exposing portions of the underlying layer to be patterned. The remainder of the photoresist is removed, leaving behind a patterned layer. Alternatively, some types of materials are patterned by directly depositing the material into the areas or voids formed by a previous deposition/etch process using techniques such as electroless and electrolytic plating.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">Patterning is the basic operation by which portions of the top layers on the semiconductor wafer surface are removed. Portions of the semiconductor wafer can be removed using photolithography, photomasking, masking, oxide or metal removal, photography and stenciling, and microlithography. Photolithography includes forming a pattern in reticles or a photomask and transferring the pattern into the surface layers of the semiconductor wafer. Photolithography forms the horizontal dimensions of active and passive components on the surface of the semiconductor wafer in a two-step process. First, the pattern on the reticle or masks is transferred into a layer of photoresist. Photoresist is a light-sensitive material that undergoes changes in structure and properties when exposed to light. The process of changing the structure and properties of the photoresist occurs as either negative-acting photoresist or positive-acting photoresist. Second, the photoresist layer is transferred into the wafer surface. The transfer occurs when etching removes the portion of the top layers of semiconductor wafer not covered by the photoresist. The chemistry of photoresists is such that the photoresist remains substantially intact and resists removal by chemical etching solutions while the portion of the top layers of the semiconductor wafer not covered by the photoresist is removed. The process of forming, exposing, and removing the photoresist, as well as the process of removing a portion of the semiconductor wafer can be modified according to the particular resist used and the desired results.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">In negative-acting photoresists, photoresist is exposed to light and is changed from a soluble condition to an insoluble condition in a process known as polymerization. In polymerization, unpolymerized material is exposed to a light or energy source and polymers form a cross-linked material that is etch-resistant. In most negative resists, the polymers are polyisopremes. Removing the soluble portions (i.e. the portions not exposed to light) with chemical solvents or developers leaves a hole in the resist layer that corresponds to the opaque pattern on the reticle. A mask whose pattern exists in the opaque regions is called a clear-field mask.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">In positive-acting photoresists, photoresist is exposed to light and is changed from relatively nonsoluble condition to much more soluble condition in a process known as photosolubilization. In photosolubilization, the relatively insoluble resist is exposed to the proper light energy and is converted to a more soluble state. The photosolubilized part of the resist can be removed by a solvent in the development process. The basic positive photoresist polymer is the phenol-formaldehyde polymer, also called the phenol-formaldehyde novolak resin. Removing the soluble portions (i.e. the portions exposed to light) with chemical solvents or developers leaves a hole in the resist layer that corresponds to the transparent pattern on the reticle. A mask whose pattern exists in the transparent regions is called a dark-field mask.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">After removal of the top portion of the semiconductor wafer not covered by the photoresist, the remainder of the photoresist is removed, leaving behind a patterned layer. Alternatively, some types of materials are patterned by directly depositing the material into the areas or voids formed by a previous deposition/etch process using techniques such as electroless and electrolytic plating.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">Depositing a thin film of material over an existing pattern can exaggerate the underlying pattern and create a non-uniformly flat surface. A uniformly flat surface can be beneficial or required to produce smaller and more densely packed active and passive components. Planarization can be used to remove material from the surface of the wafer and produce a uniformly flat surface. Planarization involves polishing the surface of the wafer with a polishing pad. An abrasive material and corrosive chemical are added to the surface of the wafer during polishing. Alternatively, mechanical abrasion without the use of corrosive chemicals is used for planarization. In some embodiments, purely mechanical abrasion is achieved by using a belt grinding machine, a standard wafer backgrinder, or other similar machine. The combined mechanical action of the abrasive and corrosive action of the chemical removes any irregular topography, resulting in a uniformly flat surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">Back-end manufacturing refers to cutting or singulating the finished wafer into the individual semiconductor die and then packaging the semiconductor die for structural support and environmental isolation. To singulate the semiconductor die, the wafer can be cut along non-functional regions of the wafer called saw streets or scribes. The wafer is singulated using a laser cutting tool or saw blade. After singulation, the individual semiconductor die are mounted to a package substrate that includes pins or contact pads for interconnection with other system components. Contact pads formed over the semiconductor die are then connected to contact pads within the package. The electrical connections can be made with solder bumps, stud bumps, conductive paste, redistribution layers, or wirebonds. An encapsulant or other molding material is deposited over the package to provide physical support and electrical isolation. The finished package is then inserted into an electrical system and the functionality of the semiconductor device is made available to the other system components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">The electrical system can be a stand-alone system that uses the semiconductor device to perform one or more electrical functions. Alternatively, the electrical system can be a subcomponent of a larger system. For example, the electrical system can be part of a cellular phone, personal digital assistant (PDA), digital video camera (DVC), or other electronic communication device. Alternatively, the electrical system can be a graphics card, network interface card, or other signal processing card that can be inserted into a computer. The semiconductor package can include microprocessors, memories, application specific integrated circuits (ASIC), logic circuits, analog circuits, radio frequency (RF) circuits, discrete devices, or other semiconductor die or electrical components. Miniaturization and weight reduction can be beneficial or essential for the products to be accepted by the market. The distance between semiconductor devices must be decreased to achieve higher density.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">By combining one or more semiconductor packages over a single substrate, manufacturers can incorporate pre-made components into electronic devices and systems. Because the semiconductor packages include sophisticated functionality, electronic devices can be manufactured using less expensive components and a streamlined manufacturing process. The resulting devices are less likely to fail and less expensive to manufacture resulting in a lower cost for consumers.</div>

The SMD components <b>90</b> can comprise a variety of semiconductor die, wafer level chip scale packages (WLCSPs), or ICs <b>92</b>, surface mount devices or active devices <b>94</b>, and passive devices <b>96</b> including solderable passives such as resistors or capacitors, as well as other components, which can be mounted to the first embedded portion <b>60</b> and adapted or configured to be in electrical communication with the semiconductor die <b>14</b> or other devices embedded within the first embedded portion <b>60</b>. By being directly mounted or connected to the first embedded portion <b>60</b>, the SMD components <b>90</b> need not be mounted to, or have signals routed through, a PCB or other substrate before arriving at the first embedded portion <b>60</b>. Instead, a compact semiconductor module <b>100</b> can be created that eliminates a need for a PCB or substrate to be used in interconnecting the various SMD components with the first embedded portion <b>60</b>. Improved integration and reduced size of the semiconductor module <b>100</b> is well suited for miniature electronic systems such as smart watches and other IoT devices that require the smallest possible form factor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">The SMT <b>97</b> used to electrically couple the SMD components <b>90</b> to SMD land pads or flex connect <b>86</b> can include solder, solder paste, solder bumps, bumps, or balls. As indicated above, the solderable land-pads or flex connect <b>86</b> for SMT <b>97</b> can be formed as part of, or formed over and coupled to, the build-up interconnect structure <b>70</b> and multi-layer routing of conductive layers <b>74</b>, <b>78</b>, <b>82</b>, to allow for large variation in a size of SMT <b>97</b>. In some instances, the SMD components <b>90</b> being electrically coupled to the SMD land pads further comprise the SMD components <b>90</b> comprising solderable terminations <b>91</b>, solder paste <b>97</b> disposed over the SMD land pads <b>86</b>, and the solderable terminations <b>91</b> being disposed over, and electrically coupled to, the SMD land pads <b>86</b> while the solderable terminations <b>91</b> are in contact with the solder paste <b>97</b>. Similarly, in some instances at least one of the SMD components <b>90</b> coupled to the land pads <b>86</b> will be coupled with solder bumps <b>97</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">When the SMT <b>97</b> comprises solder, the solder can be placed on SMD land pads <b>86</b> to facilitate electrical communication between the SMDs <b>90</b> and the build-up interconnect structure <b>70</b> as well as the first embedded portion <b>60</b>. The solder can comprise Al, Sn, Ni, Au, Ag, Pb, Bi, Cu, solder, and combinations thereof, with an optional flux solution. For example, the solder can be eutectic Sn/Pb, high-lead solder, or lead-free solder. The solder can be deposited over the first embedded portion <b>60</b> and on the SMD land pads <b>68</b> using evaporation, electrolytic plating, electroless plating, ball drop, or screen printing process. In some embodiments, the solder is Sn solder paste that is deposited using screen printing. After the SMDs <b>90</b> are coupled to the first embedded portion <b>60</b> with the solder, the solder can undergo a reflow process or be reflowed to improve electrical contact between the SMDs <b>90</b> and the SMD land pads <b>58</b> or the first embedded portion <b>60</b>. After reflow, the embedded die panel <b>58</b> or first embedded portion <b>60</b> and SMDs <b>90</b> can optionally undergo one or more of an aqueous clean, an automated optical inspection (AOI), and a plasma clean.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2I</figref> shows that after the of SMD components <b>90</b> are mounted to the embedded die panel <b>58</b>, the embedded die panel <b>58</b> can be cut or singulated through the saw streets <b>66</b> with the saw blade or laser cutting tool <b>98</b> to form semiconductor modules, modules, or semiconductor die modules <b>100</b>. The semiconductor modules <b>100</b> can comprise a plurality of fully molded or encapsulated semiconductor die <b>14</b>, and passives <b>96</b> together with other SMD components <b>90</b>, that can be in face up positions, face down positions, or both. Thus, the semiconductor module <b>100</b> can be formed as a compact module that eliminates a need for a PCB or other substrate to be used in interconnecting the various SMD components with the first embedded portion <b>60</b>. Improved integration and reduced size of the semiconductor module <b>100</b> is well suited for miniature electronic systems such as smart watches and other IoT devices that require the smallest possible form factor. In some instances, an overall size or overall dimensions of the singulated semiconductor modules <b>100</b> can comprise heights that are reduced by 10%, 20%, 30% or more from more conventional packages in which PCBs or other substrates are used for the interconnection of components on opposing sides of the packages, such as semiconductor die <b>14</b>, and components <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>, and <b>96</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">In addition to providing a benefit of compact size, the module <b>100</b> can also provide improved strength due to a robust design. For example, the semiconductor module <b>100</b> can comprise at least one of the SMD components <b>90</b> being partially within a footprint of one of the semiconductor die <b>14</b> and partially without a footprint of the semiconductor die <b>14</b>. Additionally, at least one of the SMD land pads <b>86</b> can be positioned over an edge of the footprint of the semiconductor die <b>14</b> within the fully molded base portion <b>60</b>. The addition of mold compound <b>42</b> over the face or active surface <b>18</b> of the semiconductor die <b>14</b> and over an edge <b>17</b> of the semiconductor die <b>14</b> can improve mechanical performance of the semiconductor module <b>100</b>. In particular, in designs that comprise a SMD land pad <b>86</b> positioned over the edge <b>17</b> of the semiconductor die <b>14</b>, the fully molded base portion <b>60</b> provides a planar second surface <b>56</b> that is mechanically isolated from the topography of the edge <b>17</b> of the semiconductor die <b>14</b>. By contrast, if a face down fan-out structure were built with a fan-out structure being build-up under a semiconductor die, a SMD component could be partially mechanically coupled to the semiconductor die and partially coupled to mold compound, which could result in higher thermo-mechanical stress on a solder joint, resulting in solder joint failure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">In some instances, the build-up interconnect structure <b>70</b> can be built or formed using unit specific patterning.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">As such, a number of advantages can be provided or facilitated by the modules <b>100</b>, <b>110</b>, and <b>114</b>, an exemplary and non-limiting listing of which includes: improved control of contact resistance to contact pads <b>22</b> on the semiconductor die <b>14</b>, improved RF performance of the modules <b>110</b>, <b>110</b>, and <b>114</b>, improved thermal performance and power distribution of the modules, improved mechanical reliability of the modules, a planar surface for fine pitch lithography for the build-up interconnect structure <b>70</b>, mold compound <b>42</b> replacing the first fan-out dielectric layer, a high contrast surface between encapsulant <b>42</b> and conductive interconnects <b>28</b> for optical die position measurement, a fully protected semiconductor die <b>14</b> edge for low-k devices, and a planar surface with low panel warpage that simplifies SMT assembly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">Improved control of contact resistance to contact pads <b>22</b>, such as Al contact pads <b>22</b>, on the semiconductor die <b>14</b> can be provided. Improvement is with respect to face down wafer-level fan-out structures (WLFO) structures, such as eWLB, that typically require sputtering a barrier and seed layer to the plastic panel or molding compound in order to make contact to the Al bond pads or contact pads on the semiconductor die in order to prevent formation of aluminum oxide. Plastic panels or plastic wafers can be problematic in sputter deposition of barrier layers, such as Ti or TiW barrier layers, because plastic tends to out-gas, and trace amounts of oxygen present during the sputter etch and before seed layer deposition can form a few angstroms of aluminum oxide on the contact pads, resulting in high contact resistance, which can impede performance of the semiconductor die. Managing or preventing the formation of aluminum oxide can be accomplished through things like storing the panels in nitrogen before sputter, extended degas time in the sputter tool, extended pump down time to ensure a very low base pressure in the etch chamber, or through other suitable processes. In the fully molded structure of the first embedded portion <b>60</b> of the modules <b>100</b>, <b>110</b>, or <b>114</b>, electrical interconnects <b>28</b> can be positioned within the encapsulant <b>42</b> to provide superior contact resistance with respect to Al or other contact pads <b>22</b> by applying Cu or other conductive interconnects <b>28</b> to the Si or native wafer <b>10</b> just like you would do in a flip-chip bump or wafer WLP process. As a result, the contact pads <b>22</b> of the semiconductor die <b>14</b> are protected by the molded or encased bond between the electrical interconnect <b>28</b> and the contact pad <b>22</b> so that the process risk (exposure and oxidation) is far lower for the embedded die panel <b>58</b> or first embedded portion <b>60</b> compared to face down fan-out structures without pillars, posts, or studs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">Improved RF performance for the modules <b>100</b>, <b>110</b>, or <b>114</b> can also be available with the layer of mold compound <b>42</b> disposed over the active surface <b>20</b> of the semiconductor die <b>14</b> and around the electrical interconnects <b>28</b> that can create an offset or gap of about 10-100 μm, 20-50 μm, or 30 μm (plus or minus 5 μm) between the active surface <b>20</b> of the semiconductor die <b>14</b> and the build-up interconnect structure <b>70</b>, high density multilayer routing layer, or fan-out RDL layer. The additional offset can provide a buffer or space that facilitates desirable performance of features such inductors with a higher quality factor (Q).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">Improved thermal performance and power distribution is also available for the modules <b>100</b>, <b>110</b>, and <b>114</b>, which can be achieved by forming the conductive interconnects <b>28</b> of any size or shape. For example, the conductive interconnects <b>28</b> can be formed with small fine pitch Cu studs, with large Cu studs, and can further comprise power or ground planes formed on the same semiconductor die <b>14</b>. Because the conductive interconnects <b>28</b> can be planarized after placing mold compound <b>42</b> over the front side <b>20</b> of the face up semiconductor die <b>14</b>, concerns with bump height uniformity are reduced or eliminated even with large variations in bump size or size of conductive interconnects <b>28</b> coupled to the semiconductor die <b>14</b>. With little or no concern with respect to bump size uniformity, large areas of conductive interconnects, including Cu interconnects can be used to more effectively distribute power to the semiconductor die <b>14</b>. In some instance, planes of thick Cu can be created as part of, or as one or more, conductive interconnects <b>28</b>, to improve thermal performance. Additionally, the thickness of the Cu layer can be modulated to tailor performance for different applications. The above advantages can be achieved relative to any “chips last” or flip-chip type structure in which all the solder bumps or conductive interconnects need to have an identical, same, or substantially similar size and shape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">Improved mechanical reliability for the modules <b>100</b>, <b>110</b>, and <b>114</b> is also available through the addition of mold compound <b>42</b> over the face or active surface <b>20</b> of the semiconductor die <b>14</b> and over and around die edges <b>17</b>. In particular, in designs that have SMD land pads <b>86</b> positioned over the edge <b>17</b> of the semiconductor die <b>14</b>, the fully molded structure or first embedded portion <b>60</b> can provide a planar surface mechanically isolated from the topography of the semiconductor die edge <b>17</b>. In face down fan-out structures the fan-out build-up under the SMD component can be at least partially mechanically coupled to the semiconductor die and partially mechanically coupled to the mold compound, which can result in higher thermo-mechanical stress on interconnections, such as solder joints, resulting in solder joint failures or other failures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">Improvements with the modules <b>100</b>, <b>110</b>, and <b>114</b> can further comprise a planar surface for fine pitch lithography, which can be present because when the embedded die panel <b>58</b> is planarized after molding, facilitating fine pitch lithography, such as with formation of the build-up interconnect structure <b>70</b>, with small depth of field in exposure. In addition, the first layer of the build-up interconnect structure <b>70</b>, whether a dielectric layer like insulating layer <b>72</b> or a metal layer like conductive layer <b>74</b>, can be formed over the single mold compound <b>42</b> with coplanar exposed surfaces or ends of conductive interconnects <b>28</b>. The above improvement is in contrast with respect to face down fan-out or embedded die in substrate structures in which the first layer is formed over more than one base material, such as a semiconductor die and an encapsulant around the semiconductor die. As such, feature size is limited only by the capabilities of the lithography tool, which can now be in a range of about 2-5 μm line and space (or 4-10 μm pitch), or less, with a road map. A thinner photo-polymer layer can be applied to the panel since there is no die edge topography as there is in face down structures. With the planar face up structure there is no problem running very fine traces across the die edge.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">Improvements with the modules <b>100</b>, <b>110</b>, and <b>114</b> can also comprise the mold compound <b>42</b> replacing the first fan-out dielectric layer, such as insulating layer <b>72</b>, so that the first conductive layer <b>74</b> is placed in direct contact with the encapsulant <b>42</b>. Omitting the first fan-out dielectric layer and applying the fan-out RDL <b>74</b> directly to the embedded die panel <b>58</b> can reduce cost, which can be of benefit for smaller parts with low interconnect density.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">Within embedded die panel <b>58</b>, a high contrast surface for optical measurement of position of semiconductor die <b>14</b> with respect to the encapsulant <b>42</b> is also made available. The fully molded structure is advantageous in the inspection process since it creates a very high contrast surface for inspection, which can include, e.g., Cu bumps appearing white against a black background. The encapsulant <b>42</b> over the active surface <b>20</b> of the semiconductor die <b>14</b> removes from the optical inspection process the distracting features present at the active surface <b>20</b> that could slow or complicate inspection. As such, the high contrast image produced by the current design allows for a very fast and reliable scan, which reduces the cost.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">Improvements with the modules <b>100</b>, <b>110</b>, and <b>114</b> also allow for fully protected die edges <b>17</b> for low-k devices. Low-k devices often require a laser groove being formed before dicing of the semiconductor die, which creates additional topography at the die edge. The laser groove before dicing is an additional process step that increases time and expense, but is often required to prevent a particular failure mode. The particular failure mode occurs in face down structures, that might have test pads in a saw street be lifted or moved during singulation such that the lifted pad, which is conductive, will contact or short an RDL or interconnect structure when a thinner photo-polymer layer is used. The current modules <b>100</b>, <b>110</b>, and <b>114</b> allow for fully encapsulating the sensitive die edge structure with a single mold compound <b>42</b> rather than forming a mold compound to photo-polymer interface at or near the edge of the low-k device structure in order to avoid lifted structures and prevent shorts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">Improvements with the modules <b>100</b>, <b>110</b>, and <b>114</b> also allow for a planar surface with low warpage of embedded die panel <b>58</b> that simplifies SMD and SMT assembly. The structure of modules <b>100</b>, <b>110</b>, and <b>114</b> can be balanced with portions or layers of encapsulants <b>42</b> of similar thickness and material properties being disposed on the top and bottom of semiconductor die <b>14</b>. Therefore, the stresses induced by the CTE mismatch between the semiconductor die <b>14</b> and the encapsulant <b>42</b> can be substantially balanced on both sides of the semiconductor die <b>14</b>. The embedded die panel <b>58</b> can therefore remains relatively flat during the SMT processes and the mounding of SMD components <b>90</b>, which can include placement of components at room temperature followed by reflow of solder at an elevated temperature in excess of 230 degrees Celsius.</div>
