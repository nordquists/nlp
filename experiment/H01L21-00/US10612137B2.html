<heading id="h-0001">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure generally relates to processes for manufacturing electronic devices. More particularly, the disclosure relates to selectively forming films through cyclic processes such as ALD or sequential/cyclic CVD. Specifically, the disclosure discloses methods to selectively form ALD or sequential/cyclic CVD films with organic reactants.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Water (H<sub>2</sub>O) has been often used for forming oxides in atomic layer deposition (ALD) processes. Water is a polar molecule due to its lone electron pair. Water is also reactive with many metal halides, which makes it a candidate for some ALD oxide processes. When used as a reactant at low temperatures, however, water has displayed some undesirable behavior.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Most notably, the presence of water as a reactant increases the time to sufficiently purge the tool during an ALD deposition cycle. Specifically, at low temperatures, water tends to stick to various surfaces, including substrates and tools with hydrophilic materials. The sticking of water may make it difficult to purge water from the system and it may cause loss of selectivity if water-based processes are applied on selective deposition schemes. In addition, the nature of water may oxidize some of the surfaces present on the substrate, which in some instances is not desirable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Prior approaches have described using carboxylic acids for ALD of some metal oxides. However, these have not enabled selective deposition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">As a result, a method for ALD formation of a film that displays efficient purging and effective modification of the surface is desired.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with at least one embodiment of the invention, a method of selectively forming a metal oxide is disclosed. The method comprises: providing a substrate comprising a dielectric layer and a layer comprising metal for processing in a reaction chamber; exposing the substrate to a metal or semi-metal precursor; exposing the substrate to a purging gas and/or a vacuum; exposing the substrate to an organic reactant; and exposing the substrate to a purging gas and/or the vacuum; wherein a reaction between the metal or semi-metal precursor and the organic reactant selectively forms a metal oxide layer on either the dielectric layer or layer comprising metal. In some embodiments the method of selectively forming a metal oxide comprises a cyclic process using a metal or semi-metal precursor and an organic reactant. In some embodiments the method of selectively forming a metal oxide using a metal or semi-metal precursor and an organic reactant comprises an ALD process. In some embodiments the method of selectively forming a metal oxide process using a metal or semi-metal precursor and an organic reactant comprises a cyclic or sequential CVD process using a metal or semi-metal precursor and an organic reactant. In some embodiments utilizing the cyclic or sequential CVD process, the metal or semi-metal precursor is partly decomposing on the surface. In some embodiments utilizing the cyclic or sequential CVD process, gas-phase reactions of the metal or semi-metal precursor and the organic reactant are substantially avoided. In accordance with exemplary aspects of these embodiments, the selective formation of the metal oxide layer occurs with use of an etchant before and/or after the formation of the metal oxide layer.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">Although certain embodiments and examples are disclosed below, it will be understood by those in the art that the invention extends beyond the specifically disclosed embodiments and/or uses of the invention and obvious modifications and equivalents thereof. Thus, it is intended that the scope of the invention disclosed should not be limited by the particular disclosed embodiments described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">For selective deposition processes, efficient purging is desirable. Efficient purging may allow for selectivity to take place, as the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) type of gas phase reactions are significantly reduced or absent. Additionally, it is generally desirable for selectivity to have surfaces present with only desired reactivity towards the deposition chemistry. For example, for some surfaces no reaction with the precursors (or reactants) is desired, and for other surfaces quick and complete reactions with the precursors (or reactants) are desired. If not present naturally, surfaces may be modified to exhibit the desired reactivity. For example, some surfaces can be treated to slow down the rate or completely inhibit a certain type of reaction. Surface modifications may be employed when using precursors (or reactants) with undesired reactivity towards a surface present in the system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">When using water as a reactant, the above goal of efficient purging is difficult to achieve. Water molecules are said to be polar because they exhibit an external dipole moment. This causes water to stick easily on surfaces. If water is used in selective deposition schemes, surface modifications may be used to passivate the surfaces against water. One example of such a passivation may include fluorinated or highly methyl covered surfaces, exhibiting high water contact angle. Water contact angle is a measure of the surface energy towards water. Surfaces with high water contact angle are typically passive against water. Additionally, the nature of water makes achieving only the right kind of surface reactivity more difficult, possibly resulting in a desire for surface modifications to protect a formed material, for example. Especially at temperature ranges of 100-150° C., water may prove to be problematic to remove at time scales suitable for production, due to the extended periods of time used to fully purge the water from the system and all the surfaces. Such temperatures may be encountered in many parts of a film deposition tool, outside the film deposition region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">Organic reactants, such as formic acid (HCOOH) or other carboxylic acids, may prove to be a better choice for ALD processes due to their properties. Specifically, organic reactants are not generally polar substances that stick to surfaces. In addition, organic reactants have a different nature when compared to water. Specifically, HCOOH may be able to produce reductive reactions. Additionally, organic reactants such as HCOOH begin decomposing at elevated temperatures and do not liberate H<sub>2</sub>O at 100-150° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, the organic reactant is a vapor phase organic reactant that may demonstrate thermal stability within a range of process temperatures. For example, the vapor phase organic reactant may be thermally stable across a desired range of process temperatures such that growth-disturbing condensable phases do not form on the substrate and/or the vapor phase organic reactant does not generate harmful levels of impurities on the substrate surface through thermal decomposition. In some embodiments, the vapor phase organic reactant may exhibit sufficient vapor pressure such that a desired quantity of chemical molecules is present in the gas phase near the substrate surface to enable the reduction reactions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments, a vapor phase organic reactant may be selected based on its ability to decompose into two or more reactive components, at least one of which can react with the surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, the vapor phase organic reactant may comprise formic acid. In some embodiments, the vapor phase organic reactant may comprise acetic acid (CH<sub>3</sub>COOH) and/or propanoic acid (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>COOH). In some embodiments, the (e.g., vapor phase) organic reactant may include an alcohol. In some embodiments, the (e.g., vapor phase) organic reactant may include an aldehyde. In some embodiments, the (e.g., vapor phase) organic reactant may have at least one functional group selected from the group consisting of alcohol (—OH), aldehyde (—CHO), and carboxylic acid (—COOH).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">Without being limited by any particular theory or mode of operation, the process for depositing metal oxide films selectively using organic reactants may also reduce the metal or metal oxide surfaces present on the substrate. For example, the carboxylic acid may reduce oxidized copper such that the oxidized copper may be restored to its elemental state. In some embodiments, the organic reactant, when used as oxygen source, may keep the metal surface as elemental metal or metallic or conductive state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">Organic reactants containing at least one alcohol group may be preferably selected from the group consisting of primary alcohols, secondary alcohols, tertiary alcohols, polyhydroxy alcohols, cyclic alcohols, aromatic alcohols, and other derivatives of alcohols.</div>

wherein each R<sup>1 </sup>is selected independently from the group of linear or branched C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>20 </sub>alkyl and alkenyl groups, preferably methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl or hexyl groups. An example of a preferred tertiary alcohol is tert-butanol.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">Preferred polyhydroxy alcohols, such as diols and triols, have primary, secondary and/or tertiary alcohol groups as described above. Examples of preferred polyhydroxy alcohol are ethylene glycol and glycerol.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">Preferred cyclic alcohols have an —OH group attached to at least one carbon atom which is part of a ring of 1 to 10, more preferably 5-6 carbon atoms.</div>

wherein R<sup>3 </sup>is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and linear or branched C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>20 </sub>alkyl and alkenyl groups, preferably methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl or hexyl groups.

</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, the organic reactant demonstrates desired vapor pressure such that the organic reactant may be volatized without heating the organic reactant. In some embodiments, such an organic reactant may comprise only one carboxyl group (—COOH).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments, the organic reactant may be heated to volatize the organic reactant prior to delivering the volatized organic reactant to the substrate surface. In some embodiments, such an organic reactant may comprise a dicarboxylic acid, including an oxalic acid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, the organic reactant may comprise less than about 15 weight % water (H<sub>2</sub>O). In some embodiments, the organic reactant may comprise less than about 5 weight % water, less than about 2 weight % or less than about 1 weight %. For example, the organic reactant may comprise less than about 0.5, less than about 0.1, or less than about 0.05 weight % water. In some embodiments, the organic reactant may not comprise metal. In some embodiments, the organic reactant may comprise only carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">As described herein, an organic reactant may decompose into two or more reactive components during the deposition. For example, some of the carboxylic acid delivered to a reaction space may decompose into carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen gas (H<sub>z</sub>) during the deposition process, such that one or more of the carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>) may help keep metal or metallic surfaces in its original state, i.e., prevent oxidation of the metal or metallic surfaces, or reduce them to elemental or metallic state. In this way, a substrate surface may be exposed to hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>) even though no hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>) is actively provided into the reaction space from an external source.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, the organic reactant may be stored in a liquid phase and subsequently volatized prior to being delivered to the substrate surface. In some embodiments, the organic reactant may be in vapor phase in the reaction space, such that the reaction space is substantially free of any liquid phase reactants. For example, the organic reactant may be in liquid phase during storage and may be subsequently volatized prior to delivery into a reaction chamber, such that only or substantially only organic reactant in the vapor phase is present within the reaction chamber.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, an organic reactant may be stored in a gas bubbler and can be supplied to the reaction chamber from the gas bubbler. In some embodiments, the organic reactant may be stored in a gas bubbler at around room temperature (e.g., from about 20° C. to about 25° C.). For example, the organic reactant gas may be pulsed into the reaction chamber from the gas bubbler during a cycle of the deposition process. In some embodiments, a mass flow rate of the organic reactant may be controlled by controlling the extent to which a valve for delivering the organic reactant into the reactor chamber is kept open (e.g., a needle valve). For example, a mass flow rate may be selected such that a quantity of the organic reactant may be flowed into the reaction chamber during a cycle of the deposition process to facilitate metal surface reduction or protecting the metal surface from being oxidized or facilitate increased selectivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">Embodiments of the invention may be directed to selectively deposit metal or semi-metal oxide film using an organic reactant source on micrometer-scale (or smaller) features during integrated circuit fabrication. For example, process flows described herein may be used to manufacture features having a size less than 100 micrometers, less than 1 micrometer, or less than 200 nm. In the case of selective deposition of tungsten on copper for interconnects, the size of the feature or line width may be less than 1 micrometer, less than 200 nm, less than 100 nm, or less than 50 nm. One of ordinary skill in the art may recognize that selective deposition on larger features and in other contexts is possible using the disclosed methods.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">As mentioned above, the selectivity may be expressed as the ratio of material formed on the first surface (A) minus the amount of material formed on the second surface (B) to amount of material formed on the first surface (A) (i.e., selectivity can be given as a percentage calculated by [(deposition on first surface)−(deposition on second surface)]/(deposition on the first surface) or [(A−B)/A]). Preferably, the selectivity is above about 70%, above about 80%, more preferably above 90%, even more preferably above 95%, or most preferably about 100%. In some cases, selectivity above 80% may be acceptable for certain applications. In some cases, selectivity above 50% may be acceptable for certain applications. In some embodiments, the deposition temperature may be selected such that the selectivity is above about 90%. In some embodiments, the deposition temperature may be selected such that a selectivity of about 100% is achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, the thickness of the film that is selectively deposited may be less than about 100 nm, less than about 50 nm, about 25 nm or less than about 10 nm, in some embodiments, from about 0.5 nm to about 100 nm or from about 1 nm to about 50 nm. However, in some cases a desired level of selectivity, for example more than 50%, more preferably more than 80%, is achieved with the thicknesses of the selectively deposited film being over about 2.5 nm, about 5 nm, over about 10 nm, over about 25 nm or over about 50 nm.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">The ALD method <b>200</b> may also include a step of pulsing an organic reactant <b>230</b>. Organic reactant may include formic acid (HCOOH), any simple carboxylic acid, or any precursor that might decompose into CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, or any other by-product species, and H<sub>2</sub>O, or any other organic precursor noted herein. For example, a step <b>230</b> pulsing formic acid (and/or another organic reactant) may use a purity of organic reactant, such as formic acid and/or other organic reactant of at least 90%, more preferably at least 95%, and more preferably at least 98%, in order to obtain a properly deposited layer. The pulse step <b>230</b> may take place for a time duration ranging between 0.01 and 60 seconds, from about 0.1 to about 30 seconds or from about 0.2 to about 10 seconds at a temperature range ranging between about 0 to about 750° C., from about 50 to about 500 C or from about 150 and 350° C. Step <b>230</b> may then be followed by a purge step <b>240</b>, which would remove any excess organic reactant(s). The steps of the ALD method <b>200</b> may be repeated to form an oxide layer of a desired thickness. In some embodiments, the purge step of the organic reactant(s) may be less than about 10 seconds, less than about 5 seconds, less than about 2 seconds, less than about 1 second, less than about 0.5 seconds while still retaining selective deposition. In some embodiments, the same degree of selectivity may not be retained if a water or other oxygen source than an organic reactant is used. While the exemplary pulse and purge times mentioned above may be applicable to many different types of reactors, single wafer, or mini-batch reactors, pulse and purge times may be higher in case of batch reactors with high surface areas. Any of the purge steps as discussed herein can use an inert gas, such nitrogen and/or a noble gas, such as argon and/or helium.</div>

As a result, for example, a metal oxide film can be formed on the dielectric material, while the metal surface can remain uncovered or vice versa. In addition, there may be more efficient purging of the carboxylic acid or other organic reactant due to its lower polarity in comparison to water. The use of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) or oxygen plasma or oxygen atoms or oxygen radicals may be avoided due to its tendency to oxidize metals or metallic materials or surfaces easily as well as destroying the selectivity. In some embodiments, plasma may not be used in the deposition process.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">The ALD method <b>300</b> may modify the metal surface of the substrate. For example, the carboxylic acid (or other organic reactant) may reduce a metallic surface or elemental metal, such as copper oxide (CuO), surface to metallic or elemental metal, such as elemental copper. In addition, the carboxylic acid may remove any remaining passivation layer on the metal surface, such as benzotriazole (BTA). Both of these effects are benefits because removal of the passivation layer or reduction to straight copper may both be capable of enabling selective growth.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">Quality of the metal oxide layer deposited through either ALD method <b>200</b> or ALD method <b>300</b> may be judged by a selectivity of a surface of the metal oxide layer.
