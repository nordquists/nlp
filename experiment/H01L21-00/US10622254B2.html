<div class="abstract" id="p-0001" num="0000">An object is irradiated with a laser light modulated by a reflection type spatial light modulator such that aberration of the laser light converged inside the object becomes a predetermined aberration or less. Therefore, aberration of the laser light generated at a position on which a converging point of the laser light is located is made as small as possible, to enhance the energy density of the laser light at that position, which makes it possible to form a modified region with a high function as a starting point for cutting. In addition, because the reflection type spatial light modulator is used, it is possible to improve the utilization efficiency of the laser light as compared with a transmissive type spatial light modulator.</div>

<heading id="h-0004">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0008">Meanwhile, in a technology of irradiating a plate-shaped object to be processed with a laser light while locating a converging point within the object, so as to form a modified region along a line to cut, a modified region with a low function as a starting point for cutting (for example, it is difficult to generate break) depending on a working condition such as a distance from a laser light entrance surface of the object in some cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0009">Then, the present invention has been achieved in consideration of such circumstances, and an object of the present invention is to provide a laser working method capable of reliably forming a modified region serving as a starting point for cutting, and a laser working apparatus and its manufacturing method.</div>
<heading id="h-0005">Means for Solving the Problems</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0010">In order to attain the above-described object, there is provided a laser working method according to the present invention for irradiating a plate-shaped object to be processed with a laser light while locating a converging point within the object, so as to form a modified region serving as a starting point for cutting along a line to cut the object, in the laser working method, at the time of forming the modified region, the laser light is modulated by a reflection type spatial light modulator such that a wavefront of the laser light becomes a predetermined wavefront inside the object.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0011">Further, there is provided a laser working method according to the present invention for irradiating a plate-shaped object to be processed with a laser light while locating a converging point within the object, so as to form a modified region serving as a starting point for cutting along a line to cut the object, in the laser working method, at the time of forming the modified region, the laser light is modulated by a reflection type spatial light modulator such that aberration of the laser light converged inside the object becomes a predetermined aberration or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0012">In these laser working methods, the object is irradiated with the laser light modulated by the reflection type spatial light modulator such that a wavefront of the laser light becomes a predetermined wavefront inside the object (or, aberration of the laser light converged inside the object becomes a predetermined aberration or less). Therefore, for example, aberration of the laser light generated at a position on which a converging point of the laser light is located is made substantially zero, and the energy density of the laser light at that position is enhanced, which makes it possible so as to form a modified region with a high function as a starting point for cutting (for example, it is easy to generate break). In addition, because the reflection type spatial light modulator is used, it is possible to improve the utilization efficiency of a laser light as compared with a transmissive type spatial light modulator. Such improvement of the utilization efficiency of a laser light is particularly important in the case in which a modified region serving as a starting point for cutting is formed in a plate-shaped object to be processed. Accordingly, in accordance with these laser working methods, it is possible to reliably form a modified region serving as a starting point for cutting.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0013">There is provided a laser working method according to the present invention for irradiating a plate-shaped object to be processed with a laser light while locating a converging point within the object, to form modified regions in a plurality of lines serving as starting points for cutting along a line of the object so as to line up in the thickness direction of the object, in the laser working method, at the time of forming the modified regions in one line or a plurality of lines including a modified region farthest from a laser light entrance surface of the object among the modified regions in a plurality of lines, a distance between a converging optical system and the object is changed such that a distance between the converging optical system that converges the laser light inside the object and the object becomes a predetermined distance in accordance with the modified region to be formed, and the laser light is modulated by a reflection type spatial light modulator such that a wavefront of the laser light becomes a predetermined wavefront inside the object.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0014">Further, there is provided a laser working method according to the present invention for irradiating a plate-shaped object to be processed with a laser light while locating a converging point within the object, to form modified regions in a plurality of lines serving as starting points for cutting along a line to cut the object so as to line up in the thickness direction of the object, in the laser working method, at the time of forming the modified regions in one line or a plurality of lines including a modified region farthest from a laser light entrance surface of the object among the modified regions in a plurality of lines, a distance between a converging optical system and the object is changed such that a distance between the converging optical system that converges the laser light inside the object and the object becomes a predetermined distance in accordance with the modified region to be formed, and the laser light is modulated by a reflection type spatial light modulator such that aberration of the laser light converged inside the object becomes a predetermined aberration or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0015">In these laser working methods, at the time of forming the modified regions in one line or a plurality of lines including a modified region farthest from the laser light entrance surface of the object among the modified regions in a plurality of lines, the object is irradiated with the laser light modulated by the reflection type spatial light modulator. The reason for that modulation of the laser light by the reflection type spatial light modulator is required at the time of forming the modified region farthest from the laser light entrance surface, is because the farther from the laser light entrance surface the position at which the modified region is formed is, the larger the aberration of the laser light generated at the position on which the converging point of the laser light is located is. Accordingly, in accordance with these laser working methods, it is possible to reliably form the modified regions serving as starting points for cutting even in the case in which modified regions in a plurality of lines are formed along one of the lines.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0016">At this time, in the case in which the plurality of lines are set with respect to the object, provided that after the modified regions in a plurality of lines are formed along one of the lines, the modified regions in a plurality of lines are formed along another one of the lines, the following effect is brought about. That is, in a case where there is undulation on the laser light entrance surface of the object, in order to focus the converging point of the laser light on a position at a predetermined distance from the laser light entrance surface with high precision, data on varying levels of the laser light entrance surface along the line is acquired, to fine-adjust a distance between the converging optical system and the object on the basis of the data on varying levels. Accordingly, provided that after the modified regions in a plurality of lines are formed along one of the lines, the modified regions in a plurality of lines are formed along another one of the lines, it is possible to decrease the number of switching data on varying levels, and it is possible to form the modified regions in a plurality of lines along the respective lines at positions at predetermined distances from the laser light entrance surface with high precision.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0017">Further, in the case in which the plurality of lines are set with respect to the object, provided that after the modified region in one line is formed along the plurality of lines, the modified region in another one line is formed along the plurality of lines, the following effect is brought about. That is, in a case where the object breaks by the formation of the modified regions in a plurality of lines along one of the lines, if the modified regions in a plurality of lines are formed along another one of the lines after the modified regions in a plurality of lines are formed along one of the lines, the position of the object is shifted by the break of the object. Then, in order to form the modified regions along the lines with high precision, it is necessary to correct the position of the object. However, if the modified region in another one line is formed along a plurality of lines after the modified region in one line is formed along the plurality of lines, it is possible to prevent the position of the object from being shifted by the break of the object, and the number of corrections for the position of the object is decreased, which makes it possible to form the modified regions in a plurality of lines along the plurality of lines in a short time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0018">There is provided a laser working method according to the present invention for irradiating a plate-shaped object to be processed with a laser light while locating a converging point within the object, so as to form a modified region serving as a starting point for cutting along a line to cut the object, in the laser working method, at the time of forming the modified region, the laser light is modulated by a reflection type spatial light modulator such that a numerical aperture of the laser light converged inside the object becomes a predetermined numerical aperture.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0019">In this laser working method, the object is irradiated with the laser light modulated by the reflection type spatial light modulator such that a numerical aperture of the laser light converged inside the object becomes a predetermined numerical aperture. Therefore, for example, the modified region with a high function as a starting point for cutting can be formed by changing the numerical aperture of the laser light according to a material of the object, a distance to a position at which the modified region must be formed, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0020">There is provided a laser working method according to the present invention for irradiating a plate-shaped object to be processed with a laser light while locating a converging point within the object, to form modified regions in a plurality of lines serving as starting points for cutting along a line to cut the object so as to line up in the thickness direction of the object, in the laser working method, at the time of forming the modified regions except for the modified region closest to a laser light entrance surface of the object or an opposed surface opposed to the laser light entrance surface in the object among the modified regions in a plurality of lines, the laser light is modulated by a reflection type spatial light modulator such that a numerical aperture of the laser light converged inside the object is made smaller as compared with the case in which the modified region closest to the laser light entrance surface or the opposed surface is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0021">In this laser working method, at the time of forming the modified region closest to the laser light entrance surface of the object or the opposed surface opposed to the laser light entrance surface in the object, as a modified region particularly important as a starting point for cutting, the object is irradiated with the laser light modulated by the reflection type spatial light modulator such that a numerical aperture of the laser light converged inside the object is made larger as compared with the case in which the other modified regions are formed. Therefore, the modified region closest to the laser light entrance surface of the object or the opposed surface opposed to the laser light entrance surface in the object can be made to be a modified region with an extremely high function as a starting point for cutting (for example, a modified region including break).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0022">At this time, in the case in which the modified regions are formed in at least three lines along the line so as to line up in the thickness direction of the object, at the time of forming the modified regions except for the modified region farthest from the laser light entrance surface and the modified region closest to the laser light entrance surface among the modified regions in at least three lines, the laser light is preferably modulated by the reflection type spatial light modulator such that a numerical aperture of the laser light converged inside the object is made smaller as compared with the case in which the modified region farthest from the laser light entrance surface and the modified region closest to the laser light entrance surface are formed. In this case, at the time of forming the modified region farthest from the laser light entrance surface and the modified region closest to the laser light entrance surface as the modified regions particularly important as starting points for cutting, the object is irradiated with the laser light modulated by the reflection type spatial light modulator such that a numerical aperture of the laser light converged inside the object is made larger as compared with the case in which the modified region therebetween is formed. Therefore, the modified region farthest from the laser light entrance surface and the modified region closest to the laser light entrance surface can be made to be the modified regions with extremely high functions as starting points for cutting (for example, modified regions including break).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0066">Hereinafter, a preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the drawings. Note that the same or corresponding portions in the respective drawings are denoted by the same reference numerals and letters, and overlapping descriptions thereof will be omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0067">In a laser working method and a laser working apparatus according to the present embodiment, a plate-shaped object to be processed is irradiated with a laser light while locating a converging point on the object, so as to form a modified region in the object along a line to cut.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0068">Then, first, the formation of a modified region in the laser working method and the laser working apparatus according to the present embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 9</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0069">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a laser working apparatus <b>100</b> is equipped with a laser light source <b>101</b> that performs pulsed oscillation of a laser light (laser light for working) L, a dichroic mirror <b>103</b> which is disposed so as to change the optical axis of the laser light L in direction by 90 degrees, and a converging lens <b>105</b> for converging the laser light L. Further, the laser working apparatus <b>100</b> is equipped with a supporting base <b>107</b> for supporting an object to be processed <b>1</b> irradiated with the laser light L converged by the converging lens <b>105</b>, a stage <b>111</b> for moving the supporting base <b>107</b> in the X-, Y-, and Z-axis directions, a laser light source controller <b>102</b> that controls the laser light source <b>101</b> in order to adjust an output, a pulse width, and the like of the laser light L, and a stage controller <b>115</b> that controls the movement of the stage <b>111</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0070">In this laser working apparatus <b>100</b>, the laser light L emitted from the laser light source <b>101</b> is changed in direction of its optical axis by 90 degrees by the dichroic mirror <b>103</b>, and is converged inside the object <b>1</b> placed on the supporting base <b>107</b> by the converging lens <b>105</b>. At the same time, the stage <b>111</b> is moved, to relatively move the object <b>1</b> along a line to cut <b>5</b> with respect to the laser light L. Thereby, a modified region serving as a starting point for cutting is to be formed in the object <b>1</b> along the line <b>5</b>. Hereinafter, this modified region will be described in detail.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0071">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the line <b>5</b> for cutting the object <b>1</b> is set on the plate-shaped object <b>1</b>. The line <b>5</b> is a linearly-extended virtual line. In the case in which a modified region is formed inside the object <b>1</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the laser light L is relatively moved along the line <b>5</b> (i.e., in the direction of arrow A in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) in a state in which a converging point P is located on the inside of the object <b>1</b>. Thereby, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 6</figref>, a modified region <b>7</b> is formed inside the object <b>1</b> along the line <b>5</b>, and the modified region <b>7</b> formed along the line <b>5</b> serves as a starting point region for cutting region <b>8</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0072">Note that the converging point P is a place on which the laser light L is converged. Further, the line <b>5</b> is not limited to a linear shape, and may be a curved shape, and is not limited to a virtual line, and may be a line actually drawn on a front face <b>3</b> of the object <b>1</b>. Further, the modified region <b>7</b> is continuously formed in some cases, and is intermittently formed in some cases. Further, it suffices that the modified region <b>7</b> is formed at least inside the object <b>1</b>. Further, crevices are formed from the modified region <b>7</b> as a starting point in some cases, and crevices and the modified region <b>7</b> may be exposed to the outer surface (the front face, the rear face, or the outer circumferential face) of the object <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0073">Incidentally, here, the laser light L is made transmissive through the object <b>1</b> and is absorbed particularly in the vicinity of the converging point inside the object <b>1</b>, and thereby forming the modified region <b>7</b> in the object <b>1</b> (i.e., internal absorption type laser working). Therefore, the laser light L is hardly absorbed into the front face <b>3</b> of the object <b>1</b>, and thus, the front face <b>3</b> of the object <b>1</b> does not melt in any case. Generally, in the case in which removal portions such as holes, grooves, and the like are melted and removed from the front face <b>3</b> to be formed (surface absorption type laser working), a working region gradually advances from the front face <b>3</b> side to the rear face side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0074">Meanwhile, a modified region formed by the laser working method and the laser working apparatus according to the present embodiment means a region coming into a state different in its density, refractive index, mechanical strength, and other physical characteristics from the circumference thereof. For example, there is a (1) molten processed region, (2) crack region, dielectric breakdown region, (3) refractive index changed region, and the like, and there are also regions where these are mixed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0075">A modified region by the laser working method and the laser working apparatus according to the present embodiment is formed by a phenomenon such as local absorption or multiple photon absorption of a laser light. When the energy hν of photons is less than the bandgap E<sub>G </sub>of absorption of a material, the material is made optically-transparent, which leads to the condition of hν&gt;E<sub>G </sub>under which absorption occurs in the material. The multiple photon absorption means a phenomenon that, even if a material is optically-transparent, absorption occurs in the material under the condition of nhν&gt;E<sub>G </sub>(n=2, 3, 4, and . . . ) by making the intensity of the laser light L extremely high. The formation of a molten processed region by multiple photon absorption is described in, for example, “Ultrashort Pulse Laser Microprocessing of Silicon” on pages 72 to 73 in Pre-Prints of the National Meeting of JWS (Japan Welding Society) 66 (April, 2000).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0076">Further, as described in D. Du, X. Liu, G. Korn, J. Squier, and G. Mourou, “Laser Induced Breakdown by Impact Ionization in SiO<sub>2 </sub>with Pulse Widths from 7 ns to 150 fs,” Appl Phys Lett 64 (23), Jun. 6, 1994, a modified region formed by utilizing an ultrashort pulse laser light with a pulse width from several picoseconds to femtoseconds may be utilized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0010" num="0000">(1) In the Case of a Modified Region Including a Molten Processed Region</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0077">An object (for example, a semiconductor material such as silicon) is irradiated with the laser light L under the condition that the electric field intensity at a converging point is 1×10<sup>8 </sup>(W/cm<sup>2</sup>) or more and its pulse width is 1 μs or less while locating the converging point within the object. Thereby, the laser light L is absorbed in the vicinity of the converging point to locally heat the inside of the object, and a molten processed region is formed inside the object by the heating.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0078">A molten processed region is a region which is once melted and again solidified after that, a region in a currently melt state, or a region in a state of being again solidified from a melt state, or may be called a phase-changed region or a region whose crystalline structure is changed. Further, a molten processed region may be called a region whose certain structure is changed to another structure in a single crystalline structure, an amorphous structure, or a polycrystalline structure. That is, for example, a molten processed region means a region changed to an amorphous structure from its single crystalline structure, a region changed to a polycrystalline structure from its single crystalline structure, and a region changed to a structure including an amorphous structure and a polycrystalline structure from its single crystalline structure. In the case in which an object has a silicon single crystalline structure, a molten processed region has an amorphous silicon structure, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0079"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a view showing a photograph of a cross section of one part of a silicon wafer (semiconductor substrate) irradiated with a laser light. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a molten processed region <b>13</b> is formed inside a semiconductor substrate <b>11</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0080">It will be described that the molten processed region <b>13</b> is formed inside a material which is transmissive for a wavelength of a laser light incident thereon. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a diagrammatic view showing the relationship between wavelengths of a laser light and transmittances inside silicon substrates. However, the respective reflection components on the front face sides and the rear face sides of the silicon substrates are removed, and only the transmittances inside the silicon substrates are shown. The above-described relationships of the respective silicon substrates with thicknesses of 50 μm, 100 μm, 200 μm, 500 μm, and 1000 μm are shown.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0081">For example, it is understood that, in the case in which the thickness of the silicon substrate is 500 μm or less at 1064 nm which is the wavelength of an Nd:YAG laser, 80% or more of the laser light L is made transmissive inside the silicon substrate. Because the thickness of the semiconductor substrate <b>11</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is 350 μm, the molten processed region <b>13</b> is formed in the vicinity of the center of the semiconductor substrate <b>11</b>, i.e., in the portion 175 μm from the front face. Because the transmittance in this case is 90% or more with reference to a silicon wafer with a thickness of 200 μm, the laser light L is absorbed in a slight quantity inside the semiconductor substrate <b>11</b>, and most of the laser light L is made transmissive through the semiconductor substrate <b>11</b>. However, the laser light L is converged inside the silicon wafer under the condition that the peak power density is 1×10<sup>8 </sup>(W/cm<sup>2</sup>) or more and its pulse width is 1 μs or less, to cause the laser light to be locally absorbed in the converging point and the vicinity thereof, thereby forming the molten processed region <b>13</b> inside the semiconductor substrate <b>11</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0082">Note that crevices may be generated from a molten processed region as a starting point in a silicon wafer in some cases. Further, a molten processed region may be formed so as to contain crevices in some cases. In this case, the cracks may be formed over the entire surface in the molten processed region, or may be formed only in one portion or in a plurality of portions. Moreover, the crevices may grow naturally in some cases, or may grow by applying force to the silicon wafer in some cases. In the case in which the crevices grow naturally from a molten processed region, there are both the case in which the cracks grow from a state in which the molten processed region is melted, and the case in which the cracks grow when the molten processed region is again solidified from a state in which the molten processed region is melted. However, in any of the cases, the molten processed region is formed inside the silicon wafer, and on its cutting plane, the molten processed region is formed inside the silicon wafer as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0011" num="0000">(2) In the Case of a Modified Region Including a Crack Region</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0083">An object (for example, glass or a piezoelectric material formed of LiTaO<sub>3</sub>) is irradiated with the laser light L under the condition that the electric field intensity at a converging point is 1×10<sup>8 </sup>(W/cm<sup>2</sup>) or more and its pulse width is 1 μs or less while locating the converging point within the object. This size of a pulse width is the condition under which the laser light L is absorbed into the inside of the object to form a crack region. Thereby, a phenomenon called optical damage inside the object occurs. Thermal strain is induced inside the object by the optical damage, thereby a crack region including one or a plurality of cracks are formed inside the object. A crack region may also be called a dielectric breakdown region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0084"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a diagrammatic view showing the experimental results of the relationship between electric field intensities and sizes of cracks. Peak power densities are plotted on the abscissa, and because the laser light L is a pulse laser light, its electric field intensities are expressed by the peak power densities. The sizes of cracked portions (crack spots) formed inside the object by the laser light L of one pulse are plotted on the ordinate. Crack spots gather to become a crack region. The sizes of crack spots are sizes of portions having the maximum lengths in the shapes of the crack spots. The data shown by black circles in the graph is in the case in which the magnification of the converging lens (C) is 100-times and the numerical aperture (NA) thereof is 0.80. On the other hand, the data shown by white circles in the graph is in the case in which the magnification of the converging lens (C) is 50-times and the numerical aperture (NA) thereof is 0.55. It is understood that the crack spots are generated inside the object from when the peak power density is approximately 10<sup>11 </sup>(W/cm<sup>2</sup>), and crack spots become greater as the peak power density is increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0012" num="0000">(3) In the Case of a Modified Region Including a Refractive Index Changed Region</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0085">An object (for example, glass) is irradiated with the laser light L under the condition that the electric field intensity at a converging point is 1×10<sup>8 </sup>(W/cm<sup>2</sup>) or more and its pulse width is 1 μs or less while locating the converging point within the object. In this way, when the laser light L is absorbed into the inside of the object in a state in which its pulse width is extremely short, the energy thereof is not transformed into thermal energy, and permanent structural changes such as ionic valence change, crystallization, polarization orientation, or the like are induced inside the object, which forms a refractive index changed region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0086">Note that a modified region including a molten processed region, a dielectric breakdown region, a refractive index changed region, or a region in which these are mixed, may be a region in which the density of a modified region is changed as compared with the density of an unmodified region in its material, or may be a region in which a lattice defect is formed. These may also be collectively called a high-density transfer region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0087">Further, in some cases, a molten processed region, a refractive index changed region, a region in which the density of a modified region is changed as compared with the density of an unmodified region, and a region in which a lattice defect is formed may further contain crevices (break, microcracks) inside those regions or in the interface between the modified region and the unmodified region. Crevices to be contained may spread over the entire surface of the modified region or are formed in only one portion or a plurality of portions in some cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0088">Incidentally, provided that a modified region is formed as follows in consideration of the crystalline structure or the cleavability of the object, it is possible to cut the object with high precision.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0089">That is, in the case of a substrate formed of a single crystalline semiconductor such as silicon having a diamond structure, a modified region is preferably formed in a direction along the (111) plane (first cleavage plane) or the (110) plane (second cleavage plane). Further, in the case of a substrate formed of a III-V group compound semiconductor having a zinc blende structure such as GaAs, a modified region is preferably formed in a direction along the (110) plane. Moreover, in the case of a substrate having a hexagonal crystalline structure such as sapphire (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), a modified region is preferably formed in a direction along the (1120) plane (A-plane) or the (1100) plane (M-plane) with the (0001) plane (C-plane) being as a principal plane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0090">Further, provided that an orientation flat is formed on the substrate along the direction in which a modified region must be formed (for example, a direction along the (111) plane in the single crystalline silicon substrate) described above, or a direction perpendicular to a direction in which the modified region must be formed, it is possible to easily and accurately form a modified region on the substrate by use of the orientation flat as a standard.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0091">Next, the laser working apparatus according to the present embodiment will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0092">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the laser working apparatus <b>200</b> is equipped with a supporting base <b>201</b> that supports the plate-shaped object <b>1</b>, a laser light source <b>202</b> that emits the laser light L, a reflection type spatial light modulator <b>203</b> that modulates the laser light L emitted from the laser light source <b>202</b>, a converging optical system <b>204</b> that converges the laser light L modulated by the reflection type spatial light modulator <b>203</b> inside the object <b>1</b> supported by the supporting base <b>201</b>, and a controller <b>205</b> that controls the reflection type spatial light modulator <b>203</b>. The laser working apparatus <b>200</b> is configured to irradiate the object <b>1</b> with the laser light L while locating the converging point P within the object <b>1</b>, to form the modified region <b>7</b> serving as a starting point for cutting along the line <b>5</b> of the object <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0093">The reflection type spatial light modulator <b>203</b> is installed in a case <b>231</b>, and the laser light source <b>202</b> is installed on the top panel of the case <b>231</b>. Further, the converging optical system <b>204</b> is composed of a plurality of lenses, and is installed on the bottom panel of the case <b>231</b> via a driving unit <b>232</b> composed of a piezoelectric element and the like. Then, a laser engine <b>230</b> is composed of the parts installed in the case <b>231</b>. Note that the controller <b>205</b> may be installed in the case <b>231</b> of the laser engine <b>230</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0094">A movement mechanism (not shown) that moves the case <b>231</b> in the thickness direction of the object <b>1</b> is installed in the case <b>231</b>. Thereby, it is possible to move the laser engine <b>230</b> up and down according to a depth of the object <b>1</b>, which enables to change a position of the converging optical system <b>204</b> to converge the laser light L on a desired depth position of the object <b>1</b>. Note that, in place of installation of the movement mechanism in the case <b>231</b>, a movement mechanism that moves the supporting base <b>201</b> in the thickness direction of the object <b>1</b> may be provided to the supporting base <b>201</b>. Further, the converging optical system <b>204</b> may be moved in the thickness direction of the object <b>1</b> by utilizing an AF unit <b>212</b> which will be described later. Then, these may be combined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0095">The controller <b>205</b> not only controls the reflection type spatial light modulator <b>203</b>, but also controls the entire laser working apparatus <b>200</b>. For example, at the time of forming the modified region <b>7</b>, the controller <b>205</b> controls the laser engine <b>230</b> including the converging optical system <b>204</b> such that the converging point P of the laser light L is located at a predetermined distance from the front face (laser light entrance surface) <b>3</b> of the object <b>1</b> and the converging point P of the laser light L relatively moves along the line <b>5</b>. Note that, in order to relatively move the converging point P of the laser light L with respect to the object <b>1</b>, the controller <b>205</b> may control, not the laser engine <b>230</b> including the converging optical system <b>204</b>, but the supporting base <b>201</b>, or may control both the laser engine <b>230</b> including the converging optical system <b>204</b> and the supporting base <b>201</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0096">The laser light L emitted from the laser light source <b>202</b> is reflected in sequence by mirrors <b>206</b> and <b>207</b> in the case <b>231</b>, and thereafter, the laser light L is reflected by a reflective member <b>208</b> such as a prism to be made incident onto the reflection type spatial light modulator <b>203</b>. The laser light L incident onto the reflection type spatial light modulator <b>203</b> is modulated by the reflection type spatial light modulator <b>203</b>, to be emitted from the reflection type spatial light modulator <b>203</b>. The laser light L emitted from the reflection type spatial light modulator <b>203</b> is reflected by the reflective member <b>208</b> so as to be along the optical axis of the converging optical system <b>204</b> in the case <b>231</b>, and the laser light L is made transmissive in sequence through beam splitters <b>209</b> and <b>210</b> to be made incident onto the converging optical system <b>204</b>. The laser light L incident onto the converging optical system <b>204</b> is converged inside the object <b>1</b> placed on the supporting base <b>201</b> by the converging optical system <b>204</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0097">Further, the laser working apparatus <b>200</b> is equipped with a surface observing unit <b>211</b> for observing the front face <b>3</b> of the object <b>1</b> in the case <b>231</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0098">Moreover, the laser working apparatus <b>200</b> is equipped with the AF (auto-focus) unit <b>212</b> for focusing the converging point P of the laser light L on a position at a predetermined distance from the front face <b>3</b> with high precision even in a case where there is undulation on the front face <b>3</b> of the object <b>1</b>, in the case <b>231</b>. The AF unit <b>212</b> emits a laser light for auto-focus LB reflected by the beams splitter <b>210</b>, and detects the laser light for auto-focus LB which is converged by the converging optical system <b>204</b> to be reflected by the front face <b>3</b> of the object <b>1</b>, to acquire data on varying levels of the front face <b>3</b> along the line <b>5</b> by use of, for example, an astigmatic method. Then, at the time of forming the modified region <b>7</b>, the AF unit <b>212</b> causes the driving unit <b>232</b> to drive on the basis of the acquired data on varying levels, to move the converging optical system <b>204</b> to reciprocate in its optical axis direction so as to be along the undulation of the front face <b>3</b> of the object <b>1</b>, that fine-adjusts a distance between the converging optical system <b>204</b> and the object <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0099">Here, the reflection type spatial light modulator <b>203</b> will be described.

In addition, in the case of requiring further accuracy, a distance between the primary point of the converging optical system <b>204</b> and the primary point of the lens <b>241</b> <i>b </i>is desirably set to f2.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0142">In this way, in the case in which the plurality of lines <b>5</b> are set with respect to the object <b>1</b>, provided that after the modified regions <b>7</b> in a plurality of lines are formed along one of the lines <b>5</b>, the modified regions <b>7</b> in a plurality of lines are formed along another one of the lines <b>5</b>, the following effect is brought about. That is, even in a case where there is undulation on the front face <b>3</b> of the object <b>1</b>, in order to focus the converging point P of the laser light L on a position at a predetermined distance from the front face <b>3</b> with high precision, the AF unit <b>212</b> acquires data on varying levels of the front face <b>3</b> along the line <b>5</b>, to fine-adjust a distance between the converging optical system <b>204</b> and the object <b>1</b> on the basis of the data on varying levels.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0143">As described above, in the laser working method according to the present embodiment, the object <b>1</b> is irradiated with the laser light L modulated by the reflection type spatial light modulator <b>203</b> such that aberration of the laser light L converged inside the object <b>1</b> becomes a predetermined aberration or less (or, the wavefront of the laser light L becomes a predetermined wavefront inside the object <b>1</b>). Therefore, the aberration of the laser light L generated at a position on which the converging point P of the laser light L is located is made as small as possible, to enhance the energy density of the laser light L at that position, which makes it possible to form the modified region <b>7</b> with a high function as a starting point for cutting. In addition, because the reflection type spatial light modulator <b>203</b> is used, it is possible to improve the utilization efficiency of laser light L as compared with a transmissive type spatial light modulator. Such improvement of the utilization efficiency of the laser light L is particularly important in the case in which the modified region <b>7</b> serving as a starting point for cutting is formed in the plate-shaped object <b>1</b>. Accordingly, in accordance with the laser working method according to the present embodiment, it is possible to reliably form the modified region <b>7</b> serving as a starting point for cutting. As a result, when a stress is applied to the object <b>1</b> in which the modified region <b>7</b> is formed, via an expand tape or the like, the modified region <b>7</b> sufficiently performs the function as a starting point for cutting. Therefore, it is possible to cut the object <b>1</b> along the line <b>5</b> with high precision, and to prevent generation of an uncut portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0144">The present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0143" num="0145">For example, in the above-described embodiment, after the modified regions <b>7</b> in a plurality of lines are formed along one of the lines <b>5</b>, the modified regions <b>7</b> in a plurality of lines are formed along another one of the lines <b>5</b>. However, the modified region <b>7</b> in another one line may be formed along a plurality of lines <b>5</b> after the modified region <b>7</b> in one line is formed along the plurality of lines <b>5</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0144" num="0146">In that case, the following effect is brought about. That is, in a case where the object <b>1</b> breaks by the formation of the modified regions <b>7</b> in a plurality of lines along one of the lines <b>5</b>, if the modified regions <b>7</b> in a plurality of lines are formed along another one of the lines <b>5</b> after the modified regions <b>7</b> in a plurality of lines are formed along one of the lines <b>5</b>, the position of the object <b>1</b> is shifted by the break of the object <b>1</b>. Then, in order to form the modified regions <b>7</b> along the lines <b>5</b> with high precision, it is necessary to correct the position of the object <b>1</b>. However, if the modified region <b>7</b> in another one line is formed along a plurality of lines <b>5</b> after the modified region <b>7</b> in one line is formed along the plurality of lines <b>5</b>, it is possible to prevent the position of the object <b>1</b> from being shifted by the break of the object <b>1</b>, and the number of corrections for the position of the object <b>1</b> is decreased, which makes it possible to form the modified regions <b>7</b> in a plurality of lines along the plurality of lines <b>5</b> in a short time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0147">Further, at the time of forming modified regions <b>7</b> in one line or a plurality of lines including the modified region <b>7</b> farthest from the front face <b>3</b> that is the laser light entrance surface of the object <b>1</b> among the modified regions <b>7</b> in a plurality of lines, a distance between the converging optical system <b>204</b> and the object <b>1</b> may be changed such that a distance between converging optical system <b>204</b> that converges the laser light L inside the object <b>1</b> and the object <b>1</b> becomes a predetermined distance in accordance with the modified region <b>7</b> to be formed, and the laser light L may be modulated by the reflection type spatial light modulator <b>203</b> such that a wavefront of the laser light L becomes a predetermined wavefront inside the object <b>1</b> (or, aberration of the laser light L converged inside the object <b>1</b> becomes a predetermined aberration or less).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0148">The reason for that modulation of the laser light L by the reflection type spatial light modulator <b>203</b> is required at the time of forming the modified region <b>7</b> farthest from the front face <b>3</b> that is the laser light entrance surface of the object <b>1</b> as described above, is because the farther from the laser light entrance surface the position at which the modified region <b>7</b> is formed is, the larger the aberration of the laser light L generated at the position on which the converging point P of the laser light L is located is. That is, for example, in the case of forming the modified region <b>7</b> closest to the front face <b>3</b> that is the laser light entrance surface of the object <b>1</b>, when the aberration of the laser light L converged inside the object <b>1</b> becomes a predetermined aberration or less even if the laser light L is not modulated by the reflection type spatial light modulator <b>203</b>, there is no need to modulate the laser light L by the reflection type spatial light modulator <b>203</b>. Thereby, it is possible to reliably form the modified regions <b>7</b> serving as starting points for cutting even in the case in which the modified regions <b>7</b> in a plurality of lines along one of the lines <b>5</b> is formed. Note that, in the case in which modulation of the laser light L by the reflection type spatial light modulator <b>203</b> is not carried out, the reflection type spatial light modulator <b>203</b> is controlled to be utilized as a normal reflecting mirror (that is, pattern information is used so as to be not input or in an OFF state).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0147" num="0149">Further, in place of movement of the laser engine <b>230</b>, a movement mechanism that moves the supporting base <b>201</b> in the thickness direction of the object <b>1</b> may be provided to the supporting base <b>201</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0148" num="0150">Further, the reflection type spatial light modulator <b>203</b> and the adjustment optical system <b>240</b> as described above may be, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, applied to the laser working apparatus <b>200</b> including an optical path length intergradation means <b>300</b> in place of the AF unit <b>212</b>. The optical path length intergradation means <b>300</b> changes an optical path length between a lens <b>303</b> and a lens <b>304</b> by changing installing angles of a plurality of deflecting mirrors <b>301</b> on the basis of a height position of the front face <b>3</b> of the object <b>1</b> detected by a height position detecting means (not shown), to change a position of the converging point P of the laser light L converged by the converging optical system <b>204</b>. This is because a distance to the position of the converging point P of the laser light L converged by the converging optical system <b>204</b> is expressed by a function of an optical path length from the lens <b>303</b> to the lens <b>304</b>. Note that, as a height position detecting means, for example, a means for detecting a height position of the front face <b>3</b> on the basis of a change in height position of the reflected light when the laser light L is made incident onto the front face <b>3</b> of the object <b>1</b> at a predetermined incident angle, can be cited.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0149" num="0151">Further, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the laser working apparatus <b>200</b> may be equipped with the supporting base <b>201</b>, the laser light source <b>202</b>, a plurality of (here, two) reflection type spatial light modulators <b>203</b> <i>a </i>and <b>203</b> <i>b </i>that modulate the laser light L emitted from the laser light source <b>202</b>, the converging optical system <b>204</b>, and the controller <b>205</b>. The controller <b>205</b> has a function of controlling the reflection type spatial light modulators <b>203</b> <i>a </i>and <b>203</b> <i>b </i>such that an optical characteristic of the laser light L becomes a predetermined optical characteristic. Note that, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, because the two reflection type spatial light modulators <b>203</b> <i>a </i>and <b>203</b> <i>b </i>are disposed so as to be equivalent to the disposition of lenses <b>403</b> <i>a </i>and <b>403</b> <i>b </i>of a double telecentric optical system, it is possible to control its beam diameter, its optical axis, or the like as an optical characteristic of the laser light L. Further, by at least one of the reflection type spatial light modulators <b>203</b> <i>a </i>and <b>203</b> <i>b</i>, it is also possible to modulate the laser light L such that a wavefront of the laser light L becomes a predetermined wavefront inside the object <b>1</b> (or, aberration of the laser light L converged inside the object <b>1</b> becomes a predetermined aberration or less).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0150" num="0152">In accordance with this laser working apparatus <b>200</b>, because the laser working apparatus <b>200</b> is equipped with the plurality of reflection type spatial light modulators <b>203</b> <i>a </i>and <b>203</b> <i>b</i>, it is possible to control its beam diameter, its optical axis, or the like as an optical characteristic of the laser light L. Accordingly, even in the case in which the optical axis of the laser light L is shifted from any cause, it is possible to easily correct the shift, to reliably form the modified region <b>7</b> serving as a starting point for cutting.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0153">At this time, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the adjustment optical system <b>240</b> may be provided.

In the case in which the wavefront is controlled by the reflection type spatial light modulator <b>203</b> <i>a</i>, the adjustment optical system <b>240</b> is disposed such that a distance between the reflection type spatial light modulator <b>203</b> <i>a </i>and the lens <b>241</b> <i>a </i>becomes the focal distance f1.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0162">In this laser working method, at the time of forming the modified region <b>7</b> closest to the front face <b>3</b> or the rear face <b>21</b> of the object as the modified region <b>7</b> particularly important as a starting point for cutting, the object <b>1</b> is irradiated with the laser light L modulated by the reflection type spatial light modulator <b>203</b> such that a numerical aperture of the laser light L converged inside the object <b>1</b> is made larger as compared with the case in which the other modified regions <b>7</b> are formed. Therefore, the modified region closest to the front face <b>3</b> or the rear face <b>21</b> of the object <b>1</b> can be made to be a modified region with an extremely high function as a starting point for cutting (for example, the modified region including break).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0163">Further, the converging point P of the laser light L may be located on a position at a predetermined distance from the front face <b>3</b> that is the laser light entrance surface of the object <b>1</b> by, not moving the laser engine <b>230</b> including the converging optical system <b>204</b> and the supporting base <b>201</b>, but modulating the laser light L by the reflection type spatial light modulator <b>203</b>. In detail, in the case in which the laser light L is converged at a position relatively deeper from the front face <b>3</b> of the object <b>1</b>, when the reflection type spatial light modulator <b>203</b> is controlled such that a spread angle of the laser light L emitted from the reflection type spatial light modulator <b>203</b> to be made incident onto the converging optical system <b>204</b> is made relatively smaller, to converge the laser light L at a position relatively shallower from the front face <b>3</b> of the object <b>1</b>, it is recommended that the reflection type spatial light modulator <b>203</b> be controlled such that a spread angle of the laser light L emitted from the reflection type spatial light modulator <b>203</b> to be made incident onto the converging optical system <b>204</b> is made relatively larger.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0162" num="0164">Further, in the above-described embodiment, the wavefront data is acquired as Zernike polynomials. However, the embodiment is not limited thereto. For example, the wavefront data may be acquired as Seidel's classification of aberrations, associated Legendre polynomials, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0163" num="0165">Further, in the above-described embodiment, a control signal for controlling the reflection type spatial light modulator <b>203</b> such that aberration of the laser light L converged inside the object <b>1</b> becomes a predetermined aberration or less (or, the wavefront of the laser light L becomes a predetermined wavefront inside the object <b>1</b>) is calculated on the basis of an actual measurement, and may be calculated on the basis of a simulation or the like. It is a matter of course that the control signal may be stored in the controller <b>205</b> in the case in which a control signal is calculated on the basis of a simulation or the like. However, the control signal may be not stored in the controller <b>205</b>, and a control signal may be calculated immediately before the modified region <b>7</b> is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0164" num="0166">Further, the object <b>1</b> is easily warped when its thickness reaches approximately 20 μm. Therefore, in order to form the modified region <b>7</b> at a position at a predetermined distance from the front face <b>3</b> that is the laser light entrance surface of the object <b>1</b>, the front face <b>3</b> of the object <b>1</b> is preferably pressed down toward the supporting base <b>201</b> side with a laser light transmissive member such as a glass plate. However, in this case, aberration is generated under the effect of the laser light transmissive member, which results in deterioration in the converging power of the laser light L. Then, provided that the laser light L is modulated by the reflection type spatial light modulator <b>203</b> such that aberration of the laser light L converged inside the object <b>1</b> becomes a predetermined aberration or less taking into account the laser light transmissive member, it is possible to reliably form the modified region <b>7</b> serving as a starting point for cutting.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0165" num="0167">Further, a laser light entrance surface at the time of forming the modified region <b>7</b> is not limited to the front face <b>3</b> of the object <b>1</b>, but may be the rear face <b>21</b> of the object <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0166" num="0168">Further, in the above-described embodiment, the modified region <b>7</b> including a molten processed region is formed inside the object <b>1</b> composed of a semiconductor material. However, another type of the modified region <b>7</b> such as a crack region or a refractive index changed region may be formed inside the object <b>1</b> composed of another material such as glass or a piezoelectric material.</div>
