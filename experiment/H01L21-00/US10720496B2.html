<heading id="h-0001">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">Semiconductor devices are used in a large number of electronic devices, such as computers, cell phones, and others. Semiconductor devices comprise integrated circuits that are formed on semiconductor wafers by depositing many types of thin films of material over the semiconductor wafers, and patterning the thin films of material to form the integrated circuits. Integrated circuits include field-effect transistors (FETs) such as metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) transistors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">One of the goals of the semiconductor industry is to continue shrinking the size and increasing the speed of individual FETs. To achieve these goals, fin FETs (finFETs) or multiple gate transistors are being researched and implemented. However, with this new device structure and the continuous shrinking of even finFETs, new challenges are being discovered.</div>

<heading id="h-0003">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">The following disclosure provides many different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of the invention. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. For example, the formation of a first feature over or on a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the first and second features are formed in direct contact, and may also include embodiments in which additional features may be formed between the first and second features, such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact. In addition, the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals and/or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and/or configurations discussed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">Further, spatially relative terms, such as “beneath,” “below,” “lower,” “above,” “upper” and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. The spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. The apparatus may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein may likewise be interpreted accordingly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">Fin Field-Effect Transistors (finFETs) and methods of forming the same are provided in accordance with various embodiments. Intermediate stages of forming finFETs are illustrated. Some embodiments discussed herein are discussed in the context of finFETs formed using a gate-last process. Some embodiments contemplate aspects used in a gate-first process. Some variations of the embodiments are discussed. One of ordinary skill in the art will readily understand other modifications that may be made that are contemplated within the scope of other embodiments. Although method embodiments are discussed in a particular order, various other method embodiments may be performed in any logical order and may include fewer or more steps described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">Some embodiments contemplate both n-type devices, such as n-type finFETs, and p-type devices, such as p-type finFETs, being manufactured during a manufacturing process. Hence, some embodiments contemplate the formation of complementary devices. Figures below may illustrate one device, but one of ordinary skill in the art will readily understand that multiple devices, some with a different device type, can be formed during processing. Some aspects of the formation of complementary devices are discussed below, although such aspects may not necessarily be illustrated in the figures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A, 2A, 3A, and 4A</figref> are various three-dimensional (3D) views of intermediate stages in the manufacturing of a fin, which comprises a superlattice that may include strained layers, for a finFET in accordance with some embodiments, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B, 2B, 3B, and 4B</figref> are respective cross-sectional views of the 3D views of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A, 2A, 3A, and 4A</figref>, respectively. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a process flow chart of the manufacturing of the fin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> and step <b>100</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a substrate <b>20</b> is provided. The substrate <b>20</b> may be a semiconductor substrate, such as a bulk semiconductor substrate, a semiconductor-on-insulator (SOI) substrate, a multi-layered or gradient substrate, or the like. The substrate <b>20</b> may include a semiconductor material, such as an elemental semiconductor including Si and Ge; a compound or alloy semiconductor including SiC, SiGe, GaAs, GaP, GaAsP, AlInAs, AlGaAs, GaInAs, InAs, GaInP, InP, InSb, and/or GaInAsP; or a combination thereof. The substrate <b>20</b> may be doped or undoped. In a specific example, the substrate <b>20</b> is a bulk silicon substrate, which may be a wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> and step <b>102</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a buffer layer <b>22</b> is formed on the substrate <b>20</b> in a 3D and cross-sectional view, respectively. The buffer layer <b>22</b>, in some embodiments, is epitaxially grown on the substrate <b>20</b>. The epitaxial growth can use Metal-Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD), Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE), Liquid Phase Epitaxy (LPE), Vapor Phase Epitaxy (VPE), Ultra-High-Vacuum Chemical Vapor Deposition (UHVCVD), the like, or a combination thereof. The buffer layer <b>22</b> can be a group IV material, such as Si, Ge, SiGe, SiGeSn, or the like; a group III-group V compound material, such as GaAs, GaP, GaAsP, AlInAs, AlGaAs, GaInAs, InAs, GaInP, InP, InSb, GaInAsP or the like; or the like. The buffer layer <b>22</b> can be a crystalline material and can have a natural lattice constant that is mismatched to the natural lattice constant of the crystalline material of the substrate <b>20</b> on which the buffer layer <b>22</b> is grown. The buffer layer <b>22</b> can be a relaxed material, which may result from plastic relaxation, for example. The buffer layer <b>22</b> can have a uniform composition or a varying composition, such as a graded composition. A graded composition may be substantially linearly graded or discrete-step graded. The buffer layer <b>22</b> can have a thickness greater than a critical thickness such that a surface of the buffer layer <b>22</b> distal from the substrate <b>20</b> includes a crystalline structure with a relaxed, natural lattice constant. The lattice constant at the surface of the buffer layer <b>22</b> distal from the substrate <b>20</b> can be as appropriate to induce stress in the superlattice <b>24</b>, as will be discussed. In some embodiments, the buffer layer <b>22</b> can be omitted, such as if the substrate <b>20</b> is a crystalline material with a lattice constant appropriate to induce a desired stress in the superlattice <b>24</b>. In the specific example referenced above, the buffer layer <b>22</b> is Si<sub>0.75</sub>Ge<sub>0.25 </sub>at the surface distal from the substrate <b>20</b>, is relaxed, and has a thickness in a range from about 50 nm to about 500 nm, such as about 100 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">Although not specifically illustrated, appropriate wells may be formed in the buffer layer <b>22</b> and/or substrate <b>20</b>. For example, a p-well may be formed in a first region of the substrate <b>20</b> where n-type devices, such as n-type finFETs, are to be formed, and an n-well may be formed in a second region of the substrate <b>20</b> where p-type devices, such as p-type finFETs, are to be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">For example, to form a p-well in the first region, a photoresist can formed over the buffer layer <b>22</b> in the second region of the substrate <b>20</b>. The photoresist can be patterned to expose the first region of the substrate <b>20</b>. The photoresist can be formed by using a spin-on technique and can be patterned using acceptable photolithography techniques. Once the photoresist is patterned, a p-type impurity implant can be performed in the first region, and the photoresist may act as a mask to substantially prevent p-type impurities from being implanted into the second region. The p-type impurities may be boron, BF<sub>2</sub>, or the like implanted in the first region to a concentration of equal to or less than 10<sup>18 </sup>cm<sup>−3</sup>, such as between about 10<sup>17 </sup>cm<sup>−3 </sup>and about 10<sup>18 </sup>cm<sup>−3</sup>. After the implant, the photoresist can be removed, such as by an acceptable ashing process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">Further, to form an n-well in the second region, a photoresist can be formed over the buffer layer <b>22</b> in the first region of the substrate <b>20</b>. The photoresist can be patterned to expose the second region of the substrate <b>20</b>. The photoresist can be formed by using a spin-on technique and can be patterned using acceptable photolithography techniques. Once the photoresist is patterned, an n-type impurity implant may be performed in the second region, and the photoresist may act as a mask to substantially prevent n-type impurities from being implanted into the first region. The n-type impurities may be phosphorus, arsenic, or the like implanted in the second region to a concentration of equal to or less than 10<sup>18 </sup>cm<sup>−3</sup>, such as between about 10<sup>17 </sup>cm<sup>−3 </sup>and about 10<sup>18 </sup>cm<sup>−3</sup>. After the implant, the photoresist can be removed, such as by an acceptable ashing process. After the implants, an anneal may be performed to activate the p-type and n-type impurities that were implanted. The implantations may form a p-well in the first region and an n-well in the second region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">In other embodiments, a p-well and an n-well may be formed in situ during the epitaxial growth of the buffer layer <b>22</b>. The buffer layer <b>22</b> in the different regions where different wells are to be formed can be epitaxially grown in different growth steps to allow for the different doping types to be in the different regions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">Further in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> and step <b>104</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a superlattice <b>24</b> is formed on the buffer layer <b>22</b>. The superlattice <b>24</b> includes alternating first layers <b>26</b> and second layer <b>28</b>. Each of the first layers <b>26</b> and the second layers <b>28</b>, in some embodiments, is epitaxially grown on its underlying layer. The epitaxial growth can use MOCVD, MBE, LPE, VPE, UHVCVD, the like, or a combination thereof. Each of the first layers <b>26</b> and the second layers <b>28</b> can be a group IV material, such as Si, Ge, SiGe, SiGeSn, or the like; a group III-group V compound material, such as GaAs, GaP, GaAsP, AlInAs, AlGaAs, GaInAs, InAs, GaInP, InP, InSb, GaInAsP or the like; or the like. The superlattice <b>24</b> can include any number of first layers <b>26</b> and any number of second layers <b>28</b>. As illustrated, the superlattice <b>24</b> has four first layers <b>26</b> and four second layer <b>28</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">Each of the first layers <b>26</b> and the second layers <b>28</b> can be a crystalline material. In some embodiments, a natural lattice constant of one respective group of the first layers <b>26</b> or the second layers <b>28</b> is larger than the lattice constant of the surface of the buffer layer <b>22</b> distal from the substrate <b>20</b> (or the substrate <b>20</b> if the buffer layer <b>22</b> is omitted), and a natural lattice constant of the other one respective group of the first layers <b>26</b> or the second layers <b>28</b> is smaller than the lattice constant of the surface of the buffer layer <b>22</b> distal from the substrate <b>20</b> (or the substrate <b>20</b> if the buffer layer <b>22</b> is omitted). Hence, in these embodiments, the first layers <b>26</b> can be strained a first strain type, and the second layers <b>28</b> are strained a second strain type opposite from the first strain type. Further in these embodiments, each of the first layers <b>26</b> and the second layers <b>28</b> can have a thickness less than a critical thickness, such as in a range from about 3 nm to 20 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, a natural lattice constant of the crystalline material of the first layer <b>26</b> is larger than the lattice constant of the surface of the buffer layer <b>22</b> distal from the substrate <b>20</b> (or the substrate <b>20</b> if the buffer layer <b>22</b> is omitted), and a natural lattice constant of the crystalline material of the second layer <b>28</b> is smaller than the lattice constant of the surface of the buffer layer <b>22</b> distal from the substrate <b>20</b> (or the substrate <b>20</b> if the buffer layer <b>22</b> is omitted). Hence, in these embodiments, the first layers <b>26</b> can be compressively strained, and the second layers <b>28</b> can be tensilely strained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">In other embodiments, a natural lattice constant of the crystalline material of the first layer <b>26</b> is smaller than the lattice constant of the surface of the buffer layer <b>22</b> distal from the substrate <b>20</b> (or the substrate <b>20</b> if the buffer layer <b>22</b> is omitted), and a natural lattice constant of the crystalline material of the second layer <b>28</b> is larger than the lattice constant of the surface of the buffer layer <b>22</b> distal from the substrate <b>20</b> (or the substrate <b>20</b> if the buffer layer <b>22</b> is omitted). Hence, the first layers <b>26</b> can be tensilely strained, and the second layers <b>28</b> can be compressively strained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">In the specific example referenced above, each of the first layers <b>26</b> is a layer of Si<sub>0.50</sub>Ge<sub>0.50</sub>, which has a natural lattice constant larger than the Si<sub>0.75</sub>Ge<sub>0.25 </sub>of the buffer layer <b>22</b>, having a thickness less than a critical thickness, such as in a range from about 3 nm to 20 nm. Hence, in the specific example, the first layers <b>26</b> are compressively strained. Further in the specific example referenced above, each of the second layers <b>28</b> is a layer of Si, which has a natural lattice constant smaller than the Si<sub>0.75</sub>Ge<sub>0.25 </sub>of the buffer layer <b>22</b>, having a thickness less than a critical thickness, such as in a range from about 3 nm to 20 nm.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">In further embodiments, one or both of the groups of the first layers <b>26</b> or the second layers <b>28</b> have a natural lattice constant of the respective crystalline material that is substantially equal to the lattice constant of the surface of the buffer layer <b>22</b> distal from the substrate <b>20</b> (or the substrate <b>20</b> if the buffer layer <b>22</b> is omitted). Hence, one or both of the groups of the first layers <b>26</b> or the second layers <b>28</b> can be relaxed.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">Some embodiments contemplate a structure, such as a fin, that includes a stressed superlattice, where the stressed superlattice has alternating layers that have opposing strain types (e.g., tensile versus compressive). For example, the stressed superlattice can include alternating compressively strained layers and tensilely strained layers. The superlattice can have any number of these layers. By alternating compressively and tensilely strained layers, stresses in each layer may not degrade in upper portions of the structure, e.g., fin, as much as compared to a single strained layer structure. For example, some stress may be lost in an upper portion of a single strained layer fin by elastic relaxation, particularly in smaller technology nodes, but in some embodiments, the counteracting stresses in adjacent layers may prevent significant elastic relaxation in any layer. Even further, by increasing the number of these alternating layers, less stress degradation in each layer may be achieved. The inventors performed simulations where the materials of the relaxed buffer layers, compressively strained layers, and tensilely strained layers remained constant and with fin heights varying to observe stress at an upper portion of different fin structures. The simulations included a single strained layer fin, a fin with a four layer superlattice with alternating compressively strained layers and tensilely strained layers, and a fin with an eight layer superlattice with alternating compressively strained layers and tensilely strained layers. As the fin height was increased for each fin structure, the fin with the single strained layer had the most significant stress degradation at the upper portion of the fin, while the fin with the eight layer superlattice had the least amount of stress degradation at the upper portion of the fin. This can reduce the layout dependence effect, which can be attributed to the scaling of the layout of the active area fin. As a layout of a fin is scaled down to smaller technology nodes, elastic relaxation in a single strained layer can be proportionally increased. Having a stressed superlattice with alternating strained layers as discussed above can mitigate this effect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0098" num="0097">By having layers be strained as a result of mismatching natural lattice constants and epitaxial growth, some embodiments can have an appropriate stress in a channel region that is less dependent on the pitch scaling of the device. For example, as devices are scaled to smaller technology nodes, the stress induced in a channel region by conventional embedded stressors in source and drain regions degrades. Hence, the channel stress of conventional structures can be dependent on the size of the device. Some embodiments can obviate this deficiency by inducing stress based on the mismatching of natural lattice constants of materials in the channel region, and therefore, the stress in the channel region of a device can be less dependent on the pitch scaling of the device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0099" num="0098">Some embodiments contemplate a channel region, such as in a fin, that has irregularities, such as corners, where an electric field can be increased in the channel region such that a carrier density can be increased.

This increased electrical field can cause an increased density of carriers proximate the corners of the un-etched layers in those embodiments. This can improve gate control of the device and can reduce the short channel effect. In simulations of some embodiments discussed above having one group of layers that is etched, it was observed that a current density of the on-current (I<sub>on</sub>) was increased at smaller technology nodes, such as devices having a channel length of 14 nm and less, relative to a conventional fin device. Further, in other simulations of some embodiments, the subthreshold slope was reduced at smaller technology nodes, such as devices have a channel length of 14 nm and less, relative to a conventional fin device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">In these embodiments with irregularities in the channel region, the first layers <b>26</b> and the second layers <b>28</b> do not necessarily need to be strained. One group may be relaxed while the other is tensilely strained; one group may be relaxed with the other is compressively strained; one group may be tensilely strained while the other is compressively strained; or both groups may be relaxed. The stress may increase carrier mobility as conventionally known. In some embodiments as discussed above with alternating compressively strained layers and tensilely strained layers, etching one group of layers, e.g., either the first layers <b>26</b> or the second layers <b>28</b>, can result in some degradation of stress in the other group of layers. However, the un-etched group of layers may remain strained to achieve higher carrier mobility. Further, the extent to which the etched group of layers is etched can affect the stress degradation in the un-etched group of layers. For example, increasing the amount that the etched group of layers is etched can result in increased stress degradation in the un-etched group of layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">Further, some embodiments can be easily integrated into processes and devices. A same superlattice structure may be used during the manufacture of both a p-type device and an n-type device. Therefore, the same superlattice structure can be easily integrated into complementary devices. For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of a complementary device structure comprising an n-type device region <b>200</b> and a p-type device region <b>300</b> in accordance with some embodiments. Some embodiments contemplate complementary devices having any combination of the structures described above. For example, in the context of the specific examples with the Si<sub>0.50</sub>Ge<sub>0.50 </sub>first layers <b>26</b> and the Si second layers <b>28</b>, and for a complementary device having both an n-type device and a p-type device, any of the structures in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A-C</figref>, <b>22</b>A-C, <b>24</b>A-C, <b>26</b>A-C, and <b>28</b>A-C can be used for the n-type device, e.g., n-type finFET, in the n-type device region <b>200</b>, and any of the structures in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A-C</figref>, <b>30</b>A-C, <b>32</b>A-C, <b>34</b>A-C, and <b>36</b>A-C can be used for the p-type device, e.g., p-type finFET, in the p-type device region <b>300</b>. Although the first layers <b>26</b> and the second layers <b>28</b> are illustrated in both the n-type device region <b>200</b> and the p-type device region <b>300</b>, the first layer <b>26</b> may be removed or omitted from one of the regions <b>200</b> or <b>300</b>, such as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28A-C</figref>, and/or the second layers <b>28</b> may be removed or omitted from one, e.g., in appropriate instances, the other, of the regions <b>200</b> or <b>300</b> as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36A-C</figref>.</div>
