<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to thin film deposition, and more particularly to systems and methods depositing metal oxides by atomic layer deposition using ozone and excited nitrogen-oxygen species.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">For many years, silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) has been used in semiconductor substrates for components such as transistor gate dielectrics and capacitor dielectrics. However, as circuit components have reduced in size, the electrical performance characteristics of (SiO<sub>2</sub>) results in undesirable effects such as increased leakage current. Controlling leakage current to maintain high speed and low power performance presents a challenge when older-generation dielectrics such as (SiO<sub>2</sub>) are used in the fabrication of newer integrated circuit geometries.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Newer processes, especially those that use fabrication geometries less than 65 nm have begun to include high dielectric constant (“high-k”) insulators in semiconductor fabrication. Some chipmakers now rely on high-k dielectrics, especially for 45 nm and smaller process geometries. Replacing (SiO<sub>2</sub>) gate dielectrics with high-k dielectrics is important to achieve smaller device geometries while controlling leakage and other electrical performance criteria.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">While the use of high-k dielectrics allows for smaller scaling of integrated circuit components such as transistor gate dielectrics, challenges arise in their fabrication. Certain metal and rare earth oxides such as zirconium oxide, titanium oxide, hafnium oxide, tantalum oxide, aluminum oxide, yttrium oxide, and lanthanum oxide are known to provide desirable characteristics when deposited as thin films yet present challenges during the fabrication process such as incompatibilities between process chemistries, extended deposition cycle times, and less than desired deposition uniformity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">A wide variety of methods and related apparatus exist to provide a thin film on a substrate such as a semiconductor. Some methods form a thin film on a substrate by utilizing a surface reaction on the semiconductor, such as vacuum evaporation deposition, molecular beam epitaxy, different variants of Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) (including low-pressure CVD, organometallic CVD and plasma-enhanced CVD) and Atomic Layer Epitaxy (ALE). ALE is also referred to as Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">ALD is a method of depositing thin films on a surface of a substrate through the sequential introduction of various precursor species. A conventional ALD apparatus may include a reaction chamber including a reactor and substrate holder, a gas flow system including gas inlets for providing precursors and reactants to a substrate surface and an exhaust system for removing used gases. The growth mechanism relies on the adsorption of a precursor on the active sites of the substrate and conditions are preferably maintained such that no more than a monolayer forms on the substrate, thereby self-terminating the process. Exposing the substrate to a first precursor is usually followed by a purging stage or other removal process (e.g., an evacuation or “pump down”) wherein any excess amounts of the first precursor as well as any reaction by-products are removed from the reaction chamber. The second reactant or precursor is then introduced into the reaction chamber at which time it reacts with the first precursor, and this reaction creates the desired thin film on the substrate. The reaction terminates when all of the available first precursor species adsorbed on the substrate has been reacted with the second precursor. A second purge or other removal stage is then performed which rids the reaction chamber of any remaining second precursor and possible reaction by-products. This cycle can be repeated to grow the film to a desired thickness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">One of the recognized advantages of ALD over other deposition processes is that it is self-saturating and uniform, as long as the temperature is within the ALD window (which is above the condensation temperature and below the thermal decomposition temperature of the reactants) and sufficient reactant is provided to saturate the surface in each pulse. Thus, neither temperature nor gas supply needs to be perfectly uniform in order to obtain uniform deposition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">ALD is further described in Finnish patent publications 52,359 and 57,975 and in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,058,430 and 4,389,973. Apparatus for implementing these methods are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,855,680, 6,511,539, and 6,820,570, Finnish Patent No. 100,409, Material Science Report 4(7)(1989), p. 261, and Tyhjiotekniikka (Finnish publication for vacuum techniques), ISBN 951-794-422-5, pp. 253-261.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Different film materials have been deposited employing ALD. Known materials for use in ALD include binary oxides such as Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, HfO<sub>2</sub>, ZrO<sub>2</sub>, La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>and Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. Various ternary oxides are also well known materials for use in ALD and include HfZrO, HfAlO and HfLaO. As discussed previously, selection of the appropriate material for use in high-k dielectric applications requires consideration of the impact of the deposited substance on the particular substrate and circuit environment, as well as considerations over process chemistry. In the case of ALD of HfLaO, a known Hf-precursor is HfCL<sub>4 </sub>and a known La-precursor is La(THD)<sub>3</sub>. Due to the hygroscopic nature of La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, ozone O<sub>3 </sub>is often used instead of H<sub>2</sub>O as an oxidant in prior art processes, but unfortunately, both the HfCl<sub>4</sub>/O<sub>3 </sub>process and the La(THD)/O<sub>3 </sub>process are highly sensitive to even small changes in the ozone present. In some instances, use of ozone also results in less than desired uniformity of the deposited oxide film. Further, managing two different oxidation chemistries complicates the deposition process when it is desirable that a single oxidizer (such as ozone) could be used in a manner to obtain efficient and consistent deposition results, regardless of the type of metal precursor being used in the deposition process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">Plasma discharges can be used to excite gases to produce activated gases containing ions, free radicals, atoms and molecules. Activated gases are used for numerous industrial and scientific applications including processing solid materials such as semiconductor wafers, powders, and other gases. The parameters of the plasma and the conditions of the exposure of the plasma to the material being processed vary widely depending on the application.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">Plasmas can be generated in various ways including current discharge, radio frequency (RF) discharge, and microwave discharge. Current discharges are achieved by applying a potential between two electrodes in a gas. RF discharges are achieved either by electrostatically or inductively coupling energy from a power supply into a plasma. Parallel plates are typically used for electrostatically coupling energy into plasma. Induction coils are typically used for inducing current into the plasma. Microwave discharges are achieved by directly coupling microwave energy through a microwave-passing window into a discharge chamber containing a gas. Microwave discharges are advantageous because they can be used to support a wide range of discharge conditions, including highly ionized electron cyclotron resonant (ECR) plasmas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">ALD systems have used plasma-based approaches to create oxidant gasses such as ozone. In one common configuration, Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) ozone generators create ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) from oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) that is provided as a feedgas to a corona discharge source. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a simplified DBD ozone generator cell <b>500</b> is illustrated. Typically, dry feedgas oxygen <b>530</b> is passed through a gap <b>505</b> formed between electrodes <b>510</b>A, <b>510</b>B, which are in turn energized by a high voltage source such as an alternating current (AC) voltage source <b>560</b>. The voltage produced by the source <b>560</b> can reach several thousand volts, depending on the configuration of the generator. Alternatively one of the electrodes may be at ground potential, and the other electrode energized to a high voltage. A dielectric material <b>520</b>A, <b>520</b>B, is interposed between the energized electrodes <b>510</b>A, <b>510</b>B and the feedgas <b>530</b>. When high voltage at low or high frequencies is applied to the electrodes <b>510</b>A, <b>510</b>B, ozone <b>550</b> is produced in the feedgas by micro-discharges taking place in the gap <b>505</b> and distributed across the dielectric <b>520</b>A, <b>520</b>B. The geometry of the gap and the quality of the dielectric material vary by the ozone generator manufacturer. Of note, DBD devices can be fabricated in many configurations, typically planar, using parallel plates separated by a dielectric or in a cylindrical form, using coaxial plates with a dielectric tube between them. In a common coaxial configuration, the dielectric is shaped in the same form as common fluorescent tubing. It is filled at atmospheric pressure with either a rare gas or rare gas-halide mix, with the glass walls acting as the dielectric barrier. Common dielectric materials include glass, quartz, ceramics and polymers. The gap distance between electrodes varies considerably, from 0.1 mm to several cm, depending on the application. The composition of the feed gas is also an important factor in the operation of the ozone generator.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">High-performance ozone generators that use the DBD principle require nitrogen in the feed gas to obtain optimum performance and consistent ozone generation. The formation of ozone involves a reaction between an oxygen atom, an oxygen molecule and a collision partner such as O<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2 </sub>or possibly other molecules. If the collision partner is nitrogen, the nitrogen molecules are able to transfer their excitation energy, after impact, to the oxygen molecules resulting in dissociation. Some of the excited nitrogen radicals that are formed may also dissociate oxygen or react with nitrogen oxides to liberate oxygen atoms. Many different forms of nitrogen-oxygen compounds may be produced during the process—NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, and N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, have been measured in the output DBD-type ozone generators. Some manufacturers have focused efforts to reduce or eliminate altogether the presence of certain N—O species from the output ozone stream of their ozone generators, as in some instances, aggressive corrosion of gas lines and welds from N—O compounds in the ozone stream may occur. In conventional ozone generators, control over the presence and type of N—O compounds in the output stream of ozone generators is lacking, and a need exists to be able to monitor and/or actively control the formation and generation of such compounds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">Thus, a need exists for a method for depositing a dielectric film on a substrate with reduced throughput times and with enhanced deposition uniformity. What is also needed is a system to monitor and/or control nitrogen-oxygen compounds created in an oxidizer generator such as an ozone generator.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS OF INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">One embodiment of the invention includes methods and systems for depositing a metal oxide film such as a hafnium oxide (HfO<sub>2</sub>), zirconium oxide (ZrO<sub>2</sub>), lanthanum oxide (La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and/or tantalum oxide (Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) on a substrate with enhanced deposition efficiency and uniformity. Some embodiments utilize an ALD system in combination with various precursors as explained below in combination with molecular and excited nitrogen-oxygen radical/ionic species (hereinafter referred to as “NxOy species,” where “x” and “y” may constitute any appropriate integers, and which may include excited species such as NO* and N<sub>2</sub>O*) in possible further combination with oxidizers such as ozone. Embodiments of the invention may also include electronic components and systems that include devices fabricated with methods consistent with the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) is a commonly used oxidant in ALD of various high-k metal oxides. Commercially available ozone delivery systems commonly rely on the dielectric barrier discharge and often utilize nitrogen in the feed gas to provide consistent ozone generation. Through a series of plasma reactions, various N<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y </sub>species can also form within the corona from O<sub>2 </sub>in the presence of N<sub>2</sub>. These species, while present in various concentrations in the generator effluent, are unregulated by the delivery system which measures and actively controls the O<sub>3 </sub>concentration only.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">Several ALD processes using ozone are extremely sensitive to the conditions of ozone generation. For example, a wide response in HfO<sub>2 </sub>deposition rate and film uniformity was observed as a function of O2:N<sub>2 </sub>feed gas ratio and reactor temperature in a cross-flow, thermal ALD reactor HfCl<sub>4</sub>/O<sub>3 </sub>ALD (using pure O<sub>3</sub>) has a process window at low reactor temperature (200-250° C.). At higher temperatures (e.g., 300° C.), uniform HfO<sub>2 </sub>layers were obtained when N2 was added during O<sub>3 </sub>generation. This indicates that the reactive species in ozone based ALD may not be exclusively O<sub>3</sub>, but at 300° C. N<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y </sub>species may contribute as well.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">Therefore, a study was conducted to first characterize the gaseous species entering (from ozone delivery system) and exiting the ALD reactor as a function of O<sub>2</sub>:N<sub>2 </sub>feed gas ratio, O<sub>3 </sub>concentration, and generator power levels using FTIR. N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>and N<sub>2</sub>O were detected at the outlet of the O<sub>3 </sub>delivery unit with N<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2 </sub>feed gas. The lifetime of O<sub>3 </sub>and the N<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y </sub>species were investigated as a function of the reactor temperature and material of coating (HfO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, etc.). FTIR analysis of the reactor effluent during the ozone half-reaction with adsorbed HfO<sub>2</sub>—HfCl<sub>3 </sub>was employed to elucidate the role of N<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y </sub>species on HfO<sub>2 </sub>deposition. ALD deposition rates, film uniformities, and various bulk and electrical film properties for HfO<sub>2 </sub>deposited under various ozone delivery conditions, and based on FTIR, and theories surrounding the role of O<sub>3 </sub>and N<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y </sub>species on potential reaction paths were determined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">During experiments conducted in ALD deposition of thin film metal oxides using metal halide precursor/ozone oxidizer chemistry, it was observed that no growth was taking place on a substrate when the substrate was exposed to an ozone oxidizer that had been generated by using pure oxygen feed gas. However, when gaseous nitrogen was added to the oxygen stream in the ozone generator, as is commonly the practice to increase efficiency of ozone generation, layer growth was observed during the ALD deposition process. For example, in various trials using ozone generated from pure oxygen, no uniform HfO<sub>2 </sub>or ZrO<sub>2 </sub>layers could be deposited at 300° C., but when ozone was generated from oxygen/nitrogen feed gas, uniform layers could be deposited. Different trials also showed that the growth rate and uniformity is dependent upon the amount of nitrogen used in the ozone generator relative to the amount of oxygen feed gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">It was further determined by experimentation that the concentration of N<sub>2 </sub>feed gas used for the generation of ozone influences the deposition process. In one such trial, where 0 ppm of N<sub>2 </sub>showed little uniform growth, 40 ppm of N<sub>2 </sub>resulted in an increased growth, and when N<sub>2 </sub>was adjusted to 400 ppm, significant uniform growth occurred. Additional experiments were then undertaken as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-11</figref>, using an O<sub>2 </sub>flow in the ozone generator of 2.5 slm, 18 wt %, with close loop control, with varying concentrations of nitrogen shown in the charts. Ozone injection flow into the reaction chamber was 1200 sccm. The HfCl<sub>4 </sub>precursor was pulsed into the chamber for 3 seconds followed by a 3 second purge, and the gas obtained from the ozone generator was then pulsed into the reaction chamber for 10 seconds followed by a 10 second purge. As a result, growth rate of the deposited metal oxide layer began to increase immediately when nitrogen concentration was increased, and reached a first peak when nitrogen concentration reached about 110 ppm (as seen in the close-up view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, which represents the left most portion of the graph in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) and gently started declining as nitrogen concentrations were further increased. Likewise, uniformity (NU %) was improved and reached its best values at about 110 ppm of nitrogen concentration. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows an additional impact when N<sub>2 </sub>concentration was increased; first, thickness fell and uniformity decreased up to the range of about 4000 ppm of N<sub>2</sub>, but then the trend reversed itself as the N<sub>2 </sub>concentration increased, significantly flattening out around 24000 ppm of N<sub>2</sub>. Depending on the desired effect on the growth rate and uniformity of the deposited layer, a concentration of N<sub>2 </sub>may be adjusted to achieve the desired effect. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows a different view of the process using similar HfCl<sub>4 </sub>precursor and process parameters, but shows growth rate and uniformity as a function of the flow rate of N<sub>2 </sub>feed gas supplied to the ozone generator. As can be seen in the graph, increasing the flow of N<sub>2 </sub>produced a substantial increase in growth rate and improvement in uniformity of the deposited hafnium oxide layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">Experiments with other ALD precursor chemistries also demonstrated an improvement in deposition of metal oxides when nitrogen feed gas concentrations were increased in the ozone generator. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates a chart showing improvements of the thickness and uniformity (NU %) of a deposited lanthanum oxide film in an ALD process as the amount of nitrogen feed gas supplied to the ozone generator is increased. The precursor used in this case was the rare earth cyclopentadienyl (Cp) compound La(iPrCp<sub>3</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">Additional tests were undertaken to determine whether the strong oxidant N<sub>2</sub>O, when used alone as an oxidizer gas in ALD processes, would cause metal oxide layer growth with HfCl<sub>4 </sub>and TMA precursor chemistries. The N<sub>2</sub>O gas was furnished not from an ozone generation-type device but from a cylinder, and regardless of temperatures used during the ALD process, no growth was observed in this configuration. The active N—O compounds formed during ozone generation, however, were effective in producing uniform layer growth as described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">It was determined that various nitrogen compounds originating from exposure of oxygen and nitrogen to a plasma source result in active compounds that enhance growth rate and uniformity of thin film deposition processes. Some embodiments of the invention may utilize nitrogen and oxygen compounds, particularly excited N—O species obtained from exposure of the component gasses to a plasma source, to obtain uniform growth of metal oxide layers in ALD processes. Those of skill in the relevant arts also appreciate that use of excited N—O species may also be used in other types of deposition processes described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, methods and systems of the invention utilize an activated gas containing ions and active species of nitrogen-oxygen compounds in the form of free radicals (referred to herein as active N<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y </sub>species, where “x” and “y” may comprise any appropriate integers) to enhance deposition of thin film metal oxides including rare earth oxides. After a substrate has been exposed to an ALD precursor pulse/purge cycle in the reactor, the ions/free radicals in the gas are introduced into a reactor with a substrate during an oxidation pulse, with or without an additional oxidizer such as ozone. The introduced gasses are allowed to contact a material to be treated, whereby a desired reaction occurs. In one embodiment, an organo-metallic or metal halide-containing layer of deposited material is oxidized by introduction of the activated N<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y </sub>species with or without an additional oxidizer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">As used herein, “substrate” refers to any surface upon which film processing is performed. For example, a substrate on which processing can be performed, can be comprised of materials such as silicon, silicon oxide, silicon on insulator (SOI), carbon doped silicon oxides, silicon nitride, doped silicon, germanium, gallium arsenide, glass, sapphire, or any other suitable materials such as metals, metal nitrides, metal alloys, or other conductive materials, printed organic or inorganic circuit boards, or thin-film ceramic substrates, depending on the application. In an example embodiment, the substrate comprises a semiconductor. Barrier layers, metals or metal nitrides on a substrate surface include titanium, titanium nitride, tungsten nitride, tantalum and tantalum nitride. Substrates may have any desired dimensions, such as 200 mm or 300 mm diameter wafers, and may also take the form of rectangular or square panels.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">As used herein, “pulse” refers to an introduction of a quantity of a compound that is intermittently or non-continuously introduced into a reaction zone of a reaction chamber. The quantity of a particular compound within each pulse may vary over time, depending on the duration of the pulse. As more fully explained below, the duration of each pulse is selected depending upon a number of factors such as, for example, the volume capacity of the process chamber employed, the vacuum system coupled thereto, and the volatility/reactivity of the particular compound itself.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">Reference will now be made in detail to the present exemplary embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">Some embodiments of the invention provide methods for preparing thin films used in a variety of applications, especially for depositing high-k dielectric materials and barrier materials used in transistor, capacitor, and memory cell fabrication. Some embodiments may include the use of an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process to deposit a metal oxide thin film layer on a substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">The material deposited in a film during ALD deposition may be any desired material such as a dielectric material, a barrier material, a conductive material, a nucleation/seed material or an adhesion material. In one embodiment, the deposited material may be a dielectric material containing oxygen and at least one additional element, such as lanthanum, hafnium, silicon, tantalum, titanium, aluminum, zirconium, or combinations thereof, and in an example embodiment, the deposited material comprises a metal oxide, and more particularly a rare earth metal oxide. In additional embodiments, the dielectric material may contain hafnium oxide, zirconium oxide, tantalum oxide, aluminum oxide, lanthanum oxide, titanium oxide, silicon oxide, silicon nitride, oxynitrides thereof (e.g., HfO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>), silicates thereof (e.g., HfSi<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub>), aluminates thereof (e.g., HfAl<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub>), silicon oxynitrides thereof (e.g., HfSi<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub>N<sub>z</sub>), and combinations thereof. The dielectric material may also contain multiple layers of varying compositions. For example, a laminate film may be formed by depositing a silicon oxide layer onto a hafnium lanthanum oxide layer to form a hafnium lanthanum silicate material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">In one embodiment, methods and systems of the present invention utilize an activated gas containing ions and active species of nitrogen-oxygen compounds in the form of free radicals (hereinafter referred to as active NxOy species) to enhance deposition of thin film metal oxides including rare earth oxides. In an embodiment, the NxOy species are presented to a substrate during a pulse of an ALD process following a metal precursor pulse, possibly with an oxidizer such as ozone.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">Commercially available ozone delivery systems such as those utilized in conjunction with ALD processes commonly rely on the dielectric barrier discharge and often utilize nitrogen in the feed gas to provide consistent ozone generation. Through a complex series of plasma reactions, various NxOy species can also form within the corona from O<sub>2 </sub>in the presence of N<sub>2</sub>. These species, while present in various concentrations in the generator effluent, are unregulated by the delivery system which measures and actively controls the O<sub>3 </sub>concentration only.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">Several ALD processes using ozone are extremely sensitive to the conditions of ozone generation. For example, a wide response in HfO<sub>2 </sub>deposition rate and film uniformity has been experimentally observed as a function of O<sub>2</sub>:N<sub>2 </sub>feed gas ratio and reactor temperature in a cross-flow, thermal ALD reactor HfCl<sub>4</sub>/O<sub>3 </sub>ALD (using pure O<sub>3</sub>) has a process window at low reactor temperature (200-250° C.). At higher temperatures (e.g., 300° C.), uniform HfO<sub>2 </sub>layers were experimentally obtained when N<sub>2 </sub>was added during O<sub>3 </sub>generation. These experimental results support a hypothesis that the reactive species in ozone-based ALD may not be exclusively O<sub>3</sub>, but at 300° C. NxOy species contribute as well.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">Therefore, studies were conducted to first characterize the gaseous species entering (from ozone delivery system) and exiting the ALD reactor as a function of O<sub>2</sub>:N<sub>2 </sub>feed gas ratio, O<sub>3 </sub>concentration, and generator power levels using FTIR. N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5 </sub>and N<sub>2</sub>O are detected at the outlet of the O<sub>3 </sub>delivery unit with N<sub>2</sub>:O<sub>2 </sub>feed gas. The lifetime of O<sub>3 </sub>and the NxOy species were investigated as a function of the reactor temperature and material of coating (HfO<sub>2</sub>, AhO<sub>3</sub>, etc.). FTIR analysis of the reactor effluent during the ozone half-reaction with adsorbed HfO<sub>2</sub>-HfCh was employed to elucidate the role of NxOy species on deposition. ALD deposition rates, film uniformities, and various bulk and electrical film properties for HfO<sub>2 </sub>deposited under various ozone delivery conditions, and based on FTIR, and theories surrounding the role of O<sub>3 </sub>and NxOy species on potential reaction paths are were determined. As a result, some embodiments of the present invention include improved ALD deposition in layer thickness and consistency when using various molecular and excited NxOy species that were introduced to the reaction chamber as an additional output from ozone generation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a method <b>100</b> for depositing a thin metal oxide film using activated gas compounds such as NxOy species is presented. At the beginning (<b>105</b>) of the process <b>100</b>, a substrate is located within a reaction chamber, and heated to a predetermined temperature.

Suitable carrier gases or purge gases may include argon, nitrogen, helium, hydrogen, forming gas, or combinations thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">After the ALD process is initiated (<b>105</b>), a precursor gas is pulsed (<b>110</b>) into a reaction chamber with or without a carrier gas. The precursor gas may comprise any desired compound such as metallic, organo-metallic, or metal halide compounds, including, but not limited to hafnium tetrachloride (HfCl<sub>4</sub>); titanium tetrachloride (TiCl<sub>4</sub>); tantalum pentachloride (TaCl<sub>5</sub>); tantalum pentafluoride (TaF<sub>5</sub>); zirkonium tetrachloride (ZrCl<sub>4</sub>); rare earth betadiketonate compounds including (La(THD)<sub>3</sub>) and (Y(THD)<sub>3</sub>); rare earth cyclopentadienyl (Cp) compounds including La(iPrCp)<sub>3</sub>; rare earth amidinate compounds including lanthanum tris-formamidinate La(FAMD<sub>3</sub>; cyclooctadienyl compounds including rare earth metals; alkylamido compounds including: tetrakis-ethyl-methylamino hafnium (TEMAHf); tetrakis (diethylamino) hafnium ((Et<sub>2</sub>N)<sub>4</sub>Hf or TDEAH); and tetrakis (dimethylamino) hafnium ((Me<sub>2</sub>N)<sub>4</sub>Hf or TDMAH); alkoxides; halide compounds of silicon; silicon tetrachloride; silicon tetrafluoride; and silicon tetraiodide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">During the gas pulses as referred to herein, the substrate in the reaction chamber is exposed to the admitted gas for a predetermined period of time, and this period of time is herein referred to as a pulse interval. The pulse interval for the presentation of the precursor gas to the substrate may be predetermined to be any desired time, and for example may include a time in the range of approximately 300 milliseconds to 5 seconds, and in one embodiment the pulse interval is in the range of 1 second to 3 seconds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">After the substrate has been exposed to the precursor gas for a predetermined pulse interval, the precursor gas is purged (<b>120</b>) from the reaction chamber by admission of a purge gas and/or by evacuation or pumping. Purging time, or the time during which a purging gas is admitted to the reaction chamber to displace and/or remove other gasses or reaction products, may be selected to be any desired time such as approximately 3 to 10 seconds, and may in some embodiments be approximately 500 milliseconds to 5 seconds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">An activated NxOy species gas as defined above is introduced (<b>130</b>) to the reaction chamber, and in one embodiment, a layer of precursor material deposited in step (<b>110</b>) is oxidized by introduction of the activated NxOy species with or without an additional oxidizer. During this step (<b>130</b>) an oxidizer/oxidant gas or combination of oxidizer/oxidant gasses may be admitted concurrently or sequentially into the reaction chamber to react with the first precursor. The NxOy species gas may also be introduced with or without a carrier gas such as nitrogen N<sub>2</sub>, and further in possible combination with an oxidant gas or mixture of oxidant gasses. As mentioned previously, the NxOy species may comprise any activated, ionic or radical N—O compound such as activated nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O*), nitric oxide (NO*), dinitrogen pentoxide (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>*), or nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>*). The NxOy species gas may be generated in any desired manner, and in one embodiment, the NxOy species are created by plasma discharge from an ozone generator being supplied O<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, NO, NH<sub>3 </sub>or any nitrogen bearing molecule wherein concentration of nitrogen bearing molecule is greater than 5 sccm/2000 sccm or 2000 ppm. In another embodiment, the NxOy species are created within or supplied to the reaction chamber by remote or direct plasma methods such as inductively coupled, ECR (electron cyclotron resonance), capactively coupled methods, with any desired feedgas. In yet another embodiment, NxOy species are created by feeding a nitrogen-oxygen gas such as NO or N<sub>2</sub>O into a coronal discharge (such as provided by an ozone generator) (or alternatively a remote or direct plasma source) with no additional oxygen. Additional N<sub>2 </sub>may be provided to the coronal discharge or plasma source along with the nitrogen-oxygen gasses. In yet another embodiment, a stoichiometric amount of N<sub>2</sub>+O<sub>2 </sub>is provided to a coronal discharge or plasma source to produce NxOy* (e.g., NO radicals).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">Any desired oxidizing gas may be used in any step in the present ALD process, and such oxidizing gas may include oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), atomic-oxygen (O), water (H<sub>2</sub>O), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), nitric oxide (NO), dinitrogen pentoxide (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (N<sub>2</sub>), derivatives thereof or combinations thereof.

In one embodiment where the NxOy species is introduced concurrently with an oxidant gas such as an ozone/oxygen (O<sub>3</sub>/O<sub>2</sub>) mixture, the NxOy species may represent greater than 1% of oxidizing flow stream by volume. In an alternate embodiment, the oxidant gas added to the NxOy species gas is an ozone/oxygen (O<sub>3</sub>/O<sub>2</sub>) mixture, such that the ozone is at a concentration within a range from about 12 atomic percent O<sub>3 </sub>of the O<sub>3</sub>/O<sub>2 </sub>mixture to about 18 atomic percent O<sub>3</sub>.</div>

Such a determination may be made based on any desired criteria.

The determination may also be made in the case of another embodiment incorporating a plurality of precursor/purge steps before the NxOy pulse step a desired ratio of a precursors, especially in embodiment wherein multiple different precursors are applied to the substrate before exposure to the NxOy species to obtain a desired substrate such as a ternary metal oxide. For example, in any order, a lanthanum-containing precursor could be used in one precursor pulse and a hafnium-containing precursor in another precursor pulse producing an HfLaO oxide layer after an NxOy pulse step. The process <b>100</b> iterates (<b>160</b>) until the predetermined criteria are satisfied, whereupon, the process terminates (<b>155</b>).</div>
