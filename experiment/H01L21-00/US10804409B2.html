<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Many of the physical properties of a silicon semiconductor have already been understood, whereas many of the physical properties of an oxide semiconductor have been still unclear.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">In particular, an adverse effect of an impurity on an oxide semiconductor has been still unclear.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">There are two factors of carriers in an oxide semiconductor layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">The first factor is oxygen deficiency in an oxide semiconductor layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">The second factor is a donor element or an acceptor element in an oxide semiconductor layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Here, a hydrogen element serves as a carrier (a donor) in an oxide semiconductor layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">Further, since a hydrogen element has a reducing character, it also serves as an element causing oxygen deficiency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">Therefore, it is said that a substance containing a hydrogen element is an element which prevents an oxide semiconductor layer from being highly purified so that the oxide semiconductor layer is not close to an i-type oxide semiconductor layer because a hydrogen element has two factors of inducing carriers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">Note that as a substance containing a hydrogen element, for example, hydrogen, moisture, hydroxide, hydride, and the like can be given.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">As a result of research, the present inventors found that, surprisingly, hydrogen is more likely to enter an oxide semiconductor layer when a large amount of nitrogen is contained in the oxide semiconductor layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">Conversely, hydrogen is less likely to enter an oxide semiconductor layer in which the nitrogen concentration is reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">Specifically, the nitrogen concentration in an oxide semiconductor layer measured by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) is set to 1×10<sup>20 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less (or less than 1×10<sup>20 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>), whereby an oxide semiconductor layer which is difficult for hydrogen to enter can be formed.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">Embodiments and examples will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">It is easily understood by those skilled in the art that modes and details of the present invention can be modified in various ways without departing from the spirit of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">Therefore, the present invention should not be interpreted as being limited to the description of the embodiments and examples below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">Note that in the structures described below, the same portions or portions having similar functions are denoted by the same reference numerals in different drawings, and explanation thereof will not be repeated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">The following embodiments and examples can be combined with each other, as appropriate.</div>
<heading id="h-0008">Embodiment 1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">An example of a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">First, a gate electrode <b>200</b> is formed over a substrate <b>100</b> having an insulating surface. Then, a gate insulating layer <b>300</b> is formed over the gate electrode <b>200</b>, and an oxide semiconductor layer <b>400</b> is formed over the gate insulating layer <b>300</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">As the substrate, any material can be used. For example, a glass substrate, a quartz substrate, a metal substrate, a plastic substrate, or a semiconductor substrate can be used, but the substrate is not limited to these examples.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">In the case where an insulating substrate is used as the substrate, the substrate has an insulating surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">On the other hand, in the case where a metal substrate, a semiconductor substrate, or the like is used as the substrate, the substrate can have an insulating surface when a base insulating layer is formed over the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">Note that a base insulating layer may be formed over the substrate also in the case where an insulating substrate is used as the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">As the gate electrode, any material having conductivity can be used. For example, aluminum, titanium, molybdenum, tungsten, gold, silver, copper, silicon, a variety of alloys, or an oxide conductive layer (typically, indium tin oxide and the like) can be used, but the gate electrode is not limited to these examples. The gate electrode may have a single-layer structure or a stacked-layer structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">As the gate insulating layer, any material having an insulating property can be used. For example, a silicon oxide film, a silicon nitride film, a silicon oxide film containing nitrogen, a silicon nitride film containing oxygen, an aluminum nitride film, an aluminum oxide film, a hafnium oxide film, or the like can be used, but the gate insulating layer is not limited to these examples. The gate insulating layer may have a single-layer structure or a stacked-layer structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">Note that the amount of hydrogen and nitrogen in the gate insulating layer is preferably small so that injection of carriers into the oxide semiconductor layer can be prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">The gate insulating layer in which the amount of hydrogen is small is preferably formed using a deposition gas which does not contain hydrogen (H) or hydride (e.g., SiH<sub>4</sub>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">The gate insulating layer in which the amount of nitrogen is small is preferably formed using a deposition gas which does not contain nitrogen (N) or nitride (e.g., N<sub>2</sub>O or NH<sub>4</sub>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">Therefore, when attention is focused on the point that the amount of hydrogen is small, a gate insulating film formed by a sputtering method is preferably used because hydride (e.g., SiH<sub>4</sub>) is used in a plasma CVD method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">Further, when attention is focused on the point that the amount of nitrogen is small, an oxide film which does not contain nitrogen is preferably used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0063" num="0062">Note that a gate insulating layer formed by a plasma CVD method has fewer defects and has higher film quality than a gate insulating layer formed by a sputtering method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0064" num="0063">Therefore, in some cases, transistor characteristics become favorable when a gate insulating layer formed by a plasma CVD method is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0065" num="0064">Thus, a plasma CVD method, a sputtering method, or another method may be used as appropriate as needed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0066" num="0065">Note that in the case where a gate insulating layer formed by a plasma CVD method is used, a substance containing a hydrogen element is eliminated from the gate insulating layer when heat treatment is performed; therefore, in the case where a plasma CVD method is used, heat treatment (at higher than or equal to 200° C. and lower than or equal to 1000° C. (preferably, higher than or equal to 300° C. and lower than or equal to 800° C.)) is preferably performed after the gate insulating layer is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0067" num="0066">Note that as a substance containing a hydrogen element, for example, hydrogen, moisture, hydroxide, hydride, and the like can be given.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0068" num="0067">Examples of the oxide semiconductor layer include, but not limited to, In—Ga—Zn—O-based oxide (containing indium, gallium, zinc, and oxygen as the main components), In—Sn—Zn—O-based oxide (containing indium, tin, zinc, and oxygen as the main components), In—Al—Zn—O-based oxide (containing indium, aluminum, zinc, and oxygen as the main components), Sn—Ga—Zn—O-based oxide (containing tin, gallium, zinc, and oxygen as the main components), Al—Ga—Zn—O-based oxide (containing aluminum, gallium, zinc, and oxygen as the main components), Sn—Al—Zn—O-based oxide (containing tin, aluminum, zinc, and oxygen as the main components), In—Zn—O-based oxide (containing indium, zinc, and oxygen as the main components), Sn—Zn—O-based oxide (containing tin, zinc, and oxygen as the main components), Al—Zn—O-based oxide (containing aluminum, zinc, and oxygen as the main components), In—O-based oxide (oxide of indium (indium oxide)), Sn—O-based oxide (oxide of tin (tin oxide)), Zn—O-based oxide (oxide of zinc (zinc oxide)), and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0069" num="0068">The oxide semiconductor layer can be formed by a sputtering method, an evaporation method, or the like, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0070" num="0069">The thickness of the oxide semiconductor layer is preferably 5 nm to 1 μm (more preferably, 20 nm to 80 nm).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0071" num="0070">In the case where the oxide semiconductor layer is formed, careful attention needs to be paid so that nitrogen is not contained in the oxide semiconductor layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0072" num="0071">Specifically, the oxide semiconductor layer is preferably formed so that the nitrogen concentration in the oxide semiconductor layer measured by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) is 1×10<sup>20 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less (or less than 1×10<sup>20 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>), 5×10<sup>19 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less (or less than 5×10<sup>19 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>), 1×10<sup>19 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less (or less than 1×10<sup>19 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>), 5×10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less (or less than 5×10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>), or 1×10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less (or less than 1×10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0073" num="0072">Note that nitrogen is less likely to enter the oxide semiconductor layer even in the case where the oxide semiconductor layer is subjected to heat treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0074" num="0073">Therefore, the nitrogen concentration in the oxide semiconductor layer after the semiconductor device is completed, which is measured by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), is also preferably 1×10<sup>20 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less (or less than 1×10<sup>20 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>), 5×10<sup>19 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less (or less than 5×10<sup>19 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>), 1×10<sup>19 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less (or less than 1×10<sup>19 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>), 5×10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less (or less than 5×10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>), or 1×10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less (or less than 1×10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0075" num="0074">Note that as the value of the nitrogen concentration, the average value in the effective range of secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) can be adopted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0076" num="0075">Alternatively, as the value of the nitrogen concentration, the maximum value in the effective range of secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) may be adopted (when the maximum value in the effective range is smaller than a predetermined value, the average value in the effective range is also smaller than the predetermined value).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0077" num="0076">Here, an example of a sputtering apparatus is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0078" num="0077">The sputtering apparatus in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> includes a deposition chamber <b>2001</b>, a cover <b>2002</b>, a target <b>2003</b>, and a pump <b>2004</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0079" num="0078">Note that a structure is employed in which a substrate is put to be provided for the cover <b>2002</b> and the target <b>2003</b> is sputtered for deposition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0079">The deposition chamber <b>2001</b> and the cover <b>2002</b> are connected to each other, and an O-ring <b>2005</b> is provided for a connecting portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0080">The deposition chamber <b>2001</b> and the target <b>2003</b> are connected to each other, and an O-ring <b>2006</b> is provided for a connecting portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0082" num="0081">The deposition chamber <b>2001</b> and the pump <b>2004</b> are connected to each other, and a metal gasket <b>2007</b> and a metal gasket <b>2008</b> are provided for connecting portions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0082">Both the O-rings and the metal gaskets are used to prevent leakage from the connecting portion. In other words, by the O-rings and the metal gaskets, air (in particular, nitrogen) is prevented from entering the deposition chamber <b>2001</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0084" num="0083">The O-ring is a ring-like packing. A material thereof is, for example, rubber.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0085" num="0084">The metal gasket is a ring-like fixing sealant. A material thereof is, for example, metal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0086" num="0085">The cover <b>2002</b> and the target <b>2003</b> are frequently opened and closed; therefore, the O-ring is used because it can be easily put on and taken off.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0087" num="0086">On the other hand, the pump is hardly opened and closed. Although the metal gasket is not easily put on and taken off, the metal gasket is provided for the pump because it can improve airtightness compared with the O-ring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0088" num="0087">In the case where the O-ring or the metal gasket has a chip, a crack, or the like, leakage occurs, so that air outside the deposition chamber <b>2001</b> enters the deposition chamber <b>2001</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0089" num="0088">Since air contains a large amount of nitrogen, careful attention needs to be paid so that the O-ring or the metal gasket does not have a chip, a crack, or the like in order to prevent air (in particular, nitrogen) due to the chip, the crack, or the like of the O-ring or the metal gasket from entering the deposition chamber <b>2001</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">Although the maintenance needs to be further done, it is effective to replace all the O-rings with metal gaskets which can improve airtightness because air (in particular, nitrogen) can be prevented from entering the deposition chamber <b>2001</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">On the other hand, in the case where nitrogen is attached to or enters the inner wall of the deposition chamber <b>2001</b> or a surface of the target <b>2003</b> or in the case where nitrogen floats in the deposition chamber <b>2001</b> even when air (in particular, nitrogen) is prevented from entering the deposition chamber <b>2001</b>, nitrogen might enter an oxide semiconductor layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0092" num="0091">Thus, in order to remove nitrogen which is attached to or enters the inner wall of the deposition chamber, the deposition chamber is heated at higher than or equal to 200° C. and lower than or equal to 500° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0093" num="0092">The deposition chamber is heated, whereby nitrogen which is attached to or enters the inner wall of the deposition chamber is released into the deposition chamber.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0094" num="0093">Then, nitrogen which is released through heating of the deposition chamber is evacuated with the use of the pump <b>2004</b>, whereby nitrogen which is attached to or enters the inner wall of the deposition chamber can be removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0095" num="0094">Further, after the heat treatment and the evacuation treatment are performed on the deposition chamber and before the oxide semiconductor layer used for a semiconductor device is formed, a step of forming an oxide semiconductor layer over a dummy substrate is preferably performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0096" num="0095">When the step of forming the oxide semiconductor layer over the dummy substrate is performed, nitrogen which is attached to or enters the surface of the target can be removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0097" num="0096">Further, since nitrogen which remains in the deposition chamber due to the step of forming the oxide semiconductor layer over the dummy substrate is taken into the oxide semiconductor layer over the dummy substrate, nitrogen which remains in the deposition chamber can be removed before the oxide semiconductor layer used for the semiconductor device is formed.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0359" num="0358">Here, with the use of computational science (it is also called simulation although there is a difference between computational science and simulation in a strict sense), calculation was performed to examine behavior in the case where a donor was present in the back channel.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0360" num="0359">Therefore, it was found that, when the insulating layer <b>600</b> formed under the condition where hydrogen was not used as a sputtering gas was used, the threshold voltage was prevented from shifting in a negative direction.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0362" num="0361">Note that in this example, the second heat treatment was performed at 350° C. for 1 hour.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0366" num="0365">The reason why the case where the substrate temperature was set to 200° C. was better in the BT test was found to be that, by increase in the substrate temperature during the formation of the insulating layer <b>600</b>, moisture on a surface of the back channel was removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0367" num="0366">Therefore, the substrate temperature during the formation of the insulating layer <b>600</b> is preferably 200° C. or higher (the upper limit is not limited, but can be set to 300° C. or lower, 400° C. or lower, 500° C. or lower, 600° C. or lower, or 700° C. or lower).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0371" num="0370">Next, the substrate which has been immersed in water was heated at 120° C. for 3 minutes in an air atmosphere to be dried, whereby the characteristics of the transistor were slightly recovered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0372" num="0371">Next, the substrate which has been dried for 3 minutes was heated at 120° C. for 10 minutes (13 minutes in total) in an air atmosphere, whereby the characteristics of the transistor were further recovered.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0374" num="0373">Thus, it is found that when moisture is attached to the surface of the back channel, the characteristics of the transistor are influenced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0375" num="0374">A small amount of moisture such as the one which is attached to the surface of the back channel can be removed by heat treatment at 120° C. for 53 minutes or more.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0461" num="0460">Note that it is clear that a similar reaction occurs even when an oxide semiconductor layer other than an In—Ga—Zn—O-based oxide semiconductor layer is used because a reaction of this example is a reaction between oxygen and titanium (Ti).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0462" num="0461">Therefore, the second heat treatment is preferably performed at 250° C. or higher (the upper limit is not limited, but can be set to 300° C. or lower, 400° C. or lower, 500° C. or lower, 600° C. or lower, or 700° C. or lower).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0463" num="0462">Note that a material having low resistance (a film containing aluminum as its main component, a film containing copper as its main component, or the like) is preferably formed over the titanium layer <b>1604</b> because the wiring resistance can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0464" num="0463">This application is based on Japanese Patent Application serial no. 2009-281505 filed with Japan Patent Office on Dec. 11, 2009, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</div>
