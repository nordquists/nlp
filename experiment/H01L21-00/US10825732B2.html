<heading id="h-0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method for the production of layers of solid material and to a device for the production of layers of solid material, in particular wafers.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">In many technical domains (e.g. microelectronic or photovoltaic technology) materials, such as e.g. silicon, germanium or sapphire, are often needed in the form of thin discs and plates (so-called wafers). As standard, such wafers are currently produced by sawing from an ingot, relatively large material losses (“kerf loss”) occurring. Since the source material used is often very expensive, great efforts are being made to produce such wafers with less material consumption and so more efficiently and inexpensively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, with the currently normal methods almost 50% of the material used is lost as “kerf loss” when producing silicon wafers for solar cells alone. Considered globally, this corresponds to an annual loss of more than 2 billion euros. Since the cost of the wafer makes up the greatest percentage of the cost of the finished solar cell (over 40%), the cost of solar cells could be significantly reduced by making appropriate improvements to the wafer production.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Methods which dispense with the conventional sawing and can separate thin wafers directly from a thicker workpiece, e.g. by using temperature-induced stresses, appear to be particularly attractive for this type of wafer production without kerf loss (“kerf-free wafering”). These include in particular methods as described e.g. in PCT/US2008/012140 and PCT/EP2009/067539 where a polymer layer applied to the workpiece is used in order to produce these stresses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">In the aforementioned methods the polymer layer has a thermal expansion coefficient that is higher by approximately two orders of magnitude in comparison to the workpiece. Moreover, by utilising a glass transition a relatively high elasticity modulus can be achieved in the polymer layer so that sufficiently large stresses can be induced in the polymer layer/workpiece layer system by cooling in order to enable the separation of the wafer from the workpiece.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">In the method according to the current prior art, the breaking process, which leads to separation of the wafer from the workpiece, is initiated randomly, neither the precise time of initiating the break nor the location being able to be specified. Often the break starts at a random weakpoint of the wafer, mostly at the edge or at the periphery, at a moment where the stress exceeds a critical value locally. As a result of this uncertainty regarding the location and time of the break being initiated, it is difficult to guarantee a stress field that is optimal for the breaking process at the time of initiating the break and at the place of initiating the break. This may lead to an unfavourable course of the break front and in particular to significant thickness variations of the separated wafer. Often, for example, the break runs in a number of break fronts along different directions, large and often abrupt thickness variations in the separated wafer possibly occurring if they converge again subsequently or disadvantageous overlapping of these break fronts taking place.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide an appropriate method and an appropriate device for the production of layers of solid material and/or plates of solid material which improve the quality of the wafers produced in comparison to the known methods, in particular by the curvature of the separated layers of solid material or wafers being reduced and an even layer thickness of the wafer being produced. Additional objects of the present invention are to reduce the undesirable oscillations that occur during the break propagation, to improve the heat contact with the layer system and additionally to enable simpler and gentler handling of the layers of solid material and or plates of solid material after separation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">The aforementioned object is achieved according to the invention by a method for the production of layers of solid material, in particular for use as wafers, according to the subject matter of claim <b>1</b>. The production method according to the invention comprises the following steps here: providing a workpiece for the separation of the layers of solid material, the workpiece having at least one exposed surface, producing and/or providing a carrier unit for receiving at least one layer of solid material, the carrier unit having a receiving layer for holding the layer of solid material, attaching the receiving layer to the exposed surface of the workpiece, thus forming a composite structure, producing a break initiation point by means of pre-defined local stress induction in the peripheral region, in particular at the edge, of the workpiece or wafer, and separating the layer of solid material from the workpiece starting from the break initiation point.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">It is therefore the idea of the present invention to introduce one or more defined local stress peaks into the layer system in order to specifically influence the break initiation. By means of spatially local stress peaks the location of the break initiation can thus be chosen, while by means of temporal stress peaks (stress pulses) the time of the break initiation can be controlled.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, the present invention provides a method for the production of wafers which improves the quality of the wafers produced in comparison to previous methods by being able to control the location and/or time of break initiation better. With the present invention, i.e. with the use of layer systems with defined local stress peaks the problems known from the prior art are therefore eliminated, and the object specified above is thus resolved in an extremely advantageous manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">The solution according to the invention is therefore based on the knowledge that in the methods according to the previous prior art, the separation of a wafer starts in each case at the edge of the wafer, and mostly at a corner. It has been possible to demonstrate this knowledge by means of video recordings using a high speed camera. The wafer starts to separate from this point by generally two break fronts running along the edge of the wafer in respectively opposing circulating directions and finally converging again on approximately the opposite side of the wafer. Only after this does the centre of the wafer separate. This behaviour can be explained by the fact that the edge of the wafer always has significantly more defects in the material in comparison to the inside, and this leads to locally reduced breaking strength, due to which the separation of the wafer along the edge is ultimately possible with relatively smaller stresses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">Additional advantageous configurations of the invention are the subject matter of the sub-claims.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">In the examples of use described here a thicker wafer is preferably used as the workpiece, from which wafer one or a number of thinner wafers are separated using the described method according to the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention the pre-defined local stress induction is brought about by exposing the workpiece to locally introduced forces, local tempering, in particular cooling, local exposure to waves, in particular sound waves or light waves, local exposure to fields, in particular electromagnetic fields, local exposure to electricity and/or local exposure to radiation from a radiation source.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">In addition or alternatively it is also possible, by specifically generating regions/layers of different temperatures in the polymer, to generate corresponding regions/layers with different thermal expansion coefficients and elasticity moduli. Under certain circumstances, physical values other than the temperature can also influence the thermal expansion coefficient of a corresponding polymer layer locally (e.g. swelling due to solvent) and can then be used for the specific generation of regions/layers with different thermal expansion coefficients.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">Moreover, the mechanical stress distribution in the layer structure is not only determined by the local thermal expansion coefficient and the local elasticity modulus, but also directly by the local temperature in the layer structure. In this way it is also possible to generate a desired stress distribution by generating a specific temperature distribution (e.g. using individually regulatable cooling zones) in the layer structure. For example, a single, very small area within the layer structure in the peripheral region of the wafer can be cooled to lower temperatures than the rest of the layer structure, and this leads to a local stress peak being generated here in the peripheral region. Needless to say, other geometries for such zones with different cooling are also possible and are in accordance with the invention. The targeted local introduction of a defined cooling capacity into the layer system is, moreover, facilitated if surface structural elements are made of a well thermally conductive and stable material, such as e.g. metal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">Moreover, it is not only the current temperature distribution in the layer structure that has an effect upon the current stress distribution, but also the temporal change in temperature. In particular, many material properties of the polymer are also dependent upon the rate of cooling: For example, very rapid cooling (with cooling rates over 10 K/s) of specific regions may enable local stress peaks in the polymer layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">In particular, additional external forces can also be exerted specifically upon defined regions of the layer system during the cooling process before separating the wafer in order to generate defined local stress peaks. For example, a needle-shaped metal tip can be pressed against the polymer film in the region of the wafer edge in order to generate a local stress peak in the layer system here. This embodiment is advantageous because it provides a great abundance of different effects in order to generate a break initiation point.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention a stabilisation layer is disposed over the receiving layer, by means of which a composite structure is formed and the local stress induction is brought about by at least one stress inducing means formed in the composite structure and which generates a stress peak in the layer of solid material to be separated such that the break initiation point is formed. This embodiment is advantageous because the stress inducing means can be configured, provided and tested as specified spatially and geometrically without a workpiece being required. Furthermore, this type of stress inducing means can particularly preferably be re-used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">For generation of thermally induced stress the wafer is preferably pre-cooled to a temperature at which a stress which comes beneath the limit stress is established. The material of the receiving layer or the polymer is advantageously below its glass transition temperature due to the pre-cooling. With the aid of an exposure device, in particular a laser, energy is applied to a specific point of the composite structure, in particular the wafer polymer composite, by means of a time-limited pulse—preferably in a locally limited part of the wafer edge. In addition or alternatively, the thermal stresses can be generated by very strong light and/or a (preferably small) heating point in the wafer's holder which can be made very hot very quickly and/or are generated by touching the wafer with a sufficiently hot object such as e.g. a hot rod and/or by a hot fluid, in particular a hot gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">Alternatively, it is conceivable for energy to be extracted at a specific point of the composite structure, in particular the wafer/polymer composite e.g. with the aid of cold gas, in particular with nitrogen steam, preferably generated from liquid nitrogen, or e.g. directly with liquid nitrogen by means of a time-limited flow of steam or liquid—preferably in a locally limited part of the wafer edge. Cold gas can alternatively also be generated by the adiabatic relaxation of gases—the temperature must preferably be clearly below the glass transition temperature (e.g. 100 K), at least however 5K and preferably at least 25K and particularly preferably at least 50K below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">Thermal stresses resulting from the local heating or local cooling will exceed the required minimum limit stress for the removal of the wafer (for silicon the theoretical value is 1.7 GPa, and this is clearly reduced e.g. by doping and grid impurities and by non-ideal edge finishes) or stress increases can be established by the thermally induced stresses. In this way the crack is initiated directly and the splitting process begins. Typically, this ends after less than 1 ms. The method thus ensures that the splitting time is defined as soon as sufficient stress for the crack initialisation is expended or generated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">In addition or alternatively, utilisation of the inverse piezo effect is possible. That is to say, elastomers have piezoelectric properties, due to which the following structure can be chosen by utilising the inverse piezo effect.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">The solid or wafer is pre-cooled to a temperature at which a stress is established which comes below the limit stress. The polymer is advantageously at below the glass transition temperature. At one point of the wafer (preferably at the edge) an electrode lies on the polymer and a second electrode touches the wafer. By applying sufficient stress the polymer can be made to contract and so the required limit stress is exceeded. This results in the crack also being initiated directly and the splitting process starting. Typically, this has also ended after less than 1 ms. The method therefore likewise ensures that the time of splitting is defined as soon as sufficient stress is expended in order to initialise the crack.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">In addition or alternatively, stresses can be generated by means of sound waves which come above the limit stress. That is to say, sound waves can be used to introduce energy locally. In order to utilise sound waves the following structure is preferably chosen. The solid or wafer is preferably likewise pre-cooled to a temperature at which a stress which comes below the limit stress is established. The polymer is likewise advantageously at below the glass transition temperature. Sound waves are injected into the solid and/or the receiving layer or into the composite structure such that at one point sufficient energy is introduced (preferably at the edge) in order to exceed the required limit stress, by means of which in turn the crack is initiated in a temporally defined manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">Temporally defined initiation of a crack in the solid offers considerable advantages in comparison to the methods known from the prior art, in particular within the industrial context, e.g. as regards process time reliability and quality management.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027">According to another preferred embodiment the stress inducing means is a local inconstancy or a locally tightly limited strong spatial change in the E modulus, the thermal expansion coefficient and/or the thickness of the stabilisation layer and/or the receiving layer. In particular, such inconstancies occur at the edges of the stabilisation layer and/or the receiving layer and can be specifically influenced by the choice of corresponding edge geometries.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0029" num="0028">According to another preferred embodiment the stress inducing means is a projection formed on the stabilisation layer and/or the receiving layer, in particular with a pointed end, or a recess formed in the latter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0030" num="0029">In this regard it has been recognised that the reason for the break starting in the corner is that there could be local peaks in the mechanical stress field which are caused by the angular geometry of the layer system. Tests in which different geometries were investigated for the layer system applied to the wafer confirm this. Therefore, the breaks each preferably start in regions of the layer system with sharp edges and corners, and far less in areas with large curvature radii.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030">In one exemplary embodiment layer components with defined geometries are made of different materials which are characterised by different thermal expansion coefficients, are securely connected (e.g. by adhesion or lamination) to one another to form a layer structure at a higher temperature (e.g. between ambient temperature and) 150°. The geometry of at least one of the components of the layer structure has at least one region here with sharp corners or edges (i.e. with very small local curvature radii). If this layer structure is then cooled after solidification, stress fields occur due to the different thermal expansions in the layer structure, definable local stress peaks occurring in at least one region. In the following it is described how this type of layer structure can be produced e.g. using pre-produced polymer films and structural elements made of metal of a specific form and can be used for the separation of wafers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">The receiving layer is preferably formed by at least one polymer, the at least one polymer or the polymer produced from a number of materials preferably being made or at least partially formed from one or more duroplasts and/or from one or more elastomers and/or from one or more thermoplasts and/or from one or more thermoplastic elastomers. The polymer thus preferably comprises at least one plastic, in particular at least one elastomer, in particular at least one silicone, in particular at least one RTV silicone and/or at least one HTV silicone, in particular at least one polydimethysiloxane (PDMS) or is preferably made of at least one plastic, in particular at least one elastomer, in particular at least one silicone, in particular at least one RTV silicone and/or at least one HTV silicone, in particular at least one polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Thus, a polydiorganosiloxane, for example, can particularly preferably be used as a polymer, e.g. polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMS). In the following a film made of PDMS is preferably used as the polymer layer or receiving layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">Aluminium plates are preferably described as structural elements or stabilisation layer/s and a thick wafer made of silicon is preferably described as a workpiece; however, other suitable polymers, structural element materials and workpieces (e.g. made of other materials such as gallium arsenide, germanium, gallium nitride, silicon carbide, sapphire, etc.) can also be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">PDMS is preferably used to produce the polymer films. This is a two-component mixture that is cured thermally (preferred mix ratios between curing agents: base materials have ratios in particular of 1:30 to 1:3). Temperatures from ambient temperature up to approx 200° C., preferably from ambient temperature up to approx. 120° C., are used for curing—depending on the curing time. Curing times are preferably between approx. 1-120 minutes (at high temperatures) and 1-6 days (at ambient temperature). Before curing, PDMS is a viscous liquid that is applied to a smooth surface (e.g. a mirror) e.g. by means of a casting process and is cured here to form a film. The film is then removed from this surface (e.g. mechanically), is optionally processed further and is then applied to the surface to be coated. Moreover, the finished film can already be inspected prior to application and its quality can be checked (e.g. using normal mechanical, optical or electrical measuring methods, etc.). In addition to the method described here for the production of film, many other methods are commonly used in the industry (e.g. production by means of extrusion) which can also be used for the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">Structural elements or a stabilisation layer made of another material are then adhered to a first film produced in this way. In the following a plate made of aluminium is described as the structural element; however, structural elements made of other suitable materials (e.g. brass, steel, silicon, glass etc.) can also be used. Preferably, the thermal expansion coefficients of the film and the structural elements differ greatly (at least by a factor of 2 to 5). Aluminium, for example, has a thermal expansion coefficient that is smaller by approximately one to two orders of magnitude than PDMS. The structural elements and/or specific regions of the PDMS film are produced here in a pre-defined form, i.e. in particular with at least one sharp corner, projection or edge in order to generate the desired local stress peaks. In the exemplary embodiment described a metal plate, for example, is used, the area and form of which corresponds approximately to that of the wafer, the difference being that its edge at one point tapers to a sharp corner and everywhere else is rounded.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">Good adhesion between the receiving layer or the film and the stabilisation layer or the structural elements is also important here because the connection between the structural element/s and the film must be able to withstand sufficiently large shearing forces for the separation and sufficiently large temperature variations for the thermal induction of the required stresses. The adhesion can be improved e.g. by mechanically roughening the metal surface, anodizing the aluminium, cauterizing processes, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">A polymer film, for example, in particular a thin PDMS film, can be used as an adhesive for adhering the film. The PDMS is preferably applied thinly (a few millilitres for a 6 inch wafer) in the liquid state here, preferably to both surfaces to be adhered. Then the film is placed over the metal plate and pressed on with a roller or cylinder applying slight pressure. By moving the roller to and fro the adhesive film is distributed beneath the film and air bubbles are removed. The adhesive can cure at temperatures between ambient temperature and approx. 200° C. The curing times vary dependently upon the curing temperature as with film production (see above). Alternatively to the method described, the film can also be adhered to the metal plate using other conventional methods, e.g. using a vacuum laminator. Furthermore, the film can also be connected directly (without adhesive) to the surface of the metal plate, e.g. by means of “plasma activated bonding” (e.g. activation of the PDMS film in nitrogen plasma, pressing the film onto the metal plate, optionally “annealing”) or e.g. by the lamination (melting on) of a thermoplastic film (e.g. Geniomer von Wacker silicones).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">After adhering the receiving layer or the first polymer film to the stabilisation layer or the metal plate and after the curing of the adhesive, the workpiece (in the present example a thick silicon wafer) is adhered to the first polymer film by means of a similar method, and then a second, generally a thicker, polymer film is preferably adhered to the side of the wafer that is still free—in particular using a similar method. Finally, in the present example the lateral edges of all of the polymer films are trimmed so that they have the desired edge geometry.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">Within the framework of an alternative process it is preferably also possible to adhere one or both of the polymer layers used not as a ready-made film, but to produce it/them directly in situ. For example, both the structural elements and the wafers can be cast directly with liquid PDMS with the aid of a shuttering device to form a composite structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">Independently of the respective exemplary embodiment it is the case that: The required thicknesses and material properties (in particular thermal expansion coefficients and elasticity moduli) of the polymer layers used and of the metal plate or the structural elements depend upon the thicknesses and material properties of the workpiece and the desired target thickness of the wafer to be separated. With the examples of use described, a 400 micrometre thick, monocrystalline, pseudo-quadratic 6-inch silicon wafer with &lt;100&gt; orientation is preferably split in half into two 200 micrometre thick wafers. For this purpose the following thicknesses are particularly preferably used: The stabilisation layer or metal plate, in particular made of aluminium and between 0.5 and 5 millimetres thick, the receiving layer or the first polymer layer (between the metal plate and the workpiece), in particular between 0.2 and 5 millimetres thick, the second polymer layer, in particular between 0.2 and 10 millimetres thick. The lateral dimensions of the polymer layers correspond respectively to those of the wafer, in this exemplary embodiment the edges lying one over the other flush with the wafer edge. The lateral dimensions of the metal plate preferably also correspond, as mentioned, to those of the wafer, apart from the fact that preferably at least one or precisely one point of the edge tapers to a sharp corner of the metal plate and the rest of the peripheral regions are rounded.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">After the metal plate with structural elements/polymer layer/workpiece/polymer layer system is produced, e.g. using one of the previously described exemplary embodiments, and the polymer is cured, as is normal in the Applicant's patent applications described in relation to the prior art, a thin wafer is separated from the workpiece, e.g. by thermally induced stresses, part of the layer structure (in the examples described the second polymer layer) still adhering to one side of the wafer. This layer structure can then be separated from the wafer produced e.g. by mechanical or chemical methods, as described in the aforementioned references. The other part of the layer structure with the structural elements (in the examples described the first polymer layer, and on the latter the metal plate) still adheres correspondingly on one side to the remaining workpiece. This part can also be separated e.g. by mechanical or chemical methods, as described in the aforementioned references or patent applications of the Applicant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">After the layer structure (with or without the structural elements connected) has been separated from the wafer produced, it can—if so desired—be cleaned and then be applied to a new workpiece. In this way it is possible to use the same layer structure (with or without the structural elements connected) a number of times in order to produce wafers. This can significantly reduce material consumption and the cost of the whole process. For re-use of the layer structure it is particularly advantageous to use a re-soluble adhesive in order to attach the workpiece because in this case, after the adhesive layer on the layer structure has dissolved, no adhesive residue remains.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">In the exemplary embodiments described it is shown how mechanical stress peaks in layer structures consisting of polymer layers and structural elements made of other materials (in particular materials with substantially smaller thermal expansion coefficients than the polymers used, i.e. in particular metals) can be used to resolve the problems mentioned at the start in the production of wafers. In order to produce corresponding layer structures consisting of components each with different thermal expansion coefficients, one does not, however, necessarily have to combine different materials: It is e.g. also possible to produce polymer layers with different thermal expansion coefficients by processing the polymer used differently (in particular different curing). Moreover, the thermal expansion coefficient and the elasticity modulus of the polymer used is greatly dependent upon the temperature (with a distinct glass transition at approx. −125° C. where e.g. the elasticity modulus increases by a number of orders of magnitude, while the thermal expansion coefficient decreases by approximately, substantially or precisely a factor of 4).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">In additional or alternative exemplary embodiments stress distributions with defined local stress peaks are incorporated directly into the layer structure during production. This can be achieved, for example, as follows: Before e.g. a polymer layer (e.g. a ready-made polymer film) is connected (e.g. adhered) to another layer, a defined region of this polymer layer is exposed to defined mechanical pre-stressing, in particular with a local stress peak. This can take place, for example, by a region of the polymer film, prior to adhesion, being subjected to tensile stressing in one or more directions by defined external forces, for example by external mechanical pulling at the edges of the film or by external mechanical bending of the film. After the adhesive has cured, the outer forces are deactivated, but the layer composite remains under stress. Moreover, external forces can also be used to pre-stress any other components of the layer system: thus e.g. in order to generate local stress peaks, instead of or in addition to the polymer layer, regions of the wafer can also be subjected to tensile stress or be bent by external forces prior to adhesion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention the stress inducing means extends with its longitudinal axis in the longitudinal direction and/or in the depth direction of the stabilisation layer. This embodiment is advantageous because the stress inducing means can be used at will for the defined stress induction by means of the respective alignment of its longitudinal axis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, a number of stress inducing means are formed on the stabilisation layer in the circumferential direction of the stabilisation layer or the metal plate. This embodiment is advantageous because break initiation points can be generated at a number of points on the wafer edge at the same time or staggered in time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention the stress inducing means is a projection formed on the receiving layer or the polymer layer or a recess formed in the latter. This embodiment is advantageous because the polymer layer preferably rests directly against the workpiece and so stresses brought about by the geometry of the polymer layer are generated directly in the workpiece.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the local stress induction is brought about by means of a pulse emitting device, the pulse emitting device emitting waves, in particular sound waves or light waves. This embodiment is advantageous because the pulse strength, the pulse frequency, the pulse duration and/or pulse direction can preferably be adjusted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention a number of pulse emitting devices are arranged in the circumferential direction of the workpiece and stresses are induced by means of the pulse emitting devices at a number of points provided in the circumferential direction of the workpiece. This embodiment is advantageous because any number of break initiation points can be generated at the same time or staggered in time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049">According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention the local stress induction is brought about by means of a stress inducing means and a pulse emitting device, the stress inducing means being formed by a geometric configuration of the composite structure, and the pulse emitting device emitting waves, in particular light waves or sound waves. This embodiment is advantageous because a first stress can be generated in the workpiece, e.g. by means of the stress inducing means, and a second or additional stress or stress increase can be brought about by the pulse emitting device. The pulses emitted by the pulse emitting device can therefore preferably be understood as break initiating pulses, and the stresses induced by the stress inducing means can preferably be understood as basic stresses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the local stress induction by means of the stress inducing means and the pulse emitting device take place at least at times and preferably always at the same time or staggered in time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">The temporal interplay of the external forces is, furthermore, to be considered along with the sequence of the cooling process because this is also of great significance: Since essential material properties such as e.g. elasticity moduli of the polymer layers take on substantially different values above the glass transition temperature than below the glass transition temperature, it is important for the stress distribution whether external forces are exerted only above or only below the glass transition or at all temperatures. Moreover, material properties, such as elasticity moduli, in particular in the polymer, can also be influenced by exerting external forces (e.g. the molecular chains of the polymer can be aligned along the external forces, and so the polymer becomes anisotropic).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">Stress peaks can be defined not only spatially, but also temporally. For example, external forces can be exerted upon the layer system as a temporally narrowly limited pulse, for example also as a sound pulse. Or, for example, a specific region of the layer system can be cooled temporally very quickly (abruptly). Furthermore, it is conceivable for stress peaks to be combined and defined spatially and temporally. This embodiment is advantageous because in this way the time of the break initiation can be influenced or controlled.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention the local stress induction is brought about by the stress inducing means over a longer time than by the pulse emitting device, the pulse emitting device being controlled in particular dependently upon the stress inducing means. This embodiment is advantageous because the stresses induced by the different devices/means can thus be matched optimally to one another.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0055" num="0054">Furthermore, according to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, pre-defined stress distribution within the workpiece is induced in order to influence, in particular to specify in a defined manner, a separation sequence when separating the layer of solid material from the workpiece, and the layer of solid material is separated from the workpiece along a plane extending within the workpiece according to the separating sequence influenced by the pre-defined stress distribution. This embodiment is advantageous since by means of the controlled or manipulated or influenced crack propagation, advantageous effects with regard to the thickness of the layer of solid material can be brought about.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0056" num="0055">According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the pre-defined stress distribution constitutes stress distribution according to which the stress intensity within a plane of the workpiece passing from the centre of the workpiece towards the peripheral regions of the workpiece is at least partially different, the stress intensity in the centre of the workpiece preferably being greater than close to the peripheral regions of the workpiece. This embodiment is advantageous because it also has a positive effect upon the crack propagation, by means of which very homogeneous layers of solid material can be generated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0057" num="0056">According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention the receiving layer preferably comprises a polymer or is made at least partially and particularly preferably entirely of a polymer, when exposing the composite structure, that preferably consists at the very least of the receiving layer and the workpiece, to an inner and/or outer stress field, at least one part, and preferably a number of parts of the polymer, in particular PDMS, undergoing precisely one glass transition, at least one glass transition or a number of glass transitions, in particular temporally staggered glass transitions. It is conceivable here for the initiation of the glass transition to be brought about as a result e.g. of mechanical and/or chemical and/or thermal and/or acoustic effects or exposures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0058" num="0057">According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, by tempering the receiving layer basic stresses in the workpiece are generated, the basic stresses being smaller than the stresses required for crack initiation and an additional local increase in stress being brought about by the pre-defined local stress induction in the peripheral region, by means of which the break is initiated, a period of time between generating the basic stresses and the local stress induction being specified or set in a defined manner. This solution is advantageous because the intensity of the basic stresses can be set very precisely below the stress intensity required for the crack initiation, and after setting the basic stresses the crack initiation can initiate a crack or break, preferably at any time, by means of a further pulse, in particular local exposure of the workpiece in the peripheral region. Since the intensity of the crack initiation stresses is preferably greater than the intensity of the crack guiding stresses, by means of this solution, for example, no stresses induced over the whole surface need be generated in the region of the crack initiating stresses, by means of which clearly more precise crack guidance is made possible because overall clearly less energy is introduced into the workpiece.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0059" num="0058">Furthermore, a result of the preferably temporal staggering of the basic stress generation and the local stress induction is that the basic stresses can first of all be generated in a defined manner and at a preferably downstream point in time the additional stresses required to initiate a crack are generated locally. For example, the basic stresses are generated by the tempering, in particular the cooling of the receiving layer, and one, two, three or more seconds later, fractions of this also being conceivable (such as e.g. 0.1 secs, or 1.25 secs, or 0.001 secs), generation of the local stresses is brought about by means of exposing the composite structure, in particular the workpiece, to locally introduced forces, local tempering, in particular cooling or heating, local exposure to waves, in particular sound waves or light waves, local exposure to fields, in particular electromagnetic fields, local exposure to electricity, in particular utilising the inverse piezo effect, and/or local exposure to radiation from a radiation source, by means of which the crack or break is initiated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0060" num="0059">The present invention also relates to a device for the production of layers of solid material, in particular wafers. The device according to the invention comprises at least one means for inducing defined local stresses in a peripheral region of a workpiece in order to generate a break initiation point in the workpiece in order to separate a layer of solid material from the workpiece, the device having a base body that has a substantially level surface for receiving the layer of solid material, and a stress inducing means being formed on the base body and extending with its longitudinal axis in the longitudinal direction of the base body or in the depth direction of the base body.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">The present invention can, furthermore, relate to a wafer that is produced by the method according to the invention or by the device according to the invention.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0100" num="0099">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1<i>a </i> </figref>a first diagrammatic cross-sectional illustration of the layer structure according to the invention is shown. According to this illustration the layer structure has at least one stabilisation layer <b>1</b>, a receiving layer <b>2</b> disposed over, against or on the latter, and a workpiece <b>4</b> disposed over, against or on the latter, in particular a thick silicon disc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0101" num="0100">The individual layers <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>4</b> can extend here over the same distance in the X, Y and Z direction, it also being conceivable for only individual layers to extend over the same distance in one or a number of directions.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">In the second step II previously not yet provided layers are generated and/or connected to one another. Preferably, the individual layers are arranged as shown, i.e. an adhesive layer <b>6</b> (for example made of PDMS) is preferably applied to the stabilisation layer <b>1</b> in order to couple or connect a receiving layer <b>2</b> made of PDMS to the stabilisation layer <b>1</b>. The receiving layer <b>2</b> is preferably directly in contact with a workpiece <b>4</b>, it also being conceivable for a sacrificial layer or an additional adhesive layer to be provided between the receiving layer <b>2</b> and the workpiece <b>4</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">The structure described above with the layers <b>1</b>, <b>6</b> and <b>2</b> over the workpiece <b>4</b> can be applied in the same way to the other side of the workpiece <b>4</b> or alternatively can be applied in an altered form, as explained in the following. A connection layer <b>8</b>, in particular in the form of an adhesive, is provided parallel to the receiving layer <b>2</b> and preferably also in contact with the workpiece <b>4</b>. The connection layer <b>8</b> can be designed to connect an additional receiving layer <b>10</b> made of PDMS and/or an additional layer <b>11</b> to the workpiece <b>4</b>. The additional layer <b>11</b> is preferably also made in the form of a stabilisation layer made of metal or of an additional workpiece, a corresponding layer structure composed of the layers <b>1</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>2</b> or the layers <b>8</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> in turn being able to be provided on the additional workpiece. The stabilisation layers <b>1</b> are preferably rigid or are made of rigid materials and enable mechanical coupling with an additional device for applying stress. The E modulus of the stabilisation layer <b>1</b> or stabilisation layers <b>1</b>, <b>11</b> is therefore higher than the E modulus of the receiving layers <b>2</b>, <b>10</b>. Additionally or alternatively, the stabilisation layers <b>1</b> enable defined local thermal stressing of the workpiece.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">In step III all of the layers are connected to one another or are already connected to one another.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">In step IV the workpiece <b>4</b> is shown split into two parts, one part of which being connected to the layer arrangement <b>1</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>2</b>, and the other part being connected to the layer arrangement <b>8</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>. In the transition from step III to step IV stresses are produced in the workpiece <b>4</b>, by means of which the workpiece <b>4</b> is split into a number of, in particular exactly two parts or layers of solid material. Preferably, mechanical stress is induced into the layer structure by applying forces to more rigid stabilisation layer/s <b>1</b>, <b>11</b>. The stress is extremely advantageously induced as a result of the described layer arrangement with layers <b>1</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>2</b> or <b>8</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> with different E moduli because the layers with lower E-moduli can rest against the workpiece <b>4</b> without causing any damage, and the layers <b>1</b>, <b>11</b> with higher E-moduli can be coupled to additional devices in order to apply force.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">In the optional step V the individual layers of solid material which have been obtained from the workpiece <b>4</b> are once again detached from the additional layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">The method according to the invention can additionally or alternatively have one or all of the following steps here: providing a workpiece for the separation of the layers of solid material, the workpiece having at least one exposed surface, producing and/or providing a carrier unit for receiving at least one layer of solid material, the carrier unit being made in a number of layers, the carrier unit having a stabilisation layer and the stabilisation layer being overlapped at least partially by a receiving layer, the receiving layer being designed to hold the layer of solid material, and the stabilisation layer being at least partially formed such that it has an E modulus that is greater than the E modulus of the receiving layer, and connecting the receiving layer to the exposed surface of the workpiece, thus forming a composite structure or a laminate, and exposing the composite structure to an inner and/or outer stress field in such a way that the layer of solid material is separated along a plane of the workpiece extending within the workpiece.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">According to one preferred embodiment of the present invention the receiving layer and the stabilisation layer are made of different materials, the receiving layer preferably comprising a polymer, in particular polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMS), and the stabilisation layer preferably comprising a metal, in particular aluminium.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">With the present invention, i.e. in particular by using polymer/metal laminates as layer systems for generating thermally induced mechanical stress fields, all of the aforementioned problems and restrictions are eliminated. In the examples of use described here, a thicker wafer from which one or more thinner wafers are then separated using the described method is preferably used as the workpiece. This embodiment is advantageous because it makes it possible to greatly reduce the thickness variations by using layers of appropriately configured polymer/metal laminates instead of the pure polymer layers used according to the previous prior art. These layers consist e.g. of alternating layers of polymer and a metal, e.g. aluminium, the innermost layer, i.e. the layer lying closest to the wafer surface and generating mechanical stress, in each case preferably always being made of polymer. With the corresponding methods according to the invention described below, layers of solid material, such as in particular wafers, can be produced with far smaller total thickness variations (wafers with thickness variations &lt;40% of the average wafer thickness have already been checked experimentally in this way), more advantageous linear patterns being able to be achieved as regards spatial thickness distribution, and in particular the regions with the greatest variations being able to be adjusted, such as e.g. being able to be brought close to the wafer edge where they are less disruptive.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">In examples of use where the outermost layer of the laminate (i.e. the one furthest away from the wafer surface) is preferably made of metal, as a result of the good head conductivity of metals this has the additional advantage that very good thermal contact with the laminate is possible over this layer, and this enables efficient, locally well controllable and reproducible cooling of the laminate. Moreover, a metal layer or metal plate can generally be fastened more easily to a machine than the polymer layers used, and this facilitates the automated (subsequent) processing of the wafers. In addition, this fastening enables external mechanical forces to also be able to be exerted upon the laminate/wafer composite in a controlled manner by means of a machine, e.g. during the cooling process, by means of which the separation process can be further influenced. In particular, it is conceivable for the thickness of the wafers produced to be able to be influenced by the externally exerted forces as well as by the rigidity (elasticity modulus) of the layers involved, and all of these parameters can be controlled well and largely independently of one another when using the laminates according to the invention in large areas. Furthermore, it is particularly advantageous that the stress distributions can be pre-specified in a locally defined manner on the basis of the laminate structure according to the invention, i.e. the use of at least one metal layer, a polymer layer and the workpiece by means of the forces exerted and/or the rigidity of the layers involved, additionally or alternatively non-homogeneous temperature distribution in the workpiece or the laminate layers providing the pre-defined stress distribution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5<i>a </i> </figref>a diagrammatic illustration of a workpiece <b>4</b> is shown. In the workpiece <b>4</b> pulses <b>23</b>, in particular in the form of waves, are emitted by means of a pulse emitting device <b>22</b>. The pulses <b>23</b> bring about local stresses <b>26</b> in the peripheral region of the workpiece <b>4</b> and at a place where a break initiation preferably takes place in order to separate a layer of solid material from the workpiece <b>4</b>. The local stresses <b>26</b> therefore particularly preferably strike at the point on the peripheral region of the workpiece or on its circumference at which the break initiation point <b>44</b> is desired or provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5<i>b </i> </figref>two examples of stress inducing means <b>24</b>, <b>25</b> are shown.

The stress inducing means <b>24</b> extends over the circumference of an outer contour preferably uniformly bordering the stabilisation layer <b>1</b>. Preferably, the surface of the stress inducing means <b>24</b> that can be brought into contact with a receiving layer <b>2</b> is made level and particularly preferably extends in the same plane as the remaining surface portion of the stabilisation layer <b>1</b>. The stress inducing means <b>24</b> preferably has an end <b>46</b> that tapers. The tip <b>46</b> can preferably be pointed or linear in form here. The dashed line marked by the letter L preferably specifies the direction of extension in which the stress inducing means <b>24</b> extends with its longitudinal axis.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">Thus, one exemplary embodiment of the invention consists of locally controlled stress peaks being generated in the layer structure by specifically choosing the layer geometry.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139">The stress inducing means <b>24</b> and <b>25</b> can be provided individually or in combination.
