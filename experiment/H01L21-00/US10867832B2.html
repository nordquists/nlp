No. 12/347,580, entitled “Apparatus for Holding Semiconductor Wafers,” filed on Dec. 31, 2008, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/087,468, entitled “Apparatus for Holding Semiconductor Wafers,” filed on Aug. 8, 2008, both of which applications are incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to an apparatus for holding semiconductor wafers during semiconductor manufacturing processes, and more particularly to wafer holding apparatus and methods that realize wafer temperature uniformity in processes with high heat stress.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Manufacturing a semiconductor integrated circuit (IC) typically involves numerous processing techniques that require elevated wafer temperatures to perform the desired processes, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), dry etching, or other processing techniques. As a known wafer holding apparatus, an electrostatic chuck including a heating element is commonly employed to support a semiconductor wafer in a stationary position and transfer heat generated from the heating element to the wafer during the various processes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a prior art dipole-type electrostatic chuck <b>10</b> utilized as a wafer supporting and heating apparatus. Electrostatic chuck <b>10</b> comprises either a pair of or plural pairs of electrodes <b>12</b> embedded in a wafer supporting stage, which typically comprises a mounting surface <b>15</b> made of heat conducting dielectrics, such as a heat conducting ceramic. When an alternating voltage is applied between the electrodes <b>12</b>, a reverse polarity charge is typically induced in wafer substrate <b>18</b>. Wafer substrate <b>18</b> is thus electrostatically attracted to the supporting stage utilizing the force generated between the wafer substrate and the electrodes. A heating circuit is also used to supply electricity to the supporting stage to heat the mounting surface <b>15</b> of the electrostatic chuck <b>10</b>. Heat transfer then occurs between mounting surface <b>15</b> and wafer substrate <b>18</b> held thereon so that wafer substrate <b>18</b> reaches a desired temperature range suitable for processing the wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventional electrostatic chucks, however, have the following problems. First, during a wafer fabrication process, such as a CVD or impurity doping process, a semiconductor wafer may be subjected to an elevated temperature on the order of 800° C. or higher. The wafer processed within such a high temperature range may be under significant heat stress, which typically causes wafer bowing or warping as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. This problem causes the wafer substrate <b>18</b> to lose direct abutting contact with the mounting surface <b>15</b> where the bowing or warping occurs. A considerable portion of the heat generated by mounting surface <b>15</b> would be transferred to the wafer spots that contact mounting surface <b>15</b>, but not to the bowed or warped portions of wafer substrate <b>18</b>. This causes further temperature non-uniformity in wafer substrate <b>18</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">Additionally, for the system where alternating voltage is applied to the electrodes <b>12</b>, electric charge is accumulated in the back surface of wafer substrate <b>18</b> while the wafer is being attracted, and the accumulated charge makes the separation of the substrate from the chuck difficult. Moreover, although an electrostatic chuck operated through an alternating voltage exerts an attractive force to the wafer substrate held thereon, the attractive force is typically not adapted to the mechanical stress created by the uneven heat distribution in a wafer substrate. As a result, when the mechanical stress accumulated in a wafer substrate exceeds a critical point, the wafer substrate may crack or even break.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Furthermore, the trend of increasing wafer diameter in semiconductor manufacturing continues as part of the effort to increase the throughput of a semiconductor fabrication facility and offset the high cost imposed by the processing equipment in advanced processing technology. The uneven heat distribution as described above may create increased mechanical stress in a wafer substrate of increased dimension, causing more severe bowing or warping effects.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">The making and using of the presently preferred embodiments are discussed in detail below. It should be appreciated, however, that the present invention provides many applicable inventive concepts that can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed are merely illustrative of specific ways to make and use the invention, and do not limit the scope of the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention will be described with respect to preferred embodiments in a specific context, namely wafer holding apparatus and methods that realize even temperature distribution in a wafer substrate during processes involving elevated wafer temperature, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), impurity doping, rapid thermal process (RTP), anneal, and metal deposition. Preferred embodiments may be used to heat wafer substrates of various diameter, achieving even temperature distribution across a wafer substrate to perform desired processes. Also, preferred embodiments may provide a wafer holding mechanism that is adaptive to the mechanical stress built in a wafer substrate so that the heat-induced mechanical stress built in a wafer substrate during an elevated temperature process may be released in a process with reduced processing temperature. It is noted that, although the present invention has been described in conjunction with specific embodiments, it is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to these embodiments and many modifications and variations may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention as specifically defined in the preferred embodiments. As an example, preferred embodiments may be used to other semiconductor manufacturing processes where uniform heat distribution on a semiconductor working piece are desired for processing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">With reference now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, there is shown a wafer holding apparatus <b>20</b> that comprises a heat-conductive layer <b>22</b>. The heat-conductive layer <b>22</b> is supported on a supporting base <b>30</b>, with the top surface of the heat-conductive layer <b>22</b> forming a wafer supporting surface. Therefore, the heat-conductive layer <b>22</b> is also sometimes referred to as wafer supporting surface <b>22</b> in the description below. The heat-conductive layer <b>22</b> may comprise a wide range of materials. In one embodiment, the heat-conductive layer <b>22</b> includes a dielectric material, such as aluminum nitride and pyrolytic boron nitride. In another embodiment, heat-conductive layer <b>22</b> comprises an electrically conductive material, such as pyrolytic graphite.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">A plurality of lift pins <b>28</b> extends through holes <b>32</b> formed through heat-conductive layer <b>22</b> and supporting base <b>30</b>. Lift pins <b>28</b> are made of heat conductive materials similar to those used to form heat-conductive layer <b>22</b>, such as aluminum nitride, pyrolytic boron nitride and pyrolytic graphite. Each of the lift pins <b>28</b> is supported by an elastic spring <b>23</b> attached to supporting base <b>30</b>. A heating circuit <b>21</b> is used to supply electricity to the wafer supporting surface <b>22</b> and lift pins <b>28</b> to heat a wafer substrate (not shown) held on wafer supporting surface <b>22</b> so that the wafer substrate reaches a desired temperature range suitable for processing. In an embodiment, the wafer substrate is processed in a CVD process, during which it is subjected to an elevated temperature of greater than 800° C. Under such a high processing temperature, significant heat stress is typically formed in the wafer substrate, which may cause the wafer substrate to bow or warp.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> illustrates another preferred embodiment, where each of the lift pins <b>28</b> is supported by an elastic spring <b>24</b> attached to a lift table <b>40</b>. The lift table <b>40</b> is cantilevered from the top end of a rotation motor and cylinder <b>42</b> that is axially translated by a lift motor assembly. The rest position of lift pins <b>28</b> is adjustable by positioning lift table <b>40</b> axially. In another embodiment, lift table <b>40</b> may be fastened to supporting base <b>30</b>. In an additional preferred embodiment, each of the lift pins <b>28</b> is supported by an air cylinder with sealed, compressive air that is used in place of an elastic spring. In preferred embodiments, lift pins <b>28</b> are free to move up and down axially. Preferably, when wafer holding apparatus <b>20</b> is idle, the tips of lift pins <b>28</b> protrude over the wafer supporting surface <b>22</b> to an extent that, when a wafer substrate to be processed is rested on wafer supporting surface <b>22</b>, the weight of the wafer substrate presses down the lift pins <b>28</b> so that the wafer substrate forms a direct abutting contact with the wafer supporting surface <b>22</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates wafer holding apparatus <b>20</b> with a wafer substrate <b>50</b> resting thereon. The back-end of wafer substrate <b>50</b> is in direct abutting contact with the wafer supporting surface <b>22</b> and lift pins <b>28</b>. Optionally, when holding apparatus <b>20</b> is used in a plasma reactor chamber, such as a plasma enhanced CVD (PECVD) tool, heat conductive layer <b>22</b> may also encapsulate a thin planar chucking electrode or conductive grid <b>25</b>, which is coupled to a DC or alternating chuck voltage source <b>26</b>, forming a DC type or dipole-type electrostatic chuck configuration. When a DC chuck voltage is applied to the electrode <b>25</b>, the wafer substrate <b>50</b> is typically referenced to ground through the plasma. The application of a large DC voltage to chucking electrode <b>25</b> produces a large electrostatic force that holds the wafer on wafer supporting surface <b>22</b>. When an alternating voltage is applied between the electrodes <b>25</b>, a reverse polarity charge is typically induced on the back side of wafer substrate <b>50</b>. Wafer substrate <b>50</b> is thus attracted to wafer support surface <b>22</b> via the electrostatic force generated between wafer substrate <b>50</b> and electrodes <b>25</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">It is noted that, although the above preferred embodiments are illustrated in conjunction with a CVD processing apparatus, those skilled in the art should realize that the preferred embodiments may be also applied to other wafer fabrication processes and apparatus where an elevated wafer temperature is needed, such as a rapid thermal process (RTP) using a hot chuck, a thermal anneal process (e.g., silicidation), and a metal deposition process, impurity doping, and the like, without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention as specifically defined in the preferred embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4B</figref> are collectively used to illustrate bowing and warping that may occur to wafer substrate <b>50</b> when high heat stress is applied. The bowing and warping effects are exaggerated to illustrate the advantageous features achieved with the current embodiment. As can be seen from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4B</figref>, when an air gap is formed between the wafer substrate <b>50</b> and the wafer supporting surface <b>22</b> due to wafer bowing or warping, lift pins <b>28</b> attached to the compressed springs extend upwards above the wafer supporting surface <b>22</b> so that the top end of lift pins <b>28</b> makes direct contact with the back end of wafer substrate <b>50</b>. Because lift pins <b>28</b> are also heated by being coupled to the supply electricity that is used to heat wafer supporting surface <b>22</b>, wafer substrate <b>50</b> may be continuously heated by lift pins <b>28</b> even after direct abutting contact with the supporting surface <b>22</b> is lost due to wafer bowing or warping, thus leading to even temperature distribution on wafer substrate <b>50</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a plan view illustrating one preferred embodiment of the wafer holding apparatus <b>20</b>, which comprises a plurality of lift pins <b>28</b> distributed in a concentric fashion in an inner zone <b>43</b> and an outer zone <b>45</b>. It is noted that the pattern of the lift pins <b>28</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is only for illustrative purpose and should not be construed as being limited to the pattern set forth herein. In reality, wafer holding apparatus <b>20</b> may be formed to include various lift pin <b>28</b> patterns depending upon the dimension of wafer substrate <b>50</b> to be processed, the desired process temperature, the temperature uniformity needed to process the wafer substrate without significant impact on the product yield.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">It is noted, however, the dimension of lift pins <b>28</b> and the density of lift pins <b>28</b> may impact the securing of direct abutting contact between wafer substrate <b>50</b> and wafer supporting surface <b>22</b>, thus providing even temperature distribution on wafer substrate <b>50</b>. In preferred embodiments, the dimension (e.g., diameter) of lift pins <b>28</b> is preferably in the range of from about 1/100 of the wafer dimension to about 1/10 of the wafer dimension. The density of lift pins <b>28</b>, measured by the pin-to-pin pitch, is optimized to provide even temperature distribution on wafer substrates with various materials and dimensions, and is preferably in the range of from about 1/50 of the wafer dimension (e.g., diameter) to about 1/10 of the wafer dimension. In preferred embodiments, the number of lift pins formed on a wafer holding apparatus ranges from just a few to over a hundred, depending upon the dimension of wafer substrate to be processed, the desired process temperature, and the temperature uniformity needed to process the wafer substrate without significant impact on the product yield. As an example shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a wafer holding apparatus with eight lift pins in inner zone <b>43</b> and eight lift pins in outer zone <b>45</b> may be used to process a III-V semiconductor wafer having a diameter of four inches. As another example, a wafer holding apparatus with a hundred lift pins may be employed to process a twelve-inch silicon wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">It is also noted that the DC or alternating chuck voltages applied to chucking electrode <b>25</b> may be varied through a control circuit so that the electrostatic force formed between wafer substrate <b>50</b> and electrodes <b>25</b> may be changed continuously or turned on and off intermittently, adapting to processes having different heat stress levels. As an example, during a high temperature process where even temperature distribution is highly critical, a large electrostatic force may be formed between wafer substrate <b>50</b> and electrodes <b>25</b>, creating the desired direct abutting contact between wafer substrate <b>50</b> and wafer supporting surface <b>22</b>. However, the high mechanical stress thus created in wafer substrate <b>50</b> may be quickly alleviated or released by reducing the electrostatic force formed between wafer substrate <b>50</b> and electrodes <b>25</b> through adjusting of the DC or alternating chuck voltages applied to chucking electrode <b>25</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6B</figref> are cross-sectional and plan views used to illustrate wafer holding apparatus <b>120</b> in another preferred embodiment. Wafer holding apparatus <b>120</b> comprises a heat-conductive layer <b>22</b>, which is supported on a supporting base <b>30</b>. The top surface of the heat-conductive layer <b>22</b> forms a wafer support surface. Wafer holding apparatus <b>120</b> also comprises a plurality of wafer substrate clampers <b>65</b> secured to a clamper supporting ring <b>78</b>, which is fastened on the edge of supporting base <b>30</b>. The clampers <b>65</b> can be rotated horizontally between a locked and unlocked position to secure wafer substrate <b>50</b> on heat-conductive layer <b>22</b>. Alternatively, clampers <b>65</b> may be lowered and raised between locked and unlocked positions. A heating circuit is used to supply electricity to the wafer supporting surface <b>22</b> to heat wafer substrate <b>50</b> held thereon so that wafer substrate <b>50</b> reaches a desired temperature range suitable for processing. Optionally, supporting base <b>30</b> is secured on lift table <b>40</b>, which is cantilevered from the top end of a rotation motor or cylinder <b>62</b> that is axially translated by a lift motor assembly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">Each of the clampers <b>65</b> may be attached onto the clamper supporting ring <b>78</b> at one end by a fastener <b>65</b> <i>a</i>. The clampers <b>65</b> are used to secure a direct abutting contact between wafer substrate <b>50</b> and wafer supporting surface <b>22</b> during a high temperature process where even temperature distribution is highly critical. However, the elastic spring <b>75</b> may be deactivated through a control circuit <b>81</b> so that the clamping force on the edge of wafer substrate <b>50</b> can be relieved instantaneously. In other words, in some embodiments, elastic spring <b>75</b> may have an electromechanical component such as an electromagnet or may comprise a material that deforms in the presence of an electrical field or electric current. As a result, the high mechanical stress created in wafer substrate <b>50</b> during a high temperature process may be quickly alleviated or released by removing the clamping force on wafer substrate <b>50</b>. In a preferred embodiment, elastic springs <b>75</b> in clampers <b>65</b> are activated and deactivated in an intermittent manner, adapting to processes having different heat stress levels. As an example, during a high temperature process where even temperature distribution is highly critical, clampers <b>65</b> are activated securing the desired direct abutting contact between wafer substrate <b>50</b> and wafer supporting surface <b>22</b>. After that, the high mechanical stress thus created in wafer substrate <b>50</b> may be quickly alleviated or released by deactivating clampers <b>65</b>, thus removing the clamping force on wafer substrate <b>50</b>. In some embodiments, clampers <b>65</b> may be used in combination with lift pins <b>28</b>, such as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> to provide even further flexibility in control the transfer of heat to a substrate <b>50</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0028" num="0027"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7B</figref> are cross-sectional and plan views used to illustrate wafer holding apparatus <b>150</b> in an alternative or additional preferred embodiment. Wafer holding apparatus <b>150</b> comprises a heat-conductive layer <b>22</b>. The heat-conductive layer <b>22</b> is supported on a supporting base <b>30</b>, with the top surface of the heat-conductive layer <b>22</b> forming a wafer support surface. One skilled in the art will recognize that a lift table <b>40</b>, such as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> could also be employed in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. A heating circuit (not shown) is preferably used to supply electricity to the wafer supporting surface <b>22</b> and to heat wafer substrate <b>50</b> held thereon so that wafer substrate <b>50</b> reaches an even temperature distribution in a desired temperature range suitable for processing. A plurality of holes <b>132</b> are formed through heat-conductive layer <b>22</b> and supporting base <b>30</b>. The holes <b>132</b> are preferably distributed in a concentric fashion with an inner zone <b>143</b> and an outer zone <b>145</b>. The inner zone <b>143</b> and the outer zone <b>145</b> at the back end of supporting base <b>30</b> may be connected to same or separate vacuum sources. When one or more of the vacuum sources are turned on, attractive forces are formed on the wafer supporting surface <b>22</b>, holding wafer substrate <b>50</b> thereon for the desired process. In the current embodiment, the attractive forces at the inner and outer vacuum zones <b>143</b> and <b>145</b> can be turned on and off in an intermittent manner by a vacuum source control circuit. For example, in a high temperature process where even temperature distribution is highly critical, all the vacuum sources may be turned on to secure direct abutting contact between wafer substrate <b>50</b> with the wafer supporting surface <b>22</b>. After that, the attractive forces may be quickly relieved by turning off one or more of the vacuum sources, allowing high mechanical stress created in wafer substrate <b>50</b> to be quickly alleviated or released.</div>
