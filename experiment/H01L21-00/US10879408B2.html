<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0022">The present invention relates to the field of semiconductor devices and methods of manufacturing semiconductor devices, and more specifically to materials, structures, and methods for optical and electrical III-nitride-based semiconductor devices, some embodiments of which provide epitaxially grown metal-containing layers, electrically insulating layers, highly electrically conductive layers, highly optically transmissive layers, highly optically reflective layers, n-type semiconductors, p-type semiconductors, i-type (intrinsic) semiconductors, metallo-semiconductor structures, metallo-dielectric structures, and combinations of one or more of the above layers.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0023">Gallium nitride (GaN), a wide bandgap semiconductor, has received significant interest and investment from educational, governmental, and industrial entities due to the potential for fabricating advanced optical and electrical GaN-based semiconductor devices. Beginning in the early 1990's, researchers have made continuous progress in researching developing, improving, and ultimately commercializing GaN-based semiconductor devices, including green and blue wavelength light emitting diodes (LEDs), blue wavelength laser diodes (LDs), and high-speed and high-power metal-semiconductor field effect transistors (MESFETs), high-electron mobility transistors (HEMTs), and power transistors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0024">While significant progress has been made in the development of Group-III nitride (hereafter, “III-nitride”)-based semiconductor devices, further improvements in device materials, structures, and methods of fabrication are needed to realize the full potential, in terms of device performance, efficiency, and cost metrics, of III-nitride-based devices. Therefore, there is an unmet need in the industry for materials, structures, and methods for improving the performance, efficiency, and cost of III-nitride-based semiconductor devices. In addition, there is a further unmet need in the industry for a so-called metal-base transistor, which has been commercially unavailable do to the difficulty in forming high-quality semiconductor/metal/semiconductor epitaxial structures.</div>

The embodiments shown in the Figures and described here may include features that are not included in all specific embodiments. A particular embodiment may include only a subset of all of the features described, or a particular embodiment may include all of the features described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0059">The leading digit(s) of reference numbers appearing in the Figures generally corresponds to the Figure number in which that component is first introduced, such that the same reference number is used throughout to refer to an identical component which appears in multiple Figures. Signals and connections may be referred to by the same reference number or label, and the actual meaning will be clear from its use in the context of the description.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0060">In some embodiments, the present invention provides materials, structures, and methods for III-nitride-based devices, including epitaxial and non-epitaxial structures useful for III-nitride devices including light emitting devices, laser diodes, transistors, detectors, sensors, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0061">In some embodiments, the present invention provides metallo-semiconductor and/or metallo-dielectric devices, structures, materials and methods of forming metallo-semiconductor and/or metallo-dielectric material structures for use in semiconductor devices, and more particularly for use in III-nitride based semiconductor devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0062">Specifically, in some embodiments, the present invention provides devices, structures, and materials that include combinations of one or more layers of metallic materials and one or more layers of semiconductor materials, dielectric materials, and/or combinations of semiconductor and dielectric materials, and methods of forming such devices, structures, and materials. In some embodiments, the one or more metallic layers and the one or more semiconductor and/or dielectric layers are epitaxial.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0063">As used herein, the term “epitaxial” refers to a material state (i.e., not a process) of inorganic materials based on the materials' electrical or electrical and optical relationship with other inorganic materials that it is physically in contact with (typically layered), such that the materials are substantially lattice matched (i.e., the atomic lattices of the two or more materials line up in a predictable and organized repeating atomic lattice structure) and that the materials are substantially single crystal (i.e., the strain of the lattice mismatch and layer thickness, 1) does not generate undesired cracking within the device, 2) does not generate dislocations with densities large enough and/or of the type to result in undesired electrical shorting of the device such that the device can not be useful, and 3) does not generate a secondary material phase (e.g., inclusions, precipitates, poly-crystal grains, and/or multi crystal grains) such that the device is not useful).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0064">In addition, as one of skill in the art would understand, carbon-containing compounds, such as carbides, carbonates, simple oxides of carbon (e.g., CO and CO<sub>2</sub>), and cyanides, as well as the allotropes of carbon (e.g., diamond and graphite), are considered to be inorganic materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0065">In some embodiments, the present invention provides a plurality of alternating layers of epitaxial metal and semiconductor materials to form epitaxial metallo-semiconductor devices, structures, and materials and methods of forming such epitaxial metallo-semiconductor devices, structures, materials, such that the metal layers and semiconductor layers are substantially lattice matched. In some embodiments, the present invention provides a plurality of alternating layers of epitaxial metal and dielectric materials to form epitaxial metallo-dielectric devices, structures, and materials and methods of forming such epitaxial metallo-dielectric devices, structures, materials, such that the metal layers and dielectric layers are substantially lattice matched. In some embodiments, the present invention provides a plurality of alternating layers of epitaxial metal, semiconductor, and dielectric materials to form epitaxial metallo-semiconductor-dielectric devices, structures, and materials and methods of forming such epitaxial metallo-semiconductor-dielectric devices, structures, materials, such that the metal layers and dielectric layers are substantially lattice matched.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0066">As used herein, the term “period” refers to a set of alternating material layers, wherein each material layer is adjacent to the next material layer. For example, in some embodiments, for a metallo-semiconductor structure that includes two unique material layers (e.g., alternating layers of HfN and GaN), each set of HfN—GaN layers is referred to as a period. In such an example, if there were twenty (20) total layers alternating between HfN and GaN, the structure would include ten (10) periods of HfN—GaN. In another example, if there were twenty (20) total layers alternating between HfN and AlN, the structure would include ten (10) periods of HfN—AlN. In yet another example, if there were twenty (20) total layers alternating between HfN and compounds made of AlN, GaN and/or InN while being intentionally doped or not doped, the structure would include ten (10) periods of HfN— compounds made of AlN, GaN and/or InN while being intentionally doped or not doped. As another example, in some embodiments, for a metallo-semiconductor structure that includes three unique material layers (e.g., alternating layers of HfN, GaN, and AlN), each set of HfN—GaN—AlN layers is referred to as a period. In this additional example, if there were twenty-one (21) total layers alternating between HfN, GaN, and AlN, the structure would include seven (7) periods of HfN—GaN—AlN.

In some embodiments, a PhC-GEMM-based LED device is integrated with a selective transmission mirror (e.g., a blue-pass mirror that is transparent to blue light). In some embodiments, a Photonic Crystal GEMM LED is coupled to a blue-pass mirror located at or near the light-exiting face of the PhC-GEMM LED such that the blue-pass mirror allows the blue light generated by the PhC-GEMM LED to pass through the mirror to interact with and excite the phosphor-doped material to generate white light.

In some embodiments, the peak of the reflectivity and reflectivity bandwidth spectrum is larger when HfN and GaN are used as the alternating materials due to the larger difference in the real index of refraction between GaN and HfN (Δn≈2.0) as compared to AlN and HfN (Δn≈1.6). In addition, HfN and GaN are substantially lattice matched and therefore the material quality (e.g., surface roughness, full-width at half-max (FWHM) of the x-ray diffraction (XRD) rocking-curve, and the like) of the HfN—GaN structure will be improved as compared to a HfN—AlN structure.</div>

In some embodiments, this structure dramatically improves the reflectivity of the GEMM over a range of wavelengths, tunable from approximately 370 nm to approximately 700 nm due to the large and continuous difference in the real index of refraction. In some embodiments, with proper selection of the thicknesses of the metallic layer and semiconductor layers of the PhC-GEMM structure, the reflectivity spectrum of the PhC-GEMM is tunable to select specific peak wavelengths and bandwidths and therefore address specific and diverse application areas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0080" num="0095">Over the past decade, researchers and companies in the III-nitride industry have spent significant resources in the development of distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) with only moderate success due to the limitations of the III-nitrides materials. For example, the most common materials used for forming III-nitride-based DBRs are GaN and Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1−x</sub>N, and because there is a very low contrast in the refractive indexes between the GaN and AlGaN layers, a large number of periods and/or AlGaN layers with a high Al content is required in order to obtain a mirror with a reflectivity of only approximately 50%. However, both of these requirements increase the thermal expansion coefficient mismatch and lattice mismatch between the GaN and AlGaN layers resulting in the appearance of cracks on the DBR surface that degrades the growth and operation of the light-emitting device. Due to these limitations, achieving DBR's with reflectivities of greater than 80%, as desired by LED manufacturers, is simply not feasible using traditional III-nitride materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0081" num="0096">Whereas, in a conventional distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) is formed from alternating layers of semiconductor and/or dielectric materials, with each material layer having a thickness of a quarter-wavelength of the incident light within each material, in some embodiments, the PhC-GEMM structure includes alternating layers of metal and semiconductor and/or dielectric materials and the thickness of the metal layers is adjusted to allow partial reflection and partial transmission and the thickness of the semiconductor and/or dielectric layer is adjusted to be approximately a half-wavelength of the incident light. In some embodiments, the PhC-GEMM includes metal material layers having a thickness that reflects a portion of the incident light and transmits a portion of the incident light through each metal layer and semiconductor material layers (e.g., GaN, AlN and the like) having a thickness that is equal to approximately half of the wavelength of the incident light to produce constructive interference of the light in the semiconductor material layer that is located between two of the thin metal layers in a manner similar to a Fabry-Perot cavity.</div>

In some embodiments, the thickness of the metal layer is preferably between about 15 nm and about 45 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0083" num="0098">In some embodiments, the thickness of the semiconductor layer and/or the dielectric layer is approximately half the wavelength of the incident light in the semiconductor layer and/or the dielectric layer when the metal layers are thin (e.g., 10 nm), as determined by t<sub>layer</sub>=λ<sub>layer</sub>/2=λ<sub>o</sub>/2n<sub>layer</sub>, where n<sub>layer </sub>is the index of refraction of the layer, λ<sub>layer </sub>is the wavelength of the incident light in the layer, and λ<sub>o </sub>is the wavelength of the incident light in vacuum. For example, the required thickness for a GaN layer (i.e., n<sub>GaN</sub>=2.39) and incident light of wavelength 450 nm (i.e., blue light) would be approximately 94 nm. In such a structure the reflectivity band can be quite narrow. In other embodiments, the thickness of the metal material layers is increased such that the reflectivity band is broadened and the peak wavelength is shifted.
