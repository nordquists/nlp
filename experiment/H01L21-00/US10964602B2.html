<heading id="h-0002">Technical Field</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to adjacent vertical fin field effect transistors (FinFETs) having a merged top source/drain, and more particularly to fabricating two vertical fin field effect transistors electrically coupled through a merged top source/drain.</div>
<heading id="h-0003">Description of the Related Art</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">A Field Effect Transistor (FET) typically has a source, a channel, and a drain, where current flows from the source to the drain, and a gate that controls the flow of current through the channel. Field Effect Transistors (FETs) can have a variety of different structures, for example, FETs have been fabricated with the source, channel, and drain formed in the substrate material itself, where the current flows horizontally (i.e., in the plane of the substrate), and FinFETs have been formed with the channel extending outward from the substrate, but where the current also flows horizontally from a source to a drain. The channel for the FinFET can be an upright slab of thin rectangular silicon (Si), commonly referred to as the fin with a gate on the fin, as compared to a MOSFET with a single gate in the plane of the substrate. Depending on the doping of the source and drain, an n-FET or a p-FET can be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Examples of FETs can include a metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) and an insulated-gate field-effect transistor (IGFET). Two FETs also can be coupled to form a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) device, where a p-channel MOSFET and n-channel MOSFET are coupled together.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">With ever decreasing device dimensions, forming the individual components and electrical contacts becomes more difficult. An approach is therefore needed that retains the positive aspects of traditional FET structures, while overcoming the scaling issues created by forming smaller device components.</div>

<heading id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">Principles and embodiments of the present invention relate generally to avoiding first level metallic interconnects between adjacent FinFETs by fabricating top source/drains on vertical fins that merge into a single top source/drain that spans the two vertical fins. Typically, different electrical contacts are formed to the top source/drain on each vertical fin, and interconnecting the electrical contacts through a metallization layer. By epitaxially growing the top source/drain until two separate top source/drains amalgamate into a merged source/drain, additional steps and metallization connects can be avoided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">In addition, a self-aligned isolation region can be formed between the two coupled FinFET devices, where the isolation region can be self-aligned with the gate structures on the adjacent devices, and the merged top source/drain can bridge the isolation region to electrically couple the adjacent vertical fins. The self-aligned isolation region (e.g. shallow trench isolation (STI) region) can be adjacent to and in contact with spacers on the sidewalls of a vertical fin, where the thickness of the spacer(s) can determine the distance of the isolation region from the vertical fin(s). The gate lengths on both sidewalls of a vertical fin can be the same, and the gate lengths on two adjacent vertical fins can be the same, where increased consistency of the gate lengths can improve device performance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">Principles and embodiments of the present invention also relate to use of a pinch-off layer to locate a sacrificial plug between two closely spaced vertical fins to align the isolation region with the two vertical fins and gate structures formed thereon. Control of different distances between a plurality of vertical fins and/or selective fin removal can provide closer spacing between vertical fins intended to be electrically coupled through the merged source/drains, and greater spacing between other fins forming the FinFET device, such that the closer fins are properly spaced for the top source/drains to amalgamate before the other top source/drains grow to a size that shorts the neighboring vertical fins that are farther apart.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">Exemplary applications/uses to which the present invention can be applied include, but are not limited to: vertical FinFETs, complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) field effect transistors, digital logic gates (e.g., NAND, NOR, XOR, etc.) and memory devices (e.g., DRAM, SRAM, etc.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">In various embodiments, the materials and layers can be deposited by physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD), molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), or any of the various modifications thereof, for example, plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD), electron-beam physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD), and plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD). The depositions can be epitaxial processes, and the deposited material can be crystalline. In various embodiments, formation of a layer may be by one or more deposition processes, where, for example, a conformal layer can be formed by a first process (e.g., ALD, PEALD, etc.) and a fill can be formed by a second process (e.g., CVD, electrodeposition, PVD, etc.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">Reference to source/drain projections, layers, regions, etc., is intended to indicate that the particular device feature can be implemented as a source or a drain except as expressly indicated otherwise. In addition, the role of source and drain for an active device can in some instances be reversed, so a previously indicated drain may instead be a source and vice versa. Reference to a source/drain is, therefore, intended to encompass the broadest reasonable scope of the term.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0171" num="0170">Reference in the specification to “one embodiment” or “an embodiment”, as well as other variations thereof, means that a particular feature, structure, characteristic, and so forth described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment. Thus, the appearances of the phrase “in one embodiment” or “in an embodiment”, as well any other variations, appearing in various places throughout the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0172" num="0171">It is to be appreciated that the use of any of the following “/”, “and/or”, and “at least one of”, for example, in the cases of “A/B”, “A and/or B” and “at least one of A and B”, is intended to encompass the selection of the first listed option (A) only, or the selection of the second listed option (B) only, or the selection of both options (A and B). As a further example, in the cases of “A, B, and/or C” and “at least one of A, B, and C”, such phrasing is intended to encompass the selection of the first listed option (A) only, or the selection of the second listed option (B) only, or the selection of the third listed option (C) only, or the selection of the first and the second listed options (A and B) only, or the selection of the first and third listed options (A and C) only, or the selection of the second and third listed options (B and C) only, or the selection of all three options (A and B and C). This can be extended, as readily apparent by one of ordinary skill in this and related arts, for as many items listed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0173" num="0172">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of example embodiments. As used herein, the singular forms “a,” “an” and “the” are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms “comprises,” “comprising,” “includes” and/or “including,” when used herein, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps operations, components and/or groups thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0174" num="0173">Spatially relative terms, such as “beneath,” “below,” “lower,” “above,” “upper,” and the like, can be used herein for ease of description to describe one element's or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the FIGS. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the FIGS. For example, if the device in the FIGS. is turned over, elements described as “below” or “beneath” other elements or features would then be oriented “above” the other elements or features. Thus, the term “below” can encompass both an orientation of above and below. The device can be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations), and the spatially relative descriptors used herein can be interpreted accordingly. In addition, it will also be understood that when a layer is referred being “between” two layers, it can be the only layer between the two layers, or one or more intervening layers can also be present.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0175" num="0174">It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, etc. can be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another element. Thus, a first element discussed below could be termed a second element without departing from the scope of the present concept.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0176" num="0175">Having described preferred embodiments of a device and fabrication method (which are intended to be illustrative and not limiting), it is noted that modifications and variations can be made by persons skilled in the art in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that changes may be made in the particular embodiments disclosed which are within the scope of the invention as outlined by the appended claims. Having thus described aspects of the invention, with the details and particularity required by the patent laws, what is claimed and desired protected by Letters Patent is set forth in the appended claims.</div>
