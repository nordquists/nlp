<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">This disclosure relates to integrated circuit fabrication, and more particularly to a field effect transistor with a strained structure.</div>
<heading id="h-0004">BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">As the semiconductor industry has progressed into nanometer technology process nodes in pursuit of higher device density, higher performance, and lower costs, challenges from both fabrication and design issues have resulted in the development of three dimensional designs, such as a fin field effect transistor (FinFET). A typical FinFET is fabricated with a thin vertical “fin” (or fin structure) extending from a substrate, for example, etched into a silicon layer of the substrate. The channel of the FinFET is formed in this vertical fin. A gate is provided over (e.g., wrapping) the fin. Having a gate on both sides of the channel allows gate control of the channel from both sides. Further advantages of FinFET comprise reducing the short channel effect and enabling higher current flow.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows an isometric view of a conventional FinFET <b>100</b>, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of the FinFET <b>100</b> taken along the line a-a of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. The fin <b>104</b>/<b>108</b> comprises a raised active region <b>104</b> above a semiconductor substrate <b>102</b>. Fin <b>104</b>/<b>108</b> is surrounded by a shallow trench isolation (STI) structure <b>106</b>. A gate structure <b>110</b> comprising a gate dielectric <b>112</b>, a gate electrode <b>114</b>, and an optional hardmask layer <b>116</b> is formed above the fin <b>104</b>/<b>108</b>. Sidewall spacers <b>118</b> are formed on both sides of the gate structure <b>110</b>. Further, a portion of the fin <b>104</b>/<b>108</b> contains strained structures <b>108</b> in source and drain (S/D) recess cavities of the FinFET <b>100</b>. The strained structures <b>108</b> are formed after a fin recessing process and an epitaxial growth step. The strained structures <b>108</b> utilizing epitaxial silicon germanium (SiGe) may be used to enhance carrier mobility.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">However, there are challenges to implement such features and processes in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication. As the gate length and spacing between devices decrease, these problems are exacerbated. For example, an ordered atomic arrangement does not exist due to lattice mismatch between the portion <b>104</b> of the fin <b>104</b>/<b>108</b> and strained portions <b>108</b>. Thus, strain-induced crystal defects <b>108</b> <i>a </i>may become embedded in the strained structure <b>108</b>. The crystal defects <b>108</b> <i>a </i>may provide carrier transportation paths during device operation, thereby increasing the likelihood of device instability and/or device failure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, what are needed are methods for fabricating a reduced-defect strained structure.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, a substrate <b>102</b> is provided having a fin structure <b>104</b>. In one embodiment, the substrate <b>102</b> comprises a crystalline silicon substrate (e.g., wafer). The substrate <b>102</b> may comprise various doped regions depending on design requirements (e.g., p-type substrate or n-type substrate). In some embodiments, the doped regions may be doped with p-type or n-type dopants. For example, the doped regions may be doped with p-type dopants, such as boron or BF.sub.2; n-type dopants, such as phosphorus or arsenic; and/or combinations thereof. The doped regions may be configured for an n-type FinFET, or alternatively configured for a p-type FinFET.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">The substrate <b>102</b> may alternatively be made of some other suitable elementary semiconductor, such as diamond or germanium; a suitable compound semiconductor, such as gallium arsenide, silicon carbide, indium arsenide, or indium phosphide; or a suitable alloy semiconductor, such as silicon germanium carbide, gallium arsenic phosphide, or gallium indium phosphide. Further, the substrate <b>102</b> may include an epitaxial layer (epi-layer), may be strained for performance enhancement, and/or may include a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">The fin structure <b>104</b>, formed over the substrate <b>102</b>, comprises one or more fins. In the present embodiment, for simplicity, the fin structure <b>104</b> comprises a single fin. The fin comprises any suitable material, for example, the fin structure <b>104</b> comprises silicon.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">The fin structure <b>104</b> is formed using any suitable process comprising various deposition, photolithography, and/or etching processes. An exemplary photolithography process may include forming a photoresist layer (resist) overlying the substrate <b>102</b> (e.g., on a silicon layer), exposing the resist to a pattern, performing a post-exposure bake process, and developing the resist to form a masking element including the resist. The masking element may then be used to etch the fin structure <b>104</b> into the silicon layer. The fin structure <b>104</b> may be etched using reactive ion etching (RIE) processes and/or other suitable processes. In an example, the silicon fin <b>104</b> is formed by using patterning and etching of a portion of the silicon substrate <b>102</b>. In another example, silicon fins of the fin structure <b>104</b> may be formed by using patterning and etching of a silicon layer deposited overlying an insulator layer (for example, an upper silicon layer of a silicon-insulator-silicon stack of an SOI substrate).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">Isolation structure <b>106</b> may be formed on the substrate <b>102</b> to isolate the various doped regions.

In some embodiments, the filled trench may have a multi-layer structure such as a thermal oxide liner layer filled with silicon nitride or silicon oxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">Still referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, a gate stack <b>110</b> is formed over the substrate <b>102</b> and over a portion of the fin structure <b>104</b>.

In one embodiment, a width of the patterned photoresist feature is in the range of about 15 to 45 nm. The patterned photoresist feature can then be transferred using a dry etching process to the underlying layers (i.e., the gate electrode layer <b>114</b> and the gate dielectric layer <b>112</b>) to form the gate stack <b>110</b>. The photoresist layer may be stripped thereafter.</div>

In one embodiment, using the pair of spacers <b>118</b> as hard masks, a biased etching process is performed to recess a top surface of the fin structure <b>104</b> that are unprotected or exposed to form the S/D recess cavities <b>130</b>.
