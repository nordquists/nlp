<heading id="h-0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to carrier systems, exposure apparatuses, carrier methods, exposure methods, device manufacturing methods, and suction devices, and more particularly to a carrier system which carries a plate-like object, an exposure apparatus which is equipped with the carrier system, a carrier method to carry a plate-like object onto a movable body, an exposure method using the carrier method, a device manufacturing method using the exposure apparatus or the exposure method, and a suction device which suctions the plate-like object.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, in a lithography process to manufacture electronic devices (microdevices) such as a semiconductor device (an integrated circuit or the like) or a liquid crystal display device, mainly, a projection exposure apparatus of a step-and-repeat method (a so-called stepper), projection exposure apparatus of a step-and-scan method (a so-called scanning stepper (also called a scanner)) or the like is mainly used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">Substrates such as a wafer, a glass plate and the like subject to exposure that are used in these types of exposure apparatuses are gradually becoming larger (for example, in the case of a wafer, in every ten years). Although a 300-mm wafer which has a diameter of 300 mm is currently the mainstream, the coming of age of a 450 mm wafer which has a diameter of 450 mm looms near. When the transition to 450 mm wafers occurs, the number of dies (chips) output from a single wafer becomes double or more than the number of chips from the current 300 mm wafer, which contributes to reducing the cost.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">However, because the thickness does not necessarily increase in proportion to the size of the wafer, the 450 mm wafer is weak in intensity and rigidity when compared with the 300 mm wafer. Therefore, when focusing on a point such as a carriage of a wafer, it was considered that there was a risk of warping occurring in the wafer, which may negatively affect the exposure accuracy when a means method similar to the current 300 mm wafer was employed. Accordingly, as the carrier method of the wafer, a proposal is made of a carrier method (carry-in) or the like that can be employed even when the wafer is a 450 mm wafer in which the wafer is suctioned from above in a non-contact manner by a carrier member equipped with a Bernoulli chuck or the like to maintain the flatness degree (flatness) and performs carriage to a wafer holder (holding device) (for example, refer to PTL 1).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">However, in the case of employing suction in a non-contact manner from above by the carrier member described above as a carrier method of the wafer onto the wafer stage (wafer holder), there was a risk of positional deviation (rotation deviation) in a horizontal plane of the wafer being generated at an unacceptable level, to which correction based on measurement results was difficult to perform.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">As a method for resolving the inconvenience due to suction in a non-contact manner from above by the wafer carrier member described above, a method can be considered in which while a wafer is suctioned in a non-contact manner suction from above by a suction member such as a Bernoulli chuck or the like, the wafer is also supported from below by a support member (for example, vertical-motion pins on a wafer stage). However, according to results of experiments and the like of the inventors, in the case of performing loading of the wafer onto the wafer stage in a non-contact suction from above the wafer and support from below, it became clear that warping that is not acceptable could occur even in the case of a 300 mm wafer due to a difference in driving velocity between the suction member and the support member on the loading.</div>

<heading id="h-0008">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">An embodiment will be described below, based on <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 9B</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically shows a structure of an exposure apparatus <b>100</b> according to an embodiment. This exposure apparatus <b>100</b> is a projection exposure apparatus of a step-and-scan method, or a so-called scanner. As it will be described later on, a projection optical system PL is arranged in the present embodiment, and in the description below, a direction parallel to an optical axis AX of this projection optical system PL will be described as a Z-axis direction, a direction within a plane orthogonal to the Z-axis direction in which a reticle and a wafer are relatively scanned will be described as the Y-axis direction, a direction orthogonal to the Z-axis and the Y-axis will be described as an X-axis direction, and rotational (inclination) direction around the X-axis, the Y-axis, and the Z-axis will be described as a θx direction, a θy direction, and a θz direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">Exposure apparatus <b>100</b>, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is equipped with an exposure section <b>200</b> placed at an exposure station placed near the +Y side end on a base board <b>12</b>, a measurement section <b>300</b> placed at a measurement station a predetermined distance apart to the −Y side from exposure section <b>200</b>, a stage device <b>50</b> including a wafer stage WST and a measurement stage MST that move two-dimensionally in an XY plane independently on base board <b>12</b>, a carry-in unit <b>121</b> which structures a carry carrier system <b>120</b> (refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) that carries a wafer W along with a carry-out unit which is not shown and a wafer support member <b>125</b> which will be described later on, and a control system or the like of these parts. Here, base board <b>12</b> is supported almost horizontally (parallel to the XY plane) on a floor surface by an anti-vibration device (omitted in drawings). Base board <b>12</b> consists of a member having a plate-like outer shape. Further, inside base board <b>12</b>, a coil unit including a plurality of coils <b>17</b> placed in a matrix shape with an XY two-dimensional direction serving as a row direction and a column direction is housed, which structures a stator of a planar motor (to be described later on). Incidentally, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, wafer stage WST is positioned at exposure station, and wafer W is held on wafer stage WST (to be more specific, on wafer table WTB which will be described later on). Further, measurement stage MST is positioned near the exposure station.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">Exposure section <b>200</b> is equipped with an illumination system <b>10</b>, a reticle stage RST, a projection unit PU, a local liquid immersion device <b>8</b> and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">Illumination system <b>10</b>, as is disclosed in, for example, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0025890 and the like, includes a light source, an illuminance equalizing optical system including an optical integrator and the like, and an illumination optical system that has a reticle blind and the like (none of which are shown). Illumination system <b>10</b> illuminates a slit-shaped illumination area IAR set (limited) on reticle R by the reticle blind (also called a masking system) by an illumination light (exposure light) IL, with a substantially uniform illuminance. In this case, as illumination light IL, for example, an ArF excimer laser beam (wavelength 193 nm) is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">On reticle stage RST, reticle R on which a circuit pattern or the like is formed on its pattern surface (the lower surface in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is fixed, for example, by vacuum chucking. Reticle stage RST, for example, is finely drivable within the XY plane by a reticle stage driving system <b>11</b> (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) including a linear motor, a planar motor or the like, and is also drivable in a scanning direction (the Y-axis direction which is the lateral direction of the page surface in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) at a predetermined scanning speed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">Position information (including rotation information in the θz direction) of reticle stage RST in the XY plane is constantly detected, for example, by a reticle laser interferometer (hereinafter, referred to as a “reticle interferometer”) <b>13</b>, via a movable mirror <b>15</b> (actually, a Y movable mirror (or a retroreflector) having a reflection surface orthogonal to the Y-axis direction and an X movable mirror having a reflection surface orthogonal to the X-axis direction are provided) fixed to reticle stage RST, at a resolution of, for example, around 0.25 nm. Measurement values of reticle interferometer <b>13</b> are sent to a main controller <b>20</b> (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Main controller <b>20</b> drives reticle stage RST via reticle stage driving system <b>11</b> (refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), based on the position information of reticle stage RST. Incidentally, in the present embodiment, position information of reticle stage RST in the XY plane can be detected using an encoder, instead of the reticle interferometer described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">Projection unit PU is placed below reticle stage RST in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Projection unit PU is supported by a mainframe BD, via a flange section FLG provided at an outer circumference section of mainframe BD, which is placed horizontally above base board <b>12</b>. Mainframe BD, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, consists of a plate member having a hexagonal shape (a shape in which two corners of a rectangular shape is cut off) in a planar view whose dimension in the Y-axis direction is larger than that of the X-axis direction, and is supported on the floor surface by a support member which is not shown including an anti-vibration device which is not shown in a part thereof. As is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, a frame FL having a rectangular frame shape in a planar view is placed surrounding mainframe BD. Frame FL is supported at a position the same height as mainframe BD on the floor surface by a support member different from the support member supporting mainframe BD. From an end near (a Y position almost the same as a loading position LP which will be described later on) the −Y side of a pair of long sides apart in the X-axis direction of frame FL, a pair of (symmetrical) extended sections <b>159</b> that each have an L-shaped XZ section is provided in a protruding manner below (refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039">Projection unit PU includes a barrel <b>40</b>, and projection optical system PL held inside barrel <b>40</b>. Used as projection optical system PL, for example, is a dioptric system consisting of a plurality of optical elements (lens elements) arranged along optical axis AX, which is parallel to the Z-axis. Projection optical system PL, for example, is double telecentric, and has a predetermined projection magnification (for example, ¼ times, ⅕ times or ⅛ times). Therefore, when illumination area IAR on reticle R is illuminated by illumination light IL from illumination system <b>10</b>, a reduced image of the circuit pattern of reticle R (a reduced image of a part of the circuit pattern) within illumination area IAR is formed in an area (hereinafter, also called an exposure area) IA conjugate to illumination area IAR on wafer W whose surface is coated with a resist (sensitive agent) and is placed on a second surface (image plane) side of projection optical system PL, via projection optical system PL (projection unit PU), by illumination light IL having passed through reticle R placed so that its pattern surface substantially coincides with a first surface (object plane) of projection optical system PL. And, by reticle stage RST and wafer stage WST (to be more precise, fine movement stage WFS to be described later on which holds wafer W) being synchronously driven, scanning exposure of a shot area (divided area) on wafer W is performed, by reticle R being relatively moved in the scanning direction (Y-axis direction) with respect to illumination area IAR (illumination light IL) and wafer W being relatively moved in the scanning direction (Y-axis direction) with respect to exposure area IA (illumination light IL), and the pattern of reticle R is transferred onto the shot area. That is, in the present embodiment, the pattern of reticle R is generated on wafer W by illumination system <b>10</b> and projection optical system PL, and by the exposure of the sensitive layer (resist layer) on wafer W with illumination light IL the pattern is formed on wafer W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">Local liquid immersion device <b>8</b> is provided, corresponding to exposure apparatus <b>100</b> which performs exposure using a liquid immersion method.

Nozzle unit <b>32</b>, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is supported in a suspended manner by mainframe BD supporting projection unit PU and the like, via a support member which is not shown surrounding the lower end periphery of barrel <b>40</b> which holds an optical element closest to the image plane side (wafer W side) structuring projection optical system PL, in this case, a lens (hereinafter also referred to as a “tip lens”) <b>191</b>. Nozzle unit <b>32</b> is equipped with a supply port and a recovery port of liquid Lq, a lower surface at which the recovery port is provided and to which wafer W is placed oppositely, a supply passage connected to a liquid supply pipe <b>31</b>A (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), and a recovery passage connected to a liquid recovery pipe <b>31</b>B (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).

In the present embodiment, main controller <b>20</b> controls liquid supply device <b>5</b>(refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), so that liquid is supplied between tip lens <b>191</b> and wafer W via liquid supply pipe <b>31</b>A and nozzle unit <b>32</b>, and also controls liquid recovery device <b>6</b> (refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) so that liquid is recovered from between tip lens <b>191</b> and wafer W via nozzle unit <b>32</b> and liquid recovery pipe <b>31</b>B. On this operation, main controller <b>20</b> controls liquid supply device <b>5</b> and liquid recovery device <b>6</b> so that the amount of liquid supplied and the amount of liquid recovered are constantly equal. Accordingly, between tip lens <b>191</b> and wafer W, a fixed amount of liquid Lq (refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is held constantly replaced. In the present embodiment, as liquid Lq described above, pure water is used through which an ArF excimer laser light (light with a wavelength of 193 nm) transmits. Incidentally, refractive index n of the pure water to the ArF excimer laser light is almost 1.44, and in the pure water, the wavelength of illumination light IL is shortened to 193 nm×1/n=around 134 nm. Incidentally, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a liquid immersion area formed by liquid Lq is shown by a reference sign <b>36</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">Further, in the case measurement stage MST is positioned below projection unit PU, liquid Lq can be filled in between a measurement table MTB to be described later and tip lens <b>191</b> in a manner similar to the description above.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0090" num="0089">At the lower surface of the first member <b>44</b>A, chuck member <b>124</b> is placed at a plurality of (for example, nineteen) points, at a point on its center (center point), and on points spaced equally apart on a virtual double concentric circle with the point serving as the center.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0091" num="0090">Each chuck member <b>124</b> consists of a so-called Bernoulli chuck. Bernoulli chuck, as is well known, is a chuck that uses the Bernoulli effect to locally increase the flow velocity of fluid (for example, air) which is blowing out to suction the target object (hold in a non-contact manner)). Here, the Bernoulli effect is an effect in which the pressure of fluid decreases when the flow velocity increases, and with the Bernoulli chuck, the suction state (holding/floating state) is decided by the weight of the target object subject to suction (hold, fix), and the flow velocity of fluid blowing out from the chuck. That is, in the case the size of the target object is known, the size of the gap between the chuck and the target object subject to hold upon the suction is decided, according to the flow velocity of the fluid blowing out from the chuck. In the present embodiment, chuck member <b>124</b> is used to suction wafer W by blowing out gas from its gas flow hole (for example, a nozzle or a blowout port) or the like to generate a flow of gas (gas flow) in the periphery of wafer W. The degree of the force of suction (that is, the flow velocity and the like of the gas blowing out) is appropriately adjustable, and by holding wafer W by suction with chuck member <b>124</b>, movement in the Z-axis direction, the θx direction and the θy direction can be restricted.</div>

Upon suction of wafer W to be described later on by chuck unit <b>153</b>, gas (for example, pressurized air) supplied from gas supply device <b>48</b> blows out downward (toward wafer W) from each porous bearing <b>156</b> so as to prevent wafer W from coming into contact with chuck unit <b>153</b>. The pressure, flow amount and the like of gas supplied to each porous bearing <b>156</b> are controlled by main controller <b>20</b> (refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0120" num="0119">Next, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, main controller <b>20</b> begins to supply fluid (air) to the plurality of chuck members <b>124</b>, and then by driving carrier arm <b>149</b> slightly upward (or by driving chuck unit <b>153</b> slightly downward), wafer W is suctioned by chuck unit <b>153</b> (chuck member <b>124</b>) in a non-contact manner while maintaining a predetermined distance (gap). Incidentally, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, to simplify the description, wafer W is to be suctioned by chuck unit <b>153</b> by a flow of air blown out indicated by blackened dots in the drawing (to be more precise, by a negative pressure caused by the flow). The same applies to each drawing in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7C to 9A</figref>. However, the state of the air actually blown out is not necessarily limited to this.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0121" num="0120">Next, main controller <b>20</b> drives (rotates) support plates <b>128</b> of the pair of wafer support members <b>125</b> so as to position each support plate at its first support plate position, via vertical movement rotation driving section <b>127</b>. On this operation, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, by vertical movement rotation driving section <b>127</b> of the pair of wafer support members <b>125</b>, suction pads <b>128</b> <i>b </i>on the upper surface of each of the support plates <b>128</b> are moved to positions facing the lower surface (rear surface) of wafer W. Further, in the state where the support plates <b>128</b> of the pair of wafer support member <b>125</b> are positioned at each of their first support plate positions, reflection mirrors <b>128</b> <i>a </i>are each facing predetermined positions at the outer circumference edge on the rear surface of wafer W.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0122" num="0121">When suction pads <b>128</b> <i>b </i>on the upper surface of each of the support plates <b>128</b> face wafer W, main controller <b>20</b>, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>, controls vertical movement rotation driving section <b>127</b> so as to drive support plate <b>128</b> upward. And when suction pads <b>128</b> <i>b </i>on the upper surface of each of the support plates <b>128</b> and the lower surface of wafer W come into contact, main controller <b>20</b> begins vacuum suction by the pair of suction pads <b>128</b> <i>b</i>, and supports the lower surface of wafer W by suction by each of the suction pads <b>128</b> <i>b</i>. On this operation, movement of wafer W is restricted in directions of three degrees of freedom, which are the Z direction, the θx direction, and the θy direction, by the suction from above by chuck unit <b>153</b>, as well as in directions of three degrees of freedom, which are the X direction, the Y direction and the θz direction, by the suction support from below by the pair of support plates <b>128</b>, which in turn restricts the movement in directions of six degrees of freedom.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0123" num="0122">The processing sequence of exposure apparatus <b>100</b> is decided so that wafer W waits above loading position LP in this state, that is, in a state where suction hold (support) is performed by chuck unit <b>153</b> and the pair of wafer support members <b>125</b>. In exposure apparatus <b>100</b>, while wafer W waits at loading position LP, exposure processing (and alignment processing prior to the exposure processing) or the like to the previous wafer held on wafer table WTB is performed. Further, on this operation, vacuum suction of wafer W by carrier arm <b>149</b> can be moved to a state where the suction is stopped.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0124" num="0123">Then, while wafer W is waiting above loading position LP, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the three measurement systems <b>123</b> <i>a </i>to <b>123</b> <i>c </i>(measurement system <b>123</b> <i>c </i>is not shown. Refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) each performs edge detection of wafer W. Imaging signals of the imaging elements that the three measurement systems <b>123</b> <i>a </i>to <b>123</b> <i>c </i>have are sent to signal processing system <b>116</b> (refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Signal processing system <b>116</b>, by the method disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,624,433 and the like, detects position information of the wafer, of the three places at the circumferential section including the notch, and obtains positional deviation in the X-axis direction and the Y-axis direction and rotational (θz rotation) error of wafer W. Then, information on the positional deviation and the rotation error is supplied to main controller <b>20</b> (refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0125" num="0124">Around the beginning of the edge detection of wafer W described above, main controller <b>20</b> drives carrier arm <b>149</b> downward so as to separate carrier arm <b>149</b> and wafer W, and then makes carrier arm <b>149</b> withdraw from loading position LP.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0126" num="0125">When exposure processing of the previous wafer is completed, and the previous wafer is unloaded from wafer table WTB by the carry-out device which is not shown, by main controller <b>20</b>, wafer stage WST is moved to a position below (loading position LP) chuck unit <b>153</b>, via coarse movement stage driving system <b>51</b>A. Then, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, main controller <b>20</b> drives center support member <b>150</b> having the three vertical movement pins <b>140</b> upward, via driver <b>142</b>. The edge detection of wafer W by the three measurement systems <b>123</b> <i>a </i>to <b>123</b> <i>c </i>is still being continued at this point of time, and main controller <b>20</b> finely drives wafer stage WST by the same amount in the same direction as the deviation amount (error) of wafer W, so that wafer W is mounted on a predetermined position on wafer stage WST, based on positional deviation and rotation error information of wafer W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0127" num="0126">Then, when the upper surface of the three vertical movement pins <b>140</b> comes into contact with the lower surface of wafer W suctioned by chuck unit <b>153</b>, main controller <b>20</b> stops the upward drive of center support member <b>150</b>. This allows wafer W to be held by suction by the three vertical movement pins <b>140</b> in a state where the positional deviation and the rotation errors are corrected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0128" num="0127">Here, the Z position of wafer W suctioned by chuck unit <b>153</b> at the waiting position can be accurately determined to some extent. Accordingly, by driving center support member <b>150</b> from the reference position by a predetermined amount, main controller <b>20</b> can make the three vertical movement pins <b>140</b> come into contact with the lower surface of wafer W suctioned by chuck unit <b>153</b>, based on measurement results of displacement sensor <b>145</b>. However, the arrangement is not limited to this, and an arrangement can be set in advance so that the three vertical movement pins <b>140</b> come into contact with the lower surface of wafer W suctioned by chuck unit <b>153</b> at the upper limit of the movement position of center support member <b>150</b> (the three vertical movement pins <b>140</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0129" num="0128">Then, main controller <b>20</b> operates a vacuum pump which is not shown, and begins vacuum suction to the wafer W lower surface by the three vertical movement pins <b>140</b>. Incidentally, the suction of wafer W by chuck member <b>124</b> is being continued even in this state. By the suction by chuck member <b>124</b> and the frictional force due to the support from below of the three vertical movement pins <b>140</b>, the movement of wafer W is restricted in directions of six degrees of freedom. Accordingly, no problems occur even when the suction hold of wafer W by support plate <b>128</b> of wafer support member <b>125</b> is released in this state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0130" num="0129">So, when wafer W is supported (held by suction) by the three vertical movement pins <b>140</b>, main controller <b>20</b> separates support plates <b>128</b> of the pair of wafer support members <b>125</b> from wafer W by driving the support plates downward, after finishing vacuum suction by the pair of suction pads <b>128</b> <i>b</i>, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>. Then, each of the support plates <b>128</b> is set to the second support plate position, via vertical movement rotation driving section <b>127</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0131" num="0130">Next, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</figref>, main controller <b>20</b> drives each of the chuck units <b>153</b> and the three vertical movement pins <b>140</b> (center support member <b>150</b>) downward that suctions and support wafer W, via the pair of Z voice coil motors <b>144</b> and driver <b>142</b>. By this operation, a downward drive of chuck unit <b>153</b> and the three vertical movement pins <b>140</b> (center support member <b>150</b>) begins, while the suction state by chuck unit <b>153</b> (chuck member <b>124</b>) and the support state by the three vertical movement pins <b>140</b> with respect to wafer W are maintained. Here, the drive of chuck unit <b>153</b> is performed by main controller <b>20</b> driving the pair of Z voice coil motors <b>144</b>, based on detection results of the plurality of chuck unit position detection systems <b>148</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0132" num="0131">The drive of chuck unit <b>153</b> with the three vertical movement pins <b>140</b> (center support member <b>150</b>) described above is performed until the lower surface (rear surface) of wafer W comes into contact with a planar wafer mounting surface <b>41</b> of wafer table WTB (refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>). Here, although wafer mounting surface <b>41</b> is actually a virtual flat surface (area) formed by upper end surfaces of multiple pins that the pin chuck provided on wafer table WTB is equipped with, in FIG. <b>9</b>A and the like, the upper surface of wafer table WTB is indicated as wafer mounting surface <b>41</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0133" num="0132">Before starting the downward drive and during the downward drive of chuck unit <b>153</b> with the three vertical movement pins <b>140</b> (center support member <b>150</b>) described above, main controller <b>20</b> measures the flatness of the wafer W upper surface, via wafer flatness detection system <b>147</b> (a plurality of Z position detection systems <b>146</b> (refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>)). And, of chuck unit <b>153</b> and center support member <b>150</b>, main controller <b>20</b> controls the downward speed of one of the members (in this case, center support member <b>150</b>) superior in responsiveness with respect to the downward speed of the other member (in this case, chuck unit <b>153</b>), based on the measurement results of wafer flatness detection system <b>147</b>, so that the flatness of wafer W falls within a desired range.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0134" num="0133">That is, for example, in the case it is detected by wafer flatness detection system <b>147</b> that wafer W is deformed in a shape protruding downward (a shape in which the inner circumference section is recessed than the outer circumference section), main controller <b>20</b> deceases the downward speed of center support member <b>150</b> so that it becomes slower than the driving speed of chuck unit <b>153</b>, via driver <b>142</b>. When the downward speed of center support member <b>150</b> is made slower than the driving speed of chuck unit <b>153</b>, the center of the lower surface of wafer W is substantially pushed from below by the three vertical movement pins <b>140</b>. Then, when the flatness of wafer W becomes a predetermined value, main controller <b>20</b> further drives center support member <b>150</b> and chuck unit <b>153</b> downward at the same speed (synchronously). In this case, the flatness of wafer W “becomes a predetermined value” means that, for example, wafer W is not completely flat and although the inner circumference section is recessed when compared to the outer circumference section, the shape of the wafer is deformed so that the recess level becomes equal to or less than a level determined in advance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0135" num="0134">Further, for example, in the case it is detected by wafer flatness detection system <b>147</b> that wafer W is deformed in shape protruding upward (a shape in which the inner circumference section is protruding upward than the outer circumference section), main controller <b>20</b> increases the downward speed of center support member <b>150</b> so that it becomes faster than the driving speed of chuck unit <b>153</b>, via driver <b>142</b>. When the downward speed of center support member <b>150</b> is made faster than the driving speed of chuck unit <b>153</b>, the center of the lower surface of wafer W is substantially pulled downward since the wafer is held by suction by the three vertical movement pins <b>140</b>. Then, when the flatness of wafer W becomes the predetermined value described above chuck unit <b>153</b>, main controller <b>20</b> drives center support member <b>150</b> and chuck unit further downward at the same speed (synchronously).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0136" num="0135">Incidentally, in the present embodiment, while the position in the Z direction of wafer W is detected at a plurality of points of wafer W, and information related to the shape (flatness) of wafer W is obtained from the information related to these positions, other methods can also be used. For example, an image of wafer W can be picked up by a camera or the like, and the information related to the shape (flatness) of wafer W can be obtained from the image information which has been obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0137" num="0136">In the present embodiment, main controller <b>20</b> constantly measures the deformation state (flatness) of wafer W using wafer flatness detection system <b>147</b>, from the state in which wafer W is suctioned by chuck unit <b>153</b> from an upward direction and is also supported from below by vertical movement pins <b>140</b> to the state in which wafer W is held by suction on the wafer holder which is not shown. Therefore, even in the case excessive flatness correction was performed, such as when, for example, wafer W located between chuck unit <b>153</b> and the three vertical movement pins <b>140</b> has a shape protruding downward and the descending speed of vertical movement pins <b>140</b> was made slower than the descending speed of chuck unit <b>153</b> so as to adjust the flatness, and as a consequence, wafer W became a shape protruding upward, by increasing the descending speed of vertical movement pins <b>140</b> with respect to the descending speed of chuck unit <b>153</b>, the flatness of wafer W can be adjusted again to a predetermined value. However, measurement of the deformation state (flatness) of wafer W can also be performed only during a part of a time interval, the interval being from a state where wafer W is suctioned from an upward direction by chuck unit <b>153</b> and is also supported from a downward direction by vertical movement pins <b>140</b> until wafer W is held by suction on the wafer holder which is not shown (for example, just before coming into contact with wafer mounting surface <b>41</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0138" num="0137">Then, when the lower surface of wafer W comes into contact with the wafer table WTB upper surface (wafer mounting surface <b>41</b>) as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, main controller <b>20</b> stops the high-pressure airflow flowing out from all of the chuck members <b>124</b>, via adjustment device <b>115</b>, cancels the suction of wafer W by all of the chuck units <b>153</b>, and begins the adsorption (suction) of wafer W by the wafer holder which is not shown on wafer table WTB.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0139" num="0138">Next, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, main controller <b>20</b> moves chuck unit <b>153</b> upward to a predetermined waiting position (the first position or a position near the first position), via the pair of Z voice coil motors <b>144</b>. This completes the loading (carry-in) of wafer W onto wafer table WTB.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0140" num="0139">Here, when chuck unit <b>153</b> is driven upward and stopped (or during the upward drive), main controller <b>20</b> performs detection of edge position of wafer W, using the three measurement systems <b>123</b> <i>a </i>to <b>123</b> <i>c </i>previously described. In this case, edge detection of wafer W is performed by measurement beams from measurement systems <b>123</b> <i>a</i>, <b>123</b> <i>b</i>, <b>123</b> <i>c </i>being irradiated on the three reflection mirrors <b>86</b> on wafer table WTB, and reflection beams from the reflection mirrors being received by the imaging elements of measurement system <b>123</b> <i>a</i>, <b>123</b> <i>b</i>, <b>123</b> <i>c</i>. Imaging signals of the imaging elements that the three measurement systems <b>123</b> <i>a </i>to <b>123</b> <i>c </i>have are sent to signal processing system <b>116</b> (refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), and information on positional deviation and rotation errors of wafer W is supplied to main controller <b>20</b>. Main controller <b>20</b> stores the information on positional deviation and rotation errors in a memory as an offset amount, and on wafer alignment, on exposure or the like to be described later on, controls the position of wafer table WTB, taking into account the offset amount described above. Incidentally, because wafer W is mounted on wafer table WTB after being supported by the three vertical movement pins <b>140</b>, in a state where edge detection of wafer W is performed during the waiting previously described, and positional deviation and rotation errors obtained as a result are corrected, edge detection of wafer W after wafer W being loaded on wafer table WTB does not necessary have to be performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0141" num="0140">As is described so far, according to carrier system <b>120</b> related to the present embodiment exposure apparatus <b>100</b> equipped with the system, on loading wafer W onto wafer table WTB, main controller <b>20</b> can independently and vertically move chuck unit <b>153</b> which suctions wafer W from above and vertical movement pins <b>140</b> (center support member <b>150</b>) which support wafer W from below. That is, on making wafer W, in which flexure, distortion or the like has occurred, move downward for wafer stage WST to hold by suction, wafer W can be loaded on wafer stage WST in a state where the flatness of wafer W is maintained to a value within a desired range, by controlling the descending speed of center support member <b>150</b> (the three vertical movement pins <b>140</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0142" num="0141">Further, in the present embodiment, while a structure was employed where three vertical movement pins <b>140</b> (center support member <b>150</b>), which were structured to vertically move in an integral manner, were used, the structure is not limited to this. For example, center support member <b>150</b> can be structured so that the three vertical movement pins move vertically in an independent manner, and the flatness of wafer W can be made to fall within a desired range by making the three vertical movement pins move vertically in an independent manner, based on measurement results of the flatness of the wafer. Incidentally, the number of vertical movement pins is not limited to three, and the pins can be equal to, less than or more than three.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0143" num="0142">Further, in carry-in unit <b>121</b> which structures a part of carrier system <b>120</b> related to the present embodiment, because the self-weight of chuck unit <b>153</b> is supported by the pair of weight-cancelling devices <b>131</b>, the force when driving chuck unit <b>153</b> in the vertical direction can be reduced, and the size of the pair of Z voice coil motors <b>144</b> can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0144" num="0143">Further, in carrier system <b>120</b> related to the present embodiment, during the loading of wafer W onto wafer stage WST, main controller <b>20</b> measures positional deviation and rotation deviation of wafer W via measurement systems <b>123</b> <i>a </i>to <b>123</b> <i>c</i>, and based on the measurement results, wafer stage WST is driven so that positional deviation and rotational deviation of wafer W are corrected. Accordingly, wafer W can be loaded on wafer table WTB with good positional reproducibility.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0145" num="0144">Further, according to exposure apparatus <b>100</b> related to the present embodiment, because exposure to wafer W loaded on wafer table WTB in a state of high flatness and with good positional reproducibility is performed in a step-and-scan method, to each of a plurality of shot areas on wafer W, exposure with good overlay accuracy and without defocus becomes possible, the pattern of reticle R can be transferred on the plurality of shot areas in a favorable manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0146" num="0145">Incidentally, in the embodiment above, considering the point that the three vertical movement pins <b>140</b> (center support member <b>150</b>) are superior to chuck unit <b>153</b> in responsiveness at the time of driving, driver <b>142</b> was driven so as to adjust the descending speed of the three vertical movement pins <b>140</b> (center support member <b>150</b>) to make the flatness of wafer W become a value within a desired range, when wafer W is loaded on wafer stage WST. However, on the contrary, in the case chuck unit <b>153</b> is superior to the three vertical movement pins <b>140</b> (center support member <b>150</b>) in responsiveness at the time of driving, it is desirable to adjust the descending speed of chuck unit <b>153</b>. In the case responsiveness at the time of driving is about the same in the three vertical movement pins <b>140</b> (center support member <b>150</b>) and chuck unit <b>153</b>, the descending speed of one of center support member <b>150</b> and chuck unit <b>153</b>, or both center support member <b>150</b> and chuck unit <b>153</b> can be adjusted. Further, since the flatness of the wafer only has to be maintained at a predetermined level, the descending speed of one of center support member <b>150</b> and chuck unit <b>153</b>, or both center support member <b>150</b> and chuck unit <b>153</b> can be adjusted, regardless of the superiority of responsiveness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0147" num="0146">Further, in the embodiment above, while the case has been described where wafer flatness detection system <b>147</b> was structured by the plurality of Z position detection systems <b>146</b>, the embodiment is not limited to this, and the wafer flatness detection system can be structured using a detection device that irradiates light on the entire upper surface of the wafer and can detect the surface shape. Further, in the case the wafer flatness detection system is structured by the plurality of Z position detection systems similarly to the embodiment described above, as the Z position detection system, the position detection system which employs a triangulation method does not necessarily have to be used. That is, since the wafer flatness detection system only has to be able to detect the flatness (the Z position of a plurality of places) of wafer W, for example, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, instead of Z position detection system <b>146</b> previously described, a plurality of capacitance sensors <b>84</b> can be placed at the lower surface of chuck unit <b>153</b>. Because a sensor having a size smaller than Z position detection system <b>146</b> can be used for capacitance sensor <b>84</b>, capacitance sensor <b>84</b> can be placed at places more than the total of four places where the measurement points of the plurality of Z position detection systems <b>146</b> were placed, which are, for example, three places at the outer circumference section and one place at the center.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0148" num="0147">Further, because the chuck unit position detection system only has to measure the Z position of chuck unit <b>153</b>, the system is not limited to a position detection system of the triangulation method, and as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, for example, the chuck unit position detection system can be structured using an encoder system made up of an encoder head <b>97</b> and a scale <b>98</b>. Or, for example, in at least one of the pair of Z voice coil motors <b>144</b>, an encoder can be provided, in which the encoder measures the displacement amount in the Z-axis direction from a reference point of a mover corresponding to its stator, and the chuck unit position detection system can be structured by the encoder. Further, chuck unit position detection system <b>148</b> can be structured using the capacitance sensor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0149" num="0148">Incidentally, in the embodiment described above, just before wafer W is loaded onto wafer table WTB, gas can be blown out from chuck member <b>124</b> toward wafer W at a blowout velocity faster than the blowout velocity so far when wafer W was being suctioned. By this operation, as is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the pressure between wafer W and chuck member <b>124</b> increases, and the outer circumference section of wafer W vibrates (a so-called pneumatic hammer phenomenon occurs). When wafer W is moved further downward in a state where this vibration is occurring, wafer W is mounted on wafer table WTB in a state where a contact area between the outer circumference section at the lower surface of wafer W and the wafer holder upper surface which is not shown is small. That is, because the frictional force between the wafer W lower surface and the wafer holder which is not shown is reduced, on suction hold of wafer W by the wafer holder which is not shown, wafer W is mounted on wafer table WTB in a state where generation of distortion caused by adsorption is suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0150" num="0149">Incidentally, in the embodiment described above, while wafer W is mounted on wafer mounting surface <b>41</b> of wafer table WTB by chuck unit <b>153</b> performing suction of wafer W from above, and chuck unit <b>153</b> and the three vertical movement pins <b>140</b> being driven downward in a state where the three vertical movement pins <b>140</b> perform vacuum suction of the rear surface of wafer W, the structure is not limited to this. For example, instead of the three vertical movement pins <b>140</b>, a structure that uses carrier arm <b>149</b> can be employed. In this case, carrier arm <b>149</b> is to have a structure drivable within a predetermined range also in the vertical direction, in addition to the horizontal direction. And, in a state where vacuum suction of the rear surface of wafer W is performed by carrier arm <b>149</b>, the wafer W surface is suctioned by chuck unit <b>153</b>, and main controller <b>20</b> sets each of the downward speed of chuck unit <b>153</b> and carrier arm <b>149</b> to a predetermined value, using the detection results of wafer flatness detection system <b>147</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0151" num="0150">Incidentally, it is preferable to form a groove in wafer mounting surface <b>41</b> so as to fit carrier arm <b>149</b> therein so that carrier arm <b>149</b> does not interfere with wafer W when wafer W is mounted on wafer mounting surface <b>41</b>, and that wafer W and wafer mounting surface <b>41</b> can come into contact with good precision. Then, carrier arm <b>149</b> can be made to move in the horizontal direction inside the groove, so that it can be withdrawn from wafer mounting surface <b>41</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0152" num="0151">Further, as another structure, wafer W can be mounted on wafer mounting surface <b>41</b> of wafer table WTB without using the three vertical movement pins <b>140</b>, after wafer W is delivered to chuck unit <b>153</b> from carrier arm <b>149</b>. In this case, for example, main controller <b>20</b> can control the descending speed of chuck unit <b>153</b>, the flow velocity (flow amount) of the fluid blowing out from chuck member <b>124</b>, and the direction of the fluid flowing, using the detection results of wafer flatness detection system <b>147</b> to preferably set each of the suction forces of chuck unit <b>153</b> to a predetermined value. On this operation, in the case the rear surface of wafer W is supported by suction using suction pad <b>125</b> <i>b </i>of wafer support member <b>125</b>, similarly to the case of carrier arm <b>149</b> previously described, a cutout into which wafer support member <b>125</b> fits is preferably formed in wafer mounting surface <b>41</b>, so that wafer W and mounting surface <b>41</b> can come into contact with good precision. Further, in the case movement of wafer W in the lateral direction (a direction parallel to the mounting surface) does not have to be restricted, a structure can be employed in which wafer W is held by suction only by chuck member <b>124</b> without wafer support member <b>125</b> being provided, and wafer W is mounted on wafer mounting surface <b>41</b> of wafer table WTB. Also on this operation, for example, main controller <b>20</b> can control the descending speed of chuck unit <b>153</b>, the flow velocity (flow amount) of the fluid blowing out from chuck member <b>124</b>, and the direction of the fluid flowing, using the detection results of wafer flatness detection system <b>147</b> to preferably set each of the suction forces of chuck unit <b>153</b> to a predetermined value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0153" num="0152">Incidentally, in the embodiment described above, as an example, while a liquid immersion exposure apparatus was described in which a liquid immersion space including an optical path of the illumination light was formed between the projection optical system and the wafer, and the wafer was exposed with the illumination light via the liquid between the projection optical system and the liquid immersion space, the embodiment is not limited to this, and the embodiment described above can be applied to a dry-type exposure apparatus which performs exposure of wafer W without the illumination light passing through the liquid (water).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0154" num="0153">Further, in the embodiment described above and its modified example (hereinafter referred to as the embodiment described above and the like), while the case has been described where the exposure apparatus is a scanning type exposure apparatus of the step-and-scan method or the like, the embodiment is not limited to this, and the embodiment described above can also be applied to a stationary type exposure apparatus such as a stepper.

Further, while the shape of the illumination area and the exposure area previously described was a rectangular shape, the embodiments are not limited to this, and for example, the shape can be an arc, a trapezoid, a parallelogram or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0156" num="0155">Further, the light source of the exposure apparatus related to the embodiment described above and the like is not limited to the ArF excimer laser, and a pulse laser light source such as a KrF excimer laser (output wavelength 248 nm), an F<sub>2 </sub>laser (output wavelength 157 nm), an Ar<sub>2 </sub>laser (output wavelength 126 nm), or a Kr<sub>2 </sub>laser (output wavelength 146 nm), a super high pressure mercury lamp which generates a bright line such as a g-line (wavelength 436 nm), an i-line (wavelength 365 nm), or the like can also be used. Further, a harmonic wave generating device which uses a YAG laser can also be used. As other light sources, as is disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,023,610, a harmonic wave can also be used as vacuum ultraviolet light, in which a single-wavelength laser beam in the infrared range or the visible range emitted by a DFB semiconductor laser or a fiber laser is amplified by a fiber amplifier doped with, for example, erbium (or both erbium and ytterbium) and wavelength conversion into ultraviolet light is performed using a nonlinear optical crystal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0157" num="0156">Further, in the embodiment described above and the like, as illumination light IL of the exposure apparatus, the light is not limited to light having a wavelength of 100 nm or more, and as a matter of course, light having a wavelength less than 100 nm can also be used. For example, the embodiment described above and the like can suitably be applied to an EUV exposure apparatus which uses EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) light in the soft X-ray region (for example, a wavelength region of 5 to 15 nm). Other than this, the embodiment described above and the like can also be applied to an exposure apparatus which uses a charged particle beam such as an electron beam or an ion beam.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0158" num="0157">Furthermore, the embodiment described above and the like can also be applied to an exposure apparatus which synthesizes two reticle patterns on a wafer via the projection optical system and performs double exposure almost simultaneously on a shot area on the wafer by performing scanning exposure once, as is disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,611,316.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0159" num="0158">Further, the object on which the pattern should be formed (the object subject to exposure on which the energy beam is irradiated) in the embodiment described above and the like is not limited to the wafer, and may be other objects such as a glass plate, a ceramic substrate, a film member, or a mask blank.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0160" num="0159">The usage of the exposure apparatus is not limited to the exposure apparatus for manufacturing semiconductors, and the embodiments above can be widely applied, for example, to an exposure apparatus for liquid crystals that transfers a liquid crystal display devices pattern onto a square-shaped glass plate, an exposure apparatus for manufacturing an organic EL, a thin film magnetic head, an imaging element (such as a CCD), a micromachine and a DNA chip or the like.

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0161" num="0160">Electronic devices such as semiconductor devices are manufactured through the steps such as; a step for performing function/performance design of a device, a step for making a reticle based on this design step, a step for making a wafer from a silicon material, a lithography step for transferring a pattern of a mask (reticle) onto the wafer by the exposure apparatus (pattern generating device) and the exposure method related to the embodiment described above and the like, a development step for developing the wafer which has been exposed, an etching step for removing by the etching an exposed member of an area other than the area where the resist remains, a resist removing step for removing the resist that is no longer necessary since etching has been completed, a device assembly step (including a dicing process, a bonding process, and a package process), and an inspection step. In this case, in the lithography step, because the device pattern is formed on the wafer, using the exposure apparatus of the embodiment described above and the like and performing the exposure method previously described, a highly integrated device can be manufactured with good productivity.</div>
