For example, the thin film deposition apparatus may be divided into a cluster type and an inline type in accordance with an arrangement of the process chambers. The thin film deposition apparatus having the inline type may be advantageous because the thin film deposition apparatus having the inline type may be not restricted relative to an installation space thereof, when compared with the thin film deposition apparatus having the cluster type.</div>

<li> <para-num num="[0040]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0041" num="0040">The invention is described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which exemplary embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the exemplary embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. In the drawings, the size and relative sizes of layers and regions may be exaggerated for clarity.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0041]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0042" num="0041">It will be understood that when an element or layer is referred to as being “on,” “connected to” or “coupled to” another element or layer, the element or layer can be directly on, connected or coupled to another element or layer or intervening elements or layers. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being “directly on,” “directly connected to” or “directly coupled to” another element or layer, there are no intervening elements or layers present. As used herein, connected may refer to elements being physically and/or electrically connected to each other. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout. As used herein, the term “and/or” includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</div>

These terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another element, component, region, layer or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the invention.</div>

It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation, in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as “under” relative to other elements or features would then be oriented “above” relative to the other elements or features. Thus, the exemplary term “under” can encompass both an orientation of above and below. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.</div>
