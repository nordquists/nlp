Wafer boat handling devices may be part of a vertical batch furnace and may be configured to vertically transport a wafer boat to a process chamber of said batch furnace, and to receive the wafer boat from the process chamber. The wafer boat received from the vertical batch furnace may be hot and may be cooled down before the processed wafers can be taken out of the wafer boat. The wafer boat handling device may be used to transfer wafers to and from the device, in particular to and from the wafer boats accommodated therein.

These concepts are described in further detail in the detailed description of example embodiments of the disclosure below.

</li> <li> <para-num num="[0006]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0007" num="0006">To that end, the present disclosure provides a wafer boat handling device according to claim <b>1</b>. More particularly, the wafer boat handling device may be configured to be positioned under a process chamber of a vertical batch furnace. The wafer boat handling device comprises a rotatable table having just a first and a second wafer boat support surface. Each wafer boat support surface may be configured to support a wafer boat. The rotatable table may be rotatable around a central substantially vertical axis and may be rotatable by an actuator to rotate both the first and the second wafer support surfaces to a load/receive position, a cooldown position, and a transfer position. In the load/receive position the wafer boat handling device may be configured to load a wafer boat vertically from the rotatable table into the process chamber and to receive the wafer boat from the process chamber onto the rotatable table. In the cooldown position the wafer boat handling device may be configured to cool down a wafer boat. In the transfer position the wafer boat handling device may be configured to allow wafers to be transferred to and/or from the wafer boat.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0007]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0008" num="0007">The time needed for processing, cooling and transferring may not be equal. When the cooling down is quick, and the transferring is done efficiently, both actions can be performed within the time needed for processing the wafers in the process chamber. The wafer boat handling device therefore may comprise just two wafer boat support surfaces which can be transferred to three rotational positions, in particular the load/receive position, the cooldown position, and the transfer position.</div>
</li> <li> <para-num num="[0008]"> </para-num> <div class="description-line" id="p-0009" num="0008">An advantage of having only two wafer boat support surfaces is that the rotatable table can be made smaller compared to having three wafer boat support surfaces. With the three rotational positions in which each wafer boat support surface can be brought, the wafer boat cooldown device can perform the required functions of loading/receiving, cooling down and transferring while the diameter of the wafer boat handling device may be reduced relative to the known wafer boat handling devices having three wafer boat support surfaces on the rotatable table. Additionally, the costs of manufacturing the wafer boat handling device may be smaller than the costs of the wafer boat handling devices with three wafer boat support surfaces.</div>

The wafer boat handling device may be positioned under the process chamber, and may comprise a wafer boat lift assembly configured to transfer a wafer boat from the wafer boat handling device to the process chamber and vice versa.</div>

The method further comprises providing the first wafer boat support surface with an associated first wafer boat loaded with wafers and the second wafer boat support surface with an associated second wafer boat loaded with wafers, and loading the first wafer boat vertically from the first wafer boat support surface which is in the load/receive position into the process chamber. The method further comprises processing the wafers accommodated in the first wafer boat in the process chamber, whilst simultaneously cooling down the second wafer boat on the second wafer boat support surface which is in the cooldown position, and subsequent to the cooling down, rotate the rotatable table to a position in which the second wafer boat support surface is in the transfer position.
