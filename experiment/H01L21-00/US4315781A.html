<div class="abstract">A process is provided for fabricating MOSFET devices having field source, gate and drain regions. The threshold voltage of both the channel and field regions of such devices is controlled by forming a comparatively thick oxide film on a semiconductor surface, defining enhancement mode transistor regions in the oxide film to expose portions of the semiconductor surface, implanting p-type ions under conditions such that the peak distribution of p-type atoms lies in the semi-conductor substrate just beneath the semiconductor/-oxide interface and counter-doping with n-type ions under conditions such that no implanted ions penetrate the oxide film.

<div class="description-paragraph">The Government has rights in this invention pursuant to Contract No. N00173-77-C-0228 awarded by the Department of the Navy.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The invention relates to a process for fabricating MOSFET devices on a single semiconductor substrate, and, more particularly, to a process for providing MOSFET devices with improved control over threshold voltage and reduced parasitic conduction paths between neighboring transistors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">2. Description of the Prior Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Processes for fabricating MOSFET (metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor) devices, including both enhancement mode and depletion mode transistors, are wellknown. With improvements in reduction of spacing between devices as a consequence of improved photolithographic technology, parasitic conduction paths between neighboring transistors becomes a problem. Several approaches have been devised to eliminate parasitic conduction paths between transistors by heavily doping the intervening surface (the field region). U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,873,372 (Johnson), 4,074,301 (Paivinen et al) and 4,078,947 (Johnson et al) all teach different methods of achieving this. The difficulties encountered are (1) obtaining a low boron concentration in the MOSFET channel and (2) minimizing the separation between the high and low doped regions at the channel edge. Paivinen teaches eliminating parasitic conduction paths by implanting the wafer surface and then etching away the implanted material in the channel, source and drain regions. Johnson teaches using a nitride mask over the channel region. Johnson et al teach that the field adjusting implant can be done through an oxide. However, the difficulty with the Johnson et al technique is that the channel becomes heavily doped. A further problem with the Paivinen and Johnson et al patents is that the threshold voltage for enhancement mode (normally off) transistors is determined by an implant of boron. Consequently, low threshold voltages, on the order of a few tenths of a volt, are difficult to set accurately.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">In accordance with the invention, a process is provided for setting threshold voltage of enhancement mode MOSFET devices formed on a semiconductor substrate doped with atoms of a first conductivity type which includes forming source, drain and gate regions in at least one portion of the substrate and making electrical contact to the regions. The threshold voltage is set by adjusting the difference between two implantations of atoms of different conductivity type into the portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further in accordance with the invention, a process for fabricating a plurality of MOSFET devices on a semiconductor substrate doped with atoms of a first conductivity type includes the following steps:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(a) forming a dielectric film on one surface of the semiconductor substrate;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(b) forming a plurality of first openings in the film to expose a plurality of first portions of the surface;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(c) implanting atoms of the same conductivity type as the first conductivity type, the implantation being done under conditions such that the peak distribution of implanted atoms lies in the semiconductor substrate just beneath the semiconductor/dielectric interface; and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(d) implanting atoms of a second conductivity type opposite to the first conductivity type, the implantation being done under conditions such that essentially no implanted ions of this type penetrate the dielectric film. The semiconductor substrate is then processed in accordance with well-known prior art methods by either metal gate or refractory gate technology to form completed devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The foregoing process sets forth the formation of enhancement mode transistors. Depletion mode transistors are fabricated on the same substrate by a process following step (d) which further includes the following steps:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(e) forming a removable, protective layer over the plurality of first openings;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(f) forming a plurality of second openings in both the dielectric film and the protective layer to expose a plurality of second portions of the surface; and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(g) implanting atoms of a second conductivity type opposite to the first conductivity type, the implantation being done under conditions such that essentially no implanted ions penetrate through the dielectric film or protective layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The process of the invention provides an enhancement mode device having a field region that is highly doped with atoms of the first conductivity type and a channel region that is lightly doped with atoms of the second conductivity type. The net doping of the channel region, however, remains that of the first conductivity type, though at a lower concentration. The doping is such that the distribution of atoms of the first conductivity type is established well into the substrate in the channel region of the enhancement mode device, but just within the semiconductor substrate near the semiconductor/dielectric interface in the field region. The distribution of atoms of the second conductivity type is somewhat shallower in the channel region of the enhancement mode device and essentially non-existent in the field region. The channel region of the depletion mode device is lightly doped with atoms of the second conductivity type.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In contrast to the prior art of determining the threshold voltage of the enhancement mode transistors by implantation of the first conductivity type implant, the present invention sets the threshold of enhancement mode transistors by the second conductivity type implant in combination with the first conductivity type implant. Thus, the threshold voltage is controlled by a mixture of both types; the second implantation provides a greater range of control over the threshold voltage than possible with prior art devices. For example, a threshold voltage of 0.3±0.1 V is easily attained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As the consequence of the high doping of the field region, a large voltage is required to generate even small amounts of parasitic leakage current between neighboring transistors.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 5, on coordinates of phosphorus implant dosage and threshold voltage, depicts the electrical behavior of depletion mode devices fabricated in accordance with the invention.</div>
<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring now to the Drawing, FIG. 1a depicts a semiconductor substrate 10, preferably silicon, here lightly doped with p-type atoms, about 10<sup>15</sup> atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, over which has been formed a dielectric film 11. Preferably, film 11 is silicon dioxide, often referred to as the field oxide, and, in this process, is formed to a thickness of about 4,000 to 5,000 A. While the silicon substrate shown here is doped with a p-type material, on which n-MOS devices will be fabricated, it should be understood that n-type silicon may also be employed as a substrate for fabricating p-MOS devices. The corresponding changes in the process set forth below would then be made.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For fabricating enhancement mode devices, a plurality of openings, one of which is shown at 12 in FIG. 1b, is formed in film 11 by conventional masking and etching techniques. These openings define the region that will subsequently become the source, drain and channel regions of the enhancement mode devices. P-type atoms, such as boron, are then implanted, shown at 40, to form a p<sup>+</sup>  region 13 in the semiconductor substrate. The implantation is done under conditions such that the peak distribution of atoms lies in the silicon substrate just beneath the silicon/silicon oxide interface (i.e., within a few hundred A thereof) in order to overcome processing variations in oxide formation. This ensures that the p-doping concentration is maximum near the surface, which, in combination with the n-doping described below, establishes control over threshold voltage of the enhancement mode devices. The position of the distribution peak near the interface also serves to reduce parasitic conduction between neighboring transistors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Simple experimentation is adequate for determining the particular conditions needed to establish the desired doping profile. For example, for a film of silicon dioxide 4,000 A thick, a boron implant at a dosage of 1×10<sup>13</sup> /cm<sup>2</sup> at 120 keV is sufficient to form the desired doping profile, and results in a boron concentration in field region 13 of about 10<sup>17</sup> /cm<sup>3</sup>. In the channel region of the enhancement mode device, the peak distribution of implanted atoms is about 0.4 μm below the silicon surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A second implantation, shown at 41, is then done, as depicted in FIG. 1c, employing atoms of opposite conductivity to the first implantation. For a first implantation of p-type atoms, the second implantation is of n-type atoms, such as phosphorus or arsenic. The implantation is done under conditions such that essentially no implanted ions penetrate the dielectric film 11. Again, simple experimentation is adequate for determining the particular conditions. For example, for a silicon dioxide film 4,000 A thick, a phosphorus implantation at a dosage of 4×10<sup>12</sup> /cm<sup>2</sup> at 200 keV is sufficient to meet the foregoing conditions. This second implantation, which is shallower in the channel region of the enhancement mode device than the first implantation, serves to counter-dope a portion 14 of the first implantation, although the net doping remains that of the first conductivity type. As a consequence of the comparative net light doping, region 14 is depicted here as p<sup>-</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For depletion mode transistors, the substrate is further processed by forming thereon a photoresist or other easily removable, protective layer 15, typically about 1 μm in thickness, and etching portions of the photoresist layer and dielectric film to form a plurality of second openings, one of which is shown at 16 in FIG. 1d. These openings define regions that will subsequently become the source, drain and channel regions of the depletion mode devices. A third implantation of ions, shown at 42 and opposite in conductivity to the first implantation, is carried out to form region 17 in the substrate, here shown as n-type conductivity, which dominates the existing p-type conductivity in that region. The implantation is done under conditions, easily determined experimentally, such that essentially no implanted ions penetrate the dielectric film 11 or mask 15. Consequently, the channel region is lightly doped with atoms of the second conductivity type. Employing the conditions described above for phosphorus implantation, a concentration of phosphorus on the order of 10<sup>17</sup> /cm<sup>3</sup> is obtained for region 17.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The substrate is then further processed in accordance with prior art techniques for fabricating finished devices. For example, metal gate (aluminum) devices are formed by diffusing source and drain regions, here n<sup>+</sup>, growing a gate oxide, employing photoresist for masking and etching contact holes, metallizing the entire surface of the semiconductor and employing photoresist to form the final metal electrode pattern. FIG. 2, in cross section, shows source 18 and drain 19 regions, with gate 24 over region 14. Electrode 26 contacts the source region, while electrode 27 contacts the drain region. Electrode 27 which also contacts source region 20 of the depletion mode transistor. Gate oxide 22 of the enhancement mode device separates gate 24 from the semiconductor surface. In the depletion mode device, gate oxide 23 separates gate 25, which is positioned over region 17, from the semiconductor surface. Electrode 28 contacts drain region 21.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 3, in cross section, depicts the results of the refractory gate process. Gate oxide 22, 23 is grown over enhancement mode and depletion mode regions, respectively. The refractory gate metal 29, 30, such as polycrystalline silicon highly doped to n<sup>++</sup>  (about 15Ω/□, is deposited and etched to form the respective gates. Formation of source 18a, 20a and drain 19a, 21a regions is accomplished by either etching through the thin oxide layer and diffusing in the appropriate impurity or by implanting through the thin oxide. In either case, the gate acts to self-align the channel 14, 17. For tighter control, however, the self-aligned implant process is preferred. Oxide layer 31 is then formed over the surface of the wafer and holes are formed for source, drain and gate contacts. Metal is then evaporated over the surface and etched to form source electrode 32, gate electrode 33, drain electrode and source electrode 34, gate electrode 35 and drain electrode 36.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Channel threshold voltage of the enhancement device is set by the energy of the n-type dopant (e.g., phosphorus) implantation and dosage in that portion of the process related to FIG. 1c, above. The phosphorus implantation controls the voltage needed on the gate, and permits setting threshold voltages to as low as a few hundred millivolts. Consequently, faster devices are obtained, requiring lower power. The phosphorus implantation also permits reduction of gate length to less than 1 μm for higher packing density of devices. At such smaller dimensions, a considerably higher concentration of p-type dopant (e.g., boron) at the gate would be required to avoid punch-through.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The usefulness of phosphorus implantation is shown by the following consideration. Without phosphorus implantation, the channel threshold would be greater than one volt; with high phosphorus implantation, a threshold voltage of about 0 volts is approached. Employing phosphorus implantation at the moderate levels disclosed herein permits attaining a threshold voltage of about 0.3 volts, which allows a variation in process parameters resulting in a ±0.1 volt deviation and still have an enhancement mode device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Other benefits of the process described herein include the following:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(a) The p<sup>+</sup>  field implant (region 13) is uniform; there is little lateral diffusion as with earlier techniques involving selective doping of the field region. This is due to implantation of boron following formation of the field oxide. Consequently, the process described here is superior for fabricating narrow channel devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(b) Alignment between the channel region (regions 14, 17) and the highly doped field region (region 13) is obtained. This is important in defining device parameters.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(c) The double implant process of the invention appears to reduce short and narrow channel effects on threshold voltage. Usually, in prior art devices, V<sub>T</sub> is observed to decrease as the channels get short and increase as the channels get narrow. Devices fabricated in accordance with the invention do not evidence such behavior to as great an extent.</div>
<heading>EXAMPLES</heading>
<heading>EXAMPLE 1</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">A device having substantially the same configurations as that depicted in FIG. 2 was fabricated. The thickness of the field oxide 11 was 4,000 A, while that of the gate oxide 22, 23 was about 400 A. Boron was implanted at a dosage of 1×10<sup>13</sup> /cm<sup>2</sup> at 120 keV. The first phosphorus implantation (enhancement mode device) was performed at a dosage of 3×10<sup>12</sup> /cm<sup>2</sup> at 200 keV; the second phosphorus implantation (depletion mode device) was performed at a dosage of 6×10<sup>12</sup> /cm<sup>2</sup> at 80 to 150 keV.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The channel threshold voltage of the enhancement mode device was 0.3 V. Less than 1 μA of current flowed across the parasitic transistor at 16 V, thus providing a desirable ratio of channel threshold voltage to parasitic voltage.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">Devices were fabricated substantially as in Example 1, employing a gate oxide thickness of about 360 A, with boron implantations at dosages of 1×10<sup>13</sup> /cm<sup>2</sup> at 120 keV. Phosphorus implantations for enhancement mode devices were performed at various dosages at 200 keV, while phosphorus implantations for depletion mode devices were performed at various dosages at 80 keV. The results are depicted in FIG. 4 (enhancement mode devices) and FIG. 5 (depletion mode devices), which are plots of resulting threshold voltage as a function of phosphorus implantation dosage. The statistical variations of observed device characteristics are plotted; these resulted from fluctuations in implant dose, thermal processing, oxide variations and the like.
