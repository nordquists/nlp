<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a bonded semiconductor substrate and a dielectric isolated bipolar transistor and, more specifically, to a method of manufacturing a bonded semiconductor substrate using a substrate bonding technique and a method of forming a dielectric isolated high-speed bipolar transistor on the bonded semi-conductor substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A dielectric isolated bipolar device having an SOI (silicon on insulator) structure has recently been proposed as a means for increasing the operation speed of a silicon bipolar transistor in order to reduce a junction capacitance between devices and between a collector and a substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A bonded semiconductor substrate having the SOI structure is manufactured by the following one conventional method. A silicon oxide film is formed on the surface of one of two semiconductor wafers or each surface of the two wafers, and the wafers are bonded by high-temperature heat treatment with the surfaces in contact with each other. After that, one of the bonded wafers is polished from the backside thereof and then etched.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The above method however has a drawback wherein the thickness of an SOI film of the bonded semiconductor wafers varies with the polishing and etching. The variation in thickness varies the depth of a collector layer of the finished transistor, which makes it difficult to control the resistance of the collector layer. The reduction in collector resistance is important for the high-speed operation of a bipolar transistor. Though it is advantageous to use a thin epitaxial growth layer to decrease the collector resistance, a variation in collector resistance is fatal to uniform formation of high-speed devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A method of forming the above dielectric isolated bipolar transistor on the conventional bonded semiconductor substrate has the drawback wherein the depth of the collector layer are varied with the uneven thickness of the SOI film, thereby making it difficult to control the collector resistance and to uniformly form the high-speed devices.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 5 is a graph showing an example of measured data representing the relationship between the concentration of Ge contained in a SiGe mixed crystal layer formed in the steps shown in FIGS. 1A to 1E and the critical thickness of a Si<sub>1-x</sub> Ge<sub>x</sub> epitaxial growth layer formed in the same steps.</div>
<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Embodiments of the present invention will now be described, with reference to the accompanying drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in FIG. 1A, a SiGe mixed crystal layer 12, a N<sup>-</sup> Si layer 13, a N<sup>+</sup> SiGe mixed crystal layer 14, and a N<sup>+</sup> Si layer 15 are epitaxially grown in this order on the top surface of a silicon substrate 11 to form a first substrate 10. It is advisable that the thicknesses of the layers 12 to 15 are 100 nm, 800 nm, 100 nm and 1000 nm, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When the SiGe mixed crystal layer 12 is formed, the composition ratio of Ge to Si has to be determined in consideration of the etching selective ratio of Ge to Si and the critical thickness of the epitaxial growth layer, as will be described later.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The higher the concentration of Ge, the larger the etching selective ratio of Ge to Si. As shown in FIG. 5, the critical thickness of an epitaxial growth layer (the maximum thickness of the layer capable of being formed in misfit dislocation free) tends to decrease as the concentration of Ge increases. FIG. 5 shows an example of measured data representing the relationship between the concentration of Ge and the critical thickness of a Si<sub>1-x</sub> Ge<sub>x</sub> epitaxial growth layer. This measured data is published in APPLIED PHYSICS LETTER, 1985, Vol. 47, page 322-324.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As is apparent from the graph shown in FIG. 5, for example, as in the embodiment of the present invention, it is necessary to set the percentage of Ge in the SiGe mixed crystal layer 12 at 20% or less in order to form a high-quality epitaxial growth layer when the thickness of the layer 12 is 100 nm, without simply increasing in the composition ratio (percentage) of Ge.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A second substrate 20, which includes a silicon substrate 21 and a SiO<sub>2</sub> layer 22 of about 1 to 1.5 μm formed on a top surface of a silicon substrate 21, is prepared, as illustrated in FIG. 1B. The SiO<sub>2</sub> layer 22 may be a thermally treated oxide film or a chemically vapor deposited (CVD) oxide film. It is advantageous to use the CVD oxide film rather than the thermal oxide film in order to avoid high-temperature heat treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The upper surfaces of the first and second substrates 10 and 20 contact each other, as shown in FIG. 1C, and these substrates are thermally heated for about 30 minutes in a N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere of 1000° C. to be bonded to each other, thus completing a bonded wafer 23.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">After that, as shown in FIG. 1D, the bonded wafer 23 is polished from the back (opposite to the top surface) of the first substrate 10. The polishing is stopped when it is performed to such an extent that the SiGe mixed crystal layer 12 of the first substrate 10 is not exposed, since variation is large in polishing. Thereafter, the selective etching is executed. The reason for performing the polishing prior to the selective etching is that the substrate 10 is generally quite thin, and thus an extremely long time is required to remove the substrate 10 if the selective etching is used from the beginning.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The above selective etching is executed so that it is stopped at the interface of the silicon substrate 11 and SiGe mixed crystal layer 12, that is, it is stopped at the time when the SiGe mixed crystal layer is exposed, by using an etchant which has a large etching ratio in which the etching speed of Si is significantly higher than of SiGe. A mixed solution of KOH, K<sub>2</sub> Cr<sub>2</sub> O<sub>7</sub>, and propanol is suitable for the etchant for selectively etching the silicon substrate 11 on the SiGe mixed crystal layer 12, since the selective ratio of the mixed solution is as large as about 17-20 (disclosed in Appl. Phys. Lett., 56, 373-375, 1990).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">If the exposed SiGe mixed crystal layer 12 is selectively etched to its underlying N--Si layer 13, a bonded semiconductor substrate 24 having the SOI structure is obtained, as shown in FIG. 1E.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is advisable to use a mixed solution of HF, H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub>, and CH<sub>3</sub> COOH as an etchant for etching the layer 12 (disclosed in J. Electrochem. Soc., 138, 202-204, 1991). The selective ratio in etching speed of the SiGe mixed crystal layer 12 to the N--Si layer 13 depends upon the percentage of Ge and, when the percentage is 20% or more, the selective ratio is 20 or more. The above selective (wet) etching using the etchant can be replaced with dry etching.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The element forming layer having the SOI structure obtained at this stage maintains a uniform thickness which is substantially the same as that of the layer growing epitaxially. If, therefore, the element forming layer is uniformly-grown epitaxially by using, for example, a SINGLE WAFER EPITAXIAL REACTOR or the like, the bonded semiconductor substrate 24 having the SOI structure can be improved in thickness uniformity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the foregoing embodiment, the bonded wafer 23 is obtained by bonding the first substrate 10 and the second substrate 20 having the SiO<sub>2</sub> layer 22 to each other. The present invention is not limited to this embodiment. FIGS. 2A to 2E and 3A to 3E show first and second modifications to the above embodiment. In the first modification, no SiO<sub>2</sub> is formed on the surface of the second substrate 20, as shown in FIG. 2B, while a SiO<sub>2</sub> layer 25 is formed on a N<sup>+</sup> Si layer 15 of the first substrate 10, as shown in FIG. 2A. As shown in 2C, a bonded wafer 23 can thus be formed by bonding the first and second substrates 10 and 20 to each other. Since the steps of FIGS. 2C to 2E are the same as those of FIGS. 1C to 1E, their descriptions are omitted. In the second modification, a SiO<sub>2</sub> layer 25 is formed on a N<sup>+</sup> Si layer 15 of the first substrate 10, as shown in FIG. 3A, while a SiO<sub>2</sub> layer is formed on the surface of the second substrate 20, as shown in FIG. 3B. As shown in FIG. 3C, a bonded wafer 23 can be formed by bonding both the SiO<sub>2</sub> layers of the first and second substrates 10 and 20 to each other. Since the steps of FIGS. 3C to 3E are substantially the same as those of FIGS. 1C to 1E, their descriptions are omitted. In the second modification, however, the bonded wafer warps greatly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 4A to 4F are cross-sectional views of a semiconductor structure in the respective steps of a method of manufacturing a dielectric isolated bipolar transistor according to another embodiment of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The following are the steps of forming a bipolar transistor on the bonded semiconductor substrate 24, as shown in FIG. 1E, which is completed according to the manufacturing method described above. First, as illustrated in FIG. 4A, a first insulation film pattern 31 is formed on each of element active layers 13a and 13b of a N<sup>-</sup> Si layer 13, which serve as an emitter/base and a collector of the bipolar transistor, respectively. The N<sup>-</sup> Si layer 13 is removed by selective etching until a N<sup>+</sup> SiGe mixed crystal layer 14 is exposed, using the insulation film patterns 31 as masks, with the result that a shallow trench 32 is formed by the remaining N<sup>-</sup> Si layer and the mask thereon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">SiO<sub>2</sub>, SiN, or the like is suitable for the material of the insulation film patterns 31, and the CVD is a desirable method for forming the patterns 31. Furthermore, it is advisable to use the reactive ion etching (RIE) as a method for etching the N<sup>-</sup> Si layer 13, in view of a difference in pattern conversion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Thereafter, as shown in FIG. 4B, a second insulation film pattern 33 is formed on a region other than the element isolation region, and the N<sup>+</sup> SiGe mixed crystal layer 14 and N<sup>+</sup> Si 15 are selectively etched using the insulation film pattern 33 as a mask, thereby forming a deep trench 34. In this step, too, it is advisable to use the RIE since anisotropic etching has to be performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The second insulation film pattern 33 and first insulation film pattern 31 are removed, as illustrated in FIG. 4C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">After that, as shown in FIG. 4D, a thick insulation film 35 (e.g., SiO<sub>2</sub> film) is deposited over the surface structure so that the shallow and deep trenches 32 and 34 are filled with the thick insulation film and further the element active layers 13a and 13b are covered with the thick insulation film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in FIG. 4E, the insulation film 35 is smoothed by the etch-back or polishing until the element active layers 13a and 13b are exposed. An element isolation structure of the dielectric isolated high-speed bipolar having a double trench structure is therefore completed through the above steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in FIG. 4F, a collector leading electrode 41, a base leading electrode 42, an interlayer insulation film (CVDSiO<sub>2</sub> film) 43, an emitter opening 51, and an emitter diffusing polysilicon layer 44 including N-type impurities, are formed by the normal steps. An emitter region (not shown) is then formed in the emitter/base layer 13a by emitter diffusion. After a base opening 52 and a collector opening 53 are formed, a metal wiring layer is formed and patterned, thereby forming a base electrode (wiring) 45, an emitter electrode (wiring) 46, and a collector electrode (wiring) 47. A dielectric isolated high-speed NPN transistor is therefore obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In FIG. 4F, the collector layer 13b, N<sup>+</sup> SiGe layer 14, and N<sup>+</sup> Si layer 15 constitute a collector region. In FIG. 4F, Cjc indicates a collector-to-base capacitance, Cjs denotes a substrate-to-collector capacitance, and rc represents a collector resistance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to the latter embodiment, since the bipolar transistor is formed on the bonded semiconductor substrate 24 of the SOI structure including the element forming layer having a uniform thickness, there occurs only a few variation in the depth of the collector layer (N<sup>-</sup> Si/N<sup>+</sup> SiGe/N<sup>+</sup> Si), and the collector resistance and its variations, and the variations in the collector-to-substrate capacitance Cjs and collector-to-base capacitance Cjc can be reduced at the same time. Therefore, a high-speed operation of the bipolar transistor can be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to the present invention described above, there can be realized a method of manufacturing a bonded semiconductor substrate including an element forming layer having a uniform thickness, and a method of manufacturing a dielectric isolated high-speed bipolar transistor having a structure capable of reducing the collector-to-substrate capacitance, collector-to-base capacitance, collector resistance, and their variations at the same time, which are hindrances to a high-speed operation of the bipolar-transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details, and illustrated examples shown and described herein. Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.</div>
