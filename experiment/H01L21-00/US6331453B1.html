<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">This invention relates generally to semiconductor packaging. More specifically this invention relates to a method for fabricating semiconductor packages using a mold tooling fixture with flash control cavities.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">One type of semiconductor package is referred to as a BGA package. BGA packages were developed to provide a higher lead count, and a smaller foot print, than conventional plastic or ceramic semiconductor packages. A BGA package includes an area array of solder balls that permit the package to be surface mounted to a printed circuit board (PCB) or other electronic component.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">One type of prior art BGA package <b>10</b> is illustrated in FIG. <b>1</b>A. The BGA package <b>10</b> includes a substrate <b>12</b>, an array of solder balls <b>14</b> on the substrate <b>12</b>, and a semiconductor die <b>16</b> on the substrate <b>12</b> in electrical communication with the solder balls <b>14</b>. The BGA package <b>10</b> also includes a die encapsulant <b>18</b> that encapsulates the die <b>16</b>, and a wire bond encapsulant <b>20</b> that encapsulates wire bonds <b>22</b> between the die <b>16</b> and a pattern of conductors <b>36</b> on the substrate <b>12</b>. In addition, the BGA package <b>10</b> includes a solder mask <b>24</b> having openings <b>26</b> on selected areas of the conductors <b>36</b> wherein the solder balls <b>14</b> are located.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Typically the substrate <b>12</b> comprises a reinforced polymer laminate material, such as bismaleimide triazine (BT), or a polyimide resin. In addition, the substrate <b>12</b> is initially a segment of a substrate panel <b>12</b>P (FIG. 2A) which is similar to a lead frame used in the fabrication of conventional plastic semiconductor packages. The substrate panel <b>12</b>P includes multiple substrates <b>12</b>, and is used to fabricate multiple BGA packages <b>10</b>. Following the fabrication process for the BGA packages <b>10</b>, the substrate panel <b>12</b>P is singulated into individual BGA packages <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The die encapsulant <b>18</b> and the wire bond encapsulant <b>20</b> can comprise a plastic material such as a Novoloc based epoxy formed using transfer molding process. The BGA package <b>10</b> is sometimes referred to as being “asymmetrical” because the die encapsulant <b>18</b> has a larger size and volume than the wire bond encapsulant <b>20</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">One problem with the asymmetrical BGA package <b>10</b>, which is illustrated in FIGS. 1B and 1C, occurs during molding of the wire bond encapsulants <b>20</b>. During fabrication of the BGA packages <b>10</b> on the substrate panel <b>12</b>P, the die encapsulants <b>18</b> are initially molded to the substrate panel <b>12</b>P using a first mold fixture <b>28</b> (FIG. <b>1</b>B). The first mold fixture <b>28</b> includes mold cavities <b>30</b> (FIG. 1B) and associated runners (not shown) in flow communication with a source of heated, pressurized plastic. The mold cavities <b>30</b> are configured to mold the die encapsulants <b>18</b> onto the substrate panel <b>12</b>P.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">After molding the die encapsulants <b>18</b>, the wire bond encapsulants <b>20</b> are molded to the panel <b>12</b>P using a second mold fixture <b>32</b> (FIG. <b>1</b>C). The second mold fixture <b>32</b> also includes mold cavities <b>34</b> (FIG. 1C) and associated runners (not shown) in flow communication with a source of heated, pressurized plastic. The mold cavities <b>34</b> are configured to mold the wire bond encapsulants <b>18</b> on the substrate panel <b>12</b>P.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Because of the construction of the first mold fixture <b>28</b>, a relatively high clamping pressure P<b>1</b> (FIG. 1B) can be exerted on either side of the substrate panel <b>12</b>P for sealing the mold cavities <b>30</b> during molding of the die encapsulants <b>18</b>. However, because of the construction of the second mold fixture <b>32</b>, only a relatively low clamping pressure P<b>2</b> (FIG. 1B) can be exerted on one side of the panel <b>12</b>P for sealing the mold cavities <b>34</b> during molding of the wire bond encapsulants <b>20</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The relatively low clamping pressure P<b>2</b> can allow excess plastic material, or “flash”, to escape from the mold cavities <b>34</b> (FIG. <b>1</b>C). The flash can deposit on the conductors <b>36</b> (FIG. <b>1</b>A), and in the openings <b>26</b> (FIG. 1A) in the solder mask <b>24</b> (FIG. <b>1</b>A). Depending on its location, the flash can adversely affect the solder balls <b>14</b>, and the bonded connections between the solder balls <b>14</b> and the conductors <b>36</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In view of the foregoing, improved methods for controlling mold flash during fabrication of semiconductor packages are needed in the art. The present invention is directed to a method for fabricating a semiconductor package in which mold flash is contained on a selected area of the package.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">In accordance with the present invention, a method for fabricating semiconductor packages, a semiconductor package fabricated using the method, and an electronic assembly that includes the package are provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the illustrative embodiment, the method is used to fabricate an asymmetrical BGA semiconductor package. The package includes a substrate and a semiconductor die mounted to the substrate. Initially, the substrate is provided with a first surface having a pattern of conductors, and an array ball bonding pads. The substrate also includes an opposing second surface with a die mounting area, and a wire bonding opening between the opposing surfaces. The die is attached circuit side down to the die mounting area, and wire bonds are formed through the wire bonding opening, between die contacts on the die, and the ball bonding pads on the conductors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Following attaching and wire bonding of the die, a die encapsulant is formed on the second surface of the substrate to encapsulate the die. The die encapsulant can be molded using a conventional mold tooling fixture having a mold cavity with a geometry corresponding to that of the die encapsulant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Following molding of the die encapsulant, a wire bond encapsulant is molded on the first surface of the substrate to encapsulate the wire bonds. For molding the wire bond encapsulant, a mold tooling fixture includes a mold cavity, and opposing flash control cavities located on either side of the mold cavity. The flash control cavities function to collect excess encapsulant, or flash, during molding of the wire bond encapsulant. This restricts the flash to a flash area on the substrate, and prevents the flash from contaminating the ball bonding pads. In addition, the flash control cavities provide pressure relief for the pressurized molding compound within the mold cavity during molding of the wire bond encapsulant. In the illustrative embodiment the flash control cavities comprise parallel spaced grooves in the mold tooling fixture located on either side of longitudinal edges of the mold cavity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Following the molding steps, solder balls can be bonded to the ball bonding pads to form terminal contacts for the package. Because of the absence of flash on the ball bonding pads, bonding of the solder balls and the resulting bonded connections are improved, and package reliability is improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The electronic assembly includes one or more packages surface mounted to a supporting substrate, such as a printed circuit board.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring to FIGS. 2A-2G, a panel <b>42</b> containing a plurality of substrates <b>56</b> suitable for constructing a semiconductor package <b>62</b> (FIG. 3E) in accordance with the invention is illustrated. Each substrate <b>56</b> is a segment of the panel <b>42</b>, and will subsequently be separated from the adjacent substrates <b>56</b> to form a plurality of semiconductor packages <b>62</b> (FIG. <b>3</b>E). In the illustrative embodiment, there are eighteen substrates <b>56</b> on the panel <b>42</b>. However, this number is merely exemplary, and the panel <b>42</b> can include a fewer or greater number of substrates <b>56</b>. The panel <b>42</b> facilitates the fabrication process in that different operations, such as die attach, wire bonding, and molding can be performed at the same time on each of the substrates <b>56</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Each substrate <b>56</b> includes a first surface <b>46</b>A (FIG. <b>2</b>A), and an opposing second surface <b>46</b>B (FIG. <b>2</b>B). The first surface <b>46</b>A, and the second surface <b>46</b>B, are the major planar surfaces of the substrates <b>56</b>. Each substrate <b>56</b> also includes a pattern of conductors <b>48</b> (FIG. 2C) formed on the first surface <b>46</b>A thereof, and a corresponding die attach area <b>50</b> formed on the second surface <b>46</b>B thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The substrates <b>56</b> comprise an electrically insulating material such as an organic polymer resin reinforced with glass fibers. Suitable materials for the substrates <b>56</b> include bismaleimide-triazine (BT), epoxy resins (e.g., “FR-4” and “FR-5”), and polyimide resins. These materials can be formed with a desired thickness, and then punched, machined, or otherwise formed with a required peripheral configuration, and with required features. A representative thickness of the substrates <b>56</b> can be from about 0.2 mm to 1.6 mm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in FIG. 2A, the panel <b>42</b> includes circular indexing openings <b>58</b> formed through the substrates <b>56</b> and proximate to the longitudinal edges of the panel <b>42</b>. The indexing openings <b>58</b> permit the panel <b>42</b> to be handled by automated transfer mechanisms associated with chip bonders, wire bonders, mold tooling fixtures, and ball bonding machinery. In addition, the panel <b>42</b> includes elongated separation openings <b>60</b> which facilitate singulation of the substrates <b>56</b> on the panel <b>42</b> into separate semiconductor packages <b>62</b> (FIG. <b>3</b>E). The substrates <b>56</b> also include wire bonding openings <b>64</b> which provide access for wire bonding semiconductor dice <b>16</b> (FIG. 3B) to the patterns of conductors <b>48</b> on the substrates <b>56</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring to FIG. 2C, a single substrate <b>56</b> and the conductors <b>48</b> on the substrate <b>56</b> are shown in greater detail. The conductors <b>48</b> comprise a highly conductive metal layer, which is blanket deposited onto the substrate <b>56</b> (e.g., electroless or electrolytic plating), and then etched in required patterns. Rather than etching the conductors <b>48</b>, an additive process, such as electroless deposition through a mask, can be used to form the conductors <b>48</b> in required patterns. In the illustrative embodiment the conductors <b>48</b> extend to the edges of the separation openings <b>60</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A preferred metal for the conductors <b>48</b> is copper. Other suitable metals for the conductors <b>48</b> include aluminum, titanium, tungsten, tantalum, platinum, molybdenum, cobalt, nickel, gold, and iridium. If desired, the substrate <b>56</b> and conductors <b>48</b> can be constructed from a commercially produced bi-material core, such as a copper clad bismaleimide-triazine (BT) core, available from Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Corp., Japan. A representative weight of the copper can be from 0.5 oz to 2 oz. per square foot.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in FIG. 2C, each conductor <b>48</b> includes a wire bonding pad <b>52</b> and a ball bonding pad <b>54</b>. The wire bonding pads <b>52</b> can include metal layers, such as nickel and gold, selected to facilitate the wire bonding process. The ball bonding pads <b>54</b> can also include metal layers and solder flux layers, selected to facilitate attachment of solder balls <b>80</b> (FIG. 3E) to the ball bonding pads <b>54</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in FIG. 2D, a solder mask <b>66</b> substantially covers the first surface <b>46</b>A. The solder mask <b>66</b> can comprise a photoimageable dielectric material, such as a negative or positive tone resist. One suitable resist is commercially available from Taiyo America, Inc., Carson City, Nev. under the trademark “PSR-4000”. The “PSR-4000” resist can be mixed with an epoxy such as epoxy “720” manufactured by Ciba-Geigy (e.g., 80% PSR-4000 and 20% epoxy “720”). Another suitable resist is commercially available from Shipley under the trademark “XP-9500”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in FIG. 2E, the solder mask <b>66</b> also substantially covers the conductors <b>48</b>. As shown in FIG. 2F, the solder mask <b>66</b> includes openings <b>68</b> aligned with the ball bonding pads <b>54</b>. The openings <b>68</b> can be formed by photo patterning and developing the above described resist. As will be further explained, the openings <b>68</b> locate and protect the solder balls <b>80</b> (FIG. 3E) on the completed semiconductor package <b>62</b> (FIG. <b>3</b>E).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in FIG. 2C, the first surface <b>46</b>A of the panel <b>42</b> also includes triangular metal segments <b>69</b> which function as pin #<b>1</b> indicators. The first surface <b>46</b>A also includes rectangular metal segments <b>71</b>A, <b>71</b>B which function as mold compound gate breaks. The metal segments <b>69</b>, <b>71</b>A, <b>71</b>B can comprise a same metal as the conductors <b>48</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in FIG. 2B, the second surface <b>46</b>B of the panel <b>42</b> also includes rectangular metal segments <b>76</b>A, and square metal segment <b>76</b>B, which function as mold compound gate breaks. The second surface <b>46</b>B also includes triangular metal segment <b>78</b> which function as a pin #<b>1</b> indicators.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring to FIG. 3A-3E, steps in the method for fabricating the semiconductor package <b>62</b> (FIG. 3E) in accordance with the invention are illustrated. For simplicity, only a single package <b>62</b> is illustrated. However, in actual practice the fabrication method can be performed on a panel <b>42</b> (FIG. 2A) which contains multiple packages <b>62</b> (FIG. <b>3</b>E), that will subsequently be singulated into individual semiconductor packages <b>62</b> (FIG. <b>3</b>E).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Initially, as shown in FIG. 3A the substrate <b>56</b> is provided. The substrate <b>56</b> includes the first surface <b>46</b>A which contains the conductors <b>48</b>, and the solder mask <b>66</b> formed substantially as previously described. The conductors <b>48</b> include the wire bonding pads <b>52</b> and the ball bonding pads <b>54</b>. In addition, the solder mask <b>66</b> includes openings <b>68</b> that align with the ball bonding pads <b>54</b>. The substrate <b>56</b> also includes a die attach area <b>50</b> on the second surface <b>46</b>B, and a wire bonding opening <b>64</b> through the substrate <b>56</b> from the second surface <b>46</b>B to the first surface <b>46</b>A.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, as shown in FIG. 3B, the die <b>16</b> is bonded circuit side down to the substrate <b>56</b> using an adhesive layer <b>72</b>. The adhesive layer <b>72</b> can comprise a filled epoxy, an unfilled epoxy, an acrylic, or a polyimide material. A conventional die attacher can be used to form the adhesive layer <b>72</b> and adhesively bond the die <b>16</b> to the substrate <b>56</b>. Contacts <b>74</b> on the die <b>16</b>, such as bond pads, align with the wire bonding opening <b>64</b> in the substrate <b>56</b>. This configuration of the die <b>16</b> and the substrate <b>56</b> is sometimes referred to as board-on-chip (BOC). In addition, the completed semiconductor package <b>62</b> is sometimes referred to as a BGA package.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As an alternate configuration, the die <b>16</b> can be back bonded to the substrate <b>56</b>, and wire bonded to conductors located on a same surface of the substrate <b>56</b> as the die <b>16</b>. This alternate configuration is sometimes referred to as chip-on-board (COB). Alternately, instead of wire bonding, a flip chip process (e.g., C<b>4</b>), or a TAB bonding process, can be used to electrically connect the die <b>16</b> to the conductors <b>48</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As also shown in FIG. 3B, following attachment of the die <b>16</b> to the substrate <b>56</b>, wire bonds <b>70</b> can be formed between the die contacts <b>74</b> on the die <b>16</b>, and the wire bonding pads <b>52</b> on the substrate <b>56</b>. A conventional wire bonder can be used to perform the wire bonding step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, as shown in FIG. 3C, following wire bonding, the die encapsulant <b>82</b> is molded to the substrate <b>56</b> to encapsulate the die <b>16</b>. The die encapsulant <b>82</b> can comprise a suitable plastic molding compound, such as a Novolac based epoxy, molded into a desired shape using a transfer molding apparatus, and then cured using an oven. In the illustrative embodiment, the die encapsulant <b>82</b> has a generally rectangular peripheral configuration. A mold tooling fixture <b>84</b> having a mold cavity <b>86</b>, is provided for molding the die encapsulant <b>82</b>. The mold tooling fixture <b>84</b> can comprise a component of a conventional transfer molding apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The mold cavity <b>86</b> is in flow communication with a runner (not shown) and a source of hot viscous molding compound under a high pressure. For simplicity the tooling fixture <b>84</b> is illustrated as being in contact with the second surface <b>46</b>B of the substrate <b>56</b>. However, in actual practice the tooling fixture <b>84</b> can be clamped on either side of the substrate <b>56</b> with a high clamp pressure, substantially as previously described and shown in FIG. <b>1</b>B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, as shown in FIG. 3D, following molding of the die encapsulant <b>82</b>, the wire bond encapsulant <b>88</b> can be molded. The wire bond encapsulant <b>88</b> substantially fills the wire bonding opening <b>64</b>, encapsulates the wire bonds <b>70</b>, and covers a selected area on the first surface <b>46</b>A of the substrate <b>56</b>. In addition, the wire bond encapsulant <b>88</b> covers the wire bonding pads <b>52</b> and terminal portions of the conductors <b>48</b>. In the illustrative embodiment, the wire bond encapsulant <b>88</b> has a generally rectangular peripheral configuration, and includes longitudinal edges <b>100</b> (FIG. <b>4</b>D). A thickness of the wire bond encapsulant <b>88</b> can be selected as required, but must be less than a height of the solder balls <b>80</b> (FIG. <b>3</b>E).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As with the die encapsulant <b>82</b>, the wire bond encapsulant <b>88</b> can comprise a suitable plastic molding compound, such as a Novolac based epoxy, molded into a desired shape using a transfer molding apparatus, and then cured using an oven. A mold tooling fixture <b>90</b> is provided for performing the molding step for the wire bond encapsulant <b>88</b>. As with the mold tooling fixture <b>84</b> (FIG. 3C) the mold tooling fixture <b>90</b> is a component of a transfer mold apparatus as previously described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring to FIG. 4A-4E, further characteristics of the mold tooling fixture <b>90</b> and the completed package <b>62</b> are illustrated. As shown in FIG. 4A, the mold tooling fixture <b>90</b> includes a mold cavity <b>92</b>, and a pair of flash control cavities <b>44</b> located on either side of the mold cavity <b>92</b>. The mold tooling fixture <b>90</b> includes a mating segment with associated supply runners in flow communication with the mold cavity <b>92</b> and with a source of heated molding compound. For simplicity, the mating segment and associated and plastic supply runners for the mold tooling fixture <b>90</b> are not shown.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in FIG. 4B, the mold tooling fixture <b>90</b> also includes vents <b>110</b> for venting air, and other gases, in the mold cavity <b>92</b> during filling of the mold cavity <b>92</b> with the heated molding compound. The vents <b>110</b> can comprise thin slots formed in the mold tooling fixture <b>90</b> to a required depth (e.g., 0.05-0.07 inches).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As also shown in FIG. 4B, the mold cavity <b>92</b> has a rectangular geometry which corresponds to a geometry of the wire bond encapsulant <b>88</b> (FIG. <b>3</b>E). As such, the mold cavity <b>92</b> includes longitudinal edges <b>108</b> which correspond to the longitudinal edges <b>100</b> (FIG. 4D) of the wire bond encapsulant <b>88</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The flash control cavities <b>44</b> can comprise grooves, or alternately through slots, in the mold tooling fixture <b>90</b>. In addition, the flash control cavities <b>44</b> are parallel to, and spaced from the longitudinal edges <b>108</b> of the mold cavity <b>92</b>. The flash control cavities <b>44</b> provide pressure relief for venting the pressurized molding compound from the mold cavity during molding of the wire bond encapsulant <b>88</b>. The pressure relief allows venting of the pressurized molding compound to occur from the mold cavity <b>92</b> to the flash control cavities <b>44</b> at substantially any location along the longitudinal edges <b>108</b> thereof. However, at the same time that venting can occur, flash F is contained by the flash control cavities <b>44</b> to a selected area of the substrate <b>56</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in FIG. 4C, each flash control cavity <b>44</b> is spaced from the longitudinal edge <b>108</b> of the mold cavity <b>92</b> by a spacing distance Y. In addition, each flash control cavity <b>44</b> has a width of W. A representative range for a depth D (FIG. 4A) of each flash control cavity <b>44</b> can be from about 0.025 inches, to a depth equal to a thickness of the mold tooling fixture <b>90</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, as shown in FIG. 4B, the flash control cavities <b>44</b> have a length L that is approximately equal to, but greater than the length of the longitudinal edge <b>108</b> of the mold cavity <b>92</b>. Also in the illustrative embodiment, the flash control cavities <b>44</b> are in flow communication with vents <b>110</b> on either side thereof. As with the mold cavity <b>92</b>, the vents <b>110</b> provide an outlet for air, or other gases from the flash control cavities <b>44</b> allowing the pressurized molding compound to more easily vent into the flash control cavities <b>44</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in FIG. 4D, the flash control cavities <b>44</b> restrict the flash F to a flash area FA on the solder mask <b>66</b>. The flash area FA is located proximate to the longitudinal edge <b>100</b> of the wire bond encapsulant <b>88</b> and is defined by the longitudinal edge <b>100</b> and by the flash control cavities <b>44</b>. In addition, the flash area FA has a width approximately equal to the spacing Y (FIG. 4C) of the flash control cavities <b>44</b>, plus the width W (FIG. 4C) of the flash control cavities <b>44</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring to FIG. 3E, following formation of the wire bond encapsulant <b>88</b>, the solder balls <b>80</b> can be bonded to the ball bonding pads <b>54</b> on the conductors <b>48</b>. The solder balls <b>80</b> form external contacts for the package <b>62</b>, and provide connection points from the outside world to the electrical circuits and semiconductor devices contained on the semiconductor die <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A solder reflow process can be used to bond the solder balls <b>80</b> to the ball bonding pads <b>54</b>. Prior to the solder reflow process, solder flux can be deposited on the ball bonding pads <b>54</b> and on the solder balls <b>80</b>. The solder balls <b>80</b> can then be placed on the ball bonding pads <b>54</b>, and a furnace used to form metallurgical solder joints between the solder balls <b>80</b> and the ball bonding pads <b>54</b>. During bonding of the solder balls <b>80</b>, the openings <b>68</b> in the solder mask <b>66</b> facilitate alignment of the solder balls <b>80</b> to the ball bonding pads <b>54</b>. As shown in FIG. 4E, in the completed semiconductor package <b>62</b>, the solder mask <b>66</b> insulates adjacent solder balls <b>80</b> and insulates the conductors <b>48</b> from the solder balls. Rather than bonding solder balls <b>80</b>, a deposition process such as CVD, screen printing, electro-deposition or electroless deposition can be used to form external contacts on the ball bonding pads <b>54</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring to FIG. 5, an electronic assembly <b>98</b> constructed using the semiconductor package <b>62</b> is illustrated. The electronic assembly <b>98</b> can be configured as a printed circuit board, a multi chip module, or a sub assembly of electronic product such as a field emission display.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The electronic assembly includes a supporting substrate <b>96</b>, and a plurality of the semiconductor packages <b>62</b> surface mounted to the supporting substrate <b>96</b>. Depending on the application, the supporting substrate <b>96</b> can comprise a ceramic, a plastic or a printed circuit board material (e.g., FR-4). To form the assembly <b>98</b>, the solder balls <b>80</b> (FIG. 3E) on the packages <b>62</b>, are bonded to corresponding electrodes (not shown) on the supporting substrate <b>96</b>, using a suitable bonding process such as soldering, or curing of a conductive polymer. Because of the absence of flash F on the ball bonding pads <b>54</b>, and the improved bonding of the solder balls to the package substrate <b>56</b>, the reliability of the package <b>62</b> and the bonded connections to the supporting substrate <b>96</b> are improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Thus the invention provides a method for fabricating semiconductor packages, such as asymmetrical BGA packages, in which molding flash is contained on selected areas of the package. Although the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art, certain changes and modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the invention, as defined by the following claims.</div>
