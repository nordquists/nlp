<heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates to wiring boards that have a plurality of wiring layers, and in particular to wiring boards that have less electromagnetic interference. Further, the present invention relates to wiring boards that are excellent in productivity and have a structure appropriate for packaging of high density.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In addition, the present invention relates to a fabrication method of the wiring boards, and in particular to a fabrication method of the wiring boards capable of fabricating wiring boards adequate for packaging of high density with high productivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, the present invention relates to semiconductor packages, and in particular to semiconductor packages that are less in electromagnetic interference. Still further, the present invention relates to semiconductor packages that can mount a semiconductor element of high degree of integration.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">In recent years, high functionality of wiring boards is in progress. This is because when mounting a semiconductor device such as a semiconductor element or the like on a wiring board, corresponding to demand for high functionality and high integration of a semiconductor device, demand for high integration and high functionality at system level occurs. In order to package such a semiconductor device, there is a necessity to give a wiring board various functions. For instance, corresponding to high densification and multiple pinning of the semiconductor device itself, fine patterning of pitches connecting between a semiconductor device and a wiring board mounting thereof, and fine patterning of wiring pitches (L/S) of the wiring board itself are in demand.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A conventional printed wiring board, due to its fabrication method, has a disadvantage that its wiring area becomes smaller due to through holes disposed for interlayer connection. This is because when through holes for interlayer connection are formed, a layer other than necessary one is also bored. Thus bored holes make less the wiring area for the other wiring layers. To solve such problems, there has been proposed a wiring board in which only the layers necessary for interlayer connection can be selectively bored.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As one of such wiring boards, there is an IVH board in which multiplication of layers is accomplished by stacking boards of which interlayer connection is formed by the use of through holes as identical as the conventional wiring board. For such an IVH board, each layer requires a step of boring, in addition after stacking them a step of further boring is necessary, thus resulting in an extremely expensive wiring board. In such type wiring board in which interlayer connection is furnished by the use of through holes, there was a problem that due to plating a thickness of conductor of a wiring layer becomes thick accordingly it is difficult to obtain fine patterning of wiring. On the other hand, there has been proposed another type of wiring boards in which pillars (protruded electrode) are formed on a wiring layer by the use of conductive resin, and interlayer connection of a plurality of wiring layers is furnished by letting the conductive pillars pierce through a prepreg.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In these wiring boards, compared with the conventional wiring boards, the steps of boring, plating and polishing are made unnecessary for furnishing interlayer connection, and only necessary portions can be furnished with interlayer connections. Accordingly, in addition to improvement the degree of freedom of design, productivity can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, compared with connection with through holes, interlayer connection can be implemented without decreasing an area that can package electronic parts. In addition, since the plating is unnecessary, thickening of a wiring layer can be avoided, and fine patterning of wiring can be implemented easily.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">However, in such type wiring boards in which interlayer connection is implemented by the use of the conductive pillars, there were following problems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">First, when with a wiring board that has multiple layers furnished by the use of conductive pillars as a core material further wiring layers are stacked on the outside thereof, there is a problem that reliability of the wiring boards is difficult to maintain. The conductive pillars that are formed by the use of conductive paste are such hard as to pierce through a prepreg. Accordingly, there was a problem that via lands and conductive pillars at portions of interlayer connection of the core material are tend to deform. According to the observation of the inventors, this is because that since insulating layers of the core material and external layer material are composed of approximately identical materials, due to heating during a step of stacking the layer of insulating resin constituting the core material softens to deform due to pressure during the step of stacking. When such deformation occurs, reliability of interlayer connection is deteriorated. Accordingly, conditions in the step of stacking such as temperature, pressure or the like are required to control rigorously, resulting in restricting productivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, so far, there was another problem that the conductive pillars disposed on base material and core material, because the thickness of insulating layers is thick, tend to be broad in diameter. When a diameter is made small, there is a case where sufficiently reliable interlayer connection due to the conductive pillars can not be obtained. In order to secure reliability of connection, process conditions must be rigorously controlled.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention is made out to solve such problems as described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">That is to say, an object of the present invention is to provide wiring boards having a structure that in addition to being able to cope with packaging of high density, is high in productivity and reliability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, another object of the present invention is to provide a fabrication method of wiring boards having a structure that in addition to being able to cope with high density packaging, is high in productivity and reliability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Still another object of the present invention is to provide semiconductor packages that are capable of packaging a semiconductor element of high degree of integration and of high operating speed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Now, as electronic instruments become smaller, for instance smaller high frequency oscillators are in demand. To cope with such a demand, in oscillators of high frequency, dielectric boards thereon signal lines (strip lines) are formed are stacked, on this multi-layered wiring board, other than the signal lines, other wiring pattern is disposed, and various kinds of electronic parts are mounted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, when transmission lines are disposed on a surface of a stacked dielectric board and other wiring pattern is formed within the stacked dielectric board (disposed inside) signal radiation is generated to be likely to adversely affect on the other wiring pattern. In addition, external electromagnetic noise may adversely affect to induce malfunction of wiring circuits including transmission lines, semiconductor packages, and electronic instruments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">To cope with such problems, as essential configurations are shown with sections in FIG. <b>26</b> and FIG. 27, respectively, there is a trial in which while a pair of ground layers <b>92</b> <i>a </i>and <b>92</b> <i>b </i>sandwich a transmission line <b>91</b> or a via hole <b>99</b> from up and down directions, further on the sides of both side surfaces of a transmission line <b>91</b> or a via hole <b>99</b>, shield patterns <b>93</b> <i>a </i>and <b>93</b> <i>b </i>(one turn type) are disposed to electrically connect to the ground layers <b>92</b> <i>a </i>and <b>92</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">That is, by constituting so as to surround a transmission line <b>91</b> from up and down directions and right and left directions, the transmission line <b>91</b> is secured in shielding (Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. Hei 5-299878). Incidentally, in FIG. <b>26</b> and FIG. 27, reference numeral <b>94</b> denotes a dielectric layer (insulating layer).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">However, in the case of a shield structure such as described above being employed, ordinarily, although the thickness thereof is in the range of from several tens μm to 100 μm, due to gaps that the dielectric layer forms and formation of closed circuits, the transmission line <b>91</b> can not be sufficiently shielded. Therefore, by influencing to each other with other transmission lines and electronic parts within a wiring board, stable circuit operation can not be secured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As a remedy for this, there has been proposed a configuration in which the transmission line <b>91</b> is sandwiched from up and down directions by a pair of ground layers <b>92</b> <i>a </i>and <b>92</b> <i>b</i>, and further these ground layers <b>92</b> <i>a </i>and <b>92</b> <i>b </i>are electrically connected by a plurality of vertical grounding conductors (via hole connection) at the surrounding areas thereof (Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. Hei 8-78912).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">That is, the unnecessary radiation of the up and down directions of the transmission line <b>91</b> is shielded by a pair of ground layers <b>92</b> <i>a </i>and <b>92</b> <i>b </i>that sandwich the line <b>91</b> from the up and down directions, and the unnecessary radiation on the side of the side surfaces of the transmission line <b>91</b> is shielded by the vertical grounding conductors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When such a configuration that surrounds the transmission line <b>91</b> from the up and down and left and right directions is taken, adverse influence due to the transmission line can be reduced. However, still there remains a problem that will be described in the following. That is, in the wiring board of this kind, compact circuit design and high performance is in demand. To cope with this demand, wiring of high density or fine patterning of wiring is in progress. As a result of this, complicated processing operation, fine and high precision processing or the like is in demand. In other words, upon connecting the ground layers <b>92</b> <i>a </i>and <b>92</b> <i>b </i>by vertical ground conductors, on corresponding positions where holes are necessary to be bored in advance by the use of a drill or the like, and inside these holes conductive films are required to form. However, the aforementioned boring operation with a drill or the like is restricted to holes of diameter of approximately several hundreds μm or more. Thereby, wiring of high density is largely restricted. Further, the boring operation being restricted to holes of diameter of approximately several hundreds μm or more disturbs not only high densification of L/S of wiring and fine patterning of wiring but also influences largely on yield to ensue rising of the cost.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention is made out to cope with the aforementioned situation. An object of the present invention is to provide wiring boards that can be fabricated with simple processes and are furnished with a transmission line having shielding property high in reliability and fabrication methods thereof. In addition, another object of the present invention is to provide semiconductor packages provided with such wiring board.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">The aforementioned shielding means may have a plurality of conductive pillars disposed along the transmission line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, the conductive pillars may be disposed piercing through the insulating layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, the conductive pillars may be disposed so that a central axis thereof is approximately vertical to an extending direction of the transmission line. When a line that is disposed approximately in parallel with a surface of a wiring board is shielded, such a constitution is only necessary to adopt.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Still further, the conductive pillars may be disposed so that a central axis thereof is approximately in parallel with an extending direction of the transmission line. When a line (for instance, a portion of interlayer connection) disposed approximately vertical to a surface of a wiring board is being shielded a constitution like this is only necessary to adopt.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In addition, a wiring board of the present invention comprises a transmission line that has a first surface and a second surface, a first conductor layer that faces to the first surface of the transmission line, a second conductor layer that faces to the second surface of the transmission line, a shielding means consisting of conductive material and connecting the first conductor layer and the second conductor layer, and an insulating layer insulating the transmission line from the first conductor layer, the second conductor layer, and the shielding means.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The shielding means may have a plurality of conductive pillars that is disposed along the transmission line and connects the first conductor layer and the second conductor layer by piercing through the insulating layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, the insulating layer may comprise a first insulating layer disposed on the first surface side of the transmission line and a second insulating layer disposed on the second surface side of the transmission line. The conductive pillars may have a first portion that pierces through the first insulating layer and a second portion that pierces through the second insulating layer. In this case, the first portion and the second portion of the conductive pillars may be connected through a via land or may be connected directly without through the via land.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, the shielding means may have a third conductor layer that connects the first conductor layer and the second conductor layer. For instance, the insulating layer may have a groove disposed along the transmission line, and the third conductor layer may be disposed to cover at least the surface of the groove to connect the first conductor layer and the second conductor layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A wiring board of the present invention comprises a first insulating layer having a first surface and a second surface, a first conductive pillar disposed piercing through the first insulating layer, a second conductive pillar disposed so as to encircle the surroundings of the first conductive pillar while piercing through the first insulating layer, a second insulating layer that has a first surface and a second surface, and is stacked with the first insulating layer so that the first surface thereof and the second surface of the first insulating layer face are faced to each other, a third conductive pillar disposed so as to connect with the first conductive pillar while piercing through the second insulating layer, and a fourth conductive pillar that encircles the surroundings of the third conductive pillar and is disposed so as to connect with the second conductive pillar while piercing through the second insulating layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">On the second surface of the second insulating layer a conductive pad that is disposed connected with the first conductive pillar may be comprised further.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">On the second surface of the second insulating layer, a conductor pattern (shield pattern) that is disposed so as to encircle the conductor pad to connect commonly the second conductive pillars may be further comprised.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In addition, the first conductive pillars and the third conductive pillars may be connected through via-lands and wiring layers, or may be connected directly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The semiconductor package of the present invention is a semiconductor package in which a semiconductor element is packaged on a wiring board, wherein the wiring board comprises a transmission line disposed on an inner layer of the wiring board, a shielding means that is disposed along the transmission line to encircle the surroundings of the transmission line and shields the transmission line, and an insulating layer disposed between the transmission line and the shielding means.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, a wiring board of the present invention comprises a signal wiring incorporated within an insulating layer, a pair of ground layers incorporated and disposed on both sides so as to sandwich the signal wiring, and at least a layer of shield pattern that is incorporated between the pair of ground layers on the side surface sides of the signal wiring and connected electrically to the ground layers, wherein electrical connection of the shield pattern to the ground layers may be implemented by the use of conductive bumps that pierce through the insulating layers at a plurality of places.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, the wiring board may comprise a transmission line incorporated within an insulating layer, a pair of ground layers disposed on both surface sides so as to sandwich the transmission line, and a plurality of layers of shield pattern that is disposed between the pair of ground layers on the side surface sides of the transmission line and connected electrically to the ground layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Mutual electrical connection at least between shield patterns may be implemented by the use of conductive bumps that are disposed so as to engage on surfaces facing to each other and pierce through the insulating layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the present invention, a conductive bump that due to compression pierces through an insulating layer to connect electrically between shield patterns that face to each other or between a shield pattern and a conductor layer for grounding is conductive composite or conductive metal that can be prepared by the following means. For instance, on a portion of copper foil where a shield pattern is to be formed or on a prescribed position of a shield pattern, by the use of printing method with a relatively thick metal mask, a protrusion of high aspect ratio is formed. This protrusion is desirable to form in approximate cone. Height, diameter and distribution of the conductive pillars may be appropriately set according to constitution of the piercing conductor portions to be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In concrete, they are determined considering final arrangement and structure of conductive bumps that pierce through an insulating layer. For instance, in the case of a synthetic resin based sheet being a B stage epoxy resin layer containing a glass cloth, when pressurized in from both surface sides, a height of approximately 80 to 200% of a thickness of the B stage epoxy resin layer is desirable, and when pressurized in from one surface side, a height of approximately 180 to 400% of the B stage epoxy resin layer is desirable. In addition, the conductive pillars can be arranged by the use of stamp method in which a mask that is formed by boring holes of approximately 0.05 to 0.3 mm on prescribed positions of a plate of stainless steel of a thickness of, for instance, approximately 5 mm, is placed on all the surface of a casing, and conductive composite (paste) accommodated in the casing is pressurized to extrude from the holes of the mask.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the wiring board of the present invention, electrical connection between a signal wiring disposed incorporated within an insulating layer and ground layer and shield pattern is implemented by the use of conductive bumps piercing through the insulating layer at a plurality of positions. That is, conductor layers facing to each other are connected with fine conductive bumps and reinforced in connection due to penetration of the insulating layer therethrough. Accordingly, in addition to realization of the fine shield pattern, it can work as a wiring board that is given a shielding property of high reliability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, electrical connection of a signal line disposed incorporated in an insulating layer to a ground layer and a shield pattern is implemented at a plurality of positions, and shield patterns themselves are connected by conductive bumps that pierce through the insulating layer in engaging manner to the facing surface. That is, facing conductor layers are connected over approximately whole circumference with fine conductive bumps and moreover with a form reinforced by the penetrated insulating. Accordingly, in addition to realization of fine shield patterns, it can work as a wiring board that is given a shielding property of high reliability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">While materializing simplification of fabrication steps, wiring boards that realize the aforementioned fine shield patterns and are given shielding property of high reliability can be provided with high yield.</div>

By implementing thus, at the same time with establishment of the interlayer connection due to the conductive pillars, fine holes or unevenness on a surface of ceramic material are filled by the prepreg. However hard the ceramic material that is generally a sintered body is polished, there remains fine holes or unevenness on the surface thereof. When stacking thin films of ceramics to each other, such unevenness or holes are required to fill. However, in the wiring board of the present invention, by the use of resin material of semi-cured state, the unevenness and holes on the surface of ceramics are filled automatically. Thereby, productivity can be improved. In addition, due to an anchoring effect of the unevenness on the surface of the ceramics to the resin layer, a plurality of insulating layers themselves can be connected strongly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Thermal conductivity of the first insulating layer may be larger than that of the second insulating layer. The ceramic material is larger in thermal conductivity than the resin material, accordingly heat due to for instance a semiconductor element or the like can be dissipated in a plane direction of the wiring board through the wiring board.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the above, though a constitution in which the first insulating layer and the second insulating layer are stacked together is described, the second insulating layer can be disposed on both surfaces of the first insulating layer. Further, such a stacked body can be employed as a core material to form a further multi-layered body. Even in such a case, in a wiring board of the present invention, due to adoption of the insulating layer of larger hardness, over the whole surface of the wiring board, uniform pressure can be applied. Therefore, productivity and reliability of connection due to conductive pillars can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">That is, a wiring board may comprise a first insulating layer having a first hardness that has a first surface and a second surface and is provided with first via-lands on either one of the first surface or the second surface, a plurality of second insulating layers having a second hardness smaller than the first hardness that is disposed so as to sandwich the first insulating layer, second via-lands disposed so as to face the first insulating layer through the second insulating layer, and conductive pillars connecting the first via-lands and the second via-lands by piercing through the second insulating layer.</div>

Accordingly, a wiring board that is thin and suitable for packaging of high density can be manufactured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, in a semiconductor element of which degree of integrity is particularly high and operational frequency is high, securing of thermal dissipation path is of importance. However, the conductive pillars that are an interlayer connecting means furnished to the wiring board of the present invention can be employed as thermal via to improve property of heat dissipation. In particular, since ceramic material and metallic material have thermal conductivity larger than resin material, for instance, prepreg or the like, by thermally connecting a semiconductor element and a first insulating layer by conductive pillars, a semiconductor device of high performance can be packaged.

<div class="description-paragraph">Further, interlayer connection of a plurality of wiring layers of the present wiring board may be implemented by combining the conductive pillars and other means for interlayer connection.

<div class="description-paragraph">That is, the wiring board of the present invention may further comprise second conductive pillars that are disposed independent electrically from the first conductive pillars and connected thermally with the metallic plate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In addition, the first insulating layer may have fine unevenness on the surface thereof, and the second insulating layer may engage with the unevenness of the first insulating layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For instance, for the first insulating layer, for instance ceramic material may be employed, and for the second insulating layer resin material such as prepreg may be employed. By implementing thus, at the same time with establishment of the interlayer connection due to the conductive pillars, fine holes or unevenness on the surface of ceramic base material are filled by the prepreg. In general, however hard the ceramic material that is a sintered body is polished there remain fine holes or unevenness on the surface thereof.

However, in the wiring board of the present invention, by the use of resin material of semi-cured state, the unevenness and holes on the surface of ceramics are filled automatically.

<div class="description-paragraph">A fabrication method of wiring boards of the present invention is one that fabricates such wiring boards as described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">That is, a fabrication method of wiring boards of the present invention comprises a step of forming a first wiring layer having first via-lands on a first surface of a first insulating layer that has a first hardness, a step of forming conductive pillars that have a third hardness smaller than the first hardness and are in approximate cone on the first via-lands, a step of disposing so as to face either one of a conductor layer and a board on which first surface a second wiring layer having second via-lands is disposed to the first surface of the first insulating layer through non-cured prepreg, and a step of pressing the conductor layer or the board and the first insulating layer so that the conductive pillars and the second via-lands are connected electrically and the prepreg is cured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As described above, in the wiring board of the present invention, the second insulating layer may be disposed without restricting on one surface of the first insulating layer but on both surfaces thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A semiconductor package of the present invention is as described above one that packages semiconductor element and semiconductor device such as MCM or the like on such a wiring board.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">That is, in a semiconductor package of the present invention that mounts a semiconductor element on a wiring board, the wiring board comprises a first insulating layer having a first hardness, a second insulating layer that is stacked on the first insulating layer and has a second hardness smaller than the first hardness, first via-lands that are sandwiched between the first insulating layer and the second insulating layer, second via-lands disposed so as to face the first via-lands through the second insulating layer, and conductive pillars connecting the first via-lands and the second via-lands by piercing through the second insulating layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, in semiconductor elements of which degree of integrity is particularly high and operational frequency is high, securement of thermal dissipation path is of importance. However, the conductive pillars that are an interlayer connecting means and furnished to the wiring board of the present invention can be employed as thermal via to improve property of heat dissipation. In particular, since ceramic material and metallic material have thermal conductivity larger than resin material, for instance, prepreg or the like, by thermally connecting the semiconductor element and the first insulating layer by conductive pillars, semiconductor devices of high performance can be packaged. Further, the conductive pillars that are employed as thermal vias may be disposed independently from the conductive pillars that are employed for interlayer connection of signal wiring. Still further, the first insulating layer may be constituted of a metallic plate that works concurrently as a ground plane to employ commonly between thermal via and signal wiring of ground system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">That is, the wiring board of the present invention is a multi-layered wiring board in which a plurality of wiring layers and a plurality of insulating layers are stacked, wherein interlayer connection between the wiring layers that face to each other through the insulating layer is implemented by conductive pillars, and at least one of the insulating layers is consisting of ceramic material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For instance, the wiring boards of the present invention typical in core ceramic printed wiring boards, when compared with, for instance, conventional D/C boards (thin film/ceramic board), have the following advantages.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">First, how hard the surface of ceramics is polished, due to being sintered body, there remain fine holes on the surface thereof. Each one layer of thin film formed by the use of sputtering or evaporation method is thin. Accordingly, there occurs a necessity of a step of filling unevenness of grain level on the surface of ceramics. However, in the wiring board of the present invention, due to resin such as prepreg in B stage and pressure during stacking, holes are filled automatically by stacking.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In addition, when a wiring layer of thin film is formed on a ceramic board, one conductor layer and one insulating layer are stacked alternatively one on one to form a wiring board. As a result of this, its cost becomes expensive. The wiring board of the present invention can be fabricated according to a fabricating method of the conventional printed wiring board. Accordingly, fabricating cost can be reduced remarkably.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, when the wiring layers of thin film are formed on a ceramic board, front and rear surfaces of ceramic base material are furnished with the wiring layer of thin film only one by one, or only on one surface, the wiring layer of thin film can be formed. In contrast to this, in the wiring boards of the present invention, wiring layers of thin film can be formed on front and rear surfaces simultaneously. Accordingly, the wiring boards can be made in multi-layer easily and improved in productivity. Moreover, the wiring boards of the present invention, since hardness of base material or core material is high, can be compressed uniformly over the whole surface of the wiring board. As a result of this, reliability of connection due to the conductive pillars becomes high. This is particularly remarkable when surface area of the wiring board is large.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When compared the fabricating cost from such a view point between a wiring board in which wiring layer of thin film is formed on a ceramic board and a wiring board of the present invention, as a whole, the fabricating cost of the present wiring board can be reduced to from one several tenths to one several hundredths.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, wiring boards of the present invention and ones that are obtained by piling up flexible boards consisting of ceramic base material will be compared.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When a layer to be added to base material is a flexible wiring board and this is stacked on a ceramic board that is a core, some connection means is necessary therebetween. In the present invention, a ceramic layer and a flexible board can be connected through a prepreg. Thus, it can be said a structure of high productivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, at most only two layers of flexible wiring board can be added to the core ceramics. In the wiring boards of the present invention, however, by combining a prepreg and a flexible board as necessity arises, further multiplication of layers can be carried out easily.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In addition, a resin board such as prepreg is less expensive than a flexible wiring board. Accordingly, a wiring board as a whole can be reduced in its cost.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Even when compared with other build-up type board, if a resin board is employed as core material, there remains a problem of structural strength. Further, in the present invention, by employing material of high thermal conductivity such as ceramics, metal or the like as core material, thermal conductivity in lateral direction is also improved. Thereby, heat can be dissipated uniformly from the whole wiring board.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In addition, since ceramics has high permittivity, a bypass condenser that lowers impedance of power source system or variation of power source or the like can be incorporated in a core ceramic board of a wiring board of the present invention. Accordingly, the wiring board of the present invention can cope with the demand of high function and multi-function of the wiring board.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">(Embodiment 1)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 1 is a cross section showing schematically an example of a constitution of a wiring board of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This wiring board comprises a line <b>1</b>, a shield pattern <b>2</b> disposed approximately in parallel with the line <b>1</b>, a conductor layer <b>4</b> disposed so as to face the line <b>1</b> and the shield pattern <b>2</b> through an insulating layer <b>3</b>, a conductor layer <b>6</b> disposed so as to face the line <b>1</b> and the shield pattern <b>2</b> through an insulating layer <b>5</b>, and conductive pillars <b>7</b> <i>a </i>and <b>7</b> <i>b </i>that connect the conductor layer <b>4</b> and the conductor layer <b>6</b>. In this example, the conductive pillars <b>7</b> <i>a </i>and <b>7</b> <i>b </i>are connected through the shield pattern <b>2</b>. Insulating layers <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> are also insulating layers and through them wiring layers that are omitted from showing in the figure are insulated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">By patterning copper foil, the line <b>1</b>, the conductor layers <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> and the shield pattern <b>2</b> are formed. The conductive pillars <b>7</b> <i>a </i>and <b>7</b> <i>b </i>are formed of conductive resin and disposed while piercing through the insulating layers <b>3</b> and <b>5</b> consisting of prepreg, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 2 is a diagram showing schematically an A—A cross-section structure of a wiring board of the present invention illustrated in FIG. <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Thus, in a wiring board of the present invention, the conductive pillars <b>7</b> <i>a </i>and <b>7</b> <i>b </i>that connect the conductor layer <b>4</b> and the conductor layer <b>6</b> are disposed along the line <b>1</b>. By adopting such a constitution and by applying a ground voltage to the shield pattern <b>2</b>, the conductor layers <b>4</b> and <b>6</b>, and the conductive pillars <b>7</b> <i>a </i>and <b>7</b> <i>b</i>, along an extending direction of the line <b>1</b>, over 360° in the surroundings thereof electromagnetic field can be shielded. In particular, shielding between the shield pattern <b>2</b> and the conductor layers <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> that is difficult in the conventional wiring board can be implemented by the conductive pillars <b>7</b> <i>a </i>and <b>7</b> <i>b</i>. Accordingly, unnecessary radiation caused by a signal travelling the line <b>1</b> can be shielded. Thereby, electromagnetic interference, and electromagnetic interference (EMI) to the line <b>1</b> from other lines of the wiring board and external noise sources can be prevented from occurring. Further, in the wiring board of the present invention, a line within the wiring board can be shielded. Accordingly, degree of freedom when designing wiring board can be improved. For instance, a plurality of terminals within a wiring board can be connected without employing a coaxial cable while shielding. In addition, the wiring board of the present invention, when applied to semiconductor device such as a semiconductor package, MCM (Multi-Chip Module) or the like can cope with high-speed operation to result in improvement of reliability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the above example, conductive pillar <b>7</b> <i>a </i>and conductive pillar <b>7</b> <i>b </i>are connected through a shield pattern <b>2</b>. However, they can be connected directly without through the shield pattern.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Incidentally, connection to the line <b>1</b> and connection to the shield pattern <b>2</b>, the conductor layers <b>4</b> and <b>6</b>, and the conductive pillars <b>7</b> <i>a </i>and <b>7</b> <i>b </i>may be implemented by the use of various kinds of interlayer connections such as conductive pillars, through holes or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 28 is a diagram showing schematically an example of a constitution of a wiring board of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Here, an example of a constitution of a wiring board as a whole that is furnished with the aforementioned shielding structure will be described. In this example, conductive pillars that are employed for interlayer connection are directly connected without through via-land.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This wiring board is a multi-layered wiring board provided with six layers of wiring layers <b>81</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>83</b>, <b>84</b>, and <b>86</b>. Each wiring layer is insulated by a prepreg <b>89</b> in which insulating layer resin such as BT resin or glass epoxy is impregnated in glass cloth or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Such direct connection between conductive pillars themselves that does not employ via-land may be implemented by the use of such an etching selectivity that when such as copper foil is etched to pattern etching liquid of copper does not etch conductive resin. Accordingly, copper of lower portion of conductive pillars is etched to remove. Thereafter, to bottom surfaces (or top surfaces) of the exposed conductive pillars, conductive pillars may be connected further. Without employing the via-land, space can be acquired and degree of integration can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Conductive pillars <b>87</b> and <b>87</b>S disposed piercing through prepregs <b>89</b> to implement interlayer connection between the respective wiring layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Then, a transmission line L belonging to for instance a wiring layer <b>83</b> is shielded by surrounding the circumference of an extending direction of the line over 360° by conductor layers <b>82</b>S and <b>84</b>S and conductive pillars <b>87</b>S. Thereby, unnecessary radiation from for instance the line L can be prevented from adversely affecting other lines within the wiring board, electronic parts mounted on the wiring board or the outside of the wiring board. In addition, adverse effect to the line L from these portions can be also eliminated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this case, the conductive pillars <b>87</b> are directly connected without through via-land. That is, there is no land where a plurality of conductive pillars is piled up in series.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In general, a diameter of the land is designed to have a size larger than that of an area filled by conductive paste. Accordingly, an effective area of wiring is restricted. Further, due to existence of the land, there are many interfaces between conductive paste and copper foil, as a result of this, reliability is also likely to be adversely affected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In contrast, the structure of the present invention, when compared with the conventional structure that has land, can improve wiring density by eliminating the land. Further, in the case of there being land, since the land and the conductive paste are utterly different in their physical property and characteristics, there are interfaces therebetween. However, by eliminating the land there is not any interface that is different in their physical property and characteristics. Accordingly, reliability of interlayer connection can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, as will be described later, two insulating layers on the side of, for instance, wiring layer <b>86</b> may be formed by the use of material such as ceramics or metal of larger hardness than that of prepreg <b>89</b>. Thereby, reliability of interface connection due to the conductive pillars can be heightened. In addition, heat dissipation property of the wiring board can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(Embodiment 2)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 3 is a cross section showing schematically another example of a constitution of a wiring board of the present invention, and FIGS. 4, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> are diagrams showing schematically cross section structures in other directions of the wiring board of FIG. <b>3</b>. FIG. 4 shows a BB cross section of FIG. 3, FIG. 5 shows a CC cross-section and FIG. 6 shows a DD cross-section, respectively. By the way, FIG. 3 is an EE cross section of FIG. <b>6</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this wiring board, a line <b>11</b>L and a line <b>13</b>L formed on different wiring layers are connected by conductive pillars <b>7</b>L and surroundings thereof is shielded by conductor layers <b>10</b>S and <b>14</b>S, shield patterns <b>11</b>S, <b>12</b>S and <b>13</b>S and conductive pillars <b>7</b>S.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The respective wiring layers are insulated by insulating layers <b>21</b> consisting of prepreg or the like, and the conductive pillars <b>7</b>L and <b>7</b>S pierce through the insulating layers to implement interlayer connection of the respective conductor layers. Namely, interlayer connection between the line <b>11</b>L and the line <b>13</b>L is implemented by the use of the conductive pillars <b>7</b>L that are disposed piercing through the insulating layer <b>21</b> and a via-land <b>12</b>V (cf. FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>). Further, interlayer connection between a conductor layer <b>10</b>S and a conductor layer <b>14</b>S is implemented by the conductive pillars <b>7</b>S and shield patterns <b>11</b>S, <b>12</b>S and <b>13</b>S (FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>5</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the present invention, by adopting such constitution, lines disposed over a plurality of wiring layers within a multi-layered wiring board can be also effectively shielded.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, as to the extending direction of the line consisting of the conductive pillars <b>7</b>L and a via-land <b>12</b>V that carry out interlayer connection between the line <b>11</b>L and the line <b>13</b>L, center axes of the conductive pillars <b>7</b>S for use of shield are in approximate parallel to each other. By encircling the circumference of the lines that are implemented for interlayer connection of such wiring board by the conductive pillars <b>7</b>S, not only the lines in parallel with a surface of the wiring board but also interlayer connection portions can be shielded. Together with implementation of interlayer connection to connecting terminals of electronic parts such as a semiconductor element or the like on the surface of the wiring board by the use of conductive pillars <b>7</b>L, by implementing shielding of this interlayer connection portion as described above, the lines of the wiring board can be shielded up to the vicinity of the terminals of the packaged electronic parts. Accordingly, electromagnetic interference of semiconductor package, MDM or the like can be effectively prevented from occurring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(Embodiment 3)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Here, a fabrication method of a wiring board of the present invention will be described. In the wiring board of the present invention, conductive pillars that are employed for shielding lines, interlayer connection between lines or the like can be formed simultaneously.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 7A and 7B are diagrams for explaining an example of a fabrication method of a wiring board of the present invention. First, on conductor layers <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> consisting of copper foil or the like, conductive pillars <b>7</b>S having an approximately conical shape are formed, respectively, by the use of screen-printing method. The conductive pillars may be formed for instance of conductive resin, conductive paste or the like. At this time, the conductive pillars <b>7</b>S for interlayer connection of signal lines, the conductive pillars employed as thermal via or the like can be formed simultaneously.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Then, through a prepreg <b>21</b> <i>i </i>of semi-cured state (B stage), the conductor layers <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> thereon conductive pillars <b>7</b>S are formed are disposed to face with each other. At this time, the conductive pillars <b>7</b>S formed on the conductor layers <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> are disposed themselves so as to engage to each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Then, the stacked body is heated while compressing. By compressing the conductive pillars <b>7</b>S pierce through the softened prepreg <b>21</b> <i>i </i>to connect with the facing conductor layer while deforming plastically. In addition, the prepreg <b>21</b> <i>i </i>is cured to be in C stage. Accordingly, the conductive pillars formed by such a method have a layer of plastic deformation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Thus, by forming the conductive pillars in approximate cone and by piercing the conductive pillars through the prepreg of semi-cured state, interlayer connection can be carried out. In this method, interlayer connection between a plurality of conductor layers that are stacked through insulating layers can be implemented without employing a step of boring or a step of plating. Accordingly, productivity of fabrication of wiring boards can be improved. The conductive pillars may be aligned by the use of transmission of X-rays.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 8A, <b>8</b>B and <b>8</b>C are diagrams for explaining another example of a fabrication method of the wiring boards of the present invention. Like this, sharpness of heads of conductive pillars <b>7</b>S can be made small in the range allowing to pierce through the prepreg of semi-cured state. By thus implementing, contacting property when the conductive pillars engage themselves can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the above, when the conductor layer and the insulating layer are stacked the interlayer connection is established by the use of conductive pillars. However, the present invention is not restricted to this method. For instance, though number of step increases, through holes may be formed in an insulating layer, and conductive resin may be filled in these through holes or a layer of plating is formed therein to form conductive pillars.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(Embodiment 4)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 9 and 10 are diagrams showing schematically another example of a constitution of a wiring board of the present invention. These figures illustrate lines and shielding structures thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the wiring board, together with sandwiching line <b>31</b> by conductor layers <b>35</b>A and <b>36</b> through insulating layers <b>33</b> and <b>34</b>, respectively, along the line <b>31</b> groove like photo-vias <b>37</b> and <b>38</b> are disposed in the insulating layers <b>33</b> and <b>34</b>, and the conductor layer <b>35</b>B is formed on the surfaces of the photo-vias <b>37</b> and <b>38</b> to implement interlayer connection between the conductor layer <b>35</b>A and the conductor layer <b>36</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this example, the conductor layers <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> are formed by the use of electroless plating. Since the photo-vias <b>37</b> and <b>38</b> can not be formed to pile up, here two photo-vias are disposed displaced to each other. Incidentally, the width of the line <b>31</b> and the diameter of the photo-via may be different. Here, the widths of line and groove like photo-via are set in the range of approximately 0.1 mm to 0.5 mm, however such parameters can be set as demand arises.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 11 is a diagram showing schematically another example of a constitution of a wiring board of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This figure corresponds to a cross section in aa direction in FIG. <b>10</b>. Instead of grooves <b>37</b> and <b>38</b>, circular photo-vias <b>39</b> are arranged along the line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When the conventional circular photo-vias are adopted, the width of the shield pattern <b>2</b> is required to be set at approximately two times the diameter of photo-via. For instance, when the diameter of photo-via is set at 0.2 mm, the width of the shield pattern is required to be set at approximately 0.4 mm or more.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 12 is a diagram showing schematically another example of a constitution of a wiring board of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This example is a modification example of a wiring board of the present invention illustrated in FIGS. 9 and 10. Two steps of photo-vias <b>37</b> and <b>38</b> are displaced in different way. Also in this case, the width of shield pattern <b>2</b> is required as identical as the example of FIGS. 10 and 11.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Thus, in the wiring board of the present invention, by the conductor that connects the conductor layer <b>35</b>A and the conductor layer <b>36</b> the line <b>31</b> can be shielded.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 13 is a diagram showing schematically still another example of a constitution of a wiring board of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this example, photo-vias <b>40</b> are formed pierced through the insulating layers <b>33</b> and <b>34</b>, and on an inner surface of the photo-vias <b>40</b> a conductor layer <b>41</b> is disposed by the use of electroless plating.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">By adopting such a constitution, the width of the shield pattern <b>2</b> can be made small. Accordingly, shielding structure of the line <b>31</b> can be made compact.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(Embodiment 5)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As described above, according to the wiring board of the present invention, the lines of inner layers of the wiring board can be shielded almost completely. Accordingly, if part thereof is not shielded deliberately, this portion of the line where the line is not shielded can be employed as an antenna.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 14 and 15 are diagrams showing diagrammatically an example of a structure of a wiring board of the present invention provided with such an antenna.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Omitted from showing in the figure for simplicity, interlayer connection between the conductor layers <b>4</b> and <b>6</b> is implemented by for instance the conductive pillar <b>7</b>S, shield patterns <b>2</b>, or photo-vias all of which are not shown in the figure. Accordingly, in this area, the line <b>1</b> is shielded three dimensionally.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">By contrast, other portion of the line <b>1</b> is not shielded, and by adjusting the length L of this portion according to wavelength of electromagnetic wave (for instance λ/4, λ/2, 5λ/8, 3/4λ and so on) it can be employed as an antenna. In this case, analogue signal travels along the line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">By adopting such a constitution, within the wiring board an antenna can be incorporated. Pulling around of pattern of an oscillator can be implemented easily. In particular, by applying the wiring board of the present invention to various kinds of vehicular communication terminals such as cellular phones, PHSs or the like, the communication terminals can be made small and light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(Embodiment 6)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 16 is a diagram showing schematically an example of a constitution of a wiring board of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This wiring board is a multi-layered wiring board in which a plurality of wiring layers is stacked through insulating layers. As the insulating layer, the first insulating layers <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> and <b>53</b> constituted of ceramic material and the second insulating layers <b>61</b>, <b>62</b> and <b>63</b> constituted of resin material such as prepreg or the like are employed in combination. That is, this wiring board is a composite of ceramic base material <b>50</b> and resin base material <b>60</b>. In this example, three layers of the first insulating layer consisting of alumina and the second insulating layer consisting of prepreg in which glass cloth is impregnated by glass epoxy based resin are stacked, respectively. In the wiring layer consisting of resin base material, copper foil or the like is patterned to form such as transmission line, via-land, shield pattern or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Ceramic base material <b>50</b> is co-fired to form and a plurality of wiring layers including wiring layers <b>54</b> and <b>55</b> is connected by the use of interlayer connection vias <b>56</b> consisting of for instance Mo, W or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In contrast, wiring layers <b>64</b>, <b>65</b> and <b>66</b> of resin base material <b>60</b>, and wiring layer <b>54</b> and wiring layer <b>66</b> are connected therebetween by conductive pillars <b>67</b> consisting of conductive resin. FIG. 17 is a diagram showing schematically an example of a structure of the conductive pillar <b>67</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This conductive pillar <b>67</b> carries out interlayer connection between a plurality of wiring layers by piercing through the second insulating layers <b>61</b>, <b>62</b> and <b>63</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 18 is a diagram for explaining an example of a fabrication method of a wiring board of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For instance, first on wiring layers <b>54</b> consisting of ceramic base material <b>50</b> conductive pillars <b>67</b> of approximate cone are formed by the use of screen-printing method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Then, so that the formed conductive pillars <b>67</b> and wiring layers <b>66</b> face to each other, resin base material and ceramic base material are disposed through the second insulating layer <b>63</b> of semi-cured state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Then, while heating the second insulating layer <b>63</b> to soften, the ceramic base material and the resin base material are pressed together. At this time, the conductive pillars <b>67</b> pierce through the softened second insulating layer <b>63</b> to connect with the wiring layer <b>66</b> while showing plastic deformation. The second insulating layer <b>63</b> that was in semi-cured state is heated to cure to be C-stage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">So far, when interlayer connection due to such conductive pillars <b>67</b> is implemented, for instance resin layers <b>62</b> and <b>61</b> of C-stage are softened fully due to heating and compression to result in deformation of the wiring layers <b>65</b> and <b>66</b>. In addition, there are problems that due to such deformation, reliability of interlayer connection is deteriorated, and productivity of the wiring boards is lowered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In wiring board of the present invention, hardness of ceramic base material is designed to be larger than that of the resin layer. Accordingly, even when the second insulating layer is stacked on the base material to attain a multi-layered wiring board, such a wiring layer can be prevented from deforming. That is, since the ceramic material is enough hard compared with organic resin material, even during stacking step, deformation due to conductive pillars does not occur. Accordingly, such a high reliability of connection that interlayer connection resistance is always several mΩ or less can be realized. Further, since there is allowance in stacking conditions, productivity can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For instance, since hardness of ceramic base material <b>50</b> is larger than that of resin, upon compressing uniform pressure can be applied on a surface of the base material. Accordingly, reliability of interlayer connection can be improved. In addition, productivity of wiring boards can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, so far, when multi-layered wiring boards are tried to fabricate with only insulating layers mainly consisting of resin material such as prepreg, insulating layer of base material destined to be a core (or base) is required to be thick, or softening temperature is required to raise. Further, in order to improve connection reliability, to the thickness of the insulating layer to be formed on the base material destined to be a core the diameter of the conductive pillar is necessary to be made larger.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In contrast, in the wiring board of the present invention, by adopting ceramic material of larger hardness at least in part of the insulating layer, reliability of interlayer connection due to conductive pillars can be improved. Thereby, the thickness of the second insulating layer consisting of resin can be made thinner, and the diameter of the conductive pillar can be made smaller. Accordingly, thin wiring board capable of coping with packaging of high density can be provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, the ceramic board has a property that it is large in hardness but is brittle. In the wiring board of the present invention, the resin base material plays a role of cushion to the ceramic base material to result in protection of the ceramic base material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Incidentally, present inventor has found that hardness of the insulating layer destined to be a core base material is only necessary to be approximately 3 or more by Mohs scale, or approximately 200 or more by Vickers hardness scale. In general, hardness of ceramics is approximately 650 or more by Vickers hardness scale, and that of alumina or the like is approximately 1600. In addition, hardness of each of copper, iron and glass is approximately 3, approximately 5 to 7, and approximately 4.5, respectively. All of them can be employed as the first insulating layer of the wiring board of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(Embodiment 7)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 19 is a diagram showing schematically another example of a constitution of a wiring board of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In an example of FIG. 16, whereas a constitution in which only on one surface of ceramic base material <b>50</b> resin base material <b>60</b> is disposed is shown, in this example on both surfaces of ceramic base material <b>50</b> resin base material <b>60</b> is disposed. Even in such a case, since the wiring board of the present invention employs a layer of base material of high hardness and high stiffness for a base or a core, uniform compression can be exerted on the whole base material, resulting in wiring board of high reliability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Since ceramics is a sintered body, how carefully it is polished, there are fine holes and unevenness remained on its surface. When a thin film is stacked on this ceramics, such holes and unevenness are necessary to be filled in. In the wiring board of the present invention, resin material of semi-cured state automatically fills in the unevenness and holes on the surface of the ceramics to result in improvement of productivity. Further, due to anchoring effect of the resin layer to the unevenness of the surface of ceramics, a plurality of insulating layers can join themselves strongly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this embodiment, as the base material destined to be a base or a core thereon resin base material is stacked ceramic material is employed for insulating layer. The wiring board of the present invention is not restricted to this, but any material having hardness larger than that of resin material can be employed. As such material, for instance, glass and metallic plate, metallic plate having insulating layer on the surface thereof or the like can be cited.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the wiring board of the present invention, the base material is composed of material of high stiffness such as ceramics. Accordingly, stacking on both surfaces thereof does not deform the lines within the base material of inner layer. Accordingly, a wiring board consisting of a number of layers can be easily formed. By contrast, the wiring board due to the present invention is not restricted to the aforementioned embodiments and can be modified variously in the range that does not depart from the scope of the present invention. First, in the embodiment a co-fired ceramic board is employed, however ceramic base material, laminated ceramic board, glass-ceramic base material, glass base material, metal, metal base board or the like can be employed. This is because by employing base material of higher hardness than that of organic resin to be stacked, the wiring board of the present invention can be constituted of.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As described above, in the wiring boards involving the present invention, hardness of the base material is fundamentally higher than that of the material to be stacked on. Accordingly, in stacking, the base material or the material to be stacked on does not deform unnecessarily. Therefore, connection reliability therebetween due to connecting vias is high. Accordingly, there is allowance in stacking conditions and the wiring boards involving the present invention can cope with mass-production.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, when ceramics is employed for the base material, the following effect can be newly expected. Since the ceramic board is easy in multiple stacking of wiring, within the base material wiring layers can be formed. Though the pitch is more rough (approximately 0.2 mm) than that of line of wiring layer (approximately 0.1 mm) formed on organic material to be stacked, a wiring layer of multi-layers can be easily formed. Accordingly, only the portion where fine patterning of wiring is necessary needs only be formed in organic material portion to be stacked on. In contrast, in recent years as a semiconductor device operates with a higher and higher speed, power consumption increases to arouse a necessity to strengthen the wiring of power system. By constituting a plastered pattern layer of power source system in the base material of ceramics, extremely stable power supply to a semiconductor device can be carried out. In addition, ceramic base material, being hard, is not weak to bending as the conventional printed wiring board. That is, since the ceramics itself can be a supporter, even if the surface of a board is large, reliability thereof is extremely high. Accordingly, it is effective as a packaging board of larger area. In contrast, compared with a wiring board consisting of ceramic base material alone, because of stacking of organic material the weak point of ceramics, that is, brittleness can be overcome through a role of cushion of organic material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, when a metallic plate is employed for the base material, the following new effect can be expected. As recent year higher speed operation of semiconductor advances, heat generation from semiconductor devices is a very important problem. The existing printed wiring board, being constituted basically of organic material, is poor in thermal conductivity. A heat sink is directly attached to a package of a semiconductor device accordingly, thus the height of the heat sink disturbs a system instrument from being small. In addition, due to packaging of the heat sink an area for packaging is frequently likely to be restricted. In the present invention, by the use of base material having a metallic plate therewith, the heat can be released from the wiring board to the outside thereof. Interlayer connection of organic material portions to be stacked is implemented by the use of vias that are filled by paste of conductive material. These vias can be employed as not only electrical interlayer connection but also as thermal vias. Thereby, thermal path from a semiconductor device to a metallic plate that is a base material can be secured to constitute a wiring board of excellent thermal conductivity. In addition, the metallic plate can be extended out of the conventional area of a wiring board to employ as a heat spreader. As to heat dissipation, heat flow from the heat source and thermal diffusion to the exterior are important. A structure concurrently having the heat flow capacity and the heat diffusion capacity can be easily constituted. That is, as a fabricating process of a wiring board, with a metallic plate on part of which a heat sink is formed as a base material, a wiring layer consisting of organic material involving the present invention is stacked thereon to form a wiring board easily. Further, such a metallic plate can be processed variously in the portion other than the portion of the wiring layer to add further function such as casing and supporter other than the wiring board alone.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 20 is a diagram showing schematically an example of a constitution of a semiconductor package of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The semiconductor package is constituted by packaging a semiconductor element <b>71</b> in facedown bonding on the aforementioned wiring board <b>70</b> of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The wiring board <b>70</b> is one that stacks base material <b>72</b> and resin base material <b>60</b>. The semiconductor element has terminals <b>73</b> for signal, power source or the like and dummy terminals <b>74</b> for heat dissipation, and both of them are connected with solder bumps <b>75</b> to wiring layers <b>64</b> on a surface of the wiring board <b>70</b>. Further, gap between the semiconductor element <b>71</b> and the wiring board <b>70</b> is sealed and protected by sealing resin <b>76</b> such as epoxy based resin or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, interlayer connection between wiring layers of the resin base material <b>60</b> is implemented by the conductive pillars <b>67</b> as identical as in the above, however portions connected to the dummy terminals <b>74</b> for heat dissipation are employed as thermal vias <b>67</b>T. The thermal vias <b>67</b>T are thermally connected to a metallic plate <b>72</b> such as copper or the like that is a base layer to dissipate effectively the heat generated by the semiconductor element <b>71</b>. In addition, on the other surface of the metallic plate <b>72</b>, a heat sink <b>77</b> is disposed to improve heat dissipation efficiency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the semiconductor package of the present invention, for part of a wiring board thereon a semiconductor device is packaged, base material such as metal, ceramics or the like of hardness larger than that of resin base material is adopted. Thereby, in addition to improvement of reliability of interlayer connection, productivity of wiring boards can be improved. Still further, ceramic material such as aluminum nitride or the like and metallic material such as copper or the like have larger thermal conductivity capable of dissipating effectively the heat generated due to operation of the semiconductor element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 21 is a diagram showing schematically another example of a constitution of a semiconductor package of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this example, in the place of a semiconductor element <b>71</b> of bare chip state, a semiconductor package <b>71</b> <i>b </i>sealed by mold resin or ceramic package is packaged. Thus, the thermal vias <b>67</b>T can be employed as effectively even for thermal dissipation of heat generated by a sealed semiconductor package.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 22 is a diagram showing schematically an example of still another constitution of a semiconductor package of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this semiconductor package, on a semiconductor element, terminals for electrical connection are arranged in lattice of two dimensions. In addition, in this example, as the base material <b>72</b> a board at least a surface of which shows insulating property such as ceramics, glass, or metallic plate provided with a thin insulating layer (approximately 100 μm or less) on a surface thereof is employed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Thus, by pushing the conductive pillars <b>67</b> to the base material <b>72</b> of larger hardness, insulation between signal terminals <b>73</b> themselves can be secured. Further, through the conductive pillars <b>67</b>, heat from a semiconductor element can be dissipated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 23 is a diagram showing schematically another example of a constitution of a semiconductor package of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This semiconductor package is a multi-chip module. A semiconductor element <b>71</b> packaged on a wiring board <b>70</b> is sealed air-tightly by a metal cap <b>78</b>. In the semiconductor package of the present invention, as the base material <b>72</b> material of larger hardness is selected to employ. Thereby, the metal cap <b>78</b> can be formed on the base material <b>72</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 24 is a diagram showing schematically another example of a constitution of a semiconductor package of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this semiconductor package, on both of surfaces of the base material <b>72</b> such as ceramic base material, metallic plate or the like, resin base material is disposed and electronic parts are packaged. In this example, on the opposite side of the semiconductor element <b>71</b> a chip condenser <b>78</b> is packaged as an electronic component. The chip condenser is packaged on the wiring board by solder, conductive resin or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A wiring board of the present invention has a base material <b>72</b> of larger thermal conductivity, accordingly a heat sink <b>77</b> can be disposed displaced from a position facing to a semiconductor element <b>71</b>. Accordingly, degree of freedom of design of a semiconductor package can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 25 is a diagram showing schematically still another example of a constitution of a semiconductor package of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this example, a wiring board is employed in which on both surfaces of the ceramic base material <b>50</b> resin base materials <b>60</b> are stacked. By adopting such a constitution, both sides of the wiring board can be connected. Further, on the ceramic base material <b>50</b>, common power source plane, ground plane or the like may be disposed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further in this example, on the opposite side of the semiconductor element <b>71</b>, another semiconductor element <b>79</b> is packaged. This semiconductor element <b>79</b> is connected to a wiring board by a bonding wire <b>80</b>. Thus, in a semiconductor package of the present invention, method of packaging a semiconductor element and various kinds of electronic parts may be selected according to demand.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Thus, in addition to adoption of a base material of larger hardness than resin layer such as prepreg as a base material or a core material, by applying a wiring board of the present invention in which conductive pillars are employed for interlayer connection between wiring layers of the resin base material to a semiconductor package, reliability of a semiconductor package can be improved. Further, degree of freedom of design of semiconductor package can be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, the wiring board of the present invention in which a base material of larger hardness than a resin layer is adopted as a base material or a core material may be combined with the aforementioned shielding structure of the line.</div>
<heading>INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">As described above, according to a wiring board of the present invention, the circumference of a line of a wiring layer of an inner layer of a wiring board can be effectively shielded over 360°. Thereby, an adverse effect due to unnecessary radiation from for instance the line can be prevented from adversely affecting other lines within the wiring board, electronic parts packaged on the wiring board, or the outside of the wiring board. Further, the line L is also prevented from being adversely affected by these portions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, according to the wiring board of the present invention, as base material or core material, material of larger hardness than resin material, such as prepreg or the like, is adopted. Thereby, reliability of interlayer connection due to the conductive pillars can be improved. In addition, a thickness of the resin layer can be made thinner, and a diameter of the conductive pillars can be made smaller. Accordingly, a wiring board can be made thinner, and at the same time packaging density can be heightened.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A wiring board of the present invention adopts, in a multi-layered wiring board in which a plurality of wiring layers and a plurality of insulating layers are stacked, a constitution in which interlayer connection of the wiring layers that are faced through the insulating layer is implemented by conductive pillars, and at least one of the insulating layers is consisting of ceramic material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For instance, when the wiring board of the present invention represented by a core ceramics printed wiring is compared with for instance a conventional D/C board (thin film/ceramic board), there are the following advantages.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">First, how carefully the surface of ceramics is polished, there remain fine holes on the surface thereof due to sintered body. In a thin film formed by the use of sputtering method or the vapor deposition method, a thickness of each one layer is thin. Accordingly, there occurs a necessity of a step to fill unevenness of grain level on the surface of ceramics. However, in the wiring board of the present invention, due to B stage of resin such as prepreg or the like and due to stacking under pressure, the holes are filled in automatically when being stacked.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, when wiring layers of thin film are formed on a ceramic board, alternate stacking of one conductor layer and one insulating layer is necessary to repeat to form a multi-layered one to result in high cost. The wiring board of the present invention can be manufactured according to a conventional fabrication method of printed circuit board. Thereby, the cost can be remarkably reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, when a wiring layer of thin film is formed on a ceramic board, only by one surface of front and rear surfaces of the ceramic base material, or only on one surface thereof, the wiring layer of thin film can be formed. In contrast, in the wiring board of the present invention, wiring layer of thin film can be formed at the same time on both of the front and rear surfaces. Accordingly, it can be easily multi-layered and productivity thereof can be improved. Furthermore, the wiring board of the present invention, base material or core material being high in their hardness, can be compressed uniformly all over the wiring board to result in high reliability of connection due to the conductive pillars. This is particularly remarkable when an area of a wiring board is large.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When compared a wiring board where a wiring layer of thin film is formed on a ceramic board and a wiring board of the present invention of their fabricating cost from such a point of view, the wiring board of the present invention can reduce the fabricating cost to from one several tenth to one several hundredth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, a wiring board of the present invention and a wiring board in which flexible boards of ceramic base material are stacked will be compared.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Even if a layer to be added to base material is made a flexible wiring board and is stacked on a ceramic board of core, some connecting means is necessary. In the present invention, a ceramic layer and a flexible board can be connected through prepreg to result in high productivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, the flexible wiring board can be stacked at most only two layers or so as additional layer. In contrast, in the wiring board of the present invention, by combining prepreg and flexible board according to demand, further multi-layered one can be easily obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, resin board such as prepreg or the like is less expensive than the flexible wiring board to result in reduction of the cost of a wiring board as a whole.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Even when compared with other build up board, if resin board is employed as core material, there is a problem of structural strength. In addition, in the present invention, by employing material of higher thermal conductivity such as ceramics, metal or the like as core material, thermal conductivity in a transverse direction also can be improved to result in uniform dissipation of heat from the wiring board as a whole.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, since ceramics has high permittivity, a bypass condenser that lowers impedance of power source system and makes small variation of power source can be incorporated within a core ceramic board of the wiring board of the present invention. Accordingly, the wiring board of the present invention can cope with demand for high functionality and multi-functionality.</div>
