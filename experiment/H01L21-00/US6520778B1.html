<div class="abstract">Microelectronic contact structures are fabricated by separately forming, then joining together, various components thereof. Each contact structure has three components: a “post” component, a “beam” component, and a “tip” component. The resulting contact structure, mounted to an electronic component, is useful for making an electrical connection with another electronic component. The post component can be, fabricated on a sacrificial substrate, joined to the electronic component and its sacrificial substrate removed. Alternatively, the post component can be formed on the electronic component. The beam and tip components can each be fabricated on a sacrificial substrate. The beam component is joined to the post component and its sacrificial substrate is removed, and the tip component is joined to the beam component and its sacrificial substrate is removed. In an embodiment of the invention, the beam components of adjacent contact structures are disposed at different heights above the electronic component, whereby at least a portion of the first beam component can overlap at least a portion of the second beam component, thereby conserving space required to accommodate the beam components on the surface of the electronic component.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">This patent application is a continuation-in-part of commonly-owned, co-pending U.S. patent application No. 08/819,464 filed Mar. 17, 1997, which is incorporated by reference herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This patent application is a continuation-in-part of commonly-owned, co-pending U.S. patent application No. 08/802,054 filed Feb. 18, 1997, which is incorporated by reference herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This patent application is a continuation-in-part of commonly-owned U.S. patent application No. 08/852,152 filed May 6, 1997, now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6,184,053, which is incorporated by reference herein.</div>
<heading>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates to resilient (spring) electrical contact (interconnection) elements (structures) suitable for but not limited to effecting pressure connections between electronic components and, more particularly, to microminiature spring contacts such as may be used in probing (resiliently and temporarily contacting) microelectronic components such as active semiconductor devices.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Commonly-owned U.S. Pat. No. 6,184,053, and its counterpart commonly-owned “divisional” U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,049,976 and 5,852,871, all by KHANDROS, disclose methods for making resilient interconnection elements for microelectronics applications involving mounting an end of a flexible elongate core element (e.g., wire “stem” or “skeleton”) to a terminal on an electronic component, and coating the flexible core element and adjacent surface of the terminal with a “shell” of one or more materials having a predetermined combination of thickness, yield strength and elastic modulus to ensure predetermined force-to-deflection characteristics of the resulting spring contacts. Exemplary materials for the core element include gold. Exemplary materials for the coating include nickel and its alloys. The resulting spring contact element is suitably used to effect pressure, or demountable, connections between two or more electronic components, including semiconductor devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Commonly owned U.S. Pat. No. 5,917,707 discloses a number of applications for the aforementioned spring contact element, and techniques for fabricating contact pads at the ends of the spring contact elements. For example, in FIG. 14 thereof, a plurality of negative projections or holes, which may be in the form of inverted pyramids ending in apexes, are formed in the surface of a sacrificial layer (substrate). These holes are then filled with a contact structure comprising layers of material such as gold or rhodium and nickel. A flexible elongate element is mounted to the resulting contact structure .and can be overcoated in the manner described hereinabove. In a final step, the sacrificial substrate is removed. The resulting spring contact has a contact pad having controlled geometry (e.g., sharp points) at its free end.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Commonly-owned U.S. Pat. No. 5,917,707 discloses additional techniques and metallurgies for fabricating contact tip structures on sacrificial substrates, as well as techniques for transferring a plurality of spring contact elements mounted thereto, en masse, to terminals of an electronic component (see, e.g., FIGS. 11A-11F and <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>C therein).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Commonly-owned U.S. Pat. No. 5,994,152 discloses techniques whereby a plurality of contact tip structures (see, e.g., #<b>620</b> in FIG. 6B therein) are joined to a corresponding plurality of elongate contact elements (see, e.g., #<b>632</b> of FIG. 6D therein) which are already mounted to an electronic component (#<b>630</b>). This patent application also discloses, for example in FIGS. 7A-7E therein, techniques for fabricating “elongate” contact tip structures in the form of cantilevers. The cantilever tip structures can be tapered, between one end thereof and an opposite end thereof. The cantilever tip structures of this patent application are suitable for mounting to already-existing (i.e., previously fabricated) raised interconnection elements (see, e.g., #<b>730</b> in FIG. 7F) extending (e.g., free-standing) from corresponding terminals of an electronic component (see. e.g., #<b>734</b> in FIG. <b>7</b>F).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Commonly-owned U.S. patent application No. 08/819,464 filed Mar. 17, 1997 (status: pending), referenced as a parent application above and incorporated by reference herein, disclose a number of processes and metallurgies for prefabricating contact tip structures on sacrificial substrates, for later joining to ends of spring contact elements, as well as mechanisms for releasing prefabricated components of spring, contact elements from the sacrificial substrates. Many of the processes, metallurgies and mechanisms disclosed therein are directly applicable to the methods and apparatus of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Commonly-owned, co-pending U.S. patent application No. 08/802,054 filed Feb. 18, 1997, referenced as a parent application above, discloses a technique for making microelectronic contact structures by masking and etching grooves into a sacrificial substrate (e.g., a silicon wafer), then depositing one or more layers of metallic material into the grooves, then transferring the resulting structures onto an electronic component such as by brazing, then removing the sacrificial substrate so that the fabricated structures are secured at one end to the electronic component and have another end for contacting another electronic component and function as spring contact elements. The present invention takes the concept a step further, providing an alternate technique for fabricating such spring contact elements and mounting them to terminals of electronic components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Commonly-owned, U.S. Pat. No. 6,184,053, issued from the parent application Ser. No. 08/852,152 referenced above, discloses a technique for making microelectronic contact structures by applying a series of masking layers patterned with openings onto a substrate such as a semiconductor device, then depositing one or more layers of metallic material into the openings, then removing the masking layers. This results in a plurality of spring contact elements having been fabricated on the substrate at lithographically-defined locations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention addresses and is particularly well-suited to making interconnections to modern microelectronic devices having their terminals (bond pads) disposed at a fine-pitch. The invention is useful for devices with arbitrarily large pitch, but also is particularly useful for fine pitch. As used herein, the term “fine-pitch” refers to microelectronic devices that have their terminals disposed at a spacing of less than 5 mils, such as 2.5 mils or 65 μm. As will be evident from the description that follows, this is preferably achieved by taking advantage of the close tolerances that readily can be realized by using lithographic rather than mechanical techniques to fabricate the contact elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">An exemplary application for making fine-pitch pressure connections between. electronic components can be found in commonly-owned U.S. Pat. No. 5,974,662, which discloses a probe card assembly including elongate resilient (spring) contact elements mounted to a “space transformer” component. As used herein, a space transformer is a multilayer interconnection substrate having terminals disposed at a first pitch on a one surface thereof and having corresponding terminals disposed at a second pitch on an opposite surface thereof, and is used to effect “pitch-spreading” from the first pitch to the second pitch. In use, the free ends (tips) of the elongate spring contact elements make pressure connections with corresponding terminals on an electronic component being probed (e.g., tested).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Another example of an application for fine pitch spring contact elements can be found in commonly-owned U.S. Pat. No. 6,064,213, which discloses mounting springs on active semiconductor devices.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">An object of the present invention is to provide an improved technique for fabricating microelectronic contact structures, such as spring contact elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Another object of the invention is to provide a technique for fabricating microelectronic contact structures, such as spring contact elements, using processes that are inherently well-suited to the fine-pitch, close-tolerance world of microelectronics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Another object of the invention is to provide a technique for fabricating microelectronic contact structures, such as spring contact elements, that are suitable for probing electronic components such as semiconductor devices, and that is readily scaleable to probing fine-pitch peripheral interconnect structures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Another object of the invention is to provide a technique for fabricating microelectronic contact structures, such as spring contact elements, that are suitable for socketing electronic components such as semiconductor devices, such as for performing burn-in on said devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to the invention, microelectronic contact structures are fabricated by forming various portions (“components”) thereof on a corresponding number of sacrificial substrates, then joining the portions to an electronic component and to one another.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Each contact structure has three portions (components): a base end portion or “post” component, a middle portion or “beam” component, and a contact end portion or “tip” component. The contact structure is useful for making an electrical connection with a terminal of another electronic component, whether by pure pressure connection or by soldering thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For example, for a plurality of contact structures:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(a) The post components of a plurality of contact structures are formed on a one sacrificial substrate, at prescribed spacing from one another which may, for example, correspond to the terminal layout of an electronic component. The post components can then be joined to the terminals (e.g.) of the electronic component. Alternatively, a post component can be fabricated directly on the electronic component.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(b) The beam components of the plurality of contact structures preferably are elongate, each having two opposite ends and two opposite surfaces. One or more beam components are formed on a sacrificial substrate, at prescribed spacing from one another corresponding to the layout of the post components on the electronic component. A beam component can then be joined, such as by one of its ends and by one of its surfaces, to a corresponding post component. A group of beam components can be joined as a group to a corresponding group of post-components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(c) The tip components of the plurality of contact structures are formed on another sacrificial substrate, at prescribed spacing from one another, preferably corresponding to the terminal layout of another electronic component which is to be contacted by the contact structures. A tip component can then be joined to a corresponding beam component at a position along the beam component which is offset from the post component to which the beam component is joined. The tip component may be joined to an opposite (from the post component) end of the beam component, and may be joined to an opposite (from the post component) surface of the beam component. A group of tip components can be joined as a group to a corresponding group of beam components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In an embodiment of the invention, the post, beam and tip components of each contact structure are fabricated by applying a patterned masking layer onto a sacrificial substrate, the masking layer having openings extending through to the sacrificial substrate, then depositing one or more layers of metallic material into the openings. The openings in the masking layer are at positions whereat it is desired to fabricate the respective component of the contact structures, and define the geometry (shape) of the respective component of the contact structures. A plurality of contact structures may be fabricated in this manner on the sacrificial substrates, with lithographically-defined tolerances (e.g., dimensions, spacing, alignment).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to an aspect of the invention, a sacrificial substrate may be provided with a release mechanism which may be a dissolvable layer such as aluminum or multiple metallic layers, either of which will permit the components of the contact structures to be released from the respective sacrificial substrate upon which they are fabricated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">An exemplary sacrificial substrate upon which the components of the contact structures may be fabricated is a silicon wafer, in which case the process of the present invention advantageously utilizes the directionally selective etching of silicon (as, for example, used for micro-machining processes) to create an electroform which is used to plate up the components of the contact structures. This approach may optionally employ laser-based ablation of photoresist, as opposed to lithographic development of the photoresist, in order to create the high aspect ratio of width to height which is preferred for fine pitch spacing between the contact structures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The post, beam and tip components of the contact structures are suitably formed of at least one layer of a metallic material. In the case of the post components, the metallic material(s) should preferably have good rigidity (high yield strength) and be suitable for being joined, such as by brazing or soldering, with respective ones of the beam components. In the case of the beam components, the metallic material(s) should be appropriate to permit the resulting contact structure to function, in use, as a spring contact element (i.e., exhibit elastic deformation) when force is applied to its (free) end, and should be suitable for being joined with respective ones of the post and tip components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the case of the tip components, the metallic material(s) should have good electrical contact characteristics, and should be suitable for being joined with respective ones of the beam components. All of the post, beam and tip components should include at least one layer which is a good conductor of electricity. It is desirable that the overall contact structure (which may be a spring contact element) be a good electrical conductor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the main hereinafter, microelectronic contact structures which are spring contact elements are discussed. However, the present invention is not limited to contact structures which are spring contact elements. Contact structures having more, or less, rigidity than would be required to function usefully as spring contact elements are within the scope of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">An exemplary contact structure formed in this manner has a length “L” between its base (post) end and its contact (tip) end. The base end is preferably offset in a first direction from a central (beam) portion of the contact structure, and the contact end is preferably offset in an opposite direction from the central portion. In this manner, the overall contact structure base end is mounted to a terminal of an electronic component, the beam portion is offset from the electronic component and its contact end is further offset, extending well away from the surface of the electronic component to which it is mounted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In one particularly preferred embodiment, the resulting contact structure is preferably “long and low”, having:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">a length “L”, as measured from one end to another end;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">a height “H” measured transverse the length in a direction that is normal (z-axis) to the surface of the sacrificial substrate (and typically normal to the component to which the contact structure is ultimately mounted);</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">a contact end (tip) portion which is offset in a one direction (e.g., negative along the z-axis) from a central (beam) portion of the spring element by a distance “d<b>1</b>”; and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">a base end (post) portion which is offset in one direction (e.g., positive z-axis) from the central (beam) portion of the spring element by a distance “d<b>2</b>”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The beam portion of the contact structure is preferably tapered from the one (base) end to the other (contact) end thereof, the contact structure having the following dimensions:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">a width “w<b>1</b>” at its base end as measured parallel to the surface of the sacrificial substrate and transverse to the longitudinal axis of the spring element;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">a width “w<b>2</b>” at its contact end as measured parallel to the surface of the sacrificial substrate and transverse to the longitudinal axis of the spring element;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">a thickness “t<b>1</b>” at its base end, measured along the z-axis; and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">a thickness “t<b>2</b>” at its contact end, measured along the z-axis; resulting in:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">a widthwise taper angle “α” (alpha); and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">a thickness taper angle “β” (beta).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The tip portion of the contact structure is also suitably provided with a projecting tip feature, said tip feature having a dimension “d<b>3</b>” measured along the z-axis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">There is thus described herein an exemplary contact structure suitable for effecting connections between two electronic components, typically being mounted by its base (post) end to a one of the two electronic components and effecting a pressure connection with its contact (tip) end (e.g., by the projecting tip feature) to an other of the two electronic components, having the following dimensions (in mils, unless otherwise specified):</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 1A-1C corresponding to FIGS. 1A-1C of the aforementioned U.S. patent application No. U.S. patent application No. 08/852,152 illustrate fabricating a plurality (one of many shown) of spring contact elements <b>120</b> on an electronic component <b>102</b>. Generally, a number of insulating layers having openings formed therein are aligned and “seeded” with a layer of conductive material. A mass of conductive material can then be formed (or deposited) in the seeded opening(s), such as by electroplating (or CVD, sputtering, electroless plating, etc.). After the insulating layers are removed, the masses can function as free-standing spring contact structures <b>120</b> which extend not only vertically above the surface of the component <b>102</b>, but also laterally from the location whereat they are mounted. In this manner, the spring contact structures are readily engineered to be compliant in both the Z-axis as well as in the x-y plane (parallel to the surface of the component).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 1A illustrates an exemplary technique for fabricating one of a plurality of microelectronic contact structures <b>120</b> on a substrate <b>102</b>. The substrate <b>102</b>, for example, may be an active electronic component, including semiconductor devices, including semiconductor devices resident on a semiconductor wafer (not shown). More generally, the substrate can be a variety of materials. This can be a passive device, such as an interposer or space transformer, or an active device such as a semiconductor device. The material of the substrate might be ceramic or silicon, among other choices. In general, a preferred substrate is one which is amenable to processing under typical semiconductor fabrication conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The substrate <b>102</b> has a plurality (one of many shown) of areas <b>112</b> on its surface whereat the spring contact elements <b>120</b> will be fabricated. In the case of the substrate <b>102</b> being an electronic component (such as a semiconductor device), an area <b>112</b> preferably would be a terminal (such as a bond pad) of the electronic component.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Generally, a number (three shown) of patterned masking layers <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> are applied onto the surface of the substrate. The layers are patterned to have openings (as shown) aligned with the area <b>112</b>, and the openings are sized and shaped so that an opening in a one layer (e.g., <b>108</b>, <b>106</b>) extends further from the area <b>112</b> than an opening in an underlying layer (e.g., <b>106</b>, <b>104</b>, respectively). In other words, the first layer <b>104</b> has an opening which may be directly over the area <b>112</b>. A portion of the opening in the second layer <b>106</b> is aligned over at least a portion of the opening in the first layer <b>104</b> and, conversely, a portion of the first layer <b>104</b> extends under a portion of the opening in the second layer <b>106</b>. Similarly, a portion of the opening in the third layer <b>108</b>. is aligned over at least a portion of the opening in the second layer <b>106</b> and, conversely, a portion of the second layer <b>106</b> extends under a portion of the opening in the third layer <b>108</b>. The. bottom portion of a given overall opening is directly over the selected area <b>112</b> and its top portion is elevated from its bottom portion. In one preferred embodiment, the top portion is laterally offset from the area <b>112</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As discussed in greater detail hereinbelow, and as discussed in greater detail in the aforementioned U.S. patent application No. 08/819,464, a conductive metallic material is deposited into the opening, and the masking layers are removed, resulting in a free-standing contact structure having been fabricated directly upon the substrate with its base end secured to the substrate <b>102</b> at the area <b>112</b> and its free end extending both above the surface of the substrate and laterally-displaced from the area <b>112</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">If required, such as for electroplating, a very thin (e.g., 4500 Å) “seed” layer of conductive material <b>114</b> such as titanium/tungsten (TiW) may be deposited into the openings. Then, a mass of conductive metallic material (e.g., nickel) <b>120</b> can be deposited by electroplating into the openings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 1B and 1C illustrate a resulting spring contact element <b>120</b> having its base end <b>122</b> adjacent the area <b>112</b>, and its free-end (tip) <b>124</b> elevated in the z-axis above the surface of the substrate <b>102</b> as well as laterally offset in the x-axis and y-axis from the base end <b>122</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As best viewed in FIG. 1C, the contact element <b>120</b> will react pressure applied in the z-axis at its tip end <b>124</b>, as indicated by the arrow <b>132</b>, such as would result from making, a temporary pressure electrical connection with a terminal (not shown) of another electronic component (not shown). Compliance in the z-axis ensures that contact force (pressure) will be maintained, and also accommodates non-planarities (if any) between terminals (not shown) on the other electronic component (not shown). Such temporary electrical connections are useful for making temporary connections to the electronic component <b>102</b>, such as for performing burn-in and/or testing of the component <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The tip end <b>124</b> is also free to move compliantly in the x- and y- directions, as indicated by the arrows <b>134</b> and <b>136</b>, respectively. This would be important in the context of joining (by soldering, or brazing, or with a conductive adhesive) the tip end <b>124</b> to a terminal (not shown) of another electronic component (not shown) which has a different coefficient of thermal expansion than the substrate (component) <b>102</b>. Such permanent electrical connections are useful for assemblies of electronic components, such as a plurality of memory chips (each of which is represented by the substrate <b>102</b>) to another electronic component such as an interconnection substrate such as a printed circuit board (“PCB”; not shown)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The plurality of spring contact elements <b>120</b> can be fabricated with very precise dimensions and very precise spacing from one another. For example, tens of thousands of such spring contact elements <b>120</b> are readily precisely fabricated on a corresponding number of terminals on semiconductor devices which are resident on a semiconductor wafer (not shown).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this manner, there has been shown a method of fabricating spring contact elements (<b>120</b>) directly on a substrate (<b>102</b>) such as an electronic component, such as a semiconductor device which may be resident on a semiconductor wafer, by applying at least one layer of masking material (<b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>) on a surface of the substrate (<b>102</b>) and patterning the masking layer to have openings extending from areas (<b>112</b>) on the substrate to positions which are spaced above the surface of the substrate and which also may be laterally and/or transversely offset from the areas <b>112</b>); by optionally seeding (<b>114</b>) the openings; by depositing at least one layer of a conductive metallic material into the openings; and by removing the masking material so that the remaining conductive metallic material forms free-standing contact elements extending from the surface of the substrate, each contact element having a base end which is secured to a one of the areas of the substrate and having a tip end for making an electrical connection to a terminal of an electronic component.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The structures (spring contact elements) <b>120</b> are principally, preferably entirely, metallic, and may be formed (fabricated) as multilayer structures. Suitable materials for the one or more layers of the contact structures include but are not limited to:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">nickel, and its alloys;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">copper, cobalt, iron, and their alloys;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">gold (especially hard gold) and silver, both of which exhibit excellent current-carrying capabilities and good contact resistivity characteristics;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">elements of the platinum group;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">noble metals;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">semi-noble metals and their alloys, particularly elements of the palladium group and their alloys; and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">tungsten, molybdenum and other refractory metals and their alloys. Nickel and nickel alloys are particularly preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In cases where a solder-like finish is desired, tin, lead, bismuth, indium and their alloys can also be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Another Spring Contact Element</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 2A-2C corresponding to FIGS. 3A-3C of the aforementioned U.S. patent application No. 08/852,152 are schematic illustrations of spring contact elements <b>200</b> and <b>250</b> (compare <b>120</b>) fabricated according to the techniques of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The spring contact element <b>200</b> of FIGS. 2A and 2B has a base end portion <b>202</b>, a contact (tip) end portion <b>204</b>, a main body portion <b>206</b> therebetween, an overall length “L” and an overall height “H”. As illustrated, the main body portion <b>206</b> is offset a distance “d<b>2</b>” in a one direction from the base end portion <b>202</b>, and is offset a distance “d<b>1</b>” in another direction from the contact end portion <b>304</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As best viewed in the top schematic view of FIG. 2B, the contact element <b>200</b> can be provided with a widthwise taper “α” so that it is narrower (width “w<b>2</b>”) at its contact end <b>204</b> than at its base end <b>202</b> (width “w<b>1</b>”) .</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 2C is a schematic representation of a similar (to the contact element <b>200</b>) spring contact element <b>250</b> that has a base end portion <b>252</b> (compare <b>202</b>), a contact (tip) end portion <b>254</b> (compare <b>204</b>), and a main body portion <b>256</b> (compare <b>206</b>) therebetween. In this example, the contact element <b>250</b> can be provided with a thickness taper “β” so that it is thinner (thickness “t<b>2</b>”) at its contact end <b>254</b> than at its base end <b>252</b> (thickness “t<b>1</b>”)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Exemplary Dimensions</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The spring contact elements of the present invention are particularly well suited to making interconnections between microelectronic components. Suitable dimensions for the spring contact element are (in mils, unless otherwise specified):</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">These dimensions are illustrative, and are not meant to limit in any way the scope of the claims. Dimensions outside these ranges may be useful according to various choices readily made by one skilled in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The technique described hereinabove and resulting spring contact elements <b>120</b>, <b>200</b> and <b>250</b> are viable, but somewhat limited in that:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(a) it is necessary to apply three masking layers (<b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>), one atop the other, and pattern each masking layer with openings registering with openings in previously-applied layers;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(b) the entire resulting spring contact element is of uniform composition (e.g., of one or more metallic layers throughout its construction);</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(c) there is no “tip feature” (described in greater detail hereinbelow) associated therewith.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Another Spring Contact Element</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 3A-3C corresponding to FIGS. 1A, <b>1</b>D and <b>1</b>E, respectively, of the aforementioned U.S. patent application No. 08/802,054 and its counterpart PCT patent application number US97/08271, and illustrate an elongate resilient (spring) contact element <b>300</b> that is suitable for attachment as a free-standing structure to an electronic component.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The structure <b>300</b> is elongate, has two ends <b>302</b> and <b>304</b>, a central portion <b>306</b> therebetween, and has an overall longitudinal length of “L” between the two ends. The length “L” is in the range of 10-1000 mils, such as 40-500 mils or 40-250 mils, preferably 60-100 mils.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The end <b>302</b> is a “base” whereat the contact element <b>300</b> will be mounted to an electronic component (not shown). The end <b>304</b> is a “free-end” (tip) which will effect a pressure connection with another electronic component (e.g., a device-under-test, not shown).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The structure <b>300</b> has an overall height of “H”. The height “H” is in the range of 4-40 mils, preferably 5-12 mils. (1 mil=0.001 inches=about 25 microns)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As best viewed in FIG. 3A, the structure is “stepped”. The base portion <b>302</b> is at a first height, the tip <b>304</b> is at another height, and a middle (central) portion <b>306</b> is at a third height which is between the first and second heights. Therefore, the structure <b>300</b> has two “standoff” heights, labeled “d<b>1</b>” and “d<b>2</b>” in the figure. In other words, the spring contact element <b>300</b> has two “steps”, a step up from the contact end <b>304</b> to the central body portion <b>306</b>, and a further step up from the central body portion <b>306</b> to the base end <b>302</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In use, the structure is often used as a resilient contact member to allow a mechanical and electrical connection between a second electronic device and the substrate upon which the structure is mounted. When the structure. is engaged, a pressure connection moves the tip <b>304</b> closer to the substrate (not shown), thus diminishing height “H”. The distances d<b>1</b> and d<b>2</b> can be chosen to allow displacement of tip <b>304</b> by a sufficient amount to provide the desired contact. The contact force will be influenced by the resilience of the structure as it resists compression when brought into contact with the second electronic device. The design and the resiliency of the central portion will influence how much the central portion can flex near the tip <b>304</b> versus near the base <b>302</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The standoff height “d<b>1</b>”, which is the “vertical” (as viewed in FIG. 3A) distance between the tip <b>304</b> and the central portion <b>306</b>, is selected in part to prevent bumping of the structure (contact element) with a surface of a component being contacted by the tip end <b>304</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In use, the standoff height “d<b>2</b>”, which is the “vertical” (as viewed in FIG. 3A) distance between the base <b>302</b> and the central portion <b>306</b>, is selected in part to allow the beam (contact element) to bend and be displaced toward the surface of a substrate to which the element is attached.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The dimensions for the standoff heights “d<b>1</b>” and “d<b>2</b>” are:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">“d<b>1</b>” is in the range of 3-15 mils, preferably approximately 7 mils±1 mil; and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">“d<b>2</b>” is in the range of 0-15 mils, preferably approximately 7 mils±1 mil. In the case of “d<b>2</b>” being 0 mil, the structure would be substantially planar (without the illustrated step) between the central portion <b>306</b> and the-base portion <b>302</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In use, the structure <b>300</b> is intended to function as a cantilever beam, and is preferably provided with at least one taper angle, in a manner such as was discussed with respect to FIGS. 2B and 2C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In contrast to the spring contact structures <b>120</b>, <b>200</b> and <b>250</b> described hereinabove, the tip end <b>304</b> of the spring contact structure <b>300</b> is preferably provided with an integral protruding topological “tip feature” <b>308</b>, for example in the geometric form of a pyramid, to aid in effecting pressure connection to a terminal of an electronic component (not shown).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The spring contact structure <b>300</b> is principally, preferably entirely, metallic, and may be formed (fabricated) as a multilayer structure, suitably employing, for its layers the materials listed hereinabove for layers of other contact structures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 3B shows an enlarged view of the contact end <b>304</b> of the contact structure <b>300</b>. In this enlarged view it can be seen that the tip feature <b>308</b> is suitably quite prominent, projecting a distance “d<b>3</b>”, in the range of 0.25-5 mils, preferably 3 mils, from the bottom (as viewed) surface of the contact end of the spring contact element, and is suitably in the geometric shape of a pyramid, a truncated pyramid, a wedge, a hemisphere, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The resulting contact structure has an overall height “H” which is approximately the sum of “d<b>1</b>”, “d<b>2</b>” (and “d<b>3</b>”) plus the thickness of the central body portion when the contact structure is not compressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The various dimensions set forth for the spring contact element <b>300</b> are in the ranges set forth hereinabove for the spring contact elements <b>200</b> and <b>250</b> (except for the dimension “d<b>3</b>” which is relevant only to the contact element <b>300</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Another dimension is of interest—namely, the width and length (i.e., footprint) of the overall tip end (<b>304</b>). In instances where the tip end is expected to make contact with a terminal of an electronic component which is recessed (e.g., a bond pad of a semiconductor device which has passivation material surrounding the bond pad), it may be desirable to ensure that the footprint of the tip end is sufficiently small to make such contact, for example, less than 4 mils by 4 mils. It is particularly useful to make the footprint of the contact end relatively small, for example, 10 microns or even 2 or 3 microns square, to make a penetrating contact feature which will tend to penetrate miscellaneous contaminants on the surface of a contact.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is desirable that the tip feature <b>308</b> is of sufficient height (d<b>3</b>) to make contact with a terminal, which may be recessed below the surface of the second electronic component. Generally speaking, the selection of an appropriate tip end design will be dictated by the peculiarities of the given application. For example, for contacting bond pads on silicon devices, the tip end design illustrated in FIG. 3B would likely be most appropriate. For contacting C<b>4</b> bumps, the tip end design illustrated in FIG. 3C (described hereinbelow) would likely be most appropriate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 3C illustrates an alternate embodiment of a spring contact structure wherein separate and distinct (discrete) contact tip structures <b>328</b>, such as are described in the aforementioned PCT/US96/08107 can be mounted to the contact end portions <b>304</b> of the spring contact elements, such as by brazing <b>330</b> thereto. This provides the possibility of the contact tip structure <b>328</b> having a different metallurgy, than the spring contact element (<b>300</b>). For example, the metallurgy of the spring contact element (<b>300</b>) is suitably targeted at its mechanical (e.g., resilient, spring) characteristics and its general capability to conduct electricity, while the metallurgy of a contact tip structure <b>328</b> mounted thereto is appropriately targeted to making superior electrical connection with a terminal of an electronic component being contacted and, if needed, can have superior wear-resistance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to an aspect of the invention, processes such as photolithography are employed to fabricate the spring contact elements of the present invention with tolerances, both of the springs themselves and with regard to the relative locations of a plurality of springs, suitable for use as interconnections in the context of fine-pitch microelectronics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Mounting and Contacting Spring Contact Elements</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 4A-4C, corresponding to FIGS. 4A-4C of the aforementioned U.S. patent application No. 08/802,054 and its counterpart PCT patent application number US97/08271, illustrate a technique wherein a plurality (two of many shown) of contact structures <b>402</b> (compare <b>120</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>250</b>, <b>300</b>) have been fabricated on a sacrificial substrate <b>404</b>. The base end portions of the contact structures <b>402</b> are brought into contact with a corresponding plurality of terminals <b>406</b> on an electronic component <b>408</b>, whereupon the base end portions are suitably joined by soldering, brazing or with a conductive adhesive <b>410</b> to the terminals <b>406</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is within the scope of this invention that any suitable technique and/or material for affixing the base end portions of the contact structures (<b>402</b>) to terminals of an electronic component be employed, including brazing, welding (e.g., spot welding), soldering, conductive. epoxy, tacking the contact structure in any suitable manner to the terminal and securely affixing the contact structure to the terminal by plating (e.g., electroplating), and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The sacrificial substrate <b>404</b> is then removed, in any suitable manner, such as by chemical etching or heating), resulting in an electronic component <b>408</b> having a plurality (two of many shown) of spring contact elements <b>402</b> affixed thereto, as illustrated in FIG. <b>4</b>B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As is evident in FIG. 4B, a plurality of elongate spring contact elements can be mounted to an electronic component having a plurality of terminals on a surface thereof. Each spring contact element has a base end and a contact end opposite the base end, and is mounted by its base end of a corresponding terminal of the electronic component. The contact end of each spring contact element extends above the surface of the electronic component to a position which is laterally offset from its base end.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 4C illustrates an application for the spring contact elements <b>420</b> wherein the spring contact elements have been mounted in the manner described with respect to FIG. 4B to a space transformer component (<b>408</b>) of a probe card assembly (not shown) so that the tip features (compare <b>308</b>) at their contact ends (compare <b>304</b>) make pressure connections with terminals <b>422</b> of an electronic component <b>420</b> such as a semiconductor device which may or may not be resident on a semiconductor wafer. As described hereinabove, it is within the scope of this invention that separate and discrete contact tip structures (<b>328</b>) be affixed to the contact end portions of the spring contact elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is within the scope of this invention that the substrate (component) to which the structures <b>402</b> are mounted, for example the component <b>408</b> illustrated in FIG. 4C is active electronic components, such as memory devices or ASICs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is also within the scope of the invention, as is illustrated in FIG. 4C, that the component or substrate to which the structures (e.g., <b>402</b>) are mounted can be provided with a contiguous (as illustrated) or segmented ground plane to control impedance. Such a ground plane may comprise a plurality of ground lines <b>412</b> aligned directly underneath the structures <b>402</b>, but sufficient clearance for the tip of the structure to deflect must be assured. Alternatively, the ground plane <b>412</b> can be covered with an insulating layer. Another approach would be to dispose ground plane lines <b>414</b> on the surface of the substrate <b>408</b> slightly (such as 1 mil, in the x-axis) offset from directly underneath the structures <b>402</b>, and laying parallel to the structure <b>402</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Multilayer Structures</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 5A-5D, corresponding to FIGS. 2A-2D of the aforementioned U.S. patent application No. 08/819,464 illustrate an exemplary technique for-prefabricating metallic structures <b>520</b> which suitably are components of a microelectronic contact structure on a sacrificial substrate <b>502</b>. In this example, a silicon substrate (wafer) <b>502</b> having a top (as viewed) surface is used as the sacrificial substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A layer <b>504</b> of titanium is deposited (e.g., by sputtering) onto the top surface of the silicon substrate <b>502</b>, and suitably has a thickness of approximately 250 Å (1 Å=0.1 nm=10<sup>−10 </sup>m). A layer <b>506</b> of aluminum is deposited (e.g., by sputtering) atop the titanium layer <b>504</b>, and suitably has a thickness of approximately 20,000 Å. The titanium layer <b>504</b> is optional and serves as an adhesion layer for the aluminum layer <b>506</b>. A layer <b>508</b> of copper is deposited (e.g., by sputtering) atop the aluminum layer <b>506</b>, and suitably has a thickness-of approximately 5,000 Å.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A layer <b>510</b> of masking material (e.g., photoresist) is deposited atop the copper layer <b>508</b>, and suitably has a thickness of approximately 2 mils. The masking layer <b>510</b> is processed in any suitable manner to have a plurality (three of many shown) of holes (openings) <b>512</b> extending through the photoresist layer <b>510</b> to the underlying copper layer <b>508</b>. For example, each hole <b>512</b> may be 6 mils in diameter, and the holes <b>512</b> may be arranged at a pitch (center-to-center) of 10 mils. The sacrificial substrate <b>502</b> has, in this manner, been prepared for fabricating a plurality of contact tip structures at what are “lithographically-defined” locations on the sacrificial substrate <b>502</b>, within the holes <b>512</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Exemplary metallic structures <b>520</b> may be formed, as follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A layer <b>514</b> of nickel is deposited, such as by plating, within the holes <b>512</b>, onto the copper layer <b>508</b>, and suitably has a thickness of approximately 1.0-1.5 mils. Optionally, a thin layer (not shown) of a noble metal such as rhodium can be deposited onto the copper layer <b>508</b> prior to depositing the nickel. Next, a layer <b>516</b> of gold is deposited, such as by plating, onto the nickel <b>514</b>. The multilayer structure of nickel and gold (and, optionally, rhodium) will serve as a pre-fabricated metallic structure suitable for use as one or more of the components of multipart, assembled spring contact elements which are described in greater detail hereinbelow.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, as illustrated in FIG. 5B, the photoresist <b>510</b> is stripped away (using any suitable solvent), leaving a plurality of pre-fabricated metallic structures <b>520</b> sitting atop the copper layer <b>508</b>. Next, the exposed (i.e., not covered by contact tip structures <b>520</b>) portion of the copper layer <b>508</b> is subjected to a quick etch process, thereby exposing the aluminum layer <b>506</b>. As will be evident, aluminum is useful in subsequent steps, since aluminum is substantially non-wettable with respect to most solder and braze materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It bears mention that it is preferred to pattern the photoresist with additional holes (not shown, comparable to <b>512</b>) within which “ersatz” metallic structures <b>522</b> may be fabricated in the same process steps employed to fabricate the actual metallic structures <b>520</b>. These ersatz structures <b>522</b> will serve to uniformize the aforementioned plating steps (<b>514</b>, <b>516</b>) in a manner that is well known and understood, by reducing abrupt gradients (non-uniformities) from manifesting themselves across the surface being plated. Such structures (<b>522</b>) are typically referred to in the field of plating as “robbers”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this manner, a plurality of metallic structures <b>520</b> have successfully been pre-fabricated on a sacrificial substrate <b>502</b>, awaiting subsequent joining to terminals of electronic components or to other metallic structures. Optionally, as part of the pre-fabrication of metallic structures (alternatively, immediately prior to joining the metallic structures <b>520</b> to terminals or other metallic structures, solder or brazing paste (“joining material”) <b>524</b> is deposited onto the top (as viewed) surfaces of the metallic structures <b>520</b>. (There is no need to deposit the paste onto the tops of the ersatz structures <b>522</b>). This is implemented in any suitable manner, such as with a stainless steel screen or stencil or by automated dispensing of solder paste, as is known in the art. A typical paste (joining material) <b>524</b> would contain gold-tin alloy (in a flux matrix) exhibiting, for example, 1 mil spheres (balls).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The metallic structures <b>520</b>, as fabricated upon and resident upon a sacrificial substrate <b>502</b>, constitute a product in and of themselves.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As described in the aforementioned U.S. patent application No. 08/819,464, the metallic structures <b>520</b> may be contact tip structures suitable for joining to ends of free-standing resilient contact structures resident on an electronic component, in which case the sacrificial substrate <b>502</b> with contact tip structures <b>520</b> resident thereon is brought to bear upon tips (free ends) of exemplary elongate interconnection elements extending from a substrate which may be an electronic component.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in FIG. 5C, the contact tip structures <b>520</b> (only two contact tip structures are shown in the view of FIG. 5D, for illustrative clarity) are aligned with the tips (distal ends) of interconnection elements <b>552</b> extending from a surface of an electronic component <b>554</b>, using standard flip-chip techniques (e.g., split prism), and the assembly is passed through a brazing furnace (not shown) to reflow the joining material <b>524</b>, thereby permanently joining (e.g., brazing) the prefabricated contact tip structures <b>520</b> to the ends of the interconnection elements <b>532</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">During the reflow process, the exposed aluminum layer (<b>506</b>), being non-wettable, prevents solder (i.e., braze) from flowing between the contact tip structures <b>520</b>, i.e., prevents solder bridges from forming between adjacent contact tip structures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In addition to this anti-wetting function of the aluminum layer <b>506</b>, the aluminum layer <b>506</b> also serves to provide a release mechanism. Using a suitable etchant, the aluminum is preferentially (to the other materials of the assembly) etched away, and the silicon sacrificial substrate <b>502</b> simply “pops” off, resulting in a substrate or electronic component <b>554</b> having “tipped” interconnection elements <b>552</b>, each having a prefabricated tip structure <b>520</b>, as illustrated in FIG. <b>5</b>D. (Note that the joining material <b>524</b> has reflowed as “fillets” <b>525</b> on end portions of the interconnection elements <b>552</b>.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a final step of the process, the residual copper (<b>508</b>) is etched away, leaving the contact tip structures <b>520</b> with nickel (or rhodium, as discussed hereinabove) exposed for making reliable electrical pressure connections to terminals (not shown) of other electronic components (not shown).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is within the scope of the invention that the brazing (soldering) paste (<b>524</b>) is omitted, and in its stead, alternating layers of gold and tin in a eutectic ratio are plated onto the interconnection elements (<b>552</b>) prior to mounting the contact tip structures (<b>520</b>) thereto. In a similar manner, eutectic joining layers can be plated onto the contact tip structures (<b>520</b>) prior to joining with the interconnection elements (<b>552</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Since the contact tip structures (<b>520</b>) are readily fabricated to be coplanar and of uniform thickness, the resulting “tipped” interconnection elements (FIG. 5D) will have tips (i.e., the exposed surfaces of the contact tip structures) which are substantially coplanar. The electronic component (e.g., <b>554</b>) to which the interconnection elements (e.g., <b>552</b>) are mounted may be an ASIC, a microprocessor, a component (e.g., space transformer component) of a probe card assembly, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A Multilayer Structure and a Release Mechanism</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 6 corresponds to FIG. 4A of the aforementioned U.S. patent application No. 08/819,464 and illustrates a useful (e.g., preferred) technique for forming a multilayer metallic component for a spring contact structure in (or on) a sacrificial substrate, in the following manner, using a thin aluminum layer (foil) <b>600</b> as the sacrificial substrate:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">provide a temporary backing <b>602</b>, such as a plastic sheet, for the foil <b>600</b>, to increase the structural integrity of the foil (this backing layer <b>602</b> can also act as a plating barrier/mask);</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">pattern the face (top, as viewed) of the foil <b>600</b> with a thin (approximately 3 mil) layer of photoresist <b>604</b>, or the like, leaving (or creating) openings <b>616</b> at locations whereat it is desired to form multilayer metallic components of spring contact structures;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">deposit (such as by plating) a thin (approximately 100 microinch (μ″) ) layer <b>606</b> of hard gold onto the foil <b>600</b>, within the openings <b>616</b> in the photoresist <b>604</b>;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">deposit (such as by plating) a very thin (approximately 5-10μ″) layer (“strike”) of copper <b>608</b> onto the layer of hard gold (it should be understood that such a copper strike is useful but optional, and is provided principally to assist in subsequent plating of the previous gold layer <b>606</b>);</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">deposit (such as by plating) a relatively thick (approximately 2 mil) layer <b>610</b> of nickel onto the copper strike <b>608</b> (or, if there is not copper strike, onto the layer <b>606</b> of hard gold); and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">deposit (such as by plating) a thin (approximately 100μ″) layer <b>612</b> of soft gold onto the nickel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This results in a multilayer structure <b>620</b> (compare <b>520</b>), which is readily joined to either a terminal of an electronic component (not shown) or to another component of a spring contact structure (not shown). The multilayer structure <b>620</b> has, as its principal layers, a hard gold surface (<b>606</b>) for contacting (e.g., making pressure connections to) terminals of electronic components (not shown) making the structure <b>620</b> particularly useful as a tip component of a spring contact element, a nickel layer (<b>610</b>) providing strength, and a soft gold layer (<b>612</b>) which is readily bonded to (joinable to) a terminal of an electronic component or to another component of a spring contact structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Regarding depositing the materials for the structure <b>620</b> into the openings <b>616</b> of the masking material <b>604</b> atop the sacrificial substrate, it should be noted that the sacrificial substrate itself (e.g., <b>600</b>), or one or more of the blanket layers deposited thereon serve to electrically connect the openings to one another, thereby facilitating the use of electroplating processes to deposit the multiple metallic layers of the structure <b>620</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In use, the structures <b>620</b> can be joined to terminals of electronic components or to other structures in the manner(s) described with respect to FIGS. 4A, <b>5</b>C and <b>5</b>D, and the aluminum sacrificial substrate <b>600</b> can be removed by means of chemical etching (e.g., with potassium hydroxide).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Another Multilayer Structure and another Release Mechanism</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 7 corresponds to FIG. 4B of the aforementioned U.S. patent application No. 08/819,464 and illustrates another technique for making components of microelectronic contact structures and releasing them from the sacrificial substrate upon which they are formed. The technique is not dependent on chemical etching (compare FIG. 6) to release the metallic structures from the sacrificial substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As mentioned hereinabove, a “plain” (i.e., no active devices resident thereupon) silicon wafer can be used as the sacrificial substrate upon which the post/beam/tip components of spring contact elements of the present invention may be fabricated. An exemplary metallurgy is set forth hereinabove (FIG. <b>6</b>), wherein by using a suitable chemical selective etching process, the components of spring contact elements can be released from the sacrificial substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is within the scope of this invention that an appropriate metallurgy in conjunction with heat can be used to release the components of the spring contact elements from the sacrificial substrate, rather than by using chemical etching. For example, as illustrated by FIG. <b>7</b>:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Step 1. Etch a pit (one of one or more shown) <b>702</b> into a silicon (sacrificial) substrate <b>704</b> at a location (one of several shown) whereat it is desired to have a topological feature on a contact tip structure. As discussed hereinbelow, etching of silicon can be self-limiting.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Step 2. Apply a patterned masking layer <b>706</b> (e.g., photoresist) onto the surface of the silicon (sacrificial) substrate <b>704</b>. An opening <b>708</b> in the masking layer is at a corresponding location where a corresponding tip component <b>720</b> will be fabricated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Step 3. Deposit (such as by sputtering) a thin layer <b>710</b> of a non-wettable (as will be evident) material such as tungsten (or titanium-tungsten) onto. the substrate, within the opening <b>708</b> of the masking layer <b>706</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Step 4. Deposit (such as by sputtering) a thin layer <b>712</b> of a non-wetting material such as plateable lead (or indium) onto the thin tungsten layer, within the opening <b>708</b> of the masking layer <b>706</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Step 5. Fabricate a tip component <b>720</b> having one or more layers within the opening <b>708</b> of the masking layer <b>706</b>, in the manner described hereinabove (e.g., with respect to FIG. <b>6</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Step 6. Reflow (using heat) a tip component <b>720</b> onto an end of a beam component (not shown) in the manner described hereinabove. During reflow, the thin layer <b>712</b> will melt and ball up. For example, tungsten (<b>710</b>) is not wettable with respect to lead (<b>712</b>). This will cause the tip component <b>720</b> to be released from the sacrificial substrate <b>704</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Optionally, a second layer of non-wettable material (e.g., tungsten) can be applied over the layer <b>712</b>, between layer <b>712</b> and tip component <b>720</b>. Said material will become part of the resulting contact tip structure, unless it is removed (e.g., by etching). In some cases, lead will not ball up (e.g., lead tends to wet nickel), in which cases it may be desired to deposit additional layers such as lead, then tungsten, then lead, to ensure proper release of the contact tip structures from the sacrificial substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Optionally, another layer of material which will ball up when heated (e.g., lead, indium) can be applied over the second layer of non-wettable material (e.g., tungsten). Any residual lead on the surface of the resulting contact tip structure is readily removed, or may be left in place. Alternatively, a layer of a “barrier” material can be deposited between the second layer of material which will ball up and the first layer (e.g., rhodium) of the resulting tip component <b>720</b>. The “barrier” material may be tungsten, silicon nitride, molybdenum, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Another Multilayer Structure</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 8A-8F correspond to FIGS. 5A-5F of the aforementioned U.S. patent application No. 08/819,464 and illustrate a technique for forming metallic structures having pyramid or truncated pyramid tip features on a sacrificial substrate which is a silicon wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 8A illustrates a first step in the technique, wherein a layer <b>804</b> of masking material, such as photoresist, is applied to the surface of the silicon substrate <b>802</b>, and is patterned to have a plurality (two of many shown) of openings <b>806</b> extending to the surface of the silicon substrate <b>802</b>. The openings <b>806</b> are preferably square, measuring approximately 1-4 mils, such as 2.5 mils on a side. However, the openings may be rectangular, or may have other geometric shapes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, as illustrated in FIG. 8B, the silicon substrate <b>802</b> is etched to form a like plurality (one of many shown) of pyramid-shaped depressions <b>808</b> in the silicon substrate <b>802</b>. Such etching of silicon will tend to be self-limiting, as the etching proceeds along the crystal plane at 54.74° for (100) silicon. In other words, the depression will extend to a depth which is defined (dictated) by the size of the opening <b>806</b> and the nature of the silicon substrate <b>802</b>. For example, with a square opening 2.5 mils per side, the depth of the depression will be approximately, 2 mils. Ultimately, depression <b>808</b> will become a contact feature integrally formed upon the resulting contact tip structure to be formed on the silicon substrate. This is preferably a photolithographic process, so that the size and spacing of the opening <b>806</b> and feature <b>808</b> will be extremely precise. Tolerances of microns (10<sup>−6 </sup>meters) are readily attained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, as illustrated in FIG. 8C, the masking material <b>804</b> is removed, and a new masking layer <b>814</b> (compare <b>804</b>), such as photoresist, is applied to the surface of the silicon substrate <b>802</b> and is patterned to have a plurality (one of many shown) of openings <b>816</b> (compare <b>806</b>) extending to the surface of the silicon substrate <b>802</b>. The openings <b>816</b> are larger than the openings <b>806</b>, and are generally aligned therewith. (A typical opening <b>816</b> is over a depression <b>808</b>.) An exemplary opening <b>816</b> is a rectangle suitably measuring approximately 7 mils (across the page, as shown) by 8-30 mils (into the page, as shown). Ultimately, an opening <b>816</b> will be filled with conductive material forming the body of a contact tip structure, being pre-fabricated on the sacrificial substrate <b>802</b>. This is also preferably a photolithographic process, but the size and spacing of these openings <b>816</b> need not be as precise as previous openings <b>806</b>. Tolerances on the order of up to 1 mil (0.001 inch) are generally acceptable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, as illustrated by FIG. 8C, a multilayer contact tip structure <b>820</b> is built up within the opening <b>816</b>, with a pyramid-shaped tip feature <b>830</b> extending from a surface thereof. In this example, the multilayer buildup is suitably:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">first deposit (apply) a release mechanism <b>822</b> such as has been described hereinabove (e.g., a multilayer buildup of lead/tungsten/lead);</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">then deposit a relatively thin layer <b>824</b> of rhodium or tungsten (or ruthenium, or iridium, or hard nickel or cobalt or their alloys, or tungsten carbide), such as 0.1-1.0 mils thick;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">then deposit a relatively thick layer <b>826</b> of nickel, cobalt or their alloys;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">finally deposit a relatively thin layer <b>828</b> of soft gold, which is readily brazed to.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this manner, a plurality of elongate contact tip structures <b>820</b> can be fabricated, each having a projecting pyramid-shaped contact (tip) feature <b>830</b> projecting from a surface thereof. It is this projecting contact feature that is intended to make the actual contact with a terminal (not shown) of an electronic component (not shown)(see FIG. <b>4</b>C).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in FIG. 8D (and evident in FIGS. 8C, <b>8</b>E and <b>8</b>F), the pyramid-shaped contact feature <b>830</b> is suitably polished (abraded) off, preferably at a level indicated by the dashed line <b>834</b>, which will configure the pyramid-shaped feature as a truncated pyramid-shaped feature. The relatively small flat end shape (e.g., a square measuring a few tenths of a mil on a side), rather than a truly pointed end shape, will tend to be sufficiently “sharp” to make reliable pressure connections with terminals (not shown) of electronic components (not shown). This configuration will tend to wear better than a truly pointed feature for making repeated pressure connections to a large number of electronic components, such as would be expected in an application of the tipped interconnection elements of the present invention for probing (e.g., testing silicon device wafers).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Another advantage of polishing off the point of the contact feature <b>830</b> is that the second layer of the multilayer buildup can be exposed for making contact with a terminal (not shown) of an electronic component (not shown). For example, this layer can be of a material with superior electrical characteristics, such as rhodium. Or, it can be a material with superior wear characteristics, such as titanium-tungsten. One preferred material is palladium ,alloyed with cobalt. Other palladium alloys also are preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 8E illustrates the elongate contact tip structure <b>820</b> of the present invention joined to an end of an elongate interconnection element <b>840</b>. FIG. 8F illustrates a plurality of elongate contact tip structures <b>820</b> of the present invention, each joined to a contact bump <b>832</b> of a membrane probe <b>834</b>. In these exemplary applications, the contact tip structures <b>820</b> having projecting topological contact features <b>830</b> provide:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">a distinct metallurgy;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">a distinct contact topology (topography);</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">tightly controlled positional tolerances; and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">if desired, a degree of pitch spreading.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Regarding effecting pitch spreading, it can be seen in FIG. 8F that the contact tip structures can be arranged so that the spacing between the contact features <b>830</b> is greater (as shown) or lesser (not shown) than the spacing of the contact balls <b>832</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Generally, in use, the “tipped” interconnection element is mounted to a first electronic component, and the apex (top, as viewed in FIGS. 8E and 8F) portion of the pyramid effects an electrical connection to a terminal (not shown) of a second electronic component (not shown).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As mentioned above, by prefabricating contact tip structures (e.g., <b>820</b>) with topological contact features (e.g., <b>830</b>) on a surface thereof, it is possible to achieve extremely high positional precision for the pressure connection to be made, without requiring a comparable degree of precision in either the body portion of the contact tip structure or the interconnection element to which it is joined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Joining Components Together</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">There have been described hereinabove some techniques for joining prefabricated contact tip structures (e.g., <b>328</b>, <b>520</b>, <b>820</b> to ends of spring contact elements, elongate interconnection elements or contact bumps membrane probe (e.g., <b>304</b>, <b>552</b>, <b>840</b>, <b>832</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 9A-9C correspond to FIGS. 7C, <b>7</b>D and <b>7</b>F, respectively, of the aforementioned U.S. patent application No. 08/819,464 and illustrate another embodiment of making a contact structure and joining it to an electronic component.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 9A-9C illustrate a technique for fabricating contact tip structures which are elongate and which, in use, will function as cantilever (plated cantilevered beam) spring contact elements, and mounting same to terminals of electronic components. These techniques are particularly well suited to ultimately mounting spring contact elements to electronic components such as semiconductor devices, space transformer substrates of probe card assemblies, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 9A illustrates a sacrificial substrate <b>902</b> such as a silicon wafer, into a surface of which one or more trenches <b>904</b> are etched. The trench <b>904</b> is illustrative of a surface texture ‘template’ for the contact tip structure <b>920</b> which will be fabricated on the sacrificial substrate <b>902</b>. The layout (spacing and arrangement) of the trenches <b>904</b> can be derived from (e.g. replicate or “mirror”) the bond pad layout of a semiconductor die (not shown) which is ultimately (in use) intended to be contacted (e.g., probed). For example, the trenches <b>904</b> can be arranged in a row, single file, down the center of the sacrificial substrate. Many memory chips, for example, are fabricated with a central row of bond pads (“lead on center” or LOC).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A hard “field” layer <b>906</b> has been deposited upon the surface of the sacrificial substrate <b>902</b>, including into trench <b>904</b>. Another layer <b>908</b>, such as of a plateable material, can optionally be deposited over the field layer <b>906</b>, if the field layer is of a material which is not amenable to plating such as tungsten-silicide, tungsten, or diamond. (If, as will be evident from the discussion hereinbelow, the layer <b>906</b> is difficult to remove, it may be applied by selective deposition (e.g., patterning through a mask), to avoid such removal.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A masking material <b>910</b>, such as photoresist, is applied to define an opening <b>916</b> for the fabrication of plated cantilever tip structure <b>920</b>. The opening <b>916</b> in the masking layer <b>910</b> extends to cover the trench <b>904</b>. Next, a relatively thick (e.g., 1-3 mils) layer <b>912</b> of a spring alloy material (such as nickel and its alloys) is optionally deposited (such as by plating), over which a layer <b>914</b> of material such as soft gold is deposited which is amenable to brazing or soldering, in the event that the spring alloy is not easy to bond, solder or braze to. The spring alloy layer <b>912</b> is deposited by any suitable means such as plating, sputtering or CVD. Another preferred spring alloy is palladium and its alloys, particularly palladium-cobalt.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, as shown in FIG. 9B, the masking material <b>910</b> is stripped (removed), along with that portion of the layers (<b>906</b> and <b>908</b>) which underlie the masking material <b>910</b>, resulting in an elongate contact tip structure <b>920</b> having been fabricated upon the sacrificial substrate <b>902</b>. Each elongate contact tip structure <b>920</b> has a tip portion <b>922</b> (directly over a corresponding one of the trenches <b>904</b>), a base portion <b>924</b>, and an intermediate portion <b>926</b> between the tip and base portions <b>922</b> and <b>924</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A plurality of such structures <b>920</b> may be staggered (oriented left-right-left-right), so that although their tip portions (<b>922</b>) are all aligned in a row (corresponding, e.g., to a central row of bond pads on a semiconductor device), their base portions <b>924</b> are oriented opposite one another. In this manner, the spacing between the base portions <b>924</b> of the contact tip structures <b>920</b> is at a greater (coarser) pitch (spacing) than the tip portions <b>922</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As mentioned hereinabove with respect to the spring contact structures <b>200</b> and <b>250</b> is that the intermediate portion <b>926</b> can be tapered, from narrowest at the (contact) tip portion <b>922</b> to widest at the base portion <b>924</b>. This feature provides for controllable, determinate amount of deflection of the tip portion <b>922</b> when the base portion <b>924</b> is rigidly mounted to a terminal of an electronic component such as a space transformer of a probe card assembly or a bond pad of a semiconductor device. Generally, deflection will be localized at or near the tip end of each contact tip structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The mechanical design of springs in generally well known in the art, including shape, taper, bending momentum and spring rate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 9C illustrates the mounting of a cantilever tip structure <b>920</b> to a rigid “pedestal” <b>930</b> extending (e.g., free-standing) from a corresponding terminal (one of many shown) <b>932</b> of an electronic component <b>934</b>. Generally, the function of the pedestal <b>930</b> is simply to elevate the cantilever tip structure <b>920</b> in the z-axis, above the surface of the component <b>934</b>, so that there is room for the tip end <b>922</b> to deflect (downwards, as viewed) when making a pressure connection to a terminal (not shown) of an electronic component (not shown). It is within the scope of this invention that the pedestal <b>930</b> itself may be resilient, in which case the cantilever tip structure <b>920</b> may or may not also be resilient, as desired for a specific application (use).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As illustrated, a pre-fabricated cantilever tip structure <b>920</b> is mounted by its base portion <b>924</b> to an end (top, as shown) of the pedestal <b>930</b>, mounted in any suitable manner such as by brazing or soldering. Here, another advantage of the base portion being the widest portion of the cantilever tip structure <b>920</b> is evident, the large base portion of the elongate contact tip structure providing a relatively large surface area for performing such soldering or brazing (shown by the fillet structure <b>936</b>), affording the opportunity to securely join the base of the elongate contact structure to the pedestal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is within the scope of this invention that the pedestal <b>930</b> can be any free-standing interconnection element including, but not limited to, a composite interconnection element, and specifically including a contact bump of a probe membrane (in which case the electronic component <b>934</b> would be a probe membrane) as well as a tungsten needle of conventional probe card.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As best viewed in FIG. 9C, the tip portion <b>922</b> of the cantilever tip structure <b>920</b> is provided with a raised tip feature <b>940</b> which, in use, effects the actual pressure connection to the terminal (not shown) of the electronic component (not shown). The shape and size of this feature <b>940</b> is controlled by the shape and size of the trench <b>904</b> (see FIG. <b>9</b>A).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In any cantilever beam arrangement, it is preferred that a one end of the cantilever be “fixed” and the other end “movable”. In this manner, bending moments are readily calculated. Hence, it is evident that the pedestal (<b>930</b>) is preferably as rigid as possible. In the case of the elongate contact structure (<b>920</b>) being joined to a contact bump on a membrane probe, much resilience and/or compliance will be provided by the membrane (<b>934</b>), per se.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A Three-piece Microelectronic Contact Structure</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to the invention, a microelectronic contact structure similar in many regards to the contact structures and spring contact elements and components thereof described hereinabove can be fabricated by joining together three components, each component preferably having been fabricated on a distinct sacrificial substrate, after which the components are joined to an electronic component and to one another. Each contact structure has three components: a “post” component for joining to an electronic component, a “beam” component for joining to the post component, and a “tip” component for joining to the beam component and adapted in use to make an electrical connection with a terminal of another electronic component. In one preferred embodiment, the post is formed directly on the electronic component rather than on a sacrificial substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Making Post Components</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 10A and 10B illustrate a technique for fabricating a plurality (two of many shown) of post components <b>1020</b> for microelectronic contact structures on a sacrificial substrate <b>1002</b>. In FIG. 10A, which is similar to FIG. 8A, a plurality of openings <b>1012</b> (compare <b>806</b>) are formed in a layer of masking material <b>1010</b> which is disposed on a surface of a sacrificial substrate <b>1002</b> (compare <b>802</b>). Preferably, a release mechanism <b>1004</b> is disposed between the sacrificial substrate <b>1002</b> and the masking layer <b>1010</b>. The release mechanism <b>1004</b> is any of the release mechanisms described hereinabove, such as the multiple layers <b>504</b>, <b>506</b> and <b>508</b> shown and described with respect to FIG. <b>5</b>A. However, the present invention is not limited to a particular release mechanism. As shown in FIG. 10B, the openings <b>1012</b> In the masking layer <b>1010</b> are filled, using any suitable process, with one or more layers of metallic material, such as one of the multilayer buildups for components of spring contact elements described hereinabove, resulting in a post components <b>1020</b> for spring contact elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Joining Post Components to Terminals</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a next step of the process, illustrated in FIG. 10C, the masking material <b>1010</b> is removed and a joining material such as solder paste <b>1024</b> or the like is applied to the exposed (top, as viewed) surfaces of the post components <b>1020</b>. Compare FIG. <b>5</b>B. The post components <b>1020</b>, resident on the sacrificial substrate <b>1002</b>, with or without the masking material <b>1010</b>, and preferably prior to applying the solder paste <b>1024</b>, constitute an interim product which may be warehoused for future use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a next step of the process, shown in FIG. 10D, the sacrificial substrate <b>1002</b> with post components <b>1020</b> resident thereon and prepared with solder paste <b>1024</b> is brought into contact with an electronic component <b>1030</b> which has a plurality (two of many shown) of terminals <b>1032</b> on a surface (top, as viewed) thereof. The layout of terminals <b>1032</b> on the electronic component <b>1030</b> ‘mirrors’ the layout of post components <b>1020</b> on the sacrificial substrate <b>1002</b>, and vice-versa. The terminals and corresponding post components are aligned. Then, by applying heat, the solder paste <b>1024</b> is reflowed so that the post components <b>1020</b> become joined to the terminals <b>1032</b> of the electronic component <b>1030</b>. With a suitable heat-release mechanism, such as has been described hereinabove, the sacrificial substrate <b>1002</b> will release the post components <b>1020</b> during the solder reflow heating step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Else, as described hereinabove, the sacrificial substrate <b>1002</b> can chemically be caused to release from the post components <b>1020</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The end result of the process is that a plurality of post components <b>1020</b> has been joined to a corresponding plurality of terminals <b>1032</b> on an electronic component, as illustrated in FIG. <b>10</b>E. Compare the joining of contact tip structures <b>520</b> and <b>920</b> to the interconnection element <b>552</b>, <b>932</b> of FIGS. 5D and 9C, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">These post components <b>1020</b> will serve as base portions (compare <b>122</b>, <b>202</b>, <b>302</b>) of spring contact elements (compare <b>120</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b>) and establish a standoff distance “d<b>2</b>” (compare FIGS. 2A and 3A) between the surface of the electronic component <b>1030</b> and a main body portion (compare <b>206</b>, <b>306</b>) of a resulting spring contact element in the manner described hereinabove with respect to FIGS. 2A and 3A.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this and the following examples of joining components of spring contact elements to terminals of electronic components and to one another, the descriptions proceed in terms of solder paste being the joining material and are illustrated prior to reflow as circles, and after reflow-in cross-hatch.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As an alternative to fabricating the post components on a sacrificial substrate, then joining them to terminals of an electronic component, the post components for the microelectronic contact structures of the present invention can be built up directly upon the terminals of the electronic components, by applying a suitable masking layer on the component, patterning the masking layer with openings, and depositing metallic material into the openings, as described hereinabove. See Figure A and the corresponding discussion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Also, it is within the scope of this invention that the post components can be joined to (or built-up upon) the electronic component at locations other than directly on terminals thereof. Such “remotely-located” post components may be associated with and electrically-connected to corresponding ones of the terminals by conductive traces upon the electronic component.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Making Beam Components</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 11A and 11B illustrate fabricating a plurality (two of many shown) of beam components <b>1120</b> for microelectronic contact structures on a sacrificial substrate <b>1102</b>. In FIG. 11A, which is similar to FIG. 10A, a plurality of openings <b>1112</b> (compare <b>1012</b>) are formed in a layer of masking material <b>1110</b> (compare <b>1010</b>) which is disposed on a surface of a sacrificial substrate <b>1102</b> (compare <b>1002</b>). Preferably, a release mechanism <b>1104</b> (compare <b>1004</b>) is disposed between the sacrificial substrate <b>1102</b> and the masking layer <b>1110</b>. The release mechanism <b>1104</b> preferably can be any of the release mechanisms described hereinabove.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For making a beam component <b>1120</b>, an opening <b>1112</b> may be elongate, having a one end <b>1112</b> <i>a </i>and an opposite end <b>1112</b> <i>b </i>which will correspond to the one end <b>1120</b> <i>a </i>and opposite end <b>1120</b> <i>b </i>of the beam component <b>1120</b> formed therein. As shown, the one end <b>1112</b> <i>a </i>is somewhat wider than the opposite end <b>112</b> <i>b </i>of the opening <b>1112</b> and, as will be seen, the one end <b>1120</b> <i>a </i>of the resulting beam component <b>1120</b> will likewise be wider than the opposite end <b>1120</b> <i>b </i>of the beam component <b>1120</b> formed therein, in a manner similar to that described hereinabove with respect to the middle portions <b>206</b> and <b>306</b> of the spring contact elements <b>200</b> and <b>300</b>, respectively. Note that other shapes suitable for making a beam, particularly a resilient beam, are known or within the skill in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in FIG. 11B, the openings <b>1112</b> in the masking layer <b>1110</b> are filled, using any suitable process, with one or more layers of metallic material, such as one of the multilayer buildups for components of spring contact elements described hereinabove, resulting in a plurality of beam components <b>1120</b> for spring contact elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Joining Beam Components to Post Components</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a next step of the process <b>1100</b>, shown in FIG. 11C, the masking material <b>1110</b> is removed and a joining material such as solder paste <b>1124</b> or the like is applied to a portion of the exposed (top, as viewed) surfaces of the beam components <b>1120</b>. Compare FIG. <b>5</b>B. The beam components <b>1120</b>, resident on the sacrificial substrate <b>1102</b>, with or without the masking material <b>1110</b>, and preferably prior to applying the solder paste <b>1124</b>, constitute an interim product which may be warehoused for future use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a next step of the process, shown in FIG. 11D, the sacrificial substrate <b>1102</b> with beam components <b>1120</b> resident thereon and prepared with solder paste <b>1124</b> is brought into contact with a top (as viewed) surface of the post components <b>1020</b> which previously were joined to the terminals <b>1032</b> of the electronic component <b>1030</b>. The layout of the one ends <b>1120</b> <i>a </i>of the beam components <b>1120</b> ‘mirrors’ the layout of the post components <b>1020</b> on the sacrificial substrate <b>1002</b>, and vice-versa. Then, by applying heat, the solder paste <b>1024</b> is reflowed so that the beam components <b>1120</b> are joined to the post components <b>1020</b>. With a suitable heat-release mechanism, such as has been described hereinabove, the sacrificial substrate <b>1102</b> will release the beam components <b>1020</b> during the solder reflow heating step. Else, as described hereinabove, the sacrificial substrate <b>1102</b> can chemically be caused to release from the beam components <b>1120</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The end result of the process <b>1100</b> is that a plurality of elongate cantilever-like beam components <b>1120</b> have been joined by one of their ends to a corresponding plurality of posts <b>1020</b> which extend from terminals <b>1032</b> of an electronic component <b>1030</b>, as illustrated in FIG. <b>11</b>E.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">These beam components <b>1120</b> are comparable to the main body portions <b>206</b> and <b>306</b> of the spring contact elements <b>200</b> and <b>300</b>, respectively, described hereinabove and are intended to provide the principal situs of flexure when a contact force is brought to bear upon the tip ends <b>1120</b> <i>b </i>of the beam components <b>1120</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Making Tip Components</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 12A-12C are comparable to FIGS. 8A-8C, and illustrate fabricating a plurality (two of many shown) of tip components <b>1220</b> on a sacrificial substrate <b>1102</b>. In FIG. 12A a plurality of openings <b>1212</b> (compare <b>806</b>) are formed in a layer of masking material <b>1210</b> (compare <b>804</b>) which is disposed on a surface of a sacrificial substrate <b>1202</b> (compare <b>802</b>). Preferably, a release mechanism is incorporated into the fabrication of the tip component <b>1220</b>, but may alternatively be one or more layers (compare <b>1004</b> and <b>1104</b>) between the sacrificial substrate and the masking layer. The release mechanism preferably may be any of the release mechanisms described hereinabove.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in FIG. 12B, in a first etch step, a pit <b>1208</b> (compare <b>808</b>) is etched into the sacrificial substrate <b>1202</b>. Taking advantages of the properties of silicon when it etches, a pit in the form of an inverted pyramid can be formed in this manner, by allowing the etching to proceed until it reaches a self-limiting point. Alternatively, as shown, the etching process can be stopped, resulting in the pit having the shape of an inverted truncated pyramid with a small flat apex. Also alternatively, there may be no pit <b>1208</b> at all to give, ultimately, a relatively flat tip component <b>1220</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The masking layer <b>1210</b> is then removed, and another masking layer <b>1214</b> (compare <b>814</b>) is applied over the sacrificial substrate <b>1202</b> and is patterned to have openings <b>1216</b> aligned with the pits <b>1208</b>. Then the openings. <b>1216</b> in the masking layer <b>1216</b> are filled, using any suitable process, with one or more layers of: metallic material, such as one of the multilayer buildups for components of spring contact elements described hereinabove (see, e.g., FIG. <b>8</b>C), resulting in a plurality of tip components <b>1220</b>, for spring contact elements, each tip component <b>1220</b> having a pointed tip feature <b>1230</b> (compare <b>830</b>) integrally formed therewith.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Joining Tip Components to Beam Components</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 12B and 12C, described hereinabove illustrate making one or a plurality of tip components <b>1220</b> on a sacrificial substrate <b>1202</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a next step of the process, illustrated in FIG. 12D, the masking material <b>1216</b> is removed and a joining material such as solder paste <b>1224</b> or the like is applied to the exposed (top, as viewed) surfaces of the tip components <b>1220</b>. Compare FIG. <b>5</b>B. The tip components <b>1220</b>, resident on the sacrificial substrate <b>1202</b>, with or without the masking material <b>1216</b>, and preferably prior to applying the solder paste <b>1224</b>, constitute an interim product which may be warehoused for future use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a next step of the process, shown in FIG. 12E, the sacrificial substrate <b>1202</b> with tip components <b>1220</b> resident thereon (two tip components <b>1220</b> are illustrated in this figure) and prepared with solder paste <b>1224</b> is brought into contact with corresponding top (as viewed) surfaces of the opposite ends <b>1120</b> <i>b </i>of the beam components <b>1120</b> which were previously joined by their one ends <b>1120</b> <i>a </i>to the post components <b>1020</b> which were joined to the terminals <b>1032</b> of the electronic component <b>1030</b>. The layout of the tip components <b>1220</b> ‘mirrors’ the layout of the opposite ends <b>1120</b> <i>b </i>of the beam components <b>1120</b>. The tip components <b>1220</b> and corresponding opposite ends <b>1120</b> <i>b </i>can be aligned and positioned as precisely as desired. These elements can be secured, if desired, before permanent joining. By applying heat, the solder paste <b>1224</b> is reflowed so that the tip components <b>1220</b> are joined to the beam components <b>1120</b>. With a suitable heat-release mechanism, such as has been described hereinabove, the sacrificial substrate <b>1202</b> will release the beam components <b>1220</b> during the solder reflow heating step. Else, as described hereinabove, the sacrificial substrate <b>1202</b> can chemically be caused to release from the tip components <b>1220</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The end result of the process <b>1200</b> is that a plurality of tip components <b>1220</b> have been joined to ends of beam components <b>1120</b> which were joined to post components <b>1020</b> extending from terminals <b>1032</b> of an electronic component <b>1030</b>, as illustrated in FIG. <b>12</b>F.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The end result of the three processes described with respect to FIGS. 10A-12F is that a plurality of microelectronic contact structures has been fabricated in separate pieces (components) which are joined to one another and to the terminals of an electronic component. In this manner, many of the limitations of the prior art processes for forming microelectronic contact structures are overcome. For example, the geometry and metallurgy of each of the post, beam and tip components <b>1020</b>, <b>1120</b> and <b>1220</b> can be controlled independently of the geometry and metallurgy of the other of the three components. Similarly, different manufacturing processes can be employed for each of the three components. Additional advantages accrue to this three-piece construction, making possible configurations of spring contact elements on electronic components that otherwise would not be practical using a one-piece construction of a spring contact element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The Joining Sequence</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">An example has been set forth hereinabove wherein:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(a) first, post components are joined to or built-up upon the electronic component, such as upon selected terminals of the electronic component;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(b) second, beam components are joined to post components; and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(c) third, tip components are joined to the beam components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to this exemplary sequence of events, one having ordinary skill in the art to which the invention most nearly pertains will readily appreciate that the material (e.g., solder paste) used for joining the beam component to the post component should preferably have a higher melting (reflow) temperature than that of the material (e.g., solder paste) used for joining the tip component to the beam component, so that joining the tip component to the beam component does not adversely impact the joint between the beam component and the post component. Moreover, in the case where the post component is first joined (e.g., soldered) to the terminal (or other location) of the electronic component, the material (e.g., solder paste) used for joining the post component to the terminal (e.g.) should preferably have an even higher elting (reflow) temperature than that of the material joining the beam component to the post component, so that joining the beam component to the post component does not adversely affect the joint between the post component and the electronic component. Solder and braze formulations having a wide range of reflow temperatures are readily available, from which appropriate, materials can be selected for each of the joints involved in assembling the microelectronic contact structure. In some cases, conductive adhesive formulations may also be appropriate for selected ones of the joints.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In a similar manner, one skilled in the art can select release mechanisms such as <b>1004</b> and <b>1104</b> that are compatible with reflow temperatures of the corresponding joining steps. It is within the scope of this invention that other sequences can be employed for joining components of a microelectronic contact structure to one another. For example, the beam components can first be joined to the tip components, then the sacrificial substrate supporting the beam components can be removed (without removing the sacrificial substrate supporting the tip components), then the beam components with tip components already joined thereto can be joined to the post components. This sequence affords the opportunity to utilize a very high melting temperature joining material to effect the joints between the beam components and the tip components, since the electronic component to which the microelectronic contact structures are ultimately joined preferably would not be subjected to the very high temperatures involved. In a similar manner the beam components can first be joined to the post components, then the sacrificial substrate supporting the post components can be removed (without removing the sacrificial substrate supporting the beam components), then the post components with beam components already joined thereto can be joined to the electronic component. This sequence affords the opportunity to utilize a very high melting temperature joining material to effect the joints between the post components and the beam components, since the electronic component to which the microelectronic contact structures are ultimately joined would not be subjected to the very high temperatures involved. Other variations of the joining sequences described hereinabove are within the scope of the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The Resulting Contact Structure</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">An exemplary microelectronic contact structure having a post component joined to a one end and a one surface of a beam component, and having a tip component joined to an opposite end and an opposite surface of the beam component has been described hereinabove.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is within the scope of this invention that the post component is joined at other than the one end of the beam component, and that the tip component is joined at other than the opposite end of the beam component. Generally, it is preferred that the tip component be joined at a position on the beam component which is offset from the post component, so that the portion of the beam component extending therebetween can function as a cantilever, and the resulting microelectronic contact structure can function as a spring contact element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is similarly within the scope of this invention that the post component is joined to the one surface of the beam component, and that the tip component is joined to the beam component at other than the opposite surface of the beam component. For example, in certain applications it may be desired to mount both of the post and tip components to the same surface of the beam component. Or, it may be desired to mount the tip component to a surface of the beam component which is adjacent, rather than opposite, the surface of the beam component to which the post component is joined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Overlapping Spring Contact Elements</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 13A and 13B illustrate mounting a plurality (two of many shown) of three-piece spring contact elements <b>1310</b> and <b>1312</b> to a corresponding plurality of terminals <b>1302</b> and <b>1304</b>, respectively, of an electronic component <b>1306</b> in a configuration <b>1300</b> wherein the beam components <b>1330</b> and <b>1332</b>, respectively, of the spring contact elements <b>1310</b> and <b>1312</b> are overlapping (e.g., have common coordinate, but different z-axis coordinates).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The terminals <b>1302</b> and <b>1304</b> are spaced a distance “P<b>1</b>” apart on the surface (top, as viewed) of the electronic component <b>1306</b>. The two terminals <b>1302</b> and <b>1304</b> need not be adjacent terminals, but for adjacent terminals, this would be their “pitch”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In order that the beam component <b>1330</b> of the one spring contact element <b>1310</b> may overlap or cross-over the beam component <b>1332</b> of the other spring contact element <b>1312</b>, it should be elevated (spaced) higher above the surface (top, as viewed) of the electronic component <b>1306</b> than the beam component <b>1332</b> of the other spring contact element <b>1312</b>. To this end, the post component to which the beam component <b>1330</b> is joined should be taller, overall, than the post component to which the beam component <b>1332</b> is joined. For contacting terminals of another electronic component (not shown) which are coplanar, the tip components <b>1340</b> and <b>1342</b> of the spring contact elements <b>1310</b> and <b>1312</b>, respectively, should also be coplanar, including any tip features projecting from the tip-components. Given that the beam component <b>1332</b> is disposed closer to the surface (top, as viewed) of the electronic component <b>1306</b>, the tip component <b>1342</b> must be taller, overall, than the tip component <b>1330</b>. These objects may be achieved in the following manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The overall post component of the spring contact element <b>1310</b> is fabricated as a post component <b>1320</b> joined (in the manner described hereinabove) to the terminal <b>1302</b>, and a spacer component <b>1350</b> joined (in the manner described hereinabove) to the top (as viewed) surface of the post component <b>1320</b>. Alternatively, the spacer component <b>1350</b> could be joined to the terminal <b>1302</b> and the post component <b>1320</b> could be joined to the spacer component <b>1350</b>. Alternatively, the post component <b>1320</b> and the spacer component <b>1350</b> could be formed as an integral unitary structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A one end of the beam component <b>1330</b> is joined to the top (as viewed) surface of the spacer component <b>1350</b>. The tip component <b>1340</b> of the spring contact element <b>1310</b> is joined to the opposite end of the beam component <b>1330</b>, in the manner described hereinabove.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The overall tip component of the spring contact element <b>1312</b> is fabricated as a tip component <b>1342</b> joined (in the manner described hereinabove) to a spacer component <b>1352</b> joined (in the manner described hereinabove) to the opposite (right, as viewed) end of the beam component <b>1332</b>. Alternatively, the tip component <b>1342</b> and the spacer component <b>1352</b> could be formed as an integral unitary structure. A one (left, as viewed) end of the beam component <b>1332</b> is joined to the top (as viewed) surface of the post component <b>1322</b>, in the manner described hereinabove.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">These same principles can be extended to a four-layer structure, where each of two structures similar to those shown in FIG. 13A have a post component and a tip component as shown. However, spacer component <b>1350</b> is made of two components. A first spacer component is approximately the thickness of beam component <b>1312</b> and preferably is formed in the same sacrificial substrate together with beam component <b>1312</b> and attached to the corresponding post component in the same sequence as beam component <b>1312</b> is attached to its corresponding post component. Similarly, spacer component <b>1352</b> is made of two components, a first component being made together with beam component <b>1310</b>, each attached to a corresponding structure in the same way. A new group of spacer components are fabricated on a separate sacrificial substrate using the general methods described for making other components. Using attaching techniques as taught above, each spacer component is attached to a corresponding structure in sequence to form the second portion (“top” as shown) of a spacer component such as <b>1350</b> and a first portion (“bottom” as shown) of, another spacer component such as <b>1352</b>. Such a spacer should be sufficiently thick to provide a desired offset between overlapping beam components. This can be comparable in thickness to the thickness of a beam component, but can be larger or smaller as selected by design.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As illustrated, the beam components <b>1330</b> and <b>1332</b> both extend in the y-axis, at the same x-axis coordinates. (In other words, the beam component <b>1330</b> is positioned directly over the beam component <b>1332</b>, as contrasted with simply crossing over it.) If the two beam components <b>1330</b> and <b>1332</b> were the same length (as measured between their two ends), the tip components <b>1340</b> and <b>1342</b> would be spaced the same distance apart (“P<b>2</b>”) as the terminals <b>1302</b> and <b>1304</b>. However, as illustrated, the beam component <b>1332</b> is shorter (in the y-axis) than the beam component <b>1330</b>. In this manner, the tip components <b>1340</b> and <b>1342</b> are space a distance “P<b>2</b>” apart which can be less than the distance “P<b>1</b>” (P<b>2</b>&lt;P<b>1</b>). This effects a degree of space transformation (pitch spreading) with the spring contact elements themselves. For example, the electronic component <b>1306</b> can be the space transformer component of a probe card assembly, having terminals disposed at a one pitch (spacing from one another), and the tip components can be spaced at a second finer pitch.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The example of spacing the tip components at a finer pitch than the post components (e.g., than of the terminals of the electronic component) is but one example of many and various space translations that can be implemented by having the beam components of selected ones of a plurality of microelectronic contact structures crossing over or disposed above the beam components of selected other ones of the plurality microelectronic contact structures which are mounted to an electronic component.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the manner described hereinabove, various interconnection schemes can be implemented, which would otherwise not be feasible with the one piece spring contact elements (e.g., <b>120</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>250</b>, <b>300</b>) described hereinabove.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Although the invention has been illustrated and described in detail in the drawings and foregoing description, the same is to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive in character it being understood that only preferred embodiments have been shown and described, and that all changes and modifications that come within the spirit of the invention are desired to be protected. Undoubtedly, many other “variations” on the “themes” set forth hereinabove will occur to one having ordinary skill in the art to which the present invention most nearly pertains, and such variations are intended to be within the scope of the invention, as disclosed herein.</div>
