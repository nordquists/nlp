<div class="description-paragraph">This is a divisional of parent application Ser. No. 09/904,591, filed Jul. 16, 2001 now U.S. Pat. No. 6,403,413, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</div>
<heading>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates to a manufacturing method of a semiconductor integrated circuit device and a technique of the semiconductor integrated circuit device, and more particularly, to a technique effectively applied to an exposure technique in a manufacturing process of a semiconductor integrated circuit device.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">As a pattern of a wiring or element constituting a semiconductor integrated circuit device becomes finer and higher integrated, high precision for superposition between patterns is required for exposure treatment for transferring the pattern on a semiconductor substrate. This superposing precision largely depends on a superposition precision (performance) of pattern that an exposure apparatus deals with. Therefore, it is common to lay out the pattern in a state in which an alignment tolerance determined by the superposition performance of the exposure apparatus is secured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, as another technique for securing the alignment tolerance of the above-mentioned pattern, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 10-284700 discloses a technique for deforming a shape of a pattern such that a dimension thereof in a side which requires higher superposing precision becomes smaller. Further, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 5-19446 discloses a technique of a phase shift mask, in which, in order to expose various and fine patterns, a predetermined correcting pattern is provided on either an end of a mask pattern region having a constant mode or a boundary portion of a mask pattern region having a plurality of modes.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">However, the present inventors have found that the superposing technique of the above-mentioned pattern has the following problems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">That is, in the technique for deforming the shape of the above-mentioned pattern and reducing the dimension thereof, it is possible to form a pattern in such a state that an alignment tolerance is secured in the case where there is a margin of resolution, but as the pattern dimension approaches resolution limit value of the exposure apparatus, the formation control performance of this pattern and the margin for forming the pattern are remarkably reduced. Therefore, even if the alignment tolerance of the pattern can be secured, the pattern itself can not be formed satisfactorily in some cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">An object of the present invention is to provide a technique capable of enhancing the alignment tolerance of a pattern.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The above and other object and new features of the present invention will be apparent from the description of the specification and the accompanying drawings.</div>

<heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">1. Ultraviolet light: In a semiconductor field, ultraviolet light means electromagnetic wave having wavelength of about 400 nm to short wavelength of about 50 nm. A region having long wavelength longer than 300 nm is called near-ultraviolet region, and a region having a short wavelength of 300 nm or less is called far-ultraviolet region, and a region having wavelength of 200 nm or less is particularly called vacuum-ultraviolet region. Examples of light source are i line (wavelength: 365 nm) such as mercury arc lamp or the like, KrF excimer laser (wavelength: 248 nm), ArF (wavelength: 193 nm) excimer laser, and F<sub>2 </sub>(wavelength: 157 nm) excimer laser.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">2. Scanning exposure: Scanning exposure is an exposure method of transferring a circuit pattern on a photomask, to a desired portion on a semiconductor wafer, by moving (scanning) relatively and continuously a thin slit-like exposure band in a vertical direction relative to a longitudinal direction of slits (or may move diagonally), against a semiconductor wafer and a photomask (or reticle, and description of the photomask used in the present application means a broad notion including the reticle.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">3. Step and scan exposure: This is a method of exposing the entire portion to be exposed on a wafer, by combining the scanning exposure as mentioned above and stepping exposure, and corresponds to an inferior notion of the scanning exposure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">4. Photomask (optical mask): This is a mask having light shielding patterns or light phase changing patterns formed on a substrate. The term “on substrate” includes an upper surface of the substrate and an inner or above region close to the upper surface of the substrate (or may be disposed on another substrate close to the upper surface). The term “normal photomask” (binary mask) means a general photomask having a mask pattern formed by light shielding patterns and light transfer pattern s on the substrate. The photomask is simply called a mask hereinafter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">5. Substrate trench shifter: This is a phase shifter forming recesses in a surface of a transparent mask substrate itself such as quartz. The term “surface of the substrate itself” includes something forming a film similar to material of a substrate, on a surface of the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">6. On-substrate thin film trench shifter: This is a thin shifter forming a shifter film having a thickness suitable for the purpose of functioning as a shifter, under a light shielding film of the substrate, and then being formed by utilizing or the like difference in etching speed of a backing substrate or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">7. Trench shifter: This is a superior notion containing the above-mentioned substrate trench shifter and on-substrate thin film trench shifter and the like, and is a general shifter forming recesses in a transparent film, a transparent substrate or the like that is at a layer lower than a light shield film. On the other hand, a system of arrangement of a shifter film on a light shielding film is called on-arrangement system of a shifter film or on-arrangement shifter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">8. A fine visor type trench shifter: This corresponds to a case of 40% or less (P/λ=40% is called “visor length”) of a length P of a overhang-shaped (or visor-shaped) projecting portion that a light shielding film has from an upper end of a side wall of a recess which a quartz substrate or the like has, to an inner side of the recess around the trench shifter (in a cross-sectional direction of a narrow wideness) if a wavelength λ of a monochromatic exposure light is set to a reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">9. Shifter depth: Depth of digging in a substrate of a shifter portion depends on exposure wavelength. A depth Z for inverting a phase by 180 degrees thereof is expressed as Z=λ/(2(n−1)), where n represents index of refraction of a substrate, relative to exposure light having a predetermined exposure wavelength, and λ represents the exposure wavelength.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">10. Phase shifter (phase shift mask pattern): This is a circuit pattern on a mask, which includes a mask aperture pattern having at least one phase shifter. The phase shifter is, for example, a group of circuit patterns provided on the mask, which correspond to a single shot region (an area to be exposed by one step) of a stepping exposure or a region exposed by a single scanning of the scanning exposure, and means, for example, an unit chip provided on the semiconductor wafer or a mask pattern (a circuit pattern) corresponding to integer times thereof on the mask substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">11. Auxiliary light transfer pattern (auxiliary mask pattern): This means, when generally projected onto a semiconductor wafer, an aperture pattern provided on a mask which does not form an independent image corresponding to the aperture pattern thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">12. Levenson type phase shift mask: This is also called a space frequency modulating type phase shift mask. This is a phase shift mask, which is generally isolated in a light shield region by a light shield film and is provided with a plurality of apertures close to each other and comprises an aperture group whose phases are alternately reversed. If roughly classified, this mask can be classified into a line-and-space pattern, and an alternately reversed hole pattern (also called a Levenson pattern for contact hole).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">13. Halftone type phase shift mask: This is a kind of phase shift mask having a halftone film which is used as both a shifter and which has a transmittance between 1% and 40%, and a halftone shifter whose phase shift amounts invert a phase of light in comparison with portions having no halftone film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">14. Auxiliary pattern arrangement type phase shift mask: If roughly classified, this can be classified into an independent line pattern and an aperture pattern. Typical examples of the former are a real aperture pattern and auxiliary shift patterns (this phase-reversed pattern is also an equivalence) provided on both sides thereof. A typical example of the latter is an outrigger type hole pattern (comprising a real aperture provided at center thereof and a plurality of auxiliary apertures provided around the real aperture). However, since an end or a periphery of the mask pattern of the Levenson type phase shift mask is provided with the auxiliary apertures and the auxiliary shifter, both patterns are mixed to be actually a mixed pattern in many cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">15. Phase shift mask: A phase shift mask simply described in the present application means these masks.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">16. Semiconductor wafer (described simply as wafer hereinafter) or a semiconductor substrate includes a silicon single crystal-substrate, a sapphire substrate, a glass substrate, other insulation or non-insulation or semiconductor substrate and the like, and a compound substrate thereof.

<div class="description-paragraph">17. The term “light shielding region, light shielding pattern, light shielding film or light shield” means to have optical characteristics of permeation less than 40% of exposure light radiated on regions thereof. Generally, one having the optical characteristics of permeation less than 30% of exposure light from some % is used. On the other hand, the term “light permeating region”, “light transfer pattern”, “transparent region”, “transparent film” or “transparent” means to have optical characteristics of permeation more than 60% of exposure light radiating on regions thereof. Generally, one having the optical characteristics of permeation more than 90% of exposure light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">18. A photoresist pattern is a film pattern obtained by subjecting a light-sensitive organic film to patterning by a technique of photolithography. This pattern includes a simple resist film having no aperture on the corresponding portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">19. Normal illumination means non-modified illumination, and illumination having relatively uniform light intensity distribution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">20. Modified illumination means illumination that reduces intensity thereof at center thereof, and includes oblique illumination, band illumination, multiple illumination such as quadplex illumination or quintuple illumination or the like, and super resolution technique using pupil filter that is equivalence thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">21. Resolution: A pattern size can be expressed by standardizing numerical aperture NA of a projection lens and exposure wavelength λ. The present embodiments mainly use KrF excimer laser of exposure wavelength of 248 nm, and the projection lens NA of 0.68. Therefore, in the case of use of different wavelength and different lens NA, the resolution R is expressed as R=K1λ/NA (K1 is a certain constant determined as depending upon process), so that the resolution may be converted and used. However, a focus depth D is also expressed as D=K2·λ/(NA)<sup>2 </sup>(K2 is a certain constant determined as depending upon process), so that the depth is also different therefrom.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Embodiments will be described by dividing a plurality of sections or sub groups if necessary for the sake of expediency, but, except for a case of being particularly specified, relationship between the plurality of sections or sub groups has nothing to do with one another but one of them has something to do with modified, detailed or supplemented explanations, or the like of a part-or-all parts of the other.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">Embodiment 1</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the embodiment 1, one example, in which the present invention is applied to a manufacturing process of large-scale semiconductor integrated circuit elements in 1 G (giga) bit DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) class having minimum design size of about 130 nm, will be explained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">First, one example of a manufacturing method of the DRAM will be explained. Here, a structure thereof in the manufacturing process of the DRAM will be mainly explained, and an exposure technique (including a structure of the above-mentioned mask) for forming the structure will be explained hereinafter. The explanation will be made such that a right and left horizontal direction is defined as an X direction and an up and down direction is defined as a Y direction in plan views used here. An imaginary axis extending in the X direction is defined as an X axis, and an imaginary axis extending in the Y direction is defined as a Y axis. As a memory cell pattern, a pattern layout of one intersecting point memory cell type (or open bit line type) is illustrated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 1 is a plan view of an essential portion of a memory array in the manufacturing process of the DRAM. FIGS. 2 to <b>4</b> are cross-sectional views taken along lines A—A, B—B and C—C of FIG. 1, respectively. A semiconductor substrate (simply called substrate hereinafter) <b>1</b> constituting a wafer <b>1</b>W comprises a p-type single crystal silicon. In a separating region of a main surface of the substrate <b>1</b>, for example, a separating portion (a trench isolation) <b>2</b> of a groove type is formed. The separating portion <b>2</b> is formed by embedding an insulative film into a trench dug in the substrate <b>1</b>. In the substrate <b>1</b>, a plurality of active regions L are formed by the separating portion <b>2</b>. As shown in FIG. 1, a periphery of each active region L is formed like a flat-surface-island-shaped pattern extending thin and long in a diagonal direction relative to left-right and upper-lower (horizontal and vertical: XY) directions of FIG. <b>1</b>. In each active region L, for example, two memory sell selecting MISFETs are formed such that one of respective sources and drains thereof is used commonly with the other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">An arrangement pitch (a pitch: a distance between centers of objective patterns) Dy<b>1</b> extending in the Y direction of each active region L is about 420 nm (converted to wafer size), for example. An arrangement pitch Dx<b>1</b> between the active regions L extending in the X direction is about 520 nm (converted to wafer size), for example. A dimension Dx<b>2</b> in which each active region L is shifted in the X direction per row of the Y direction is about 260 nm (converted to wafer size), for example. An arrangement pitch D<b>1</b> between the active regions L extending in a short direction (a wide direction: a direction perpendicular to a longitudinal direction) is about 250 nm (converted to wafer size), for example. An arrangement interval (an interval: a distance between one end of objective pattern and the other end of pattern adjacent to the objective pattern) D<b>2</b> of the active regions L extending in the longitudinal direction is about 160 to 180 nm (converted to wafer size), for example. A pitch between the adjacent patterns of the respective active regions L extending in the longitudinal direction has, for example, a value of about 252 nm (converted to wafer size). A dimension of each active region L extending in the longitudinal direction has, for example, a value of about 126 nm (converted to wafer size).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A forming method of the above-mentioned separating portion <b>2</b> of a trench type is as follows, for example. First, a photoresist pattern for forming the active region is formed on a main surface of the substrate <b>1</b>. This photoresist pattern is formed such that forming regions of the active regions L are covered and other region except for the forming regions is exposed. This photoresist pattern will be explained in detail hereinafter. Next, by using the photoresist pattern as an etching mask to perform etching treatment of the substrate <b>1</b>, a portion of the substrate <b>1</b> exposed from the photoresist pattern is removed by etching. This results in formation of trenches (transfer patterns), for example, having a depth of about 300 to 400 nm in the substrate <b>1</b>. Then, on the substrate <b>1</b> including each inside of the trenches, for example, insulative films <b>2</b> <i>a </i>formed of a silicon oxide film are deposited to a thickness of about 600 nm by using a CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) method. Each insulative film <b>2</b> <i>a </i>is formed in such a manner that, for example, oxygen (or ozon) and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) are deposited by a plasma CVD method using source gas, and then dry oxidization of about 1000° C. is performed to densify each film. Thereafter, each insulative film <b>2</b> <i>a </i>is polished by a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) method. At this time, a surface of each insulative film <b>2</b> <i>a </i>deposited in each trench is flattened such that height thereof becomes substantially the same as that of each surface of the active regions L. The trench-shaped separating portion <b>2</b> is formed in this manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Then, boric acid (B) is ion-implanted into the substrate <b>1</b> to form a p-type well <b>3</b>, and then a surface of the p-type well <b>3</b> is cleaned with cleaning liquid of hydrogen fluoride (HF) system. Thereafter, the substrate <b>1</b> is thermally oxidized to form a clean gate insulative film <b>4</b> of a silicon oxide system on each surface of the active regions L of the p-type well <b>3</b>. A thickness of the gate insulative film <b>4</b> is, for example, about 6 nm according to conversion to silicon dioxide film thickness. The gate insulative film <b>4</b> may be a silicon-nitride-system insulative film or a metal-oxide-system insulative film (tantalum oxide film, titanium oxide film or the like) having higher permittivity than a silicon-oxide-system insulative film. These insulative films are formed by making a film grow on the substrate <b>1</b> by the CVD method or a sputtering method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Subsequent steps are shown in FIGS. 5 to <b>7</b>. FIG. 5 is a plan view of the same essential portion as FIG. 1 in the manufacturing process of the DRAM. FIGS. 6 and 7 are cross-sectional views taken along lines A—A and B—B of FIG. 5, respectively. In this step, a plurality of word lines WL (gate electrodes <b>5</b>) are formed on the main surface of the substrate <b>1</b>. That is, on the main surface of the substrate <b>1</b>, for example, an n-type polycrystalline silicon film (having film thickness of about 70 nm) doped with phosphorus (P) or the like, a barrier metal film (having film thickness of about 5 to 10 nm) formed of tungsten nitride (WN) or titanium nitride (TiN), a tungsten (W) film (having film thickness of about 100 nm), and a gap insulative film <b>6</b> (having film thickness of about 150 nm) are deposited in this order. Then, by using as a mask photoresist patterns for forming word lines to perform dry etching of these films, the word lines WL (gate electrodes <b>5</b>) are formed. The polycrystalline silicon film and the cap insulative film <b>6</b> are deposited by the CVD method, and the barrier metal film and the W film are deposited by the sputtering method. The cap insulative film <b>6</b>, for example, comprises a silicon nitride film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in FIG. 5, the word lines WL are formed like flat-surface band-shaped patterns extending along the Y direction of FIG. 5, and are arranged to extend along the X direction of FIG. <b>5</b> and have a predetermined interval between the adjacent to word lines parallel to one each. These word lines WL and the above-mentioned active regions L are arranged to intersect diagonally at each other. Flat-surface superposing portions between the word lines WL and the active regions L become the gate electrodes <b>5</b> of the memory cell selecting MISFETs. And, a region on which each word line WL is superposed in each active region L becomes a memory sell selecting MISFET channel region. As described above, since two memory cell selecting MISFETs are disposed in each active region L, two word lines WL are superposed on each active region L in two dimensions. And, in the DRAM of this structure, the arrangement interval D<b>2</b> extending in the longitudinal direction of each active region L only has only a dimension enough to dispose only one word line WL. A line width of each word line WL has a line width necessary for obtaining a threshold voltage of the memory sell selecting MISFET, and has, for example, a value of about 100 nm (converted to wafer size) in the present embodiment. Further, a pitch between the adjacent word lines WL has, for example, a value of about 60 nm (converted to wafer size).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Subsequent steps are shown in FIGS. 8 to <b>10</b>. FIGS. 8 to <b>10</b> are cross-sectional views taken along lines A—A, B—B and C—C of FIG. 1, respectively. In this step, arsenic (As) or phosphorus (P) is ion-implanted into p-type wells <b>3</b> to form n-type semiconductor regions <b>7</b> (source and drain) in each of the p-type wells <b>3</b> on both sides of the gate electrodes <b>5</b>. By these steps, the memory cell selecting MISFETQs are substantially completed. Then, an insulative film <b>8</b> formed of silicon nitride or the like is deposited on the substrate <b>1</b> to a thickness of about 50 nm by using the CVD method. The insulative film <b>8</b> is thinly coated on the surface of each word line WL without being buried between the adjacent word lines WL.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Subsequent steps are shown in FIGS. 11 to <b>14</b>. FIGS. 11 to <b>14</b> are cross-sectional views taken along lines A—A, B—B and C—C of FIG. 1, respectively. In this step, after insulative film <b>9</b> is deposited in the substrate <b>1</b>, substantially flat-surface-circle-shaped contact holes (first hole patterns) <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and contact holes (second hole patterns) <b>10</b> <i>b </i>are formed in the insulative films <b>9</b> such that each n-type semiconductor region <b>7</b> is exposed from a bottom surface. That is, firstly, the insulative films <b>9</b> formed of silicon nitride or the like are deposited on the substrate <b>1</b> to a thickness of about 600 nm by using the CVD method, and then a surface of each insulative film <b>9</b> is flattened by the chemical mechanical polishing method or the like. Then, a photoresist pattern for forming each contact hole is formed on each insulative film <b>9</b>. This photoresist pattern is a pattern such that contact hole forming regions are exposed and a region other than the contact hole forming regions is covered. This photoresist pattern will be explained in detail later. Thereafter, by using the photoresist pattern as an etching mask and performing dry etching, portions of the insulative films <b>9</b> and <b>8</b> exposed from the photoresist pattern are removed by etching. This results in formation of the contact holes <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and <b>10</b> <i>b </i>such that each n-type semiconductor region <b>7</b> (source and drain) of the memory cell selecting MISFETQs is exposed from the bottom surface. This etching treatment is performed under the condition that the etching of each insulative film <b>9</b> formed of silicon oxide or the like is great in etching selection ratio to the silicon nitride film and the etching of each insulative film <b>8</b> formed of the silicon nitride is great in etching selection ratio to the silicon or silicon oxide film. By this, the contact holes <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and <b>10</b> <i>b </i>can be formed as self-aligns relative to the gate electrodes <b>5</b> (word lines WL).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Among the contact holes <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and <b>10</b> <i>b</i>, each contact hole <b>10</b> <i>a </i>disposed at a center of each active region L is a hole pattern (a transfer pattern) for electrically connecting each n-type semiconductor region <b>7</b> and each data line. And, each contact hole <b>10</b> <i>b </i>disposed on both sides of each active region L is a hole pattern (a transfer pattern) for electrically connecting each n-type semiconductor region <b>7</b> and each lower electrode (a storage electrode) of an information storage capacity element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The contact holes <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and <b>10</b> <i>b </i>are, for example, densely disposed like a honeycomb. Each diameter of the contact holes <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and <b>10</b> <i>b </i>has, for example, a value of about 240 nm (converted to wafer size). And, an arrangement pitch Dy<b>2</b> between the contact holes <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and <b>10</b> <i>b </i>in the Y direction is about 280 nm (converted to wafer size), for example. A dimension Dy<b>3</b> in which the respective contact holes <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and <b>10</b> <i>b </i>are shifted in the Y direction per row of the X direction is about 140 nm (converted to wafer size), for example. An arrangement pitch Dx<b>3</b> between the contact holes <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and <b>10</b> <i>b </i>extending in the X direction is about 260 nm (converted to wafer size), for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">And, an arrangement pitch Dy<b>4</b> between the contact holes <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and <b>10</b> <i>b </i>extending in the Y direction is about 420 nm (converted to wafer size), for example. An arrangement pitch Dx<b>4</b> between the contact holes <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and <b>10</b> <i>b </i>extending in the X direction is about 520 nm (converted to wafer size), for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">And, an arrangement pitch Dy<b>5</b> between the contact holes <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and <b>10</b> <i>b </i>extending in the Y direction is about 280 nm (converted to wafer size), for example. An arrangement pitch Dy<b>6</b> between the contact holes <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and <b>10</b> <i>b </i>extending in the Y direction is about 420 nm (converted to wafer size), for example. Further, an arrangement pitch Dx<b>5</b> between the contact holes <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and <b>10</b> <i>b </i>extending in the X direction is about 520 nm (converted to wafer size), for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A subsequent step is shown in FIGS. 15 and 16. FIGS. 15 and 16 are cross-sectional views corresponding to sectional portions taken along lines A—A and B—B of FIG. 1, respectively. In this step, as shown in FIGS. 15 and 16, plugs <b>11</b> <i>a </i>and <b>11</b> <i>b </i>are formed inside the respective contact holes <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and <b>10</b> <i>b</i>. To form the plugs <b>11</b> <i>a </i>and <b>11</b> <i>b</i>, an n-type polycrystal-line silicon film doped with phosphorus (P) is deposited on each insulative film <b>9</b>, and thereby this n-type polycrystalline silicon film is embedded inside the contact holes <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and <b>10</b> <i>b</i>, and thereafter the n-type polycrystalline silicon film deposited on outer sides of the contact holes <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and <b>10</b> <i>b </i>is removed by a chemical mechanical polishing method or an etching back method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A subsequent step is shown in FIGS. 17 to <b>20</b>. FIG. 17 is a plane view of the same essential portion as that of FIG. 1, and FIGS. 18 to <b>20</b> are cross-sectional views taken along lines A—A, B—B and C—C of FIG. 17, respectively. In this step, after an insulative film <b>12</b> is deposited on the substrate <b>1</b>, through holes <b>13</b> like a substantially flat-surface circle are formed in the insulative film <b>12</b> such that a portion of the plug <b>11</b> <i>a </i>is exposed from the bottom thereof. That is, firstly, the insulative film <b>12</b>, for example, formed of silicon oxide or the like is deposited on the substrate <b>1</b> (upper surfaces of the insulative film <b>9</b> and the plugs <b>11</b> <i>a </i>and <b>11</b> <i>b</i>) by the CVD method or the like to a thickness of about 50 nm. Then, a photoresist pattern for forming through holes for the data line is formed on the insulative film <b>12</b>. This photoresist pattern is a pattern such that a through hole forming region for connecting the data line and each plug <b>11</b> <i>a </i>is exposed, and a region other than the through hole forming region is covered. Then, as shown in FIGS. 17, <b>19</b> and <b>20</b>, by using the photoresist pattern as the etching mask and removing a portion of the insulative film <b>12</b> exposed therefrom by etching, the through holes <b>13</b> are formed. A plane arrangement pitch between the through holes <b>13</b> is relatively wider than a plane arrangement pitch between each contact holes <b>10</b> and each contact hole <b>10</b> <i>b</i>. Therefore, the photoresist pattern for forming each through hole <b>13</b> can be formed by a halftone type phase shift mask under the exposure condition of coherence (δ)=0.3 (or a normal exposure condition in a phase shift method) in which interference of the illumination is high. Each diameter of the through holes <b>13</b> has, for example, a value of about 200 nm (converted to wafer size).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A subsequent step is shown in FIGS. 21 to <b>24</b>. FIG. 21 is a plane view of the same essential portion as that of FIG. 1, and FIGS. 22 to <b>24</b> are cross-sectional views taken along lines A—A, B—B and C—C of FIG. 21, respectively. In this step, after a plug <b>14</b> is formed in each through hole <b>13</b>, a data line DL to be connected to each plug <b>14</b> is formed. First, to form each plug <b>14</b>, a barrier metal film formed of a laminated film of titanium (Ti) film and titanium nitride (TiN) film is deposited on the insulative film <b>12</b> by the sputtering method. Then, tungsten (W) film is deposited on the barrier metal film by the CVD method, and thereby these films inside each through hole <b>13</b> are embedded. Thereafter, these films deposited on the outer side of each through hole <b>13</b> are removed by the chemical mechanical polishing method. Then, to form the data lines DL, a titanium (TiN) film (having a film thickness of about 10 nm) is deposited on the insulative film <b>12</b> by the sputtering method. Then, tungsten (W) film (film thickness is about 50 nm) is deposited on the titanium nitride (TiN) film by the CVD method. Thereafter, these films are dry-etched by using the photoresist pattern as a mask.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Each data line DL is electrically connected to one of a n-type semiconductor region <b>7</b>, the one of which is for source/drain of the memory cell selecting MISQs through a plug <b>14</b> and a layer plug <b>11</b> <i>a </i>disposed thereunder. Each line width of the data lines DL has, for example, a value of about 80 nm (converted on wafer). Each distance between the adjacent data lines DL has, for example, a value of about 430 nm (converted to wafer size).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A subsequent step is shown in FIGS. 25 to <b>28</b>. FIG. 25 is a plane view of the same essential portion as that of FIG. 1, and FIGS. 26 to <b>28</b> are cross-sectional views taken along lines A—A, B—B and C—C of FIG. 25, respectively. In this step, after an insulative film <b>15</b> and an insulative film <b>16</b> are deposited on the substrate <b>1</b>, each through hole (a second hole pattern) <b>17</b> like a substantially flat-surface circle is formed on the insulative films <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> and the insulative film <b>12</b> such that a portion of each plug <b>11</b> <i>b </i>is exposed from the bottom thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">That is, first, each insulative film <b>15</b> formed of silicon oxide or the like, for example, is deposited on the substrate <b>1</b> (an upper surface of each insulative film <b>12</b> and a surface of each data line DL) by the CVD method or the like to a thickness of about 300 nm. Then, after the insulative film <b>16</b> formed of silicon nitride is, for example, deposited on the insulative film <b>15</b> to a film thickness of about 50 nm by the CVD method or the like. Then, for example, polycrystalline film is deposited on the insulative film <b>16</b> by the CVD method. Thereafter, after each photoresist pattern is formed on the polycrystalline silicon film in order to form though holes for the information storage capacity element, each hard mask <b>18</b> is formed by using each photoresist pattern as an etching mask and forming holes in the though hole formation region of the polycrystalline silicon film. Each photoresist pattern is a pattern such that the through hole formation region for connecting each plug <b>11</b> <i>b </i>and a lower electrode of the information storage capacity element is exposed and a region other than the through hole formation region is covered. A plane arrangement pitch between the through holes in this case is relatively wider than a plane arrangement pitch between each contact hole <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and each contact hole <b>10</b> <i>b</i>. Therefore, the photoresist pattern can be formed under the normal exposure condition by the phase shift method using the Levenson type phase shift mask. After each hard mask <b>18</b> is formed, a polycrystalline silicon film is further deposited on the substrate <b>1</b> by the CVD method or the like. By etching back this by an anisotropic dry etching method or the like, side walls <b>18</b> <i>a </i>are formed on an inner surface of a hole of each hard mask <b>18</b>. Then, as shown in FIGS. 25, <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, by using each hard mask <b>18</b> and each side wall <b>18</b> <i>a </i>as a etching mask and removing portions of the insulative films <b>16</b>, <b>15</b> and <b>12</b> exposed therefrom by the etching, the through holes <b>17</b> are formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Each through hole <b>17</b> is formed such that its diameter is smaller than that of each lower contact hole <b>10</b> <i>b</i>. Further, each through hole <b>17</b> is offset in such a direction that a center thereof is separated from each data line DL further than a center of each contact hole <b>10</b> <i>b</i>. By making the diameter of each through hole <b>17</b> smaller than that of each lower contact hole <b>10</b> <i>b </i>and by offsetting each through hole <b>17</b> in such a direction that the center of each through hole <b>17</b> is separated from each data line DL, even if the memory cell size is reduced, it is possible to prevent shortcircuit between each through hole <b>17</b> (plug embedded therein) and each data line DL without using a self-align contact (SAC) technique. Even if each diameter of through holes <b>17</b> is made smaller than that of the contact holes <b>10</b> <i>b </i>disposed thereunder or one of centers of both the holes is deviated from the other, it is possible to sufficiently secure a contact area between both of the holes. Each through holes <b>17</b> is not necessarily formed on each lower plug <b>11</b> <i>b </i>as a whole, and may preferably be formed such that at least one portion thereof is connected to each lower plug <b>11</b> <i>b</i>. That is, this permits having a structure of a so-called gap. Each diameter of the through holes <b>17</b> is, for example, a value of about 170 nm (converted to wafer size).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A distance between each end of the through holes <b>17</b> and each end of the bit lines DL, which is close to and face each end of the through holes <b>17</b> is, for example, about 40 nm (converted to wafer size).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A subsequent step is shown in FIGS. 29 to <b>31</b>. FIGS. 29 to <b>31</b> are cross-sectional views showing portions corresponding to sectional portions taken along lines-A—A; B—B and C—C of FIG. 1, respectively. In this step, after each hard mask <b>18</b> and each side wall <b>18</b> <i>a </i>are removed by the dry etching, a plug <b>19</b> is formed in each through hole <b>17</b>, and further a barrier metal film <b>20</b> is formed on a surface of each plug <b>19</b>. To form each plug <b>19</b> and each barrier metal film <b>20</b>, first, a n-type polycrystalline silicon film doped with phosphorus (P) is deposited on the insulative film <b>16</b> by the CVD method, and thereby the n-type polycrystalline silicon film is embedded inside each through hole <b>17</b>. Thereafter, the n-type polycrystalline silicon film deposited outside of each through hole <b>17</b> is removed by the chemical mechanical polishing method (or etch back). And, at this time, the n-type polycrystalline silicon film deposited in each through hole <b>17</b> is over-polished (over-etched) to retreat the surface of each plug <b>19</b> downward from a surface of the insulative film <b>16</b>. Thereby, each space for embedding the barrier metal film <b>20</b> is secured in an upper portion of each plug <b>19</b>. Next, by depositing a TiN film on an upper portion of the insulative film <b>16</b> by the sputtering method, the TiN film embedded into each through hole <b>17</b> on the upper portion of each plug <b>19</b>. Thereafter, the TiN film deposited outside each through hole <b>17</b> is removed by the chemical mechanical polishing method (or etch back). As this kind of barrier metal material, ruthenium (Ru) polycide, titanium (Ti)—aluminum (Al)—silicon (Si) alloy or the like can be used in addition to TiN.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A subsequent step is shown in FIGS. 32 and 33. FIGS. 32 and 33 are cross-sectional views showing portions corresponding to the sectional portions taken-along lines A—A and C—C of FIG. 1, respectively. In this step, after an insulative film <b>21</b> formed of silicon oxide or the like, for example, is deposited on the insulative film <b>16</b> and the barrier metal film <b>20</b> by the CVD method, a reflection preventing film and a photoresist film are applied thereon in a spinning manner, and this results in formation of photoresist patterns <b>22</b> for forming each capacitor hole.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A lower electrode of the information storage capacity element constituting the DRAM memory cell is formed inside each hole (recess) to be formed in the insulative film <b>21</b> by the following steps. Therefore, the film thickness of the insulative film <b>21</b> becomes equal to a height of this lower electrode, so that, in order to enlarge a surface area of the lower electrode and thereby increase amount of electric charge stored therein, it is necessary to deposit the insulative film <b>21</b> by a thick film (having about 0.8 μm in thickness). The insulative film <b>21</b> is deposited by the plasma CVD method using oxygen and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) as source gas. Then, a surface of the insulative film <b>21</b> is flattened by the chemical mechanical polishing method if necessary.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, each photoresist pattern <b>22</b> is constituted by a reflection preventing film and the photoresist film provided thereon. Because etching the thick insulative film <b>21</b>; this photoresist film is set to about 480 nm in thickness by taking into consideration of a film thickness reduced in etching process. By performing pattering of the photoresist film by exposure development, and then using photoresist pattern thereof as an etching mask to perform dry etching treatment, the reflection preventing film disposed under the photoresist film has already patterned. When film thickness of the insulative film <b>21</b> has a value of about 0.8 μm, the resist mask allows etching to be performed. But, when a value of film thickness of the insulative film <b>21</b> is greater than this value, it is necessary to transfer a hard mask such as tungsten or the like, as an etching mask.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A subsequent step is shown in FIGS. 34 to <b>36</b>. FIG. 34 is a plane view of the same essential portion as that of FIG. 1, and FIGS. 35 and 36 are cross-sectional views taken along lines A—A and C—C of FIG. 34, respectively. In this step, by using the photoresist pattern <b>22</b> as a mask to perform dry etching of the insulative film <b>21</b> disposed at a lower layer thereof, each deep hole (recess) <b>23</b> is formed in a bottom surface of the insulative film <b>21</b> such that a surface of the barrier metal film <b>20</b> in each through hole <b>17</b> is exposed. Each hole <b>23</b> comprises a rectangle-shaped plane pattern having long sides in an extending direction of each word line WL and short sides in an extending direction of each data line DL. A diameter of the long side direction is, for example, about 220 nm, and a diameter of the short side direction is, for example, about 130 nm. An interval between the adjacent holes <b>23</b> of the long side direction and an interval between the adjacent holes <b>23</b> of the short side direction are respectively 130 nm, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 37 shows a cross-sectional view of the information storage capacity-element <b>24</b> that is formed in the holes <b>23</b>. The information storage capacity element <b>24</b> includes a lower electrode <b>24</b> <i>a</i>, a capacity insulative film <b>24</b> <i>b</i>, and a plate electrode <b>24</b> <i>c</i>. The lower electrode <b>24</b> <i>a </i>is formed, for example, of a doped polysilicon film, and is electrically connected to one end of each n-type semiconductor region <b>7</b> of one of a source/drain of the memory cell selecting MISQs through the plugs <b>19</b> and plugs <b>11</b> <i>b </i>formed in a lower layer thereof. The capacity insulative film <b>24</b> <i>b </i>is formed, for example, of a silicon nitride film, a laminated film of a silicon nitride film and a silicon oxide film, tantalum oxide (TaO<sub>5</sub>), or the like. The plate electrode <b>24</b> <i>c </i>has a doped polysilicon film to be filled in the capacitor holes <b>23</b>, and a metal film such as tungsten deposited thereon. Since the plate electrode <b>24</b> <i>c </i>is formed by filling the inside of the capacitor holes <b>23</b> with the doped silicon film having good embedded characteristics thereinto, it is possible to embed securely the capacitor holes <b>23</b> having a high aspect ratio.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The capacity insulative film <b>24</b> <i>b </i>may be constituted, for example, by high (strong) dielectric comprising perovskite type metal oxide such as BST film, BaTiO<sub>3 </sub>(barium titanate), PbTiO<sub>3 </sub>(lead titanate), PZT (PbZrXTi1-XO<sub>3</sub>), PLT (PbLaXTi1-XO<sub>3</sub>), PLZT or the like in addition to the above-mentioned materials. In this case, it is preferable to use ruthenium or the like for the lower electrode <b>24</b> <i>a</i>. It is preferable that each plate electrode <b>24</b> <i>c </i>is formed by depositing a ruthenium, titanium nitride, and tungsten films on each capacity insulative film <b>24</b> <i>b</i>. The tungsten film constituting each plate electrode <b>24</b> <i>c </i>has a function to lower contact resistance between each plate electrode <b>24</b> <i>c </i>and each upper layer wiring. And, the titanium nitride film has a function to prevent resistance from being increased by dispersion of gas (oxygen or hydrogen) from the capacity insulative film <b>24</b> <i>b </i>to the tungsten film. And, in this case, an explanation has been made of the case where the information storage capacity element <b>24</b> is of a crown type. But, the information storage capacity element <b>24</b> is not limited to this only, and may be variously be changed, for example, be of a fin type.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">By the steps described heretofore, the information storage capacity element <b>24</b> is completed, and the DRAM memory cell constituted by the memory cell selecting MISFETQs and the information storage capacity element <b>24</b> serially connected thereto is substantially completed. Thereafter, about two layer wirings between which an interlayer insulative film is put are formed at an upper portion of the information storage capacity element <b>24</b>, and a passivasion film is formed on an upper portion of the uppermost layer wiring. But, the about two layer wiring and the interlayer insulative film are not illustrated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, an exposure technique used in the manufacturing process of the above-mentioned DRAM described in the present embodiment will be explained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">First, FIG. 38 shows one example of an exposure apparatus used in multiple exposure treatment described in the present embodiment. An exposure apparatus <b>25</b> is a scanning type reduction projection exposure apparatus (also called scanner hereinafter), for example, having reduction ratio of 4:1. Exposure conditions of the exposure apparatus <b>25</b> are as follows, for example. That is, for example, KrF excimer laser light (exposure wavelength λ=248 nm) is used as exposure light, and these exposure conditions is the number of aperture NA of optical lens being equal to 0.68 (NA=0.68), and in order to obtain higher phase shift effect, coherence (δ; sigma) value=0.3 which is an illumination condition for improving interference of the exposure light. However, the exposure conditions of the exposure light is not limited to the above-described conditions, and may be changed variously. For example, ArF excimer laser having a wavelength of 193 nm or F<sub>2 </sub>laser having a wavelength of 157 nm may also be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Light emitted from an exposure light source <b>25</b> <i>a </i>illuminates a mask <b>26</b> through a fly-eye lens <b>25</b> <i>b</i>, an aperture <b>25</b> <i>c</i>, capacitor lens <b>25</b> <i>d</i> <b>1</b> and <b>25</b> <i>d</i> <b>2</b>, and a mirror <b>25</b> <i>e</i>. The coherence of the optical conditions was adjusted by changing an opening size of the aperture <b>25</b> <i>c</i>. A pellicle <b>27</b> is provided on the mask <b>26</b> for preventing pattern-transfer badness or the like which is caused by foreign matter attached thereon. A mask pattern formed on the mask <b>26</b> is projected through a projection lens <b>25</b> <i>f </i>onto a wafer <b>1</b>W (substrate <b>1</b>) which is a sample substrate. The mask <b>26</b> is put on a mask stage <b>25</b> <i>h </i>controlled by a mask position control means <b>25</b> <i>g</i>, and a center of the mask stage <b>25</b> <i>h </i>precisely positions an optical axis of the projection lens <b>25</b> <i>f. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The wafer <b>1</b>W is vacuum-absorbed on a wafer stage <b>25</b> <i>i</i>. The wafer stage <b>25</b> <i>i </i>is placed on a Z-stage <b>25</b> <i>j </i>which is movable in an optical axis direction of the projection lens <b>25</b> <i>f</i>, i.e., in a Z direction, and is further placed on an XY stage <b>25</b> <i>k</i>. The Z stage <b>25</b> <i>j </i>and the XY stage <b>25</b> <i>k </i>are respectively driven by driving means <b>25</b> <i>n</i> <b>1</b> and <b>25</b> <i>n</i> <b>2</b> in accordance with control commands given by a main control system <b>25</b> <i>m</i>, and thereby can move to desired exposure positions. Such positions are precisely monitored by a laser measuring apparatus <b>25</b> <i>q </i>as positions of a mirror <b>25</b> <i>p </i>fitted to the Z stage <b>25</b> <i>j</i>. And, an on-surface position of the wafer <b>1</b>W (substrate <b>1</b>) is measured by focus position detecting means that a normal exposure apparatus has. Driving the Z stage <b>25</b> <i>j </i>in accordance with results of the measurement can make the surface of the wafer <b>1</b>W coincide with an image forming surface of the projection lens <b>25</b> <i>f. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the case where a circuit pattern on the mask <b>26</b> is superposed on another circuit pattern formed on the wafer <b>1</b>W and then is exposed, positions of the mark pattern formed on the wafer <b>1</b>W are detected by using an alignment detecting optical system <b>25</b> <i>r</i>, and the wafer is positioned in accordance with the detected results and is superposed and transferred. The main control system <b>25</b> <i>m </i>is electrically connected to a network apparatus <b>25</b> <i>s</i>, and can remote-monitor or the like a state of the exposure apparatus <b>25</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 39 is a view schematically showing exposure operation of the above-mentioned exposure apparatus <b>1</b>. Since a relationship between the mask <b>26</b> and the wafer <b>1</b>W is mirror-symmetric, a scanning direction of the mask <b>26</b> and a scanning direction of the wafer <b>1</b>W are opposite to each other during exposure treatment. The mask <b>26</b> disposed on the mask stage <b>25</b> <i>h </i>and the wafer <b>1</b>W disposed on the wafer stage <b>25</b> <i>i </i>are precisely synchronized with each other at a predetermined driving ratio and are scan-driven. Since the mainstream of the reduction ratio of the scanner is 4:1, when a driving distance of the wafer <b>1</b>W is 1, a driving distance of the mask <b>26</b> becomes 4. Since a slit-like exposure region formed by pass of an exposure light EP through a slit SL is scanned on the mask <b>26</b> in accordance with scanning operation of the mask <b>26</b>, a mask pattern on the mask <b>26</b> is exposed and transferred onto a main surface of the wafer <b>1</b>W (this is an explanation of the above-mentioned scanning exposure.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">However, in the case where the mask pattern is transferred onto the substrate through an image forming optical system, shape deterioration of the transfer pattern, transfer position shift (deviation) and the like are affected by aberration which is an error of an optical system. The aberration of the image forming optical system exists and is distributed within an exposure filed. This amount of aberration can be expressed by a Zernike aberration function, and a size of each aberration component thereof corresponds to a coefficient of each term. It is known that, among the aberration components, a Trefoil aberration constituted by a tertiary and quintic coma aberrations results from the shape deterioration or the positional deviation of the transferred pattern.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the case of the above-mentioned scanner, for example, when a pattern is transferred by scanning in a wide (short) direction of the above-mentioned slit-like exposure region, the lens aberration is basically distributed only in a longitudinal direction of the slit-like exposure region. Therefore, in the case of disposing a plurality of patterns along the wide direction (i.e., in a scanning direction) of the above-mentioned slit-like exposure region on the mask <b>26</b> and by performing multiple exposure of this, each amount of lens aberration by which each pattern is affected becomes the same between patterns transferred to the same position on the substrate. That is, if the transfer patterns are the same, the transfer pattern position caused by aberration is the same relative to the scanning direction. Therefore, the shape deterioration and positional deviation and the like as described above can be reduced or eliminated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The transfer position shift amount of each transfer pattern changes to depend not only on the aberration amount but also the pattern arrangement. For example, the transfer position shift amount changes to depend on each arrangement pitch, but the shift amount in the scanner is linearly distributed relative to the longitudinal direction of the slit-like exposure region. Therefore, since each position of the mask pattern may be linearly corrected, the correction thereof is easier than a stepper.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the case of the scanner, the maximum exposure field becomes greater, for example, 25×33 mm in size in comparison with the stepper whose size is 22×22 mm, and there is thereby the advantage of disposition of a greater semiconductor chip onto one mask <b>26</b>. By this, a size of each maximum chip for a double exposure capable of being disposed on one mask <b>26</b> can be enlarged, for example, to 25×16.5 mm which is greater than 22×11 mm of a sequentially moving type reduction projection exposure apparatus (called stepper hereinafter).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In FIGS. 38 and 39, only portions necessary for explaining functions of the exposure apparatus have shown, and other portions necessary for using a normal exposure apparatus (scanner or stepper) are similar within a normal range used. And, the technical idea of the present invention can be applied to an exposure technique using the stepper. In the case of the stepper, an exposure chip, for example, of 22×22 mm is once exposed to transfer the mask pattern onto the substrate. However, since the aberration is distributed in this exposure chip and exists thereon, if the stepper is used, the transfer pattern shape is varied as depending on the position thereof in the exposure chip, or the transfer pattern position is transferred so as to deviate from ideal position having no aberration. For example, in the case where two kinds of mask patterns are disposed on the same mask and are superposed and multiple-exposed, since the patterns to be multiple-exposed on the substrate have aberration amount different from each other, the shift amount of each transfer pattern position is also different at transference of each pattern onto the substrate. Since this results in difference of the transfer position shift amount between respective patterns, it is likely that relatively superposed deviation between patterns of two kinds is caused due to effects of the position shift.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the case of the stepper, since the aberration amount is two-dimensionally distributed in the exposure chip, correction of the transfer pattern position on the mask becomes complicated in order to correct the transfer pattern position shift. Further, since mask patterns for two shots are disposed on the same mask substrate, throughput derived from restriction of chip size capable of being exposed and increase of number of exposure shots per substrate may be reduced. Further, in the case of use of two masks, the amount of aberration that each pattern to be multiple-transferred on the substrate is affected is the same, but since the masks are replaced and multiple-exposed on the same substrate as described above, throughput may be reduced. By taking the above description into consideration, use of the scanner can perform double exposure treatment easier and more precisely.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, the mask used in the present embodiment will be explained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">First, the exposure technique for forming the photoresist patterns used in forming the active regions L (trench isolations <b>2</b>) shown in FIG. <b>1</b> and the like, will be explained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 40A is a plan view of each essential portion of photoresist patterns RL for forming the active regions L shown in FIG. <b>1</b> and the like. FIG. 40B is a cross-sectional view taken along line A—A of FIG. <b>40</b>A. FIG. 40A is a plan view in which the photoresist patterns RL are hatched for easy understanding the drawing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Each photoresist pattern RL is required that an adjacent interval D<b>2</b> between adjacent photoresist patterns RL extending in the longitudinal direction of each active region L is set for the photoresist patterns to be extremely close to each other, for example, at 160 to 180 nm (such an interval as to be able to dispose one word line WL described above). That is, an arrangement pitch of the required pattern is fine. Due to this, in an exposure treatment using a normal mask, because slops of the light intensity become smoothened and a retreating amount of each photoresist pattern becomes great after the development, and sufficient light intensity can not be obtained from the longitudinal direction of each pattern, it is extremely difficult to form each pattern under such a state as to keep the above-described fine arrangement pitch. This results in requirement for using the Levenson type phase shift mask as a mask for transferring each photoresist pattern RL.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As performed in a technique of a normal Levenson type phase shift mask, consider the case where each photoresist pattern RL is transferred onto a negative type photoresist film by using the Levenson type phase shift mask. As described above, use of the Levenson type phase shift mask requires that a phase difference of each light that permeates adjacent light permeating regions is set at 180 degrees. However, in the layout of the photoresist patterns RL, since three patterns or more among the light permeating regions for transferring this are respectively arranged close at a distance required to dispose the-phase shifters, the phase shifters can be arranged such that each transferring light has a phase difference of 180 degrees between all the light permeation regions close thereto. That is, there certainly occurs the case that each of at lease one pair among the transferring lights passing through the light permeation regions close thereto, has the same phase.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Now, in the present embodiment, when each photoresist pattern RL for forming a pattern of each active region L shown in FIG. 1 is formed, a positive type photoresist film is used as a photoresist film and a multiple exposure method in which a plurality of mask patterns are superposed and exposed on the same position of the positive type photoresist film on the wafer <b>1</b>W (substrate <b>1</b>) is employed. Each active region L is separated into a band-like pattern extending diagonally and a hole pattern which cuts predetermined portions thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 41A to <b>41</b>C show a first mask pattern <b>28</b>A of the mask <b>26</b> for forming a photoresist pattern for forming each active region described above. FIG. 41A is a plan view of an essential portion thereof, FIG. 41B is a cross-sectional view taken along line A—A of FIG. 41A, and FIG. 41C is an enlarged cross-sectional view of a phase shifter of FIG. <b>41</b>B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A mask substrate <b>26</b> <i>a </i>constituting the mask <b>26</b> of FIGS. 41A to <b>41</b>C comprises, for example, transparent synthetic quartz glass, and a mask pattern <b>28</b>A shown in FIG. 40A is formed on a main surface of the substrate <b>26</b> <i>a</i>. This mask pattern <b>28</b>A is a pattern for exposing a line/space pattern extending diagonally relative to the XY direction, and has band-shaped light shield patterns <b>26</b> <i>b </i>extending diagonally (inclination of about 28 degrees in the X direction, for example) in the XY direction, and light transfer pattern s <b>26</b> <i>c</i>. Each light shield pattern <b>26</b> <i>b </i>and each light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c </i>are alternately arranged along a wide (short) direction of the pattern. A phase shifter S is disposed in one of the light transfer pattern s <b>26</b> <i>c </i>and <b>26</b> <i>c </i>which are disposed in both sides of each light shield pattern <b>26</b> <i>b </i>and which are adjacent to each other. Due to this, lights that have passed through the permeation patterns <b>26</b> <i>c </i>and <b>26</b> <i>c </i>adjacent to each other have a phase difference of 180 degrees different from each other. That is, each light is inverted at 180 degrees. A dimension Dx<b>10</b> is about 520 nm, for example (converted to wafer size). A dimension Dy<b>10</b> is about 280 nm, for example (converted to wafer size).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Each light shield pattern <b>26</b> <i>b </i>constituting the mask pattern <b>28</b>A is formed of a light shield film such as chromium, chromium oxide or a laminated film thereof. Each light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c </i>is formed after the light shield film is removed. As shown in FIGS. 41B and 41C, the phase shifter S is, for example, a trench shifter. That is, the phase shifter S is formed by digging a trench having a predetermined depth (satisfying the equation of the above-mentioned Z) in the mask substrate <b>26</b> <i>a</i>. In the above example, the depth Z of the phase shifter S is, for example, about 245 nm by use of the KrF having an exposure wavelength of about 248 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Here, a case in which the trench shifter is the above-mentioned fine visor type trench shifter is shown. That is, the mask substrate <b>26</b> <i>a </i>is overhung in the wide direction of the trench in a periphery of the phase shifter S (in a cross-sectional direction having narrow width). As a result, each light shield pattern <b>26</b> <i>b </i>to face the phase shifter S has a structure of having an end thereof projecting like a visor. An optimal value P about length of the visor projecting from each light shield pattern <b>26</b> <i>b </i>depends on pattern pitch thereof, optical conditions and the like, and, in the case of using a mask for a scanner having a reduction ratio of 4:1, the optical value thereof is about 0.15 μm. Since the visor structure of this results in restriction of waveguide effect of light, light intensity of the transferring light can be reduced by effects caused from side walls of the phase shifter S. Therefore, when multiple-exposure treatment is performed by using the mask <b>26</b>, it is possible to enhance dimensional precision of each pattern to be transferred onto the wafer <b>1</b>W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The mask pattern <b>28</b>A shown in FIG. 41 is a line/space pattern inclining about 28 degrees in the X direction. Therefore, in the case where this pattern is drawn by electron beam exposure apparatus having a vector-scan type of variable rectangular beams, the inclined pattern is divided into a large number of rectangular-shaped patterns to draw the inclined pattern by approximation. That is, a mask pattern layout shown in FIG. 41A becomes fine step-shaped patterns as schematically shown in FIG. 42 in terms of electron beam drawing data. This has caused a problem of increase of both the number of the electron beam shots during a mask pattern drawing and time necessary for drawing operation. Therefore, regarding the layout of the mask pattern for transferring such inclined patterns, it is preferable to layout the mask pattern such that the number of the exposure shots is reduced in drawing the mask pattern. FIG. 43 shows one example of a mask pattern layout using step-shaped patterns having a size included within such a range as to be able to obtain sufficient resolution during wafer process. In this case, each light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c </i>is divided into a plurality of fine rectangular patterns, for example, of 65 nm (=Dx<b>11</b>)×135 nm (Dy<b>11</b>), and these rectangular patterns are arranged along the X direction while offsetting 35 nm (=Dy<b>12</b>) from one another in the Y direction. At this time, dimension of the rectangular pattern is 260×540 nm on the mask which is four times greater, but value of this dimension is within dimensional range capable of drawing on shot when the drawing is performed by the electron beam exposure apparatus. A deviating amount Dy<b>12</b>=35 nm relative to the Y direction is set to a value multiplying the pitch Dy<b>10</b>=280 nm by ⅛, and a size 65 nm of a rectangular extending in the X direction is a value multiplying the pitch Dx<b>12</b>=260 nm by ¼. The reason why each cut of the X direction is greater than that of the Y direction is that the cut angle of each inclined pattern is inclined about 28 degrees from the X direction. When a raster scan type electron beam (EB) drawing apparatus is used, since a drawing system thereof is different, the pattern layout may employ patterns having a diagonal direction. And, in a cell projection type EB drawing apparatus, such a method or the like can be used that portions of each inclined pattern are linked together and drawn as a cell configuration. Additionally, it is also possible to draw not only the rectangular-shaped patterns but also the inclined patterns (e.g., triangular-shaped patterns) by using aperture having transmittable opening portions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 44 schematically shows a case in which only the mask pattern <b>28</b>A is exposed on a positive type photoresist film. Regions in which exposure light is illuminated are shown as hollow portions. On the other hand, other regions in which the exposure light is not illuminated are shown as hatched portions. Since each photoresist film R is a positive type, if it is developed (in actual case, it is developed after the multiple-exposure), then the exposed regions (hollow regions) are removed. Use of only this mask pattern <b>28</b>A forms band-shaped photoresist patterns R (i.e., photoresist patterns for forming line patterns) extending in the inclined direction shown in FIG. 44, but can not form island-shaped photoresist pattern. Therefore, by partially removing predetermined portions of the band-shaped photoresist patterns R, it is necessary to prepare a second mask pattern for forming the island-shaped photoresist patterns and to superposition-expose the second mask pattern.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 45A and 45B show a second mask pattern <b>28</b>B of the mask <b>26</b> for forming the photoresist patterns for forming the above-mentioned active regions used for superposition-exposure, and FIG. 45A is a plan view of an essential portion of thereof, and FIG. 45B is a cross-sectional view taken along line A—A of FIG. <b>45</b>A.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The mask pattern <b>28</b>B formed on a main surface of the mask substrate <b>26</b> <i>a </i>shown in FIGS. 45A and 45B is a pattern for forming the island-shaped photoresist patterns by exposing a region having an adjacent interval between the adjacent active regions L in the longitudinal direction of each active region L, in each band-shaped photoresist pattern R of FIG. 43, which remains without being exposed in the mask pattern <b>28</b>A of FIG. <b>41</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This mask pattern <b>28</b>B has each main light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> and each auxiliary light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>2</b> arranged in peripheral regions thereof. Each main light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> and each auxiliary light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>2</b> are formed like a flat-surface square. A plane dimension of each main light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> is, for example, about 200×200 nm (converted to wafer size). And a plane dimension of each auxiliary light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>2</b> is relatively smaller than that of the main light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b>, and has such no size that as to be transferred onto the photoresist film, and is, for example, about 100×100 nm (converted to wafer size). Here, the phase shifters S are disposed on the main light transfer pattern s <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b>, respectively. This results in generating of a phase difference of 180 degrees between respective lights having passed through each main light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> and the auxiliary light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>2</b>. Each phase shifter S is, for example, the above-mentioned fine visor type trench shifter similar to the above-mentioned mask pattern <b>28</b>A. A depth of the trench of the phase shifter S is the same as that of the trench of the phase shifter S of the above-mentioned mask pattern <b>28</b>A.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the second mask pattern <b>28</b>B, a pitch Dx<b>13</b> between the main light transfer pattern s <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> and <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> adjacent to each other in the X direction (a second direction) is a minimum approach pitch of the pattern, and its distance is, for example, about 2×0.33 (λ/NA) to 2×0.045 (λ/NA) nm, and is in a range of about 120 to 160 nm on the wafer. Here, a pitch Dx<b>13</b> between the main light transfer pattern s <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> adjacent to each other in the X direction is, for example, about 260 nm (converted to wafer size). An adjacent pitch between the main light transfer pattern s <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> and <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> adjacent to each other in the Y direction (a first direction) is longer than an adjacent pitch between the main light transfer pattern s <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> and <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> adjacent to each other in the X direction. Here, a pitch Dy<b>13</b> between the main light transfer pattern s <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> and <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> adjacent to each other in the Y direction is, for example, about 420 nm (converted to wafer size). A pitch Dy<b>14</b> between each main light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> and each auxiliary light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>2</b> adjacent to each other in the Y direction is, for example, about 280 nm (converted to wafer size).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">However, generally, for designing the mask pattern <b>28</b>B, only the main light transfer pattern is disposed, and a phase shifter might be disposed in only one of the adjacent main light transfer pattern s. But, in the case of the mask pattern <b>28</b>B, since the phase shifters are closely disposed in the Y direction, a distance of each disposing arrangement requiring to dispose each phase shifter is to narrow to dispose each phase shifter in a normal manner. Therefore, in the present embodiment, the auxiliary light transfer pattern s are disposed around each main light transfer pattern, and the light which has passed through each auxiliary light transfer pattern is reversed to an angle of 180 degrees, so that the resolution thereof can be enhanced. In this case, since merely disposition of the auxiliary light transfer pattern s causes inconvenience, a method of illuminating the inconvenience is added. A method of arranging the auxiliary light transfer pattern s is explained below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As an arrangement method of the auxiliary patterns, as shown in FIGS. 46A to <b>46</b>B, there is a method for disposing each auxiliary pattern in an intermediate position between the main light transfer pattern s <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> in the respective X and Y directions. In this case, since a distance between each main light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> and each auxiliary light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>2</b> is slightly different, the phase shift effect is also different in the X direction and the Y direction. Therefore, the optical image projected on the wafer <b>1</b>W (substrate <b>1</b>) becomes oval in shape, and there is an adverse possibility that a portion of each photoresist pattern RL located below and above a portion between adjacent regions extending in the longitudinal direction of each photoresist pattern RL shown in FIG. 40 becomes thinner due to effects of light which passed through each main light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> of the second mask pattern <b>28</b>B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, as shown in FIG. 47, there is another method to layout such that four auxiliary light transfer pattern s <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>2</b> are arranged in above, below, right and left sides of each main light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> at equal distances therefrom. In this case, this is a layout in which each auxiliary light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>2</b> is disposed around the main light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> having a pitch of 140 nm in the Y direction. However, in this case, since the plane dimension of each auxiliary light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>2</b> is set to a rectangular pattern of 100×100 nm (converted to wafer size), a space between the auxiliary light transfer pattern s <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>2</b> is as extremely small as 40 nm (converted to wafer size). Therefore, it is very difficult to produce the mask.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Now, as shown in FIGS. 45A and 45B, in the mask pattern <b>28</b>B of the present embodiment, the auxiliary light transfer pattern s <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>2</b> are disposed such that a distance from a center of each main light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> to that of each auxiliary light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>2</b> thereabout becomes substantially equal. That is, the auxiliary light transfer pattern s <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>2</b> are disposed such that the center of each auxiliary light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>2</b> is located at a corner of a hexagon whose center coincides with the center of each main light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b>. The respective auxiliary light transfer pattern s <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>2</b> around each main light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> are disposed symmetrically in right-left and up-down sides relative to both the X and Y axes which passing the center of each main light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">From another point of view, this can be seen as follows. That is, each auxiliary light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>2</b> is not disposed on the Y axis (axis based on the first direction) passing through the center of each main light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b>, but is not disposed on an X axis (axis base on the second direction) passing through the center of each main light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b>, and is disposed at such a position as to be separated in upper and lower sides from the X axis relative to the Y direction and to become symmetrical by regarding the X axis as a center line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Further, from still another point of view, this can be seen as follows. That is, as shown at two dots and dash line of FIG. 48, such unit cells UC as to contain two auxiliary light transfer pattern s <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>2</b> can be imaged. The two auxiliary light transfer pattern s <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>2</b> in each unit cell UC are disposed on the Y axis passing through each center of the two main light transfer pattern s <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> and <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> arranged along the Y direction. And, the two auxiliary light transfer pattern s <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>2</b> are not disposed on the X axis passing through the center of each of the two main light transfer pattern s <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> and <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b>, but are disposed to become symmetric by regarding the X axis as a center line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the layout of such a mask pattern <b>28</b>B, a projection optical image on the wafer <b>1</b>W (substrate <b>1</b>) relative to each main light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> can be made substantially circular. And, in the upper and lower positions of a region between adjacent active regions L extending in the longitudinal direction of FIG. 1, deformation of the photoresist pattern can be suppressed to a small degree.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 49 shows a state in which data of the first mask pattern <b>28</b>A and data of the second mask pattern <b>28</b>B are superposed. One dot lines show the first mask pattern <b>28</b>A, and solid lines show the second mask pattern <b>28</b>B. The main light transfer pattern s <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> and the auxiliary light transfer pattern s <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>2</b> of the second mask pattern <b>28</b>B are arranged on the light shield patterns <b>26</b> <i>b </i>of the first mask pattern <b>28</b>A.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, a technique concerning the multiple-exposure treatment will be explained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">First, in the present embodiment, FIG. 50 shows a plan view of the entire mask for transferring each active region. Here, a case in which two transfer regions <b>30</b>A and <b>30</b>B, for example, are disposed on a main surface (the same surface) of one mask <b>26</b> is illustrated. Each of the transfer regions <b>30</b>A and <b>30</b>B is formed, for example, like a plane rectangular, and is disposed such that long sides thereof are in parallel to each other at a predetermined distance therebetween. Each of the transfer regions <b>30</b>A and <b>30</b>B corresponds to a region, for example, for transferring one semiconductor chip. This mask production is suitable for such a structure that a plane dimension of the semiconductor chip is small and two semiconductor chip transfer regions can be disposed in one mask.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The first mask pattern <b>38</b>A shown in FIG. 41 is disposed in a memory cell region of the transfer region <b>30</b>A, and the second mask pattern <b>38</b>B shown in FIG. 45 is disposed in a memory cell region of the transfer region <b>30</b>B. In the multiple-exposure treatment, the first mask pattern <b>28</b>A of the transfer region <b>30</b>A and the second mask pattern <b>28</b>B of the transfer region <b>30</b>B are precisely positioned and transferred onto a positive type photoresist film on the wafer <b>1</b>W (substrate <b>1</b>). The longitudinal dimension of each active region L (each photoresist pattern RL) can be optimized by mainly adjusting a dimension of the second mask pattern <b>28</b>B or exposure amount used during exposure of the second mask pattern <b>28</b>B on the wafer <b>1</b>W. Due to this, a desired dimension of each photoresist pattern can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Since the mask patterns being outside the memory cell region are not transferred by normal exposure but by the multiple exposure, the mask patterns are disposed in the transfer region <b>30</b>A. The mask patterns being outside the memory cell region may be transferred by multiple exposure. In the above-mentioned transfer regions <b>30</b>A and <b>30</b>B, patterns such as mark patterns used for superposition, mark patterns used for inspecting superposition, and mask patterns used for inspecting electric characteristics which do not constitute an actual integrated circuit, are also included in addition to patterns constituting the actual integrated circuit. In the light shield regions around the transfer regions <b>30</b>A and <b>30</b>B, a portion of a mask substrate <b>26</b> <i>a </i>is exposed, and other light transfer pattern s <b>26</b> <i>d </i>such as alignment marks and measuring marks and the like are formed. These light transfer pattern s <b>26</b> <i>d </i>are such regions as to transfer no photoresist film thereon, or to be hidden by masking blades that shield exposure light illuminated at exposure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, a concrete example of the multiple-exposure treatment will be explained. There is a method in which, first, in the state that each pattern of the transfer region <b>30</b>A is masked (light-shielded) as not exposed, each pattern of the transfer region <b>30</b>B is exposed on the positive type photoresist film of the main surface of the wafer <b>1</b>W (substrate <b>1</b>), and then in the state that each pattern of the transfer region <b>30</b>B is masked (light shielded) as not exposed, each pattern of the transfer region <b>30</b>A is superposed on each pattern of the transfer region <b>30</b>B which has already been transferred (latent-imaged) on the positive type photoresist film of the wafer <b>1</b>W and exposed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">And, as another method, there is a method in which plane dimensions of the transfer region <b>30</b>A and the transfer region <b>30</b>B are set to be equal to each other, the transfer regions <b>30</b>A and <b>30</b>B are collectively transferred on the positive type photoresist film of the wafer <b>1</b>W, and then the mask <b>26</b> is moved along the Y direction to the dimension (width) of each Y direction side of the respective transfer regions <b>30</b>A and <b>30</b>B, and each pattern is exposed in a state of superposition of the exposure shots on half thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the former method, the respective transfer regions <b>30</b>A and <b>30</b>B can be exposed with optimal exposure amount and under optimal optical condition. On the other hand, in the latter method, since the exposure amount and the optical condition of both the transfer regions <b>30</b>A and <b>30</b>B are the same, it is necessary to optimize the mask pattern. But, the latter method is advantageous in terms of throughput in comparison with the former method. Further, since two shots are aligned, there occurs the problem that the alignment precision is lowered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the above-mentioned example, a case in which the first and second mask patterns <b>28</b>A and <b>28</b>B are disposed on one mask <b>26</b> has explained, but the present invention is not limited thereto, and there is a method, for example, in which the multiple-exposure is performed by using two masks. That is, there is a method in which the first and second mask patterns <b>28</b>A and <b>28</b>B are disposed on separated masks, respectively, and the multiple-exposure is performed while the masks are exchanged. In this case, since the exposure is performed after the masks are replaced, it is possible to increase the shot size up to the maximum exposure field of the exposure apparatus similarly to the normal exposure. Further, since the exposure condition can be set to be optimal value for each pattern, it is possible to excellently set exposure tolerance or exposure conditions. This method is especially suitable for the case where the plane dimension of the semiconductor chip is large and two semiconductor chip transfer regions can not be disposed on one mask.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">After completion of the multiple-exposure treatment, a series of processing such as normal developing processing and cleaning and drying processing is carried out, and thereby the photoresist pattern RL as shown in FIG. 40 is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the above-mentioned example, the case has explained where the phase shifter S is the trench shifter (fine visor type trench shifter), but the present invention is not limited thereto. For example, as shown in FIG. 51A, the shifter may be the above-mentioned on-substrate thin film trench shifter. In this case, a shifter film <b>26</b> <i>e </i>is formed on the surface of the mask substrate <b>26</b> <i>a</i>. The shifter film <b>26</b> <i>e </i>is formed to have a thickness (as satisfying the above-mentioned equation Z) suitable for the purpose of functioning as the phase shifter, and, for example, is formed of SOG (spin on glass) or the like having light permeating rate and index of refraction, which are the same as or similar to those of the mask substrate <b>26</b> <i>a</i>. A trench forming the phase shifter S is formed by removing the shifter film <b>26</b> <i>e </i>of a predetermined light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c </i>(corresponding to the main light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b>) exposed from each light shield pattern <b>26</b> <i>b </i>until a surface of the mask substrate <b>26</b> <i>a </i>is exposed. In this case, when the trench for the phase shifter S is formed, etching selection ratio between the mask substrate <b>26</b> <i>a </i>and the shifter film <b>26</b> <i>e </i>is set higher such that etching speed of the shifter film <b>26</b> <i>e </i>becomes faster than that of the mask substrate <b>26</b> <i>a</i>. That is, the trench for the phase shifter S is formed by using the mask substrate <b>26</b> <i>a </i>as an etching stopper. This results in extremely high precise formation of depth (i.e., thickness of the shifter film <b>26</b> <i>e</i>) and flatness of the bottom surface of the trench. Therefore, since the phase difference of the transferring light can be largely reduced or eliminated, it is possible to largely enhance the dimensional precision of each photoresist pattern to be transferred on the wafer <b>1</b>W (substrate <b>1</b>). Further, as shown in FIG. 51B, a transparent film <b>26</b> <i>f </i>can be used as the phase shifter S instead of the trench. In this case, a thickness of the transparent film <b>26</b> <i>f </i>can be expressed by the equation Z about depth of the trench for the above-mentioned phase shifter S.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, an exposure technique for forming a photoresist pattern used in forming each pattern of the contact holes <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and <b>10</b> <i>b </i>shown in FIG. <b>11</b> and the like, will be explained. A minimum arrangement pitch is, for example, about 260 nm, and a minimum design dimension is, for example, about 170 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 52A is a plan view of an essential portion of a photoresist pattern RC for forming the contact holes <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and <b>10</b> <i>b </i>shown in FIG. <b>11</b> and the like. FIG. 52B is a cross-sectional view taken along line A—A of FIG. <b>52</b>A. Although FIG. 52A is the plan view, the photoresist pattern RC is hatched so as to easily see the drawing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in FIG. 52A, apertures <b>31</b> <i>a </i>and <b>31</b> <i>b </i>(portions in which the contact holes <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and <b>10</b> <i>b </i>are formed) of the photoresist pattern RC are densely arranged like a honeycomb. An arrangement pitch Dx<b>3</b> is, for example, about 260 nm, and an arrangement pitch Dy<b>2</b> is, for example, 280 nm, and respective patterns are deviated to 140 nm (=Dy<b>2</b>) per row. In order to transfer such patterns disposed densely, it is necessary to use a Levenson type phase shift mask. However, in the pattern arrangement shown in FIG. 52A, it is impossible to dispose such phase shifters that all the phase differences between the closest patterns become 180 degrees. Therefore, it is necessary to divide the mask pattern into two and transfer the patterns by multiple-exposure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Accordingly, in the present embodiment, even when the photoresist pattern for forming the patterns of the contact holes <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and <b>10</b> <i>b </i>shown in FIG. 11 is formed, a multiple-exposure method is employed in which the positive type photoresist film is used as a photoresist film, and a plurality of mask patterns are superposed on the same position of the positive type photoresist film of the wafer <b>1</b>W (substrate <b>1</b>) and exposed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The contact holes <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and <b>10</b> <i>b </i>are separated such that a first pattern group has a dimension and a mask pattern layout capable of using a technique of the Levenson type phase shift mask, and a second pattern group has another pattern other than a pattern included in the first pattern group. More specifically, for example, the first pattern group has defined as a pattern group of contact hole <b>10</b> <i>b </i>used for the information storage capacity element, and the second pattern group has defined as the contact hole <b>10</b> <i>a </i>used for the data lines.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 53A and 53B show a first mask pattern <b>28</b>C of the mask <b>26</b> for forming a photoresist pattern for forming the above-mentioned contact holes. FIG. 53A is a plan view of an essential portion of thereof, and FIG. 53B is a cross-sectional view taken along line A—A of FIG. <b>53</b>A.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The first mask pattern <b>28</b>C is a pattern for exposing a pattern group of the contact hole <b>10</b> <i>b </i>for the information storage capacity element, and has, for example, a plurality of light transfer patterns <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>3</b> formed like a plane square. A plane dimension of each light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>3</b> is, for example, about 200×200 nm. The phase shifter S is disposed in any one of adjacent light transfer patterns <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>3</b>, and the phase of the light that passes through each adjacent light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>3</b> has thereby a reversion of 180 degrees. Two respective light transfer patterns <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>3</b> and <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>3</b> which are disposed along the Y direction and through which phases of the respective transferring lights passing have reversions of 180 degrees are disposed along the X direction so as to be spaced the arrangement pitch Dy<b>21</b> in the Y direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The arrangement pitch Dx<b>20</b> between the light transfer pattern s <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>3</b> and <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>3</b> adjacent to each other in the X direction is, for example, about 260 nm (converted to wafer size). The arrangement pitch Dy<b>20</b> between the light transfer pattern s <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>3</b> and <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>3</b> adjacent to each other in the Y direction is, for example, about 280 nm (converted to wafer size). The arrangement pitch between the light transfer pattern s <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>3</b> which are adjacent to each other in the Y direction and whose the transferring light has the same phase is, for example, about 420 nm (converted to wafer size). And, respective structures of the light shield pattern <b>26</b> <i>b </i>and the phase shifter S described in this case are the same as those described above, so that explanation thereof will be omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 54 schematically shows a case in which only the first mask pattern <b>28</b>C is exposed on the positive type photoresist film. Regions illuminated by exposure light are hollow, and other regions not illuminated by the exposure light are hatched. Since the photoresist film is positive type, if development treatment thereof is performed (in actual case, development treatment thereof is performed after the multiple exposure), the exposed regions (hollow regions) are removed. By using only the above-mentioned mask pattern <b>28</b>C, a photoresist pattern R (i.e., a photoresist pattern for forming the first hole pattern) which has only apertures <b>31</b> <i>b </i>for the contact hole <b>10</b> <i>b </i>for the information storage capacity element is formed, and the apertures <b>31</b> <i>a </i>for the contact hole <b>10</b> <i>a </i>for each data line can not be formed therein. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare a second mask pattern for forming the contact hole <b>10</b> <i>a </i>for each data line and to superpose the pattern and perform exposure thereof. An arrangement pitch Dx<b>21</b> between the apertures <b>31</b> <i>a </i>and <b>31</b> <i>b </i>adjacent to each other in the X direction is, for example, about 520 nm (converted to wafer size) whose value is twice larger than that the above-mentioned arrangement pitch Dx<b>20</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present embodiment uses the same pattern as the second mask pattern <b>28</b>B shown in FIG. 45A, as the second mask pattern for forming the contact hole <b>10</b> <i>a </i>for the data line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the case where a normal mask is used as the second mask pattern, the second mask pattern has a mask pattern layout in which only each main light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> of the second mask pattern <b>28</b>B shown in FIG. 45A is disposed. If the projection optical image using the second mask pattern on the wafer <b>1</b>W (substrate <b>1</b>) is compared with the projection optical image using the second mask pattern <b>28</b>B shown in FIG. 45, the latter can have better phase shift effect than the former and better optical image having more excellent shape and a dimensional precision.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 55 schematically shows a case in which only the second mask pattern <b>28</b>B is exposed on the positive type photoresist film. Regions illuminated by exposure light are hollow, and other regions not illuminated by the exposure are hatched. Since the photoresist film is positive type, if development treatment thereof is performed (in actual case, development treatment thereof is performed after the multiple-exposure), the exposed regions (hollow regions) are removed. By using only the above-mentioned second mask pattern <b>28</b>B, a photoresist pattern R (i.e., a photoresist pattern for forming the second hole pattern) which has only apertures <b>31</b> <i>a </i>for the contact hole <b>10</b> <i>a </i>for each data line is formed. An arrangement pitch Dx<b>22</b> between the apertures <b>31</b> <i>a </i>and <b>31</b> <i>a </i>adjacent to each other in the X direction is, for example, about 520 nm (converted to wafer size) whose value is twice larger than the arrangement pitch Dx<b>3</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Therefore, the first mask pattern <b>28</b>C shown in FIG. <b>53</b>A and the second mask pattern shown in FIG. 45A are superposed and exposed, and then, by performing the series of treatment such as development, cleaning, drying and the like, the photoresist pattern RC shown in FIG. 52 can be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 56 shows the state that data of the first mask pattern <b>28</b>C and data of the second mask pattern <b>28</b>B are superposed. One dot lines show the first mask pattern <b>28</b>C, and solid lines show the second mask pattern <b>28</b>B. The light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>3</b> of the first mask pattern <b>28</b>A and the auxiliary light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>2</b> of the second mask pattern <b>28</b>B are superposed and disposed. That is, each auxiliary light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>2</b> of the second mask pattern <b>28</b>B is disposed in each light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>3</b> of the first mask pattern <b>28</b>A.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Therefore, in order to form the pattern data of the second mask pattern <b>28</b>B shown in FIG. 45, the following procedure is performed, for example. Firstly, the pattern data is formed which disposes the light transfer pattern s in accordance with the arrangements of the respective contact holes <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and <b>10</b> <i>b</i>. At this time, the contact holes <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and <b>10</b> <i>b </i>are laid out on other layers (data layers). The contact hole <b>10</b> <i>b </i>corresponds to the mask pattern <b>28</b>C of FIG. 53A, and the contact hole <b>10</b> <i>a </i>corresponds to each light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> of a mask of the mask pattern <b>26</b> of FIG. <b>47</b>A. That is, the mask pattern <b>28</b> <i>c </i>is laid out on a certain layer (data layer), and the mask pattern <b>26</b> is laid out on anther layer (data layer). And, the data of the first mask pattern <b>28</b>C of FIG. 53 is calculated to obtain the size of each auxiliary light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>2</b>, and then both the data and the data disposing the light transfer pattern in accordance with the arrangement of the above-mentioned contact hole <b>10</b> <i>a </i>are synthesized. By this method, the pattern data of the above-mentioned second mask pattern <b>28</b>B is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Divisional treatment of the mask pattern data, when the photoresist pattern for forming the contact holes <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and <b>10</b> <i>b </i>is exposed by a multi-exposing treatment, will be explained from a view point of the above-mentioned unit cell UC (see FIG. <b>48</b>), for example, as follows. That is, the data is divided into both data of the light transfer pattern located at a vertex of the unit cell UC, and data of the light transfer pattern disposed in the unit cell UC. The data of the light transfer pattern located at the vertex of the unit cell UC is regarded as data of the light transfer pattern s <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>1</b> transferred on the wafer of the second mask pattern <b>28</b>B. The data of the light transfer pattern s included in the unit cell UC is regarded as data of the first mask pattern <b>28</b>C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the multiple-exposure treatment using such first and second mask patterns <b>28</b>C and <b>28</b>B, the entire structure of the mask (see FIG. 50) and method of the multiple-exposure treatment are the same as those described above, and thus explanation thereof will be omitted.</div>

A plane dimension of each light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>5</b> is, for example, about 220×220 nm (converted to wafer size). The exposure apparatus is the same as one explained in FIG. 38, and, for example, the exposure optical conditions satisfies NA=0.68 and δ=0.30. A positive type resist film is used as a photoresist film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 59A is a plan view of an essential portion of the mask <b>26</b> used at formation of the data lines DL shown in FIG. <b>21</b> and the like described above, and FIG. 59B is a cross-sectional view taken along line A—A of FIG. 59A.

The exposure apparatus is the same as those explained in FIG. 38, and the exposure conditions satisfy NA=0.68 and δ=0.3. A negative type resist film is used as a photoresist film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, FIG. 60A is a plan view of an essential portion of the mask <b>26</b> used at formation of the through holes <b>17</b> for the information storage capacity element shown in FIG. <b>25</b> and the like described above, and FIG. 60B is a cross-sectional view taken along line A—A of FIG. 60A. A Levenson type phase shift mask is used in this case. This mask pattern <b>28</b>G has a plurality of light transfer pattern s <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>7</b>, for example, formed like a plane square. The light transfer patterns <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>7</b> are arranged along a straight line extending in the Y direction, but are not arranged on a straight line extending in the X direction and are deviated from one another alternately. Each deviation amount is less than a value of a dimension of each side of the light transfer patterns <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>7</b> extending in the Y direction. A adjacent pitch between the light transfer patterns <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>7</b> extending in the Y direction is longer than in the X direction in value. And, the phase shifter S is disposed in any one of the light transfer patterns <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>7</b> adjacent to each other. A structure of the phase shifter S is the same as the above-mentioned structure, for example, is a fine visor type trench shifter. Each plane size of the light transfer patterns <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>7</b> is, for example, about 200×200 nm (converted to wafer size). The exposure apparatus is the same one that is explained in FIG. 38, and the exposure optical conditions satisfies NA=0.68 and δ=0.30. Either stepper or scanner may be used as the exposure apparatus. A positive type resist film has used as a photoresist film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present inventors have studied a problem concerning the mask <b>26</b> used at that time. This problem will be explained. As shown in FIG. 25, patterns of the through holes <b>17</b> are periodically and densely (with small pitch) disposed. Therefore, appliance of a Levenson type phase shift mask that is effective for such a layout is considered at formation of the patterns. Here, FIG. 61 is a plan view of a mask pattern used for forming the hole pattern. In this mask pattern, a plurality of light transfer patterns <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>7</b> formed like plane square are regularly arranged. The light transfer patterns <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>7</b> are disposed at intersections between a plurality of straight lines (shown by one dot line) extending in the X direction and a plurality of straight lines extending in the Y direction. That is, the light transfer patterns <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>7</b> are arranged on the straight lines extending in both the X and Y directions. Arrangements of the light transfer patterns <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>7</b> are different from one another in pitches of the X direction and the Y direction. And, the adjacent pitch extending in the X direction is shorter than in the Y direction. Additionally, the phase shifter S is disposed in any one of the light transfer patterns <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>7</b> adjacent to each other, and thereby phase of light passing through each of the patterns is reversed to 180 degrees.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this case, the short adjacent arrangement pitch of the light transfer patterns <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>7</b> in the X direction results in excellent effect of the phase shift mask, but the long adjacent arrangement pitch of the light transfer patterns <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>7</b> in the Y direction results in no excellent effect of the phase shift mask. FIG. 62 shows each pattern dimension of the X and Y direction among the transfer patterns obtained at this time. This case shows, when the Y direction is a non-continuous direction and the X direction is a continuous direction and a dimension of the non-continuous direction (the Y direction) has a value of 1.16 μm (converted to wafer size), a value of a dimension of the continuous direction (the X direction) obtained thereby. The respective light transfer patterns <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>7</b> of FIG. 61 described above are arranged on the above-mentioned lines and have no deviation, so that the arrangement satisfies the condition that arrangement deviation amounts=0.0 μm. Therefore, as shown in FIG. 62, each dimension of the transfer patterns extending in the non-continuous direction has a value of 0.16 μm, but each dimension of the transfer patterns extending in the continuous direction (X direction) is 0.10 μm or less and thereby becomes extremely small. FIG. 63 shows values of focal depth obtained at this time. When the above-mentioned arrangement deviation amount has a value of 0.0 μm, the focal depth has a value of 0.4 μm. Thereby, it is understood that tolerance thereof is extremely small.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Now, the inventors have contrived arrangements of the light transfer patterns <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>7</b> such that positions of the light transfer patterns <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>7</b> adjacent to each other in the arrangements are deviated relatively. FIG. 64 shows this case. In this mask pattern, each position of the light transfer patterns <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>7</b> is deviated in the Y direction to a dimension Dy<b>40</b> in comparison with the case shown in FIG. <b>61</b>. In this case, each light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>7</b> is deviated to a length of the side of the Y direction. This results in enhancement of formation tolerance of each pattern. In this case, as shown in FIG. 62 described above, up to about 0.075 μm which the arrangement deviation amounts gradually increase to reach, a dimensional difference between the transfer patterns extending in the X and Y directions becomes gradually reduced. When the arrangement deviation amount has a value of about 0.075 μm, the dimensional difference between the transfer patterns extending in the X and Y directions becomes substantially zero (i.e., each plane shape of the transfer patterns is substantially perfect circle). To the contrary, if the arrangement deviation amounts exceed a value of 0.075 μm, each dimension of the transfer patterns extending in the X direction becomes larger. This is for the reasons as follows: in the where the respective light transfer patterns <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>7</b> are disposed on the straight line, one light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>7</b> has a two-direction phase-shift effect obtained from the X direction; on the other hand, by deviating the respective arrangements of the light transfer patterns <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>7</b>, the adjacent light transfer patterns <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>7</b> extending in the Y direction become close; and, as a result, interference of light therebetween is generated and one light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>7</b> obtains a three-direction phase shift effect at a certain distance. Therefore, if the respective position of the light transfer patterns <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>7</b> are deviated to some degree, each shape of the hole patterns approaches a perfect circle. The focal depth also becomes maximum when the arrangement deviation amount has a value of about 0.075 μm (corresponding to such the arrangement deviation amount that the above-mentioned pattern shape becomes substantially circular) as shown in FIG. <b>63</b>. That is, the inventors have first found that it is preferable to dispose such the light transfer patterns <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>7</b> on the mask <b>26</b> that the pattern shape approaches as close a circular as possible on the wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 65 is a plan view of an essential portion of memory cell region in the case of forming the through holes <b>17</b> by using the mask shown in FIG. <b>64</b>. Also, FIG. 66 is a cross-sectional view taken along line A—A of FIG. <b>65</b>. This drawing shows the case where the through holes <b>17</b> and lower patterns are positioned substantially precisely.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in FIGS. 65 and 66, the through holes <b>17</b> is disposed such that each center thereof coincides with each center of the contact holes <b>10</b> <i>b</i>, i.e., each of the plugs <b>11</b> <i>b</i>. In this case, although each diameter of the through holes <b>17</b> is smaller than that of the contact holes <b>10</b> <i>b</i>, each through hole <b>17</b> is close to each data line DL and alignment tolerances in both are also small. Due to this, each deviated position of the through holes <b>17</b> results in alignment of the through holes <b>17</b> with the data lines DL and occurrence of short circuit. FIG. 67 is a plan view showing the case where the through holes <b>17</b> are deviated in the Y direction to a value of about −50 nm in the structure shown in FIGS. 65 and 66. FIG. 68 is a cross-sectional view taken along line A—A of FIG. <b>67</b>. It is found that each through hole <b>17</b> is superposed on each data line DL and thereby the short circuit is caused between each data line DL and each plug <b>19</b> to be formed in each through hole <b>17</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 69 shows a relationship between between-pattern distance (from an end to the other end) dy between the data lines DL close to each other and the through holes <b>17</b> close thereto, and deviation amounts caused at formation of the patterns. The case (solid line PL) of the structure shown in FIG. <b>65</b> and the like can have only a value of about 20 nm which is extremely small even when the between-pattern dy has no alignment deviation. That is, it is found that short circuit is caused between the patterns having a arrangement deviation of about 20 nm at most. Therefore, the structure shown in FIG. <b>65</b> and the like needs extremely high precision for the positioning. But, since the deviation amount caused by alignment error generally used in the current exposure apparatus is about ±50 nm, it can be found that the alignment tolerance can be secured to form the pattern. That is, the inventors have first found that although it is preferable to deviate the respective light transfer patterns <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>7</b> on the mask <b>26</b>, excessive deviation of each pattern results in occurrence of a new problem.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">There is a means of securing the alignment tolerance or the like by reducing each diameter of the through holes <b>17</b>. For example, as shown in FIG. 70A, if each diameter of the through holes <b>17</b> has a small value of 140 nm (converted to wafer size), the between-pattern distance dy of about 40 nm can be secured and the patterns can be formed without causing short circuit at about ±50 nm which the deviation amount of the exposure apparatus has a value of. However, in this case, since the patterns are formed, the various tolerances are largely reduced. FIG. 70B shows a mask pattern of the mask <b>26</b> used for forming the transfer pattern of FIG. <b>70</b>A. An adjacent pitch between the light transfer patterns <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>7</b> which are the closest in the Y direction is, for example, a value of about 290 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 71 is a view showing a comparison between a focal depth obtained with one hole pattern, for example, having 170 nm, and a focal depth obtained with a hole pattern of 140 nm. The condition of forming the patterns is, for example, as follows: the number of aperture NA is 0.68 and the KrF excimer laser having wavelength of 248 nm is used as the exposure light. The patterns are disposed in the form of lattice with a pitch, for example, of 290 nm (converted to wafer size). The focal depth taking variation of exposure up to ±5% in consideration and obtained within an admitted dimension rage of ±10% in each dimension has a value of about 1.8 μm with a hole pattern of 170 nm. To the contrary, the focal depth is lowered to about 0.9 μm with a hole pattern of 140 nm. By this, it is understood that the focal depth which is generally required is lower than 1.0 μm. That is, the present inventors have found that reduction of each dimension of the patterns can increases the alignment tolerance between the patterns, but process tolerance required for forming each pattern could not be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Accordingly, in order to form the above-mentioned patterns, such a method is generally employed as to enhance the alignment performance of each pattern of the exposure apparatus, or increase the number of aperture NA of the projection lens, or reduce each pattern dimension by shortening the exposure wavelength. However, enhancement of performance of the exposure apparatus is required to change an exposure apparatus. This results in increase of the equipment costs and thereby of the costs of the semiconductor integrated circuit device. Since such a tendency is rapidly promoted as to fine and high integrate the patterns of the semiconductor integrated circuit device, there is an economical problem to change the exposure apparatus without depreciation. Further, the number of aperture NA of the projection lens has restriction capable of increase. Only increase in the number of aperture NA and short of the exposure wavelength can be applied to the same as described above in economy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">For this purpose, in the present invention, the alignment precision of each pattern is enhanced by further contriving the layout of each transfer pattern. As described above, each through hole <b>17</b> may electrically connect each plug <b>11</b> <i>b </i>and each lower electrode <b>24</b> <i>a </i>of the information storage capacity element <b>24</b> as a role. Further, in each through hole <b>17</b>, since the information storage capacity element <b>24</b> is within a width between the data lines DL, each through hole <b>17</b> may be arranged within a range surrounded by a pair of data lines DL. Furthermore, if electrical connection to each plug <b>11</b> <i>b </i>is taken into consideration, at least a portion of each through hole <b>17</b> may be on each plug <b>11</b> <i>b</i>. For this purpose, the patterns are initially laid out in a direction separated from each data line DL having the small alignment tolerance. By this layout, the alignment tolerance between the patterns can be secured without changing each dimension of the patterns.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">That is, even if each through hole <b>17</b> should be deviated at the time of formation thereof, each through hole <b>17</b> is disposed separately from each data line DL at design thereof such that the electrical connection of each plug <b>11</b> <i>b </i>thereto can be secured and the insulative state with each data line DL can secured. In this case, even when each through hole <b>17</b> is formed as designed without being deviated in position, a center of each through hole <b>17</b> is deviated from that of each plug <b>11</b> <i>b</i>, but each plug <b>19</b> and each plug <b>11</b> <i>b </i>are electrically connected to each other in each through hole <b>17</b> (see FIGS. 25, <b>28</b>, <b>31</b> and the like).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIG. 72 is a plane view when each through hole <b>17</b> is deviated in the Y direction, for example, to about −50 nm (converted to wafer size) in the same manner as described above in this device layout. FIG. 73 is a cross-sectional view taken along line A—A of FIG. <b>72</b>. Even in this case, it can be found that short circuit is not caused between each through hole <b>17</b> and each data line DL. Each through hole <b>17</b> is connected to each lower plug <b>11</b> <i>b </i>and satisfactory electrical characteristics can be obtained. In a relationship of the between-pattern distance dy between each through hole <b>17</b> and each data line DL, it can be found that short circuit is not caused, for example, with deviation thereof up to about 60 nm (converted to wafer size) in the case of the present invention. Therefore, by changing layout of the device and layout of the mask pattern for forming the device, even if the pattern dimension and the like are not changed (of course, dimension change (reduction) within a range capable of obtaining resolution may be performed), alignment error of the exposure apparatus could be permitted, and excellent patterns could be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A mask pattern <b>28</b>G of the mask <b>26</b> shown in FIG. 60 is formed in accordance with the above technical idea. FIG. 74A is a plan view of an essential portion of the same mask <b>26</b> shown in FIG. <b>60</b> and used for transferring the through holes <b>17</b>. FIG. 74B is a plan view of an essential portion of a transfer pattern obtained when the mask pattern shown in FIG. 74A is used. FIG. 75A is a plan view of an essential portion of a mask pattern that is deviated to a length corresponding to half of a side thereof in the Y direction. FIG. 75B is a view shown for comparing a plan view of an essential portion of transfer patterns that are actually obtained when the mask pattern of FIG. 75A is used. According to the embodiment shown in FIG. 74, it is confirmed that tolerance between the transfer patterns is increased in comparison with tolerance of FIG. <b>75</b>. When the mask pattern <b>28</b>G of the present invention is used, a satisfactory alignment tolerance between each through hole <b>17</b> and each data line DL could be ensured. Further, as compared with a case of the mask pattern having the structure of FIG. 64, the chip size can be reduced to about 12%. Further, since the alignment tolerance between each through hole <b>17</b> and each data line DL can be secured, yield of the product production could be lowered to ⅔ in comparison with the mask pattern having the structure of FIG. <b>64</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Next, an exposure technique for forming the holes <b>23</b> (forming storage capacity patterns) shown in FIG. <b>34</b> and the like, will be explained. In this case, the above-mentioned multi-exposure treatment is performed. The first mask pattern is the same as one shown in FIG. <b>59</b>. However, a wide dimension of each light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>6</b> is, for example, about 150 nm (converted to wafer size). On the other hand, FIGS. 61A and 61B show a second pattern <b>28</b>H. FIG. 76A is a plan view of an essential portion thereof, and FIG. 76B is a cross-sectional view taken along line A—A thereof. In this second mask pattern <b>28</b>H, a technique of the Levenson type phase shift mask is used. The mask pattern <b>28</b>H has band-like light shield patterns <b>26</b> <i>b </i>and light transfer pattern s <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>8</b> extending in the Y direction of FIG. <b>76</b>A. The phase shifter S is disposed in any one of the light transfer pattern s <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>8</b> and <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>8</b> adjacent to each other. A-wide dimension Dx<b>50</b> of each light-transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>8</b> is, for example, about 130 nm (converted to wafer size), and a total wide dimension Dx<b>41</b> of the light transfer pattern <b>26</b> <i>c</i> <b>8</b> and the light shield pattern <b>26</b> <i>b </i>is, for example, about 260 nm (converted to wafer size). The exposure apparatus is the same as one explained in FIG. 38, and the exposure optical conditions satisfies NA=0.68 and δ=0.30. A negative type resist film is used as a photoresist film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Typical effects of this present embodiment will be described as follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(1) At the time of exposure treatment for forming the through holes <b>17</b>, if the mask pattern <b>28</b>G shown in FIG. 60 is used, it is possible to enhance the alignment tolerance between each through hole <b>17</b> and each data line DL without deteriorating the formation control performance of each pattern and reducing the forming tolerance of each pattern.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(2) At the time of exposure treatment for forming the through holes <b>17</b>, if the mask pattern <b>28</b>G shown in FIG. 60 is used, it is possible to suppress both deterioration of the forming control performance of each pattern and reduction of the forming tolerance of each pattern.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(3) According to the above-mentioned effects (1) and (2), since each through hole <b>17</b> and each data line DL can be disposed densely, it is possible to enhance integrated degree of the memory cell.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(4) According to the above-mentioned effect (3), it is possible to enhance the performance of the DRAM.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(5) According to the above-mentioned effect (3), the size of the semiconductor chip can be reduced and thus, the DRAM can be made smaller.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(6) According to the above-mentioned effects (1), (2) and (5), it is possible to enhance production yield of the DRAM.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(7) According to the effects (5) and (6), it is possible to reduce the manufacturing cost of the DRAM.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Embodiment 2</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the above-mentioned embodiment 1, the case has been described in which the normal illumination is used in the exposure treatment using the mask <b>26</b> shown in FIG. <b>60</b>. However, the technical idea of the present invention is not limited to the normal illumination used for the exposure light source, and deformed illumination may be used as an exposure light source. Respective FIGS. 77A and 77B show one example of the deformed illumination. FIG. 77A shows a quadruple illumination. Here, four point-shaped light sources <b>33</b> are disposed symmetrically with respect to the X and Y axes. FIG. 77B shows a zone illumination. Here, a zone-shaped light source <b>34</b> is disposed. Since the case of use of such a zone illumination has higher resolution than that of the normal illumination, the pitch between the patterns can be reduced. Therefore, it is possible to enhance integrated degree of the semiconductor integrated circuit device. Since other portions are the same as those in the previous embodiment 1, explanation thereof is omitted.</div>
