<div class="description-paragraph">This is a division of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/981,415, filing date Oct. 18, 2001, A Dual Metal Gate Process: Metals and Their Silicides, assigned to the same assignee as the present invention, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,475,908.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">(1) Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates to the fabrication of integrated circuit devices, and more particularly, to a method of fabricating dual-metal transistors having different work functions in the fabrication of integrated circuits.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">(2) Description of the Prior Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">It is anticipated that a single metal gate with mid-gap work function values will not be suitable for CMOS applications due to buried channel effects. By using a single metal gate for both NMOSFET and PMOSFET, the threshold voltage becomes too high for both types of transistors. In order to achieve a lower threshold voltage, additional implantation is required and this will result in buried channel effects. The short channel effect control will then be degraded. However, with dual metal gates having different work functions, additional implantation is not required. That is, one electrode with a lower work function will be used in the NMOSFET while another electrode with a higher work function will be used for the PMOSFET. That means that the threshold voltage for NMOSFET and PMOSFET can be tailored independently. It is desired to maintain the conventional CMOS process flow in the dual metal gate process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">U.S. Pat. No. 6,043,157 to Gardner et al shows a process for forming dual gates where one gate is polysilicon and the other gate is metal. U.S. Pat. No. 5,960,270 to Misra et al discloses a process wherein the same mid-gap work function metal is used for both n- and p-gates. U.S. Pat. No. 6,083,836 to Rodder teaches a dummy gate process where two gates are formed. For example, one gate is polysilicon and the other is aluminum. U.S. Pat. No. 6,051,487 to Gardner et al teaches a dummy gate process using a polysilicon or a metal gate.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 1 through 5 are cross-sectional representations of a first preferred embodiment of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 6 through 11 are cross-sectional representations of a second preferred embodiment of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">FIGS. 12 and 13 are cross-sectional representations of two alternatives of a third preferred embodiment of the present invention.</div>
<heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention uses a metal and its metal silicide to form dual-metal gates having different work functions. In one embodiment, two different suicides of the metal are used as the dual-metal gates. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the invention should not be limited to the embodiments described herein, but can be extended and applied to any application in which it is desired to have metal gates having differing work functions. The first embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to FIGS. 1-5. The second embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to FIGS. 6-11. The third embodiment of the invention will be described with reference to FIGS. 12 and 13.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring now to FIGS. 1-5, the first preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described. Referring now more particularly to FIG. 1, there is shown a semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>. This is preferably monocrystalline silicon. Isolation regions, such as shallow trench isolation (STI) <b>12</b>, are formed in the substrate to separate active regions. N-wells and P-wells, may be formed within the substrate, as is conventional. Punchthrough and threshold voltage adjustment implantations, not shown, are made as is conventional in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">A gate dielectric layer <b>14</b> is grown or deposited over substrate to a thickness of between about 15 and 150 Angstroms. For example, the dielectric layer may be a low dielectric constant material such as silicon dioxide, nitrided silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, or their combinations. Alternatively, the dielectric layer may be a high dielectric constant gate dielectric material such as zirconium oxide, hafnium oxide, aluminum oxide, tantalum pentoxide, barium strontium titanates, and crystalline oxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring now to FIG. 2, a metal layer <b>16</b> is formed over the gate dielectric layer to a thickness of between about 500 and 3000 Angstroms. The metal layer <b>16</b> may be formed by sputtering, evaporation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), or electroplating. The deposited metal can be platinum, titanium, nickel, cobalt, tantalum, molybdenum, tungsten, zirconium, hafnium, vanadium, palladium, or chromium.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Now, the metal layer is masked <b>20</b>, as shown in FIG. 3, to expose a region where the metal will be silicided. Silicon ions are implanted <b>24</b> into the metal layer <b>16</b> where it is not covered by the mask <b>20</b>. Silicon ions are implanted with a dosage of between about 5 E 15 to 5 E 17 ions/cm<sup>2 </sup>and an energy of between about 1 to 50 KeV. It is important that the masking layer is thick enough to protect the underlying metal layer from implantation. The silicidation process is now to be accomplished by annealing in an inert gas ambient. Annealing can be performed in a furnace, rapid thermal process (RTP), or a laser system. The photomask must be removed prior to annealing in the inert gas. Silicided metal region <b>28</b> is the result of the silicidation process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring now to FIG. 4, the metal and metal silicide layers, <b>16</b> and <b>28</b>, respectively, are patterned to form gate electrodes. A chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process may be applied to achieve planarization. In one embodiment, the silicide <b>28</b> is patterned to form the first gate electrode and, subsequently, the metal layer is patterned to form the second gate electrode. In another embodiment, both gate electrodes are defined and etched at the same time. The etching can be achieved by alternating chemistry <b>1</b> and chemistry <b>2</b> with time and using a high selectivity etch chemistry when the etch process is getting close to the end point, with chemistry <b>1</b> having a higher etch rate for silicide and chemistry <b>2</b> having a higher etch rate for the metal, or vice versa. Thus, metal gates <b>16</b> and <b>28</b>, having different work functions, are realized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The metal silicide gate <b>28</b> may have a higher or lower work function than the metal gate <b>16</b> depending on the metal used. The PMOS gate will be the gate having the higher work function and the NMOS gate will be the gate having the lower work function.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring now to FIG. 5, source/drain regions <b>30</b> and sidewall spacers <b>32</b> may be formed, as is conventional. The spacers <b>32</b> may comprise either silicon nitride or silicon oxide. Processing continues as is conventional in the art, except that silicidation over the gates is not required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The second preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to FIGS. 6-11. This embodiment is a damascene gate process. Referring now more particularly to FIG. 6, there is shown a semiconductor substrate <b>10</b>. This is preferably monocrystalline silicon. Isolation regions, such as shallow trench isolation (STI) <b>12</b>, are formed in the substrate to separate active regions. N-wells and P-wells may be formed within the substrate, as is conventional. Punchthrough and threshold voltage adjustment implantations, not shown, are made as is conventional in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Dummy gates are formed. A first layer of silicon oxide <b>42</b> is deposited over the substrate to a thickness of between about 15 and 150 Angstroms. A layer of silicon nitride <b>44</b> is deposited over the silicon oxide layer <b>42</b> to a thickness of between about 15 and 200 Angstroms. A layer of polysilicon <b>46</b> is deposited over the silicon nitride layer <b>44</b> to a thickness of between about 500 and 3000 Angstroms. The dummy gate stack is patterned to form a dummy gate <b>50</b> in each of the active areas, as shown in FIG. <b>6</b>. Sidewall spacers <b>54</b> and source/drain regions <b>52</b> are formed as is conventional in the art. Now, an interlevel dielectric layer. <b>58</b> is deposited over the dummy gates and planarized to the top of the dummy gates by CMP.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in FIG. 7, the dummy gates <b>50</b> are removed where they are exposed by the CMP process. The dummy gates are removed by wet etching, dry etching, or a combination of the two.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Now, the dual-metal gates of the present invention are to be formed. A gate dielectric layer <b>60</b> is deposited or thermally grown on the exposed substrate surface within the gate openings to a thickness of between about 15 and 150 Angstroms, as shown in FIG. <b>8</b>. As in the first embodiment, the dielectric layer may be a low dielectric constant material such as silicon dioxide, nitrided silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, or their combinations or a high dielectric constant gate dielectric material such as zirconium oxide, hafnium oxide, aluminum oxide, tantalum pentoxide, barium strontium titanates and crystalline oxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Referring now to FIG. 9, a metal layer <b>62</b> is formed over the gate dielectric layer <b>60</b>. The metal layer <b>62</b> may be deposited by sputtering or CVD, for example. The deposited metal can be platinum, titanium, nickel, cobalt, tantalum, molybdenum, tungsten, zirconium, hafnium, vanadium, palladium, or chromium. A CMP process polishes away the metal layer not within the gate openings, thus completing the damascene process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Now, as shown in FIG. 10, a photomask <b>65</b> is formed to cover the intermetal dielectric layer <b>58</b> and the first gate. An opening is formed in the photomask to expose only the second gate that is to be silicided. Silicon ions are implanted <b>69</b> by a low energy implanter into the second gate where it is not covered by the mask <b>65</b>. Silicon ions are implanted with a dosage of between about 5 E 15 to 5 E 17 ions/cm<sup>2 </sup>and an energy of between about 1 to 50 KeV. It is important that the masking layer is thick enough to protect the first gate from implantation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">After stripping the photomask <b>65</b>, an annealing step in an inert gas or a vacuum is performed to form a silicide from the silicon-implanted metal <b>72</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in FIG. 11, metal gates <b>62</b> and <b>72</b>, having different work functions, are realized. Gate <b>62</b> comprises a metal while gate <b>72</b> comprises metal silicide. The gate electrode with the higher work function will be the PMOSFET while the gate electrode with the lower work function will be the NMOSFET.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The work functions of the gate electrodes of the first two embodiments have been measured as shown in Table 1. The resistivity of almost all metals and their silicides is much lower than the resistivity of polysilicon.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph">The dual-metal gate can also be realized by adjusting the work function of the silicides since the work function of the metal suicides is closely related to the stoichiometry. That is, one gate electrode will be in the form of MSi<sub>X </sub>while the other gate electrode will be in the form of MSi<sub>Y</sub>, where M is a metal which can be platinum, titanium, nickel, cobalt, tantalum, molybdenum, tungsten, zirconium, hafnium, vanadium, palladium, or chromium, and X is not equal to Y. The value of X and Y can be well adjusted by the implantation dose. The methods described for the first and second embodiments can also be used in this third embodiment dual-gate process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in FIG. 12, the conventional gate formation process described in the first embodiment can be used to form the two gates MSi<sub>X </sub>and MSi<sub>Y</sub>. The metal layer can be implanted with two different dosages of silicon ions to form these two metal silicide gates having different work functions. For example, a first silicon ion dosage of between about 1 E 15 and 1 E 16 ions/cm<sup>2 </sup>will form a gate having a lower work function and a second silicon ion dosage of between about 1 E 16 and 1 E 17 ions/cm<sup>2 </sup>will form a gate having a higher work function.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Alternatively, instead of depositing an elemental metal layer for gate electrode <b>1</b>, a silicide with a certain M/Si ratio can be deposited by CVD or sputtering. This will form the first gate electrode MS<sub>X</sub>. The stoichiometry of the second electrode MS<sub>Y </sub>can be adjusted by the silicon ion implantation as described with for the first embodiment. For example, the silicon concentration of the first gate electrode having a lower work function is between about 1 E 21 and 1 E 22 ions/cm<sup>3 </sup>and the silicon concentration of the second gate electrode having a higher work function is between about 1 E 22 and 1 E 23 ions/cm<sup>3</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As shown in FIG. 13, the damascene gate process described in the second embodiment can be used to form the two gates MS<sub>X </sub>and MS<sub>Y</sub>. The gates will each be implanted with different dosages of silicon ions to form these two metal silicide gates having different work functions. Again, As an alternative, instead of depositing an elemental metal layer for gate electrode <b>1</b>, a silicide with a certain M/Si ratio can be deposited by CVD or sputtering. This will form the first gate electrode MSi<sub>X</sub>. The stoichiometry of the second electrode MS<sub>Y </sub>can be adjusted by the silicon ion implantation as described with for the second embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The process of the present invention provides three simple, manufacturable dual-metal gate processes. The conventional CMOS process flow is maintained. The work function of the gates is simply tuned by the silicidation process. The dual-metal gates comprise a metal and a metal silicide, or two metal silicides having different work functions. The metal silicide having the higher work function will be used for the PMOS gate and the metal silicide having the lower work function will be used for the NMOS gate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to the preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</div>
