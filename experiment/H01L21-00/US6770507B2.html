<heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">The present invention relates to a bonded semiconductor wafer having a layered structure alternately stacked with semiconductor layers and insulator layers in two cycles or more and to a novel manufacturing process therefor.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the technical progress in miniaturization of LSI (Large Scale Integrated circuit) devices in recent years, more perfect isolation, a higher operating speed and higher performance have been pursued and attention has been given to an SOI (Silicon-On-Insulator) wafer as material satisfying such demands.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">There has been known a wafer bonding process as one of the manufacturing techniques for an SOI wafer. As a technique utilizing this bonding process, a so-called ion implantation separation process (also called a Smart-Cut (a registered trade mark) process) has been developed, which is described in JP A 93-211128.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This ion implantation separation process is a technique wherein an oxide film is formed on at least one of two silicon wafers, hydrogen gas ions or rare gas ions are implanted into one silicon wafer through an upper surface thereof to form a micro-bubble layer (an enclosed layer) within the interior of the one silicon wafer, thereafter the ion implanted surface is put into close contact with the other wafer with the oxide film interposed therebetween, then heat treatment (separation heat treatment) is applied to the wafers in close contact to separate the one wafer in such a manner that the contact portion is partly left in a state of a thin film at the micro-bubble layer performing as a cleavage plane (a separation plane), and heat treatment (bonding heat treatment) is further applied to the other wafer with the thin film left thereon to reinforce bonding between the surfaces in close contact and thereby manufacture an SOI wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In this process, an SOI wafer is obtained with relative ease in which the separated surface is a good mirror surface and the SOI layer is very high in uniformity. This process is also advantageous in that a raw material can be effectively used since one wafer partly removed by separation can be reused. Furthermore, this process makes it possible that two silicon wafers can be bonded directly with each other without an oxide film interposed therebetween, not limited to the case where two silicon wafers are bonded together, the ion implanted silicon wafer is bonded to an insulator wafer having a different thermal expansion coefficient such as of quartz, silicon carbide and alumina, or by selecting a material other than silicon as a wafer to be ion implanted, a bonded wafer having a thin film of the material can be manufactured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">With the advent of the ion implantation separation process, there is solved a problem of film thickness uniformity which is the greatest problem in a bonded semiconductor wafer, and it has been possible to manufacture a bonded SOI wafer with a film thickness uniformity as excellent as 1 nm or less in film thickness standard deviation across a surface of the SOI layer. This process has made possible application of a bonded SOI wafer to an LSI such as a CMOS as a leading device, which requires an SOI layer in the form of an ultra-thin film and excellent film thickness uniformity, in addition to its conventional applications to a BiCMOS and a power IC.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">While an SOI wafer to be used in the above-mentioned applications is of a structure including a single SOI layer formed on a buried oxide film, the applicant of the present application has proposed a technique in a previous application (JP A 99-316154) that the ion implantation separation process is adopted to form a bonded semiconductor wafer alternately stacked with two kinds of layers having different refractive indexes such as a combination of an SOI layer and a buried oxide film in two cycles or more and the bonded silicon wafer is utilized in an optical functional device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">This technique is to cultivate a field where the bonded semiconductor wafer is utilized in an optical functional device such as a waveguide, an optical communication modulator, an optical detector or a laser, and very useful. Especially, an SOI wafer having the simplest two cycle layered structure in such layered structures makes advantageously possible that an upper SOI layer is utilized in fabrication of an LSI while an lower SOI layer is utilized as an optical waveguide or a wiring layer, thereby facilitating three-dimensional wiring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Description will be given of examples of prior art steps for manufacturing a bonded semiconductor wafer having a two cycle layered structure by use of the ion implantation separation process on the basis of FIGS. 4 and 5. FIG. 4 is a flow chart showing an example of a prior art manufacturing process for a bonded semiconductor wafer. FIG. 5 is a flow chart showing another example of a prior art manufacturing process for a bonded semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In FIG. 4, first of all, there are prepared a semiconductor wafer A having an insulator film or an insulator layer <b>10</b> <i>a </i>on a surface thereof and a semiconductor wafer B having no insulator film on a surface thereof. Hydrogen (or rare gas) ions are implanted into the wafer A to form a micro-bubble layer <b>12</b> <i>a </i>in the interior of the wafer A. The wafer A with the micro-bubble layer <b>12</b> <i>a </i>is bonded to the wafer B with the insulator film <b>10</b> <i>a </i>interposed therebetween at room temperature to form a bonded wafer <b>15</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When the bonded wafer <b>15</b> is heat treated, cracking occurs in the wafer A at the micro-bubble layer <b>12</b> <i>a </i>due to strain to form an SOI wafer <b>16</b> with a one cycle layered structure in which the insulator layer <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and a semiconductor layer <b>14</b> <i>a </i>are formed on the wafer B. As opposed to the SOI wafer <b>16</b> with a one cycle layered structure, there is further prepared a wafer C having an insulator film or an insulator layer <b>10</b> <i>b </i>on a surface thereof, hydrogen (or rare gas) ions are implanted into the wafer C to form a micro-bubble layer <b>12</b> <i>b </i>in the interior of the wafer C. The wafer C with the micro-bubble layer <b>12</b> <i>b </i>is bonded to the SOI wafer <b>16</b> at room temperature to form a bonded wafer <b>17</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When the bonded wafer <b>17</b> is heat treated, cracking occurs in the wafer C at the micro-bubble layer <b>12</b> <i>b </i>to form an SOI wafer <b>18</b> with a two cycle layered structure in which the insulator layer <b>10</b> <i>b </i>and the semiconductor layer <b>14</b> <i>b </i>constituting the second cycle layered structure are formed on the first cycle layered structure (the insulator layer <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and the semiconductor layer <b>14</b> <i>a</i>) of the SOI wafer <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In another example of a prior art process shown in FIG. 5, a manufacturing process goes according to the same steps as in FIG. 4 till the first cycle layered structure is formed on a wafer B and as opposed to the SOI wafer <b>16</b> there is further prepared a wafer C having an insulator film or an insulator layer <b>10</b> <i>b </i>on a surface thereof In this prior art example, hydrogen (or rare gas) ions are implanted into the SOI wafer <b>16</b> to form a micro-bubble layer <b>12</b> <i>c </i>in the interior of the SOI wafer <b>16</b> instead of ion implantation on the wafer C in FIG. <b>4</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Then, the SOI wafer <b>16</b> is bonded to the wafer C with the insulator film <b>10</b> <i>b </i>interposed therebetween at room temperature to form a bonded wafer <b>17</b>. When the bonded wafer <b>17</b> is heat treated, cracking occurs in the wafer C due to strain at the micro-bubble layer <b>12</b> <i>c</i>, and the insulator layer <b>10</b> <i>b </i>and a semiconductor layer <b>14</b> <i>c </i>are further formed in addition to the one cycle layered structure (the insulator layer <b>10</b> <i>a </i>and the semiconductor layer <b>14</b> <i>a</i>) of the SOI wafer <b>16</b> to complete an SOI wafer <b>18</b> having a two cycle layered structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">As described above, in any of the manufacturing processes of FIGS. 4 and 5, there are necessarily repeated two times the hydrogen (or rare gas) ion implantation step and the bonding step, respectively. Furthermore, at least two heat treatment steps are required for separation heat treatment, and when separation heat treatment and bonding heat treatment are separately performed, further heat treatment steps are added.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In manufacturing the bonded semiconductor wafer having such a layered structure, however, there has to be repeated the bonding step requiring the severest process control for the purpose to improve the manufacture yield, so the manufacturing processes are neither simple nor convenient, resulting in high frequency in occurrence of defective products in the bonding steps.</div>

<heading>BEST MODE FOR THE CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph">Description will be given of embodiments of the present invention taking up an SOI wafer having a two cycle layered structure as an example below on the basis of FIGS. 1 to <b>3</b> among the accompanying drawings. It is needless to say that various modifications or alterations of the embodiments can be carried out as far as not departing from the technical concept of the present invention. FIG. 1 is a flow chart showing a first embodiment of a manufacturing process for a bonded semiconductor wafer of the present invention. FIG. 2 is a flow chart showing a second embodiment of a manufacturing process for a bonded semiconductor wafer of the present invention. FIG. 3 is a flow chart showing a third embodiment of a manufacturing process for a bonded semiconductor wafer of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the first embodiment of the present invention shown in FIG. 1, first of all, a first semiconductor wafer A (for example, a silicon wafer) having no insulator film and a second semiconductor wafer B (for example, a silicon wafer) having an insulator film or an insulator layer (for example, an oxide film) <b>20</b> <i>b </i>are prepared. Two kinds of ions, oxygen ions and hydrogen ions (or rare gas ions), are implanted into the wafer A. By these ion implantation steps, an oxygen ion implanted layer <b>20</b> <i>a </i>and a hydrogen ion implanted layer (a micro-bubble layer) <b>22</b> <i>a </i>are formed in the interior of the wafer A. In this case, while an implantation depth of hydrogen ions (or rare gas ions) is required to be deeper than that of oxygen ions, there is no specific limitation as to which of both of the ion implantation steps is to be first performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Then, the ion implanted wafer A is bonded to the wafer B with the insulator layer <b>20</b> <i>b </i>interposed therebetween to form a bonded wafer <b>26</b>. This bonding step is to be performed in a clean atmosphere at room temperature. After that, the bonded wafer <b>26</b> is heat treated. By this heat treatment, the oxygen implanted layer <b>20</b> <i>a </i>is changed to an oxide film layer, that is, an insulator layer <b>20</b> <i>c</i>, and a portion of the wafer A is separated from the bonded wafer <b>26</b> at the hydrogen ion implanted layer (a micro-bubble layer) <b>22</b> <i>a</i>. By this separation, there is manufactured a bonded semiconductor wafer having a two cycle layered structure (the insulator layer <b>20</b> <i>b</i>, a semiconductor layer <b>24</b> <i>a</i>, the insulator layer <b>20</b> <i>c </i>and a semiconductor layer <b>24</b> <i>b</i>), that is, an SOI wafer <b>28</b> having the two cycle layered structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">When the bonded wafer <b>26</b> is heat treated, low temperature heat treatment at temperature on the order of 400 to 600° C. is sufficient if the heat treatment is performed only for the purpose of separation of the first wafer A, but in order to make the oxygen ion implanted layer <b>20</b> <i>a </i>and the SOI layer adjacent thereto good in quality, heat treatment at temperature of 1300° C. or higher is usually required. Therefore, the film quality improving heat treatment and the separation heat treatment can be concurrently performed in high temperature heat treatment, omitting the low temperature separation heat treatment. In the embodiment of FIG. 1, there is shown the case where the oxygen ion implanted layer <b>20</b> <i>a </i>is changed to an oxide film layer (an insulator layer) <b>20</b> <i>c. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to the first embodiment shown in FIG. 1, compared with the prior art processes shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, only one bonding step is required and the number of heat treatment steps can also be reduced; therefore, a manufacturing process becomes simpler and more convenient and defective products in the bonding step can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the second embodiment of the present invention shown in FIG. 2, similar to the case of FIG. 1, first of all, a first semiconductor wafer A (for example, a silicon wafer) having no insulator film and a second semiconductor wafer B (for example, a silicon wafer) having an insulator film or an insulator layer (for example, an oxide film) <b>20</b> <i>b </i>are prepared. Oxygen ions are implanted into the wafer A to form an oxygen implanted layer <b>20</b> <i>a </i>in the interior thereof. Hydrogen ions (or rare gas ions) are implanted into the wafer B to form an hydrogen ion implanted layer (a micro-bubble layer) <b>22</b> <i>a </i>in the interior thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Then, the wafer A implanted with oxygen ions is bonded to the wafer B implanted with hydrogen ions with the insulator film <b>20</b> <i>b </i>interposed therebetween to form a bonded wafer <b>26</b>. Following to this, the bonded wafer <b>26</b> is heat treated. By this heat treatment, the oxygen ion implanted layer <b>20</b> <i>a </i>is changed to an oxide layer, that is, an insulator layer <b>20</b> <i>c</i>, and a portion of the wafer B is also separated from the bonded wafer <b>26</b> at the hydrogen ion implanted layer (the micro-bubble layer) <b>22</b> <i>b</i>. By this separation, there is manufactured a bonded semiconductor wafer having a two cycle layered structure (the insulator layer <b>20</b> <i>c</i>, a semiconductor layer <b>24</b> <i>a</i>, the insulator layer <b>20</b> <i>b </i>and a semiconductor layer <b>24</b> <i>b</i>), that is, an SOI wafer <b>28</b> having the two cycle layered structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">According to the second embodiment shown in FIG. 2 as well, only one bonding step is required and the number of heat treatment steps can also be reduced; therefore, a manufacturing process becomes simpler and more convenient and defective products in the bonding step can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">The third embodiment of the present invention shown in FIG. 3 is a modification of FIG. 1, and similar to the case of FIG. 1, first of all, a first semiconductor wafer A (for example, a silicon wafer) having no insulator film and a second semiconductor wafer B (for example, a silicon wafer) having an insulator film or an insulator layer (for example, an oxide film) <b>20</b> <i>b </i>are prepared. Oxygen ions are implanted into the wafer A to form an oxygen ion implanted layer <b>20</b> <i>a </i>in the interior thereof, and thereafter high temperature heat treatment is applied thereto to form an SOI wafer <b>25</b> having a one cycle layered structure (an insulator layer <b>20</b> <i>c </i>and a semiconductor layer <b>24</b> <i>a</i>). That is, an SOI wafer according to the so-called SIMOX (Separation by IMplanted OXygen) method is once manufactured and thereafter, hydrogen ions are implanted on the SOI wafer, followed by the below described steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Hydrogen ions (or rare gas ions) are implanted into the SOI wafer <b>25</b> in which the one cycle layered structure is formed to form a hydrogen ion implanted layer (a micro-bubble layer) <b>22</b> <i>c </i>in the interior thereof. Then, the SOI wafer <b>25</b> thus implanted with hydrogen ions is bonded to the wafer B with an insulator film <b>20</b> <i>b </i>interposed therebetween to form a bonded wafer <b>26</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Then, the bonded wafer <b>26</b> is heat treated and thereby, a portion of the wafer A is separated from the bonded wafer <b>26</b> at a hydrogen ion implanted layer (a micro-bubble layer) <b>22</b> <i>c</i>. By this separation, there is provided a bonded semiconductor wafer having a two cycle layered structure (the insulator layer <b>20</b> <i>b</i>, a semiconductor layer <b>24</b> <i>a</i>, the insulator layer <b>20</b> <i>c </i>and a semiconductor layer <b>24</b> <i>b</i>), that is, an SOI wafer <b>28</b> having the two cycle layered structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">In the third embodiment of the present invention shown in FIG. 3, only one bonding step is required; therefore, a manufacturing process becomes simpler and more convenient and defective products in the bonding step can also be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Note that while in each of FIGS. 1 to <b>3</b>, the insulator film or the insulator layer (for example, an oxide film) <b>20</b> <i>b </i>prior to the bonding is formed on the wafer B, the insulator film <b>20</b> <i>b </i>may be formed on either surface or both surfaces of the A and B wafers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph">Furthermore, a layered structure of 3 cycles or more can be obtained by the following procedures; for example, a hydrogen ion implanted wafer (a wafer similar to the wafer B of FIG. 2) separately prepared is bonded to the surface of the SOI wafer <b>28</b> having a two cycle layered structure obtained according to any of the manufacturing processes of FIGS. 1 to <b>3</b> and then separation heat treatment step is successively performed, or SOI wafers having multi-cycle layered structure are bonded together at respective surfaces thereof with the insulator film interposed therebetween.</div>
