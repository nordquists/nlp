<heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00009">The present invention together with the above and other objects and advantages may best be understood from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments of the invention illustrated in the drawings, wherein:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00010"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a side view of an exemplary starting structure for forming a quadruple density sidewall image transfer (SIT) structure in accordance with a method of the preferred embodiment; and</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00011"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B, and <b>3</b>-<b>9</b> are side views not to scale illustrating exemplary steps of a method for forming a quadruple density sidewall image transfer (SIT) structure starting with the exemplary starting structure of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in accordance with the preferred embodiment.</div>
</description-of-drawings>
<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00012">Sidewall Image Transfer (SIT) techniques form conductors with very narrow widths or semiconductor devices with very short gate lengths without using critical photolithography. Sidewall Image Transfer has been proposed as a way to produce well-controlled images having sub-lithographic dimensions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00013">Use of sidewall spacers to define feature dimensions offers an opportunity to build two shapes using each starting shape since each starting shape, for example, printed using standard lithography, has two edges. Resulting features thus can have half the pitch possible using the same lithographic tools in a conventional printing process. It is desirable to extend the frequency doubling opportunity to even smaller dimensions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00014">In accordance with features of the preferred embodiment, an extension of the sidewall image transfer (SIT) approach is provided to enable formation of four well-controlled lines for each lithographically minimum pitch dimension. The method of the preferred embodiment is to employ spacers-on-spacers, with one spacer formed utilizing oxidation to better balance line space sizes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00015">Referring now to the drawings, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> there is shown an exemplary starting structure generally designated by the reference character <b>100</b> for forming a quadruple density sidewall image transfer (SIT) structure in accordance with the preferred embodiment. The exemplary starting structure <b>100</b> includes a substrate <b>102</b>, such as a silicon substrate <b>102</b>, a gate dielectric layer <b>104</b> and a gate conductor <b>106</b>, such as polysilicon or gate conductor poly <b>106</b>. Formed over the gate conductor poly layer <b>106</b> of the exemplary starting structure <b>100</b> includes an oxide hardmask layer <b>108</b>, a poly etch stop layer <b>110</b>, a first nitride layer <b>112</b>, and a poly mandrel layer <b>114</b>, such as polysilicon mandrel layer <b>114</b> capped with a second, thinner nitride layer <b>116</b>. It should be understood that other materials than polysilicon that are partially consumed in formation of the edge material could be used for the poly mandrel layer <b>114</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00016"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> illustrates a print mandrel mask step generally designated by the reference character <b>200</b> with a respective pair of photoresist features <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>; and <b>202</b>A, <b>204</b>A formed on top of the exemplary starting structure <b>100</b> in accordance with the preferred embodiment. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the photoresist feature <b>202</b> has a width indicated by an arrow labeled F and is spaced apart from the photoresist feature <b>204</b> by a distance indicated by an arrow labeled F, for example, representing a lithographically minimum pitch dimension. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the photoresist features <b>202</b>A, <b>204</b>A are illustrated corresponding to a next processing step of FIG. <b>3</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00017"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a next step of the method generally designated by the reference character <b>300</b> where the nitride layer <b>116</b> and the poly mandrel features <b>114</b> are etched corresponding to the photoresist features <b>202</b>A, <b>204</b>A and the photoresist features <b>202</b>A, <b>204</b>A are stripped.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00018">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in a next step of the method generally designated by the reference character <b>400</b> an oxide <b>402</b> is grown on each sidewall of the etched first mandrels <b>114</b>. These oxides <b>402</b> defining oxide spacers form a second mandrel <b>402</b>. The nitride films <b>112</b>, <b>116</b> protect the second poly etch stop layer <b>110</b> and the top of the first mandrel <b>114</b> from oxidation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00019"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a next optional step of the method generally designated by the reference character <b>500</b>. The grown oxide spacer mandrel <b>402</b> may not have an ideal profile where it meets the underlying nitride layer <b>112</b>, and the grown oxide spacer mandrel <b>402</b> may not adhere properly to the underlying nitride <b>112</b>. To alleviate this difficulty, while the grown oxide spacer mandrel <b>402</b> is still attached to the first poly mandrel <b>114</b>, a thin oxide generally designated by the reference character <b>502</b>, such as a thin Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) oxide <b>502</b> optionally is deposited and etched, if required, to fill any possible undercut profile of the thermally grown oxide spacer second mandrel <b>402</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00020">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in a next step of the method generally designated by the reference character <b>600</b>, directional etching, such as RIE, is performed to remove the nitride film <b>116</b>. The directional etching is stopped before breaking through the nitride film <b>112</b> and then the poly first mandrel <b>114</b> is removed. Poly removal can be done either all wet or dry poly removal with an isotropic component to guarantee full removal of the polysilicon mandrel <b>114</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00021"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a sidewall spacer forming step <b>700</b> employing spacers-on-spacers in accordance with the preferred embodiment. A plurality of sidewall spacers <b>702</b> are formed using any suitable technique, such as by conformal deposition and directional etch of a nitride layer. Each sidewall spacer <b>702</b> is relatively thin. The sidewall spacers <b>702</b> are formed on sidewalls of each thermally grown oxide spacer second mandrel <b>402</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00022">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in a next step of the method generally designated by the reference character <b>800</b>, the thermally grown oxide spacer second mandrel <b>402</b> is removed. The remainder of the nitride oxidation/etch-stop layers <b>112</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>108</b> then is removed by Reactive Ion Etching (RIE), while maintaining the profile and width of the nitride spacers <b>702</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00023">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, in a final step of the method generally designated by the reference character <b>900</b>, a pattern <b>902</b> of the nitride spacers <b>702</b> is transferred into the poly etch stop layer <b>110</b> and the oxide hardmask layer <b>108</b>, and the nitride layer <b>112</b> is stripped. Produced now is the desired quadruple density (oxide) hardmask for gate conductor etch.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00024">As is obvious to a person skilled in the art, the described method forms loops of only one dimension. Conventional SIT processing includes two additional masks of which the first mask trims the loops and the second mask adds larger shapes of any desired dimension. It should be understood that these conventional two additional masks apply to the method of the preferred embodiment also.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="P-00025">While the present invention has been described with reference to the details of the embodiments of the invention shown in the drawing, these details are not intended to limit the scope of the invention as claimed in the appended claims.</div>
