<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates to a revolution member supporting apparatus for holding and rotating a disc-shaped object (object to be rotated) such as a semiconductor wafer. The present invention also relates to a semiconductor substrate processing apparatus for forming circuit interconnects by filling a circuit pattern trench and/or hole formed in a semiconductor substrate with a plated metal film, and removing the plated metal film while leaving the metal film at the filled portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">For example, a semiconductor wafer, which has undergone a copper-plating treatment or a CMP (chemical mechanical polishing) treatment, is generally subjected to a cleaning treatment. The cleaning treatment is usually performed by supplying a cleaning liquid onto the upper surface of a semiconductor wafer around its center, while the wafer is being held horizontally and rotated by a revolution member supporting apparatus, and allowing the cleaning liquid to diffuse radially over the upper surface of the wafer by the action of centrifugal force.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">It is usual with such a revolution member supporting apparatus to hold a semiconductor wafer by engaging the periphery of the wafer with a plurality of holding members.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">In conventional revolution member supporting apparatuses, such holding members always engage certain fixed portions in the periphery of a semiconductor wafer when the wafer is held and rotated. Accordingly, there has been the problem that a cleaning liquid cannot reach adequately into the engaging portions, and therefore a satisfactory cleaning treatment cannot be carried out.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">An attempt has been made to solve this problem by making a change of holding members during a cleaning treatment. According to this approach, for example, two pairs of holding members, each pair consisting of three members, are provided, and a semiconductor wafer is allowed to be held by each of the two pairs separately by exchanging one pair for the other according to the rotating speed of the apparatus. This approach, however, has the problem that since the number of holding members in engagement with a semiconductor wafer is relatively small, the wafer cannot be held sufficiently firmly, whereby slipping of the wafer at the engaging portions is likely to occur. This may wear the holding members and produce particles that contaminate the semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">Generally, aluminum or aluminum alloys have been used as a material for forming interconnection circuits on a semiconductor substrate. The higher integrated density of semiconductor devices requires that a material having a higher electric conductivity should be used for interconnection circuits. Thus, there has been proposed a method which comprises plating a surface of a semiconductor substrate having a circuit pattern trench and/or hole formed therein to fill Cu (copper) or copper alloy into the circuit pattern trench and/or hole, and removing the Cu or copper alloy with the exception of the filled portion, thereby forming circuit interconnects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">The above method of forming circuit interconnects will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A through 1C</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a conductive layer <b>101</b> <i>a </i>is formed on a semiconductor substrate <b>101</b> on which semiconductor devices are formed, and an oxide film <b>102</b> of SiO<sub>2 </sub>is deposited on the conductive layer <b>101</b> <i>a</i>. Then, a via hole <b>103</b> and a trench <b>104</b> for an interconnect are formed in the oxide film <b>2</b> by lithography and etching technology. Thereafter, a barrier layer <b>105</b> of TiN or the like is formed thereon, and then a seed layer <b>107</b> as an electric supply layer for electroplating is formed on the barrier layer <b>105</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">Then, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the surface of the semiconductor substrate W is coated with copper by electroplating to deposit a plated copper film <b>106</b> on the oxide film <b>102</b>, thus filling the via hole <b>103</b> and the trench <b>104</b> with copper. Thereafter, the plated copper film <b>106</b> and the barrier layer <b>105</b> on the oxide film <b>102</b> are removed by chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), thus making the plated copper film <b>106</b> in the via hole <b>103</b> and the trench <b>104</b> lie flush with the oxide film <b>102</b>. In this manner, an interconnect composed of the plated copper film <b>106</b> is produced as shown in FIG. <b>1</b>C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">In this case, the barrier layer <b>105</b> is formed so as to cover a substantially entire surface of the oxide film <b>102</b>, and the seed layer <b>107</b> is also formed so as to cover a substantially entire surface of the barrier layer <b>105</b>. Thus, in some cases, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a copper film which is the seed layer <b>107</b> resides in a bevel (outer peripheral portion) of the semiconductor substrate W, or copper is deposited on an edge (outer peripheral portion) inwardly of the bevel of the semiconductor substrate W and remains unpolished (not shown in the drawing).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">Copper can easily be diffused into the oxide film <b>102</b> in a semiconductor fabrication process such as annealing, for example, thus deteriorating the electric insulation of the oxide film and impairing the adhesiveness of the oxide film with a film to be subsequently deposited to possibly cause separation of the deposited film. It is therefore necessary to remove the remaining unnecessary copper completely from the substrate before at least film deposition. Furthermore, copper deposited on the outer peripheral portion of the substrate other than the circuit formation area is not only unnecessary, but may cause cross contamination in subsequent processes of delivering, storing and processing the semiconductor substrate. For these reasons, it is necessary that the remaining deposited copper on the peripheral portion of the substrate should be completely removed immediately after the copper film deposition process orthe CMP process. Here, the outer peripheral portion of the substrate is defined as an area including an edge and a bevel of the semiconductor substrate W, or either the edge or the bevel. The edge of the substrate means areas of the front and back surfaces of the semiconductor substrate W within about 5 mm from the outer peripheral end of the substrate, and the bevel of the substrate means an area of the outer peripheral end surface and a curved portion in a cross section of the semiconductor substrate W within 0.5 mm from the outer peripheral end of the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">Recently, a so-called dry-in dry-out configuration in which a substrate is introduced in a dry state and removed in a dry state is employed in a plating apparatus for performing Cu plating of copper interconnection, and a polishing apparatus for performing chemical mechanical polishing. The apparatuses have such structure that after respective processing steps such as plating or polishing are performed, particles are removed and dried by a cleaning unit and a spin-drying unit, and the semiconductor substrate is taken out in a dry state from the respective apparatuses. In this manner, the plating apparatus and the polishing apparatus perform many common processes, which are essentially successive processes. Thus, there have been problems that the initial cost and the running cost for the apparatuses are high, installation spaces for installation of both apparatuses need to be wide, and a long processing time is required.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">Currently, the driving force for semiconductor devices is changing from work stations and personal computers to digital information household electric appliances (game machines, cellular phones, digital still cameras, DVD, car navigation instruments, digital video cameras, and the like). Under these circumstances, LSI production also needs to respond to changes from general purpose LSIs used in personal computers, and the like, to system LSIs required for digital information household electric appliances.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">These system LSIs are characterized by a wide variety of products, low volume production, great fluctuations in the number of products made, and a short life of product, as compared with general purpose LSIs. In order to reduce the instrument costs of digital information household electrical appliances, it is indispensable to reduce the manufacturing cost for LSIs. In semiconductor production plants as well, it is demanded to shift from the concept of large scale lines to the possession of many types of small scale lines, and minimize the production time rather than the amount of production. In order to cope with these demands, it is demanded for future semiconductor device production to respond quickly to the needs of instrument manufacturers and place semiconductor devices on the production lines as promptly as possible. Besides, since changes in demand are drastic, it is necessary that functional changes can be made flexibly, or the apparatus can be renewed.</div>

It is therefore a first object of the present invention to provide a revolution member supporting apparatus which, when used in a cleaning treatment of an object to be rotated such as a semiconductor wafer, for example, can allow such as a cleaning liquid, supplied during the cleaning treatment, to reach the entire peripheral area of the object to be rotated and, in addition, can securely hold the object to be rotated and prevent the generation of particles.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0123">Embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 6</figref> show an embodiment of a revolution member supporting apparatus in accordance with the present invention. The revolution member supporting apparatus <b>40</b> is for holding a substrate (object to be rotated) W such as a semiconductor wafer, and has a disc-shaped rotatable member <b>44</b> that is set horizontally and rotated by a rotatable drive shaft <b>42</b>, and a plurality of holding members <b>46</b> for holding the substrate W above the rotatable member <b>44</b>. The holding members <b>46</b> are mounted on the peripheral portion of the rotatable member <b>44</b> and arranged along a circle with the rotatable drive shaft <b>42</b> as a center, with each two adjacent members being spaced at a predetermined distance (60° in the embodiment of FIG. <b>4</b>). The holding members <b>46</b> engage the periphery W′ of the substrate W, thereby holding the substrate W horizontally. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, reference numeral <b>47</b> denotes a belt driving device for connecting the rotatable drive shaft <b>42</b> to a motor M for driving, and H denotes a housing for accommodating the revolution member supporting apparatus <b>40</b>, that is adapted to prevent a cleaning liquid or the like supplied from a nozzle N to the substrate W from scattering all around and correct the scattered liquid which is then discharged through a discharge pipe D.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0124"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the details of each holding member <b>46</b>. The holding member <b>46</b> is substantially columnar and has near its top an engaging surface <b>48</b> in an annular groove form. The engaging surface <b>48</b> is adapted to make a friction engagement with the periphery W of the substrate W. The holding member <b>46</b> vertically penetrates a slot <b>50</b>, which is formed in the peripheral portion of the rotatable member <b>44</b> and extends in the radial direction thereof, and is rotatably supported at its bottom by a holding plate <b>52</b>. The holding plate <b>52</b> is located below the rotatable member <b>44</b> and is so constructed that it is allowed to rotate together with the rotatable member <b>44</b>. The holding member <b>46</b> is held on the holding plate <b>52</b> in such a manner that it is allowed to swing about its own central axis. That is, the holding plate <b>52</b> has, mounted thereon, a small-diameter shaft <b>54</b> extending vertically upward, whereas in the inside of the holding member <b>46</b>, a hole <b>56</b> is formed that extends upward from the bottom of the holding member <b>46</b>. The hole <b>56</b> is adapted to make a clearance fit with the small-diameter shaft <b>54</b>, so that the holding member <b>46</b> can swing about the small-diameter shaft <b>54</b> as a center.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0125">Further, a weight <b>58</b>, extending horizontally, is mounted on lower end of the holding member <b>46</b>. When the rotatable member <b>44</b> rotates about its axis of rotation, i.e. the rotatable drive shaft <b>42</b>, and the holding member <b>46</b> revolves around the shaft <b>42</b>, the weight <b>58</b> is forced to move (swing) by the action of centrifugal force whereby the holding member <b>46</b> swings (rotates) about its own axis (i.e. the shaft <b>54</b>). The position of the weight <b>58</b> shown by the solid line in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> represents a home position, where the weight <b>58</b> is forced by pressure through an elastic means, not shown. When a certain centrifugal force is applied, the weight <b>58</b> is forced to move in the direction of arrow A towards the position shown by the chain line, whereby the substrate W is made to move in the direction of arrow B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0126">The holding plate <b>52</b> is supported, in such a manner that it can move horizontally in the direction of arrow C, i.e. the radial direction of the rotatable member <b>44</b> by a link mechanism or the like, not shown, so that the holding member <b>46</b> can move along the slot <b>50</b> between an engaging/holding position (the position shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) where the holding member <b>46</b> engages the periphery W of the substrate W and a release position which is spaced radially outwardly from the engaging/holding position and in which the holding member <b>46</b> detaches from the periphery W of the substrate W. Further, the holding plate <b>52</b> is pressed inwardly in the radial direction of the rotatable member <b>44</b> by a spring <b>60</b> so that the engaging surface <b>48</b> of the holding member <b>46</b> in the engaging/holding position elastically engages the periphery W′ of the substrate W through the spring <b>60</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0127">The operation of the revolution member supporting apparatus <b>40</b> for holding and rotating the substrate will now be described. First, each holding member <b>46</b> is moved, against the pressure by the spring <b>60</b>, outwardly in the radial direction of the rotatable member <b>44</b> to the release position. Thereafter, the substrate W is set horizontally above the rotatable member <b>44</b>, and the holding member <b>46</b> is returned to the engaging/holding position to bring the engaging surface <b>48</b> into engagement with the periphery W′ of the substrate W, thereby allowing the holding member <b>48</b> to elastically hold the substrate W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0128">When the rotatable member <b>44</b> is driven to rotate and the holding member <b>46</b> revolves, a centrifugal force comes to act on the weight <b>58</b>. The centrifugal force acting on the weight <b>58</b> is weak when the rotational speed of the rotatable member <b>44</b> is low, and so the weight <b>58</b> is kept motionless due to the pressure by the spring which forces the weight <b>58</b> in the home position. When the rotational speed of the rotational member <b>44</b> is higher than a particular value, the centrifugal force acting on the weight <b>58</b> exceeds the counter pressure by the spring and causes the weight <b>58</b> to swing, whereby the holding member <b>46</b> swings (rotates) about its central axis. Since the holding member <b>46</b> is in friction engagement with the periphery W′ of the substrate W as described above, the swinging of the holding member <b>46</b> makes the substrate W move in the direction of arrow B shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, thus shifting the engaging portion in the periphery W′ of the substrate W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0129">According to the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the weight <b>58</b>, whose center of gravity is eccentric to the central axis of the holding member <b>46</b>, is mounted on the holding member <b>46</b>. The use of such an eccentric weight, as described above, enables the holding member <b>46</b> to swing (rotate) about its central axis as the rotatable member <b>44</b> rotates. However, the mechanism for the swinging (rotation) of the holding member <b>46</b> is not limited thereto. Thus, for example, a link mechanism may be connected to the holding member <b>46</b>, and the holding member <b>46</b> may be allowed to swing (rotate) through the action of the link mechanism.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0130">The revolution member supporting apparatus of the present invention, which has the above structural features and technical effects, can advantageously be utilized in a cleaning treatment of a substrate (object to be rotated) such as a semiconductor wafer. When cleaning is performed to the substrate while it is held and rotated by the revolution member supporting apparatus, the peripheral portions of the substrate in engagement with the holding members can be shifted during the cleaning treatment, whereby a cleaning liquid can reach to the entire peripheral area of the substrate, thus enabling a satisfactory cleaning treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0131">Though the revolution member supporting apparatus can be applied to any cleaning device, it is most suitably employed in a bevel-etching device for performing bevel-etching (etching of edge and bevel portions) to a semiconductor wafer. The use of the revolution member supporting apparatus in the bevel-etching device, while ensuring the holding of a semiconductor wafer, can shift the edge portions (the periphery W′) of the semiconductor wafer in engagement with the holding members, whereby etching can be effected to every edge or bevel portion of the semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0132">Further, since an object to be rotated such as a semiconductor wafer is held by all of the holding members that are provided in the revolution member supporting apparatus, the object to be rotated can be held firmly and, therefore, the above described problem of generation of particles can be prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0133"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a view showing the plan constitution of a semiconductor substrate processing apparatus according to the first aspect of the present invention. The semiconductor substrate processing apparatus of the present invention is of a constitution in which there are provided a loading and unloading section <b>1</b>, a plated Cu film forming unit <b>2</b>, a first robot <b>3</b>, a third cleaning unit <b>4</b>, a reversing machine <b>5</b>, a reversing machine <b>6</b>, a second cleaning unit <b>7</b>, a second robot <b>8</b>, a first cleaning unit <b>9</b>, a first polishing apparatus <b>10</b>, and a second polishing apparatus <b>11</b>. A before-plating and after-plating film thickness measuring instrument <b>12</b> for measuring the film thicknesses before and after plating, and a dry state film thickness measuring instrument <b>13</b> for measuring the film thickness of a semiconductor substrate W in a dry state after polishing are placed near the first robot <b>3</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0134">The before-plating and after-plating film thickness measuring instrument <b>12</b>, and the dry state film thickness measuring instrument <b>13</b>, especially the dry state film thickness measuring instrument <b>13</b>, may be provided on a hand of the first robot <b>3</b>, as will be described later on. The before-plating and after-plating film thickness measuring instrument <b>12</b> may be provided at a semiconductor substrate carry-in and carry-out opening of the plated Cu film forming unit <b>2</b>, although this is not shown, so as to measure the film thickness of the semiconductor substrate W carried in, and the film thickness of the semiconductor substrate W carried out.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0135">The first polishing apparatus (polishing unit) <b>10</b> has a polishing table <b>10</b>-<b>1</b>, a top ring <b>10</b>-<b>2</b>, a top ring head <b>10</b>-<b>3</b>, a film thickness measuring instrument <b>10</b>-<b>4</b>, and a pusher <b>10</b>-<b>5</b>. The second polishing apparatus (polishing unit) <b>11</b> has a polishing table <b>11</b>-<b>1</b>, a top ring <b>11</b>-<b>2</b>, a top ring head <b>11</b>-<b>3</b>, a film thickness measuring instrument <b>11</b>-<b>4</b>, and a pusher <b>11</b>-<b>5</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0136">A cassette <b>1</b>-<b>1</b> accommodating the semiconductor substrates W, in which a via hole <b>103</b> and a trench <b>104</b> for interconnect are formed, and a seed layer <b>107</b> is formed thereon as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, is placed on a loading port of the loading and unloading section <b>1</b>. The first robot <b>3</b> takes out the semiconductor substrate W from the cassette <b>1</b>-<b>1</b>, and carries the semiconductor substrate W into the plated Cu film forming unit <b>2</b> where a plated Cu film <b>106</b> is formed. At this time, the film thickness of the seed layer <b>107</b> is measured with the before-plating and after-plating film thickness measuring instrument <b>12</b>. The plated Cu film <b>106</b> is formed by carrying out hydrophilic treatment of the face of the semiconductor substrate W, and then Cu plating. After formation of the plated Cu film <b>106</b>, rinsing or cleaning of the semiconductor substrate W is carried out in the plated Cu film forming unit <b>2</b>. If there is time to spare, drying of the semiconductor substrate W may be performed. Constitution examples and operations of the plated Cu film forming unit <b>2</b> will be described in detail later on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0137">When the semiconductor substrate W is taken out from the plated Cu film forming unit <b>2</b> by the first robot <b>3</b>, the film thickness of the plated Cu film <b>106</b> is measured with the before-plating and after-plating film thickness measuring instrument <b>12</b>. The method of measurement is the same as for the seed layer <b>107</b>. The results of its measurement are recorded into a recording device (not shown) as record data on the semiconductor substrate, and are used for judgment of an abnormality of the plated Cu film forming unit <b>2</b>. After measurement of the film thickness, the first robot <b>3</b> transfers the semiconductor substrate W to the reversing machine <b>5</b>, and the reversing machine <b>5</b> reverses the semiconductor substrate W (the surface on which the plated Cu film <b>106</b> has been formed faces downward). The first polishing apparatus <b>10</b> and the second polishing apparatus <b>11</b> perform polishing in a serial mode and a parallel mode. Next, polishing in the serial mode and the parallel mode will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0005">[Serial Mode Polishing]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0138">In the serial mode polishing, a primary polishing is performed by the polishing apparatus <b>10</b>, and a secondary polishing is performed by the polishing apparatus <b>11</b>. The second robot <b>8</b> picks up the semiconductor substrate W on the reversing machine <b>5</b>, and places the semiconductor substrate W on the pusher <b>10</b>-<b>5</b> of the polishing apparatus <b>10</b>. The top ring <b>10</b>-<b>2</b> attracts the semiconductor substrate W on the pusher <b>10</b>-<b>5</b> by suction, and brings the surface of the plated Cu film <b>106</b> of the semiconductor substrate W into contact with a polishing surface <b>10</b>-<b>1</b> <i>a </i>of the polishing table <b>10</b>-<b>1</b> under pressure to perform a primary polishing, shown in FIG. <b>8</b>. With the primary polishing, the plated Cu film <b>106</b> is basically polished. The polishing surface <b>10</b>-<b>1</b> <i>a </i>of the polishing table <b>10</b>-<b>1</b> is composed of foamed polyurethane such as IC1000, or a material having abrasive grains fixed thereto or impregnated therein. Upon relative movements of the polishing surface <b>10</b>-<b>1</b> <i>a </i>and the semiconductor substrate W, the plated Cu film <b>106</b> is polished.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0139">Silica, alumina, ceria, or the like is used as abrasive grains for performing polishing of the plated Cu film <b>106</b>, or as a slurry ejected from a slurry nozzle <b>10</b>-<b>6</b>. A mainly acidic material for oxidizing Cu, such as hydrogen peroxide, is used as an oxidizing agent. A temperature controlled fluid piping <b>28</b> for passing a liquid whose temperature is adjusted to a predetermined value is connected to the interior of the polishing table <b>10</b>-<b>1</b> in order to maintain the temperature of the polishing table <b>10</b>-<b>1</b> at a predetermined value. A temperature regulator <b>10</b>-<b>7</b> is provided on the slurry nozzle <b>10</b>-<b>6</b> in order to maintain the temperature of the slurry at a predetermined value. Water or the like used for dressing is also controlled in temperature, although this is not shown. In this manner, temperature of the polishing table <b>101</b>, the temperature of the slurry, and the temperature of water or the like used for dressing are maintained at predetermined values, whereby the chemical reaction rate is kept constant. Particularly for the polishing table <b>10</b>-<b>1</b>, ceramics with high thermal conductivity, such as alumina or SiC, are used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0140">An eddy current film thickness measuring instrument <b>10</b>-<b>8</b> or an optical film thickness measuring instrument <b>10</b>-<b>9</b> provided in the polishing table <b>10</b>-<b>1</b> is used for detection of an end point of the primary polishing. Film thickness measurement of the plated Cu film <b>106</b>, or surface detection of the barrier layer <b>5</b> is performed, and when the film thickness of the plated Cu film <b>106</b> reaches zero or when the surface of the barrier layer <b>5</b> is detected, polishing is judged to have reached its end point.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0141">After completion of polishing of the plated Cu film <b>106</b>, the semiconductor substrate W is returned onto the pusher <b>10</b>-<b>5</b> by the top ring <b>10</b>-<b>2</b>. The second robot <b>8</b> picks up the semiconductor substrate W, and introduces it into the first cleaning unit <b>9</b>. At this time, a chemical liquid may be ejected toward the face and backside of the semiconductor substrate W on the pusher <b>10</b>-<b>5</b> to remove particles therefrom or cause particles to be difficult to adhere thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0142"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a schematic view showing the first cleaning unit. In the first cleaning unit <b>9</b>, the face and the backside of the semiconductor substrate W are scrubbed with PVA sponge rolls <b>9</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>9</b>-<b>2</b>. As cleaning water ejected from nozzles <b>9</b>-<b>4</b>, pure water is mainly used, but there may be used a surface active agent, or a chelating agent, or a mixture of both which has been adjusted in pH and conformed to the zeta potential of copper oxide. The nozzle <b>9</b>-<b>4</b> may also be provided with an ultrasonic vibration element <b>9</b>-<b>3</b> for applying ultrasonic vibrations to the cleaning water to be ejected. The reference numeral <b>9</b>-<b>1</b> is a rotating roller for rotating the semiconductor substrate W in a horizontal plane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0143">After completion of cleaning in the first cleaning unit <b>9</b>, the second robot <b>8</b> picks up the semiconductor substrate W, and places the semiconductor substrate W on the pusher <b>11</b>-<b>5</b> of the second polishing apparatus <b>11</b>.

The constitution of the polishing table <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> and the top ring <b>11</b>-<b>2</b> are the same as the constitution shown in FIG. <b>8</b>. With this secondary polishing, the barrier layer <b>105</b> is polished. However, there may be a case in which a Cu film and an oxide film left after the primary polishing are also polished.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0144">A polishing surface <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> <i>a </i>of the polishing table <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> is composed of foamed polyurethane such as IC1000, or a material having abrasive grains fixed thereto or impregnated therein.

At this time, silica, alumina, ceria, or the like is used as abrasive grains or a slurry. A chemical liquid is adjusted depending on the type of the film to be polished.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0145">Detection of an end point of the secondary polishing is performed by measuring the film thickness of the barrier layer <b>105</b> mainly with the use of the optical film thickness measuring instrument <b>10</b>-<b>9</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, and detecting the film thickness which has become zero, or detecting the surface of an insulating film <b>102</b> comprising SiO<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, a film thickness measuring instrument with an image processing function is used as the film thickness measuring instrument <b>11</b>-<b>4</b> provided near the polishing table <b>11</b>-<b>1</b>. By use of this measuring instrument, measurement of the oxide film is made, the results are stored as processing records of the semiconductor substrate W, and used for judging whether the semiconductor substrate W in which secondary polishing has been finished can be transferred to a subsequent step or not. If the end point of the secondary polishing is not reached, repolishing is performed. If over-polishing has been performed beyond a prescribed value due to any abnormality, then the semiconductor substrate processing apparatus is stopped to avoid next polishing so that defective products will not increase.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0146">After completion of the secondary polishing, the semiconductor substrate W is moved to the pusher <b>11</b>-<b>5</b> by the top ring <b>11</b>-<b>2</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0006">[Parallel Mode Polishing]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0151">In the parallel mode polishing, the semiconductor substrates W having the plated Cu film <b>106</b> formed by the plated Cu film forming unit <b>2</b> are polished in parallel by the polishing apparatuses <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>. The second robot <b>8</b> picks up the semiconductor substrate W which has been reversed by the reversing machine <b>5</b> as stated above, and places the semiconductor substrate W on the pusher <b>10</b>-<b>5</b> or <b>11</b>-<b>5</b>. The top ring <b>10</b>-<b>2</b> or <b>11</b>-<b>2</b> attracts the semiconductor substrate W by suction, and brings the surface of the plated Cu film <b>106</b> of the semiconductor substrate W into contact with the polishing surface of the polishing table <b>10</b>-<b>1</b> or <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> under pressure to perform a primary polishing. The polishing surface <b>10</b>-<b>1</b> <i>a </i>or <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> <i>a </i>of the polishing table <b>10</b>-<b>1</b> or <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> is composed of foamed polyurethane such as IC1000, or a material having abrasive grains fixed thereto or impregnated therein, as stated above. Upon relative movements of the polishing surface and the semiconductor substrate W, polishing is performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0152">Silica, alumina, ceria, or the like is used as abrasive grains or a slurry. A mainly acidic material for oxidizing Cu, such as hydrogen peroxide, is used as an oxidizing agent. The polishing tables <b>10</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>11</b>-<b>1</b>, and the slurry or water or the like used for dressing are controlled in temperature as stated above to keep the chemical reaction rate constant. Particularly for the polishing tables <b>10</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>11</b>-<b>1</b>, ceramics with high thermal conductivity, such as alumina or SiC, are used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0153">Polishing in the polishing table <b>10</b>-<b>1</b> or <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> is performed by a plurality of steps. In the first step, the plated Cu film <b>106</b> is polished. A main purpose of this polishing is the removal of the difference in level on the surface of the plated Cu film <b>106</b>, and a slurry having excellent level difference characteristics is used. For example, a slurry capable of reducing an initial level difference of 700 nm in a 100 μm line to 20 nm or less is used. At this time, as the second step, the pressing load for pressing the semiconductor substrate W is made a half or less of that in the first step, and the polishing conditions for improving the level difference characteristics are added. For detection of the end point in the second step, the eddy current type measuring machine <b>10</b>-<b>8</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is used when 500 nm of the plated Cu film <b>106</b> is to be left. In the case where 500 nm or less is to be left or polishing is to be performed up to the surface of the barrier layer <b>105</b>, an optical film thickness measuring instrument <b>10</b>-<b>9</b> is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0154">After polishing of the Cu layers, i.e. the plated Cu film <b>106</b> and the seed layer <b>107</b>, is completed, polishing of the barrier layer <b>105</b> is performed. If the barrier layer <b>105</b> cannot be polished usually with the initially used slurry, its composition needs to be changed. Thus, when the second step is completed, the slurry, which has remained on the polishing surface of the polishing table <b>10</b>-<b>1</b> or <b>11</b>-<b>1</b> and has been used in the first and second steps, is removed by a water polish, a water jet, an atomizer having a mixture of pure water and a gas, or a dresser.

Each of the mixing nozzles <b>10</b>-<b>11</b> <i>a </i>to <b>10</b>-<b>11</b> <i>d </i>is supplied with a nitrogen gas whose pressure has been controlled by a regulator <b>16</b> from a nitrogen gas supply source <b>14</b> through an air operator valve <b>18</b>, and is also supplied with pure water whose pressure has been controlled by a regulator <b>17</b> from a pure water supply source <b>15</b> through an air operator valve <b>19</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0156">The mixed gas and liquid undergo changes in parameters, such as the pressure and temperature of the liquid and/or gas and the nozzle shape, by the nozzles.

The pressure of the nitrogen gas and the pressure of pure water can be set independently. In the present embodiment, manually driven regulators are used along with a pure water line and a nitrogen line, but regulators whose setting pressures can be changed based on external signals may be used. As a result of cleaning of the polishing surface <b>10</b>-<b>1</b> <i>a </i>using the above-described cleaning mechanism, the slurry remaining on the polishing surface in the first polishing step and the second polishing step could be removed by performing cleaning for 5 to 20 seconds.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0158">As the abrasive grains used in the slurry for polishing of the barrier layer <b>105</b> in the third step, it is desirable to use the same abrasive grains as those for polishing of the plated Cu film <b>106</b>. Moreover, the pH value of the chemical liquid is either on the acid side or on the alkali side, and the preferable conditions are to prevent formation of a mixture on the polishing surface. In both cases, the same particles of silica were used, and both of the chemical liquid with alkalinity and the chemical liquid with acidity, as the pH value of the chemical liquid, obtained good results.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0159">For detection of the end point in the third step, the optical film thickness measuring instrument <b>10</b>-<b>9</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is used to detect mainly the film thickness of the SiO<sub>2 </sub>oxide film and the remainder of the barrier layer <b>105</b> and send signals.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0172">In this embodiment, a plating liquid impregnated material <b>2</b>-<b>22</b> comprising a water retaining material and covering the entire surface of the anode <b>2</b>-<b>20</b> is attached to the lower surface of the anode <b>2</b>-<b>20</b>. The plating liquid impregnated material <b>2</b>-<b>22</b> is impregnated with the plating liquid to wet the surface of the anode <b>2</b>-<b>20</b>, thereby preventing a black film from falling onto the plated surface of the substrate, and simultaneously facilitating escape of air to the outside when the plating liquid is poured between the surface, to be plated, of the substrate and the anode <b>2</b>-<b>20</b>. The plating liquid impregnated material <b>2</b>-<b>22</b> comprises, for example, a woven fabric, nonwoven fabric, or sponge-like structure comprising at least one material of polyethylene, polypropylene, polyester, polyvinyl chloride, Teflon, polyvinyl alcohol, polyurethane, and derivatives of these materials, or comprises a porous ceramics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0173">Attachment of the plating liquid impregnated material <b>2</b>-<b>22</b> to the anode <b>2</b>-<b>20</b> is performed in the following manner: That is, many fixing pins <b>2</b>-<b>25</b> each having a head portion at the lower end are arranged such that the head portion is provided in the plating liquid impregnated material <b>2</b>-<b>22</b> so as not to be releasable upward and a shaft portion of the fixing pin pierces the interior of the anode <b>2</b>-<b>20</b>, and the fixing pins <b>2</b>-<b>25</b> are urged upward by U-shaped plate springs <b>2</b>-<b>26</b>, whereby the plating liquid impregnated material <b>2</b>-<b>22</b> is brought in close contact with the lower surface of the anode <b>2</b>-<b>20</b> by the resilient force of the plate springs <b>2</b>-<b>26</b> and is attached to the anode <b>2</b>-<b>20</b>. With this arrangement, even when the thickness of the anode <b>2</b>-<b>20</b> gradually decreases with the progress of plating, the plating liquid impregnated material <b>2</b>-<b>22</b> can be reliably brought in close contact with the lower surface of the anode <b>2</b>-<b>20</b>. Thus, it can be prevented that air enters between the lower surface of the anode <b>2</b>-<b>20</b> and the plating liquid impregnated material <b>2</b>-<b>22</b> to cause poor plating.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0174">Incidentally, columnar pins made of PVC (polyvinyl chloride) or PET (polyethylene terephthalate) and having a diameter of, for example, about 2 mm may be arranged from the upper surface side of the anode so as to pierce the anode, and an adhesive may be applied to the front end surface of each of the pins projecting from the lower surface of the anode to fix the anode to the plating liquid impregnated material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0175">The anode <b>2</b>-<b>20</b> and the plating liquid impregnated material <b>2</b>-<b>22</b> may be used in contact with each other, but it is also possible to provide a gap between the anode <b>2</b>-<b>20</b> and the plating liquid impregnated material <b>2</b>-<b>22</b>, and perform plating treatment while holding the plating liquid in the gap. This gap is selected from a range of 20 mm or less, but is selected from a range of preferably 0.1 to 10 mm, and more preferably 1 to 7 mm. Particularly, when a soluble anode is used as the anode <b>2</b>-<b>20</b>, the anode <b>2</b>-<b>20</b> is dissolved from its lower portion. Thus, as time passes, the gap between the anode <b>2</b>-<b>20</b> and the plating liquid impregnated material <b>2</b>-<b>22</b> enlarges and forms a gap in the range of 0 to about 20 mm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0176">The electrode portion <b>2</b>-<b>5</b> descends to such a degree that when the substrate holding portion <b>2</b>-<b>9</b> is located at the plating position B (see FIG. <b>14</b>), the gap between the substrate W held by the substrate holding portion <b>2</b>-<b>9</b> and the plating liquid impregnated material <b>2</b>-<b>22</b> reaches about 0.1 to 10 mm, preferably 0.3 to 3 mm, and more preferably about 0.5 to 1 mm. In this state, the plating liquid is supplied from a plating liquid supply pipe to be filled between the upper surface (surface to be plated) of the substrate W and the anode <b>2</b>-<b>20</b> while the plating liquid impregnated material <b>2</b>-<b>22</b> is impregnated with the plating liquid.

In this state, the precoating and recovery arm <b>2</b>-<b>7</b> located at a retreat position is moved to a position opposite to the semiconductor substrate W, and a precoating liquid comprising, for example, a surface active agent is supplied intermittently toward the surface, to be plated, of the semiconductor substrate W from a precoating nozzle provided at the front end of the precoating and recovery arm <b>2</b>-<b>7</b>. At this time, the substrate holding portion <b>2</b>-<b>9</b> is rotating, and hence the precoating liquid spreads over the entire surface of the semiconductor substrate W.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0190">In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>, a plating liquid introduction pipe <b>2</b>-<b>28</b> of a straight-line shape, which has a plating liquid introduction passage <b>2</b>-<b>28</b> <i>a </i>therein and extends in a diametrical direction, is installed on the upper surface of the anode <b>2</b>-<b>20</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0191">At positions approximately corresponding to the plating liquid pouring holes <b>2</b>-<b>20</b> <i>a </i>of the anode <b>2</b>-<b>20</b>, the plating liquid reaches the upper surface (surface to be plated) of the substrate W from the lower surface of the plating liquid impregnated material <b>2</b>-<b>22</b>, thereby forming plating liquid columns <b>2</b>-<b>30</b> which bridge the plating liquid impregnated material <b>2</b>-<b>22</b> and the surface, to be plated, of the substrate W. By continuing the supply of the plating liquid, the plating liquid columns <b>2</b>-<b>30</b> are gradually grown, or connected to each other. Then, a flow of the plating liquid Q, which advances in a direction perpendicular to the plating liquid introduction pipe <b>2</b>-<b>28</b> and spreads over the entire surface of the surface, to be plated, of the substrate W, occurs as shown in FIG. <b>20</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0192">As a result, air bubbles B entrained by this flow of the plating liquid Q are pushed outward, and a front line Q<b>1</b> of the flow of the plating liquid Q is a nearly straight line, so that the plating liquid Q does not enclose air. Thus, the air bubbles are prevented from remaining in the plating liquid filled between the plating liquid impregnated material <b>2</b>-<b>22</b> and the surface, to be plated, of the substrate W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0193">Here, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref>, the plating liquid introduction pipe <b>2</b>-<b>28</b> which has blade portions extending cruciformly in directions perpendicular to each other and which has plating liquid introduction holes <b>2</b>-<b>28</b> <i>b </i>at predetermined positions along the longitudinal direction of each blade portion may be used, and the anode (not shown) which has plating liquid pouring holes <b>2</b>-<b>20</b> <i>a </i>at positions corresponding to the plating liquid introduction holes <b>2</b>-<b>28</b> <i>b </i>may be used.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0194">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</figref>, a similar flow of the plating liquid Q is generated, when the plating liquid introduction pipe <b>2</b>-<b>28</b> is placed in a circumferential manner and plating liquid introduction holes <b>2</b>-<b>28</b> <i>b </i>are provided at predetermined positions. The plating liquid introduction holes <b>2</b>-<b>28</b> <i>b </i>of the plating liquid introduction pipe <b>2</b>-<b>28</b> are often provided at equal pitch and with equal diameter, but discharge of the liquid may be controlled by adjusting the pitch of the holes and the diameter of the holes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0195">According to the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 through 20</figref>, at positions approximately corresponding to the plating liquid pouring holes <b>2</b>-<b>20</b> <i>a </i>of the anode <b>2</b>-<b>20</b>, the plating liquid reaches the upper surface (surface to be plated) of the substrate W from the lower surface of the plating liquid impregnated material <b>2</b>-<b>22</b>, thereby forming the plating liquid columns <b>2</b>-<b>30</b> which bridge the plating liquid impregnated material <b>2</b>-<b>22</b> and the surface, to be plated, of the substrate W. At this time, when the plating liquid flows inside the plating liquid impregnated material <b>2</b>-<b>22</b>, the plating liquid is slightly diffused along its flow direction, thereby alleviating damage to the seed layer <b>107</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) upon arrival of the plating liquid at the substrate W, namely, alleviating the phenomenon of the seed layer <b>107</b> due to local application of a jet, and thus contributing to the uniformity of the film thickness during a subsequent plating step. By providing the distribution of the passage holes <b>2</b>-<b>20</b> <i>b </i>over the surface so as to be dense in the central portion and sparse in the peripheral portion, the plating liquid spreads uniformly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0196">As indicated by imaginary lines in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, after the plating liquid reaches the upper surface (surface to be plated) of the substrate W from the lower surface of the plating liquid impregnated material <b>2</b>-<b>22</b> to form the plating liquid columns <b>2</b>-<b>30</b>, the substrate W, for example, may be instantaneously raised to bring the plating liquid impregnated material <b>2</b>-<b>22</b> and the substrate W close to each other instantaneously. Further, it is possible to form the plating liquid columns <b>2</b>-<b>30</b> similarly while bending the substrate in a concave form under slight pressure on the edge of the substrate, and then to release the pressure, thereby restoring the substrate to the original shape. With this measure, the plating liquid impregnated material <b>2</b>-<b>22</b> and the substrate W may be instantaneously brought close to each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0197">When the plating liquid impregnated material <b>2</b>-<b>22</b> has a large thickness and a high density (low porosity), for example, resistance becomes large when the plating liquid flows inside the plating liquid impregnated material <b>2</b>-<b>22</b>. As a result, a predetermined amount of the plating liquid does not flow out of the plating liquid impregnated material <b>2</b>-<b>22</b>, and binding of the plating liquid columns <b>2</b>-<b>30</b> is disturbed. Even if air is dragged at this time, a rapid outward flow of the plating liquid can be generated to drive out air bubbles together with the plating liquid, and the supply of the plating liquid between the plating liquid impregnated material <b>2</b>-<b>22</b> and the substrate W can be performed in a short time by being brought the plating liquid impregnated material <b>2</b>-<b>22</b> and the substrate W instantaneously close to each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0198">Contact between the plating liquid and the seed layer <b>107</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) in a non-energized state induces a decrease in the seed layer <b>107</b>. Even in an energized state, the failure of the plating liquid to spread on the surface of the substrate W in a short time causes variations in the film thickness at the initial stage of plating, and impairs the uniformity of subsequent plated film thickness. However, these troubles can be prevented by supplying the plating liquid between the plating liquid impregnated material <b>2</b>-<b>22</b> and the substrate W in a short time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0199">Further, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the plating liquid may be supplied from the plating liquid pouring holes <b>2</b>-<b>20</b> <i>a </i>to the plating liquid impregnated material <b>2</b>-<b>22</b> during plating treatment to supply the plating liquid between the plating liquid impregnated material <b>2</b>-<b>22</b> and the surface, to be plated, of the substrate W.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0200">The plating liquid is stirred in this manner during plating treatment, whereby it becomes possible to remove air bubbles which have not been withdrawn during liquid filling, and air bubbles which have occurred during plating treatment after liquid filling.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0201">In the present plating apparatus, the spacing between the surface, to be plated, of the substrate W and the anode <b>2</b>-<b>20</b> is small, so that a small amount of the plating liquid to be used is sufficient. However, since the additives and ions in the plating liquid become in limited amounts, in order to perform efficient plating in a short time, it is necessary to distribute the additives and the like uniformly in the plating liquid. In this respect, according to the present embodiment, because the plating liquid is stirred during plating treatment, it is possible to perform plating in such a state that the additives and ions are distributed uniformly. In the present plating apparatus, plating is applied onto the semiconductor substrate W by connecting the semiconductor substrate W to the cathode and connecting the anode to the positive electrode. By applying a reverse voltage, on the other hand, etching of the plated film formed on the semiconductor substrate W can be carried out. After plating for filling the hole is substantially completed (40 to 400 seconds), a feed voltage is applied for a short time (e.g., 1 to 60 seconds), and then a forward voltage is applied again (50 seconds, 0.5 μ). By applying feed voltage, the action of the additives is suppressed, and formation of a protuberance only on the hole is prevented, so that uniformity of the plated film can be achieved.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0216">When a predetermined voltage is applied between the anode <b>2</b>-<b>20</b> and the substrate W to flow a direct current, plating (e.g. copper plating) is applied on the entire surface of the conductive layer of the substrate W. According to the present embodiment, the porous ceramic plate <b>2</b>-<b>22</b> is interposed between the anode <b>2</b>-<b>20</b> and the substrate W, and hence there is minimal influence due to the difference among the resistance values of the respective portions according to the difference in the distance from contacts <b>2</b>-<b>17</b> on the surface of the substrate W as stated above.

However, the insulating member <b>2</b>-<b>35</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is not shown in this electroplating apparatus. In this electroplating apparatus, since a gap between a holding member <b>2</b>-<b>18</b> and the porous ceramic plate <b>2</b>-<b>22</b> is not sealed, a plating liquid flows out of the anode <b>2</b>-<b>20</b> through this gap to thus form a passage for an electric current as shown by an arrow. Since this current passage is such a passage that current does not pass through the interior of the porous ceramic plate <b>2</b>-<b>22</b>, its resistance value is small.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0250"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> is a flow chart showing the flow of the respective steps in the present substrate processing apparatus. The respective steps in the apparatus will be described according to this flow chart. First, a semiconductor substrate taken out by the first robot <b>131</b> from a cassette <b>120</b> <i>a </i>placed on the load and unload unit <b>120</b> is placed in the first aligner and film thickness measuring unit <b>141</b>, in such a state that its surface, to be plated, faces upward. In order to set a reference point for a position at which film thickness measurement is made, notch alignment for film thickness measurement is performed, and then film thickness data on the semiconductor substrate before formation of a Cu film are obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0251">Then, the semiconductor substrate is transported to the barrier layer forming unit <b>111</b> by the first robot <b>131</b>. The barrier layer forming unit <b>111</b> is such an apparatus for forming a barrier layer on the semiconductor substrate by electroless Ru plating, and the forming unit <b>111</b> forms an Ru film as a film for preventing Cu from diffusing into an interlayer insulator film (e.g. SiO<sub>2</sub>) of a semiconductor device. The semiconductor substrate discharged after cleaning and drying steps is transported by the first robot <b>131</b> to the first aligner and film thickness measuring unit <b>141</b>, where the film thickness of the semiconductor substrate, i.e., the film thickness of the barrier layer is measured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0252">The semiconductor substrate after film thickness measurement is carried into the seed layer forming unit <b>112</b> by the second robot <b>132</b>, and a seed layer is formed on the barrier layer by electroless Cu plating.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0253">The semiconductor substrate which has completed notch alignment is transported by the third robot <b>133</b> to the plating unit <b>113</b> where Cu plating is applied to the semiconductor substrate. The semiconductor substrate discharged after cleaning and drying steps is transported by the third robot <b>133</b> to the bevel and backside cleaning unit <b>116</b> where an unnecessary Cu film (seed layer) at a peripheral portion of the semiconductor substrate is removed. In the bevel and backside cleaning unit <b>116</b>, the bevel is etched in a preset time, and Cu adhering to the backside of the semiconductor substrate is cleaned with a chemical liquid such as hydrofluoric acid. At this time, before transporting the semiconductor substrate to the bevel and backside cleaning unit <b>116</b>, film thickness measurement of the semiconductor substrate may be made by the second aligner and film thickness measuring instrument <b>142</b> to obtain the thickness value of the Cu film formed by plating, and based on the obtained results, the bevel etching time may be changed arbitrarily to carry out etching. The region etched by bevel etching is a region which corresponds to a peripheral edge portion of the substrate and has no circuit formed therein, or a region which is not utilized finally as a chip although a circuit is formed.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0255">At this time, desired abrasive grains or the like are used, but fixed abrasive may be used in order to prevent dishing and enhance flatness of the face.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0258">The aligner and film thickness measuring instrument <b>141</b> and the aligner and film thickness measuring instrument <b>142</b> perform positioning of the notch portion of the substrate and measurement of the film thickness.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0260">The apparatus is configured to have a rotatable vacuum chuck <b>142</b>-<b>4</b>, a lift <b>142</b>-<b>2</b>, a photomicrosensor <b>142</b>-<b>1</b> for notch detection, an eddy current sensor <b>142</b>-<b>3</b> for film thickness measurement, and the like.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0263">The semiconductor substrate W transferred to the barrier layer forming unit <b>111</b> which is an electroless Ru plating apparatus is first given Pd as a catalyst. Pd is applied to the semiconductor substrate W in an amount of about 30 ml, and the treatment time is about 1 minute. After the semiconductor substrate W is washed with water, the semiconductor substrate W is treated with hydrochloric acid for activation treatment. At this time, hydrochloric acid is applied in such a state that hydrochloric acid is a 36% solution in a concentration of about 100 ml/L and in an amount of about 30 ml, with the treatment time being about 1 minute. After the semiconductor substrate W is washed with water again, electroless Ru plating is performed. RuCl<sub>3</sub>.xH<sub>2</sub>O is used as a ruthenium plating liquid. Treatment is performed for about 10 minutes at a substrate surface temperature of about 85° C. The film formation rate at that time is about 2 nm/min. A barrier layer is formed in this manner, and the substrate is subjected to a water washing step and a spin-drying step, thus completing treatment. According to these steps, about 20 nm of Ru is obtained on SiO<sub>2 </sub>by electroless plating.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0264">Formation of the barrier layer <b>105</b> is not limited to electroless plating, and this barrier layer may be formed by using CVD, sputtering or electroplating. The barrier layer is not limited to Ru, and any material may be used as long as it can achieve the prevention of Cu diffusion into an interlayer insulator film such as TiN.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0265">Electroless Cu plating, which is the seed layer forming unit <b>112</b>, can employ the same apparatus as the electroless Ru plating unit. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> is a view showing a constitution example of an electroless Cu plating unit. The structure of the electroless plating apparatus shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> will be described in detail in an explanation for the second aspect of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0266">In the seed layer forming unit <b>112</b>, a semiconductor substrate W per se is directly heated by a backside heater <b>315</b>, and kept at a temperature of 70° C., for example. A plating liquid heated, for example, to 50° C. is ejected from a shower head <b>341</b>, and the plating liquid is poured over substantially the entire surface of the semiconductor substrate W. The amount of the supplied plating liquid is such that the thickness of the plating liquid on the surface of the semiconductor substrate W is about 1 mm. The semiconductor substrate W is instantaneously rotated by a motor M to perform uniform liquid wetting on the surface to be plated, and then a plated film is formed on the surface of the substrate in such a state that the semiconductor substrate W is in a stationary state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0267">After seed layer formation treatment is completed, the front end of a plating recovery nozzle <b>365</b> is lowered to an area near the inside of a dam member <b>331</b> located at a face peripheral edge portion of the semiconductor substrate W to suck in the plating liquid. At this time, the semiconductor substrate W is rotated, for example, at a rotational speed of 100 rpm or less, and hence the liquid remaining on the upper surface of the semiconductor substrate W can be gathered in the portion of the dam member <b>331</b> by centrifugal force. Thus, the plating liquid can be recovered with good efficiency and at a high recovery rate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0268">Then, holding means <b>311</b> is lowered to separate the semiconductor substrate W from the dam member <b>331</b>, and the rotation of the semiconductor substrate W is started and a cleaning liquid (ultrapure water) is ejected toward the plated surface of the semiconductor substrate W from a nozzle <b>353</b> of cleaning liquid supply means <b>351</b> to cool the plated surface and perform dilution and cleaning, thereby terminating the electroless plating reaction. Next, the semiconductor substrate W is rotated at a high speed by the motor M for thereby spin-drying, and then the semiconductor substrate W is taken out from the holding means <b>311</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0269">The above electroless plating liquid contains CuSO<sub>4</sub>.5H<sub>2</sub>O, EDTA.4Na as a complexing agent, HCHO as a reducing agent, and NaOH as an alkali for pH adjustment so that the pH becomes 12.5, and further contains α, α′-dipyridyl. The plating temperature is about 40 to 80° C. Formation of the seed layer is not limited to electroless plating, and this seed layer can be formed by using CVD, sputtering or electroplating.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0270">The bevel and backside cleaning unit <b>116</b> can perform an edge (bevel) Cu etching and a backside cleaning at the same time, and can suppress growth of a natural oxide film of copper at the circuit formation portion on the surface of the substrate. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref> shows a schematic view of the bevel and backside cleaning unit <b>116</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, the bevel and backside cleaning unit <b>116</b> has a substrate holding portion <b>222</b> positioned inside a bottomed cylindrical waterproof cover <b>220</b> and adapted to rotate a substrate W at a high speed, in such a state that the face of the substrate W faces upwardly, while holding the substrate W horizontally by spin chucks <b>221</b> at a plurality of locations along a circumferential direction of a peripheral edge portion of the substrate; a center nozzle <b>224</b> placed above a nearly central portion of the face of the substrate W held by the substrate holding portion <b>222</b>; and an edge nozzle <b>226</b> placed above the peripheral edge portion of the substrate W. The center nozzle <b>224</b> and the edge nozzle <b>226</b> are directed downward. A back nozzle <b>228</b> is positioned below a nearly central portion of the backside of the substrate W, and directed upward. The edge nozzle <b>226</b> is adapted to be movable in a diametrical direction and a height direction of the substrate W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0271">The width of movement L of the edge nozzle <b>226</b> is set such that the edge nozzle <b>226</b> can be arbitrarily positioned in a direction toward the center from the outer peripheral end surface of the substrate, and a set value for L is inputted according to the size, usage, or the like of the substrate W. Normally, an edge cut width C is set in the range of 2 mm to 5 mm. In the case where a rotational speed of the substrate is a certain value or higher at which the amount of liquid migration from the backside to the face is not problematic, the copper film within the edge cut width C can be removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0272">Next, the method of cleaning with this cleaning apparatus will be described. First, the semiconductor substrate W is horizontally rotated integrally with the substrate holding portion <b>222</b>, with the substrate being held horizontally by the spin chucks <b>221</b> of the substrate holding portion <b>222</b>. In this state, an acid solution is supplied from the center nozzle <b>224</b> to the central portion of the face of the substrate W. The acid solution may be a non-oxidizing acid such as hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, citric acid, oxalic acid, or the like is used. On the other hand, an oxidizing agent solution is supplied continuously or intermittently from the edge nozzle <b>226</b> to the peripheral edge portion of the substrate W. As the oxidizing agent solution, one of an aqueous solution of ozone, an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide, an aqueous solution of nitric acid, and an aqueous solution of sodium hypochlorite is used, or a combination of these is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0273">In this manner, the copper film, or the like formed on the upper surface and end surface in the region of the peripheral edge portion C of the semiconductor substrate W is rapidly oxidized with the oxidizing agent solution, and is simultaneously etched with the acid solution supplied from the center nozzle <b>224</b> and spreaded on the entire face of the substrate, whereby it is dissolved and removed. By mixing the acid solution and the oxidizing agent solution at the peripheral edge portion of the substrate, a steep etching profile can be obtained, in comparison with a mixture of them which is produced in advance being supplied. At this time, the copper etching rate is determined by their concentrations. If a natural oxide film of copper is formed in the circuit-formed portion on the face of the substrate, this natural oxide is immediately removed by the acid solution spreading on the entire face of the substrate according to rotation of the substrate, and does not grow any more. That is, the oxide film of copper, which was formed on the surface of the substrate in the plating, can thus be removed by flowing HF over the substrate surface. Further, an oxide film of copper is not newly formed during the etching. It is to be noted in this connection that when an oxide film of copper remains on the surface of the substrate, only the oxide portion of copper is preferentially polished away in a later CMP processing, which adversely affects the flatness of the processed surface. This can be avoided by the removal of the oxide film of copper in the above manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0274">After the supply of the acid solution from the center nozzle <b>224</b> is stopped, the supply of the oxidizing agent solution from the edge nozzle <b>226</b> is stopped. As a result, silicon exposed on the surface is oxidized, and deposition of copper can be suppressed. Thus, the activated surface of Si exposed on the surface of the substrate, for example, can be oxidized and thereby inactivated by later stopping the supply of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. This prevents adsorption of large particles onto the surface of the substrate which can cause scratching in a later CMP processing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0275">The oxidation of copper by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>and the removal of the oxidized copper by HF, carried out repeatedly in the above manner, can enhance the rate of copper removal as compared with the case where the oxidation of copper and its removal are simultaneously effected by using a mixture of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>and HF.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0276">On the other hand, an oxidizing agent solution and a silicon oxide film etching agent are supplied simultaneously or alternately from the back nozzle <b>228</b> to the central portion of the backside of the substrate. Therefore, copper or the like adhering in a metal form to the backside of the semiconductor substrate W can be oxidized with the oxidizing agent solution, together with silicon of the substrate, and can be etched and removed with the silicon oxide film etching agent. This oxidizing agent solution is preferably the same as the oxidizing agent solution supplied to the face, because the types of chemicals are decreased in number. Hydrofluoric acid can be used as the silicon oxide film etching agent, and if hydrofluoric acid is used as the acid solution on the face of the substrate, the types of chemicals can be decreased in number. Thus, if the supply of the oxidizing agent is stopped first, a hydrophobic surface is obtained. If the etching agent solution is stopped first, a water-saturated surface (a hydrophilic surface) is obtained, and thus the backside surface can be adjusted to a condition which will satisfy the requirements of a subsequent process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0277">In this manner, the acid solution, i.e., etching solution is supplied to the substrate to remove metal ions remaining on the surface of the substrate W. Then, pure water is supplied to replace the etching solution with pure water and remove the etching solution, and then the substrate is dried by spin-drying. In this way, removal of the copper film in the edge cut width C at the peripheral edge portion on the face of the semiconductor substrate, and removal of copper contaminants on the backside are performed simultaneously to thus allow this treatment to be completed, for example, within 80 seconds. The etching cut width of the edge can be set arbitrarily (to 2 mm to 5 mm), but the time required for etching does not depend on the cut width.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0278">The revolution member supporting apparatus shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is used for holding the semiconductor substrate in the bevel and backside cleaning unit <b>116</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0279">Annealing treatment performed before the CMP process and after plating has a favorable effect on the subsequent CMP treatment and on the electrical characteristics of wiring. Observation of the surface of broad wiring (unit of several micrometers) after the CMP treatment without annealing showed many defects such as microvoids, which resulted in an increase in the electrical resistance of the entire wiring. Execution of annealing ameliorated the increase in the electrical resistance. In the absence of annealing, thin wiring showed no voids. Thus, the degree of grain growth is presumed to be involved in these phenomena. That is, the following mechanism can be speculated: Grain growth is difficult to occur in thin wiring. In broad wiring, on the other hand, grain growth proceeds in accordance with annealing treatment. During the process of grain growth, ultrafine pores in the plated film, which are too small to be seen by the SEM (scanning electron microscope), gather and move upward, thus forming microvoid-like depressions in the upper part of the wiring. The annealing conditions in the annealing unit <b>114</b> are such that hydrogen (2% or less) is added in a gas atmosphere, the temperature is in the range of 300° C. to 400° C., and the time is in the range of 1 to 5 minutes. Under these conditions, the above effects were obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0280"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 77 and 78</figref> show the annealing unit <b>114</b>.

The annealing unit <b>1002</b> also has a plurality of vertically movable elevating pins <b>1008</b> penetrating the cool plate <b>1006</b> and extending upward and downward therethrough for placing and holding the semiconductor substrate W on them. The annealing unit further includes a gas introduction pipe <b>1010</b> for introducing an antioxidant gas between the semiconductor substrate W and the hot plate <b>1004</b> during annealing, and a gas discharge pipe <b>1012</b> for discharging the gas which has been introduced from the gas introduction pipe <b>1010</b> and flowed between the semiconductor substrate W and the hot plate <b>1004</b>. The pipes <b>1010</b> and <b>1012</b> are disposed on the opposite sides of the hot plate <b>1004</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0281">The gas introduction pipe <b>1010</b> is connected to a mixed gas introduction line <b>1022</b> which in turn is connected to a mixer <b>1020</b> where a N<sub>2 </sub>gas introduced through a N<sub>2 </sub>gas introduction line <b>1016</b> containing a filter <b>1014</b> <i>a</i>, and a H<sub>2 </sub>gas introduced through a H<sub>2 </sub>gas introduction line <b>1018</b> containing a filter <b>1014</b> <i>b</i>, are mixed to form a mixed gas which flows through the line <b>1022</b> into the gas introduction pipe <b>1010</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0282">In operation, the semiconductor substrate W, which has been carried in the chamber <b>1002</b> through the gate <b>1000</b>, is held on the elevating pins <b>1008</b> and the elevating pins <b>1008</b> are raised up to a position at which the distance between the semiconductor substrate W held on the lifting pins <b>1008</b> and the hot plate <b>1004</b> becomes e.g. 0.1-1.0 mm. In this state, the semiconductor substrate W is then heated to e.g. 400° C. through the hot plate <b>1004</b> and, at the same time, the antioxidant gas is introduced from the gas introduction pipe <b>1010</b> and the gas is allowed to flow between the semiconductor substrate W and the hot plate <b>1004</b> while the gas is discharged from the gas discharge pipe <b>1012</b>, thereby annealing the semiconductor substrate W while preventing its oxidation. The annealing treatment may be completed in about several tens of seconds to 60 seconds. The heating temperature of the substrate may be selected in the range of 100-600° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0283">After the completion of the annealing, the elevating pins <b>1008</b> are lowered down to a position at which the distance between the semiconductor substrate W held on the elevating pins <b>1008</b> and the cool plate <b>1006</b> becomes e.g. 0-0.5 mm. In this state, by introducing a cooling water into the cool plate <b>1006</b>, the semiconductor substrate W is cooled by the cool plate to a temperature of 100° C. or lower in e.g. 10-60 seconds.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0285">The features of the substrate processing apparatus having the above-described constitution are enumerated as follows:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0286">Pretreatment, cleaning and drying can be performed in each film forming unit, and no contaminants are brought into a next step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0287">In each unit incorporated in the present apparatus, various chemical liquids are used. Even in the same unit, different chemical liquids may be selected depending on differences in the process. If different chemical liquids are mixed, the treating effects of the chemical liquids may change, or crystals of compounds may be deposited, thus not only affecting the substrate being treated, but also affecting the process treatment of a next semiconductor substrate which will be introduced subsequently. If the transport means is a robot hand, the hand is contaminated. Thus, each time the substrate is transported, various chemical liquids adhere thereto.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0288">Therefore, the present apparatus is characterized in that before transfer to the next unit, i.e., the next step in the semiconductor manufacturing apparatus, the semiconductor substrate is subjected in the unit to treatment which allows no chemical liquid for treatment to remain, and then the treated semiconductor substrate is taken out therefrom. Thus, the chemical liquid is not brought into a separate unit. For example, when the substrate is to be transferred from the electroless plating unit for a barrier layer formation step to the electroplating unit for a plating step for formation of buried wiring, the substrate is subjected to cleaning treatment and drying treatment in the electroless plating unit. Thus, an alkaline electroless plating liquid is prevented from being brought into the electroplating unit in which an acidic plating liquid is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0289">At the time of transfer of the substrate from the plating step to the CMP step, cleaning treatment and drying treatment, as well as plating treatment, are carried out in the electroplating unit so that the acidic plating liquid is not brought into the CMP step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0290">The plating unit <b>113</b> for performing a plating step for embedded wiring is characterized in that treatment with a surface active agent, precoating treatment, and the like are possible. Because of this characteristic, pretreatment can be performed in the plating unit <b>113</b> (in the single unit) immediately before electroplating, and hence filling of liquid into fine recesses is improved. Moreover, a cleaning mechanism and a spin-drying mechanism are present in the plating unit <b>113</b> (in the single unit), and hence the semiconductor substrate W for intercellular movement can be put into a desired wet state such as liquid removal or drying. The cleaning mechanism and the spin-drying mechanism, in particular, can clean and dry not only the semiconductor substrate, but also the seal material and the cathode contacts, and thus have the effects of remarkably decreasing the replacement frequency of these expendable members and increasing the continuous operating time of the entire apparatus.</div>

<br/>
(4) By recording the results of measurement of the film thicknesses, the remaining film, and the initial film thicknesses of the respective layers measured with the film thickness measuring section and the remaining film measuring section, it is possible to utilize the records as data for controlling the treatment time of a subsequent step, and as data for judging the good or poor state of each treatment step, or judging whether the semiconductor substrate after completion of the interconnect formation treatment is good or poor.
<br/>
(5) It is possible to provide a substrate processing apparatus which can easily cope with a change in the substrate treatment process, and can achieve renewal of the function of the entire substrate processing apparatus at a low cost in a short time.
<br/>
(6) While a substrate holding portion is holding a semiconductor substrate faceup, a plating liquid is filled between a surface to be plated and an anode of an electrode arm portion to perform plating treatment. After plating treatment, the plating liquid between the surface to be plated and the anode of the electrode arm portion is discharged, and the electrode arm portion is raised to release the plated surface. Thus, other treatments associated with plating treatment, such aspretreatment and cleaning and drying treatment, can be performed before and after plating treatment, while the semiconductor substrate is being held by the substrate holding portion.
<br/>
(7) The precoating treatment, plating treatment and water washing treatment can be performed by a plating unit, thus improving time efficiency.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0310">In the semiconductor substrate W, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44A</figref>, an insulating film <b>102</b> comprising SiO<sub>2 </sub>is deposited on a conductive layer <b>110</b> <i>a </i>of a substrate <b>100</b> on which semiconductor devices are formed, a contact hole <b>103</b> and a trench <b>104</b> for an interconnect are formed by lithography and etching technology, a barrier layer <b>105</b> comprising TiN or the like is formed thereon, and a seed layer <b>107</b> is further formed thereon by electroless copper plating.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0311"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> is a schematic constitution drawing of the electroless plating apparatus of the present invention.

The respective members will be described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0312">The holding means <b>311</b> has a substrate placing portion <b>313</b> on its upper surface for placing and holding the semiconductor substrate W. The substrate placing portion <b>313</b> is adapted to place and fix the semiconductor substrate W. Specifically, the substrate placing portion <b>313</b> has a vacuum attracting mechanism (not shown) for attracting the semiconductor substrate W to a backside thereof by vacuum suction. A backside heater (heating means) <b>315</b>, which is planar and heats the surface, to be plated, of the semiconductor substrate W from underside to keep it warm, is provided at the backside of the substrate placing portion <b>313</b>. The backside heater <b>315</b> is composed of, for example, a rubber heater. This holding means <b>311</b> is adapted to be rotated by the motor M and is movable vertically by raising and lowering means (not shown).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0313">The dam member <b>331</b> is tubular, has a seal portion <b>333</b> provided in a lower portion thereof for sealing the outer peripheral edge of the semiconductor substrate W, and is installed so as not to move vertically from the illustrated position.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0314">The shower head <b>341</b> is of a structure having many nozzles provided at the front end for scattering the supplied plating liquid in a shower form and supplying it substantially uniformly to the surface, to be plated, of the semiconductor substrate W. The cleaning liquid supply means <b>351</b> has a structure for ejecting a cleaning liquid from a nozzle <b>353</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0315">The plating liquid recovery nozzle <b>365</b> is adapted to be movable upward and downward and swingable, and the front end of the plating liquid recovery nozzle <b>365</b> is adapted to be lowered inwardly of the dam member <b>331</b> located on the upper surface peripheral edge portion of the semiconductor substrate W and to suck in the plating liquid on the semiconductor substrate W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0316">Next, the operation of the electroless plating apparatus will be described. First, the holding means <b>311</b> is lowered from the illustrated state to provide a gap of a predetermined dimension between the holding means <b>311</b> and the dam member <b>331</b>, and the semiconductor substrate W is placed on and fixed to the substrate placing portion <b>313</b>. An 8 inch wafer, for example, is used as the semiconductor substrate W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0317">Then, the holding means <b>311</b> is raised to bring its upper surface into contact with the lower surface of the dam member <b>331</b> as illustrated, and the outer periphery of the semiconductor substrate W is sealed with the seal portion <b>333</b> of the dam member <b>331</b>. At this time, the surface of the semiconductor substrate W is in an open state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0318">Then, the semiconductor substrate W itself is directly heated by the backside heater <b>315</b> to render the temperature of the semiconductor substrate W, for example, 70° C. (maintained until termination of plating). Then, the plating liquid heated, for example, to 50° C. is ejected from the shower head <b>341</b> to pour the plating liquid over substantially the entire surface of the semiconductor substrate W. Since the surface of the semiconductor substrate W is surrounded by the dame member <b>331</b>, the poured plating liquid is all held on the surface of the semiconductor substrate W. The amount of the supplied plating liquid may be a small amount which will become a 1 mm thickness (about 30 ml) on the surface of the semiconductor substrate W. The depth of the plating liquid held on the surface to be plated may be 10 mm or less, and may be even 1 mm as in this embodiment. If a small amount of the supplied plating liquid is sufficient as in the present embodiment, the heating apparatus for heating the plating liquid may be of a small size. In this embodiment, the temperature of the semiconductor substrate W is raised to 70° C., and the temperature of the plating liquid is raised to 50° C. by heating. Thus, the surface, to be plated, of the semiconductor substrate W becomes, for example, 60° C., and hence a temperature optimal for a plating reaction in this embodiment can be achieved. If the semiconductor substrate W itself is adapted to be heated as described above, the temperature of the plating liquid requiring a great electric power consumption for heating need not be raised so high. This is preferred, because the electric power consumption can be decreased, and a change in the property of the plating liquid can be prevented. The electric power consumption for heating of the semiconductor substrate W itself may be small, and the amount of the plating liquid stored on the semiconductor substrate W is also small. Thus, heat retention of the semiconductor substrate W by the backside heater <b>315</b> can be performed easily, and the capacity of the backside heater <b>315</b> may be small, and the apparatus can be made compact. If means for directly cooling the semiconductor substrate W itself is used, switching between heating and cooling may be performed during plating to change the plating conditions. Since the plating liquid held on the semiconductor substrate is in a small amount, temperature control can be performed with good sensitivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0319">The semiconductor substrate W is instantaneously rotated by the motor M to perform uniform liquid wetting of the surface to be plated, and then plating of the surface to be plated is performed in such a state that the semiconductor substrate W is in a stationary state. Specifically, the semiconductor substrate W is rotated at 100 rpm or less for only 1 second to uniformly wet the surface, to be plated, of the semiconductor substrate W with the plating liquid. Then, the semiconductor substrate W is kept stationary, and electroless plating is performed for 1 minute. The instantaneous rotating time is 10 seconds or less at the longest.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0320">After completion of the plating treatment, the front end of the plating liquid recovery nozzle <b>365</b> is lowered to an area near the inside of the dam member <b>331</b> on the peripheral edge portion of the semiconductor substrate W to suck in the plating liquid. At this time, if the semiconductor substrate W is rotated at a rotational speed of, for example, 100 rpm or less, the plating liquid remaining on the semiconductor substrate W can be gathered in the portion of the dam member <b>331</b> on the peripheral edge portion of the semiconductor substrate W under centrifugal force, so that recovery of the plating liquid can be performed with a good efficiency and a high recovery rate. The holding means <b>311</b> is lowered to separate the semiconductor substrate W from the dam member <b>331</b>. The semiconductor substrate W is started to be rotated, and the cleaning liquid (ultrapure water) is jetted at the plated surface of the semiconductor substrate W from the nozzle <b>353</b> of the cleaning liquid supply means <b>351</b> to cool the plated surface, and simultaneously perform dilution and cleaning, thereby stopping the electroless plating reaction. At this time, the cleaning liquid jetted from the nozzle <b>353</b> may be supplied to the dam member <b>331</b> to perform cleaning of the dam member <b>331</b> at the same time. The plating waste liquid at this time is recovered into the recovery vessel <b>361</b> and discarded.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0321">The plating liquid once used is not reused, but thrown away. As described above, the amount of the plating liquid used in this apparatus can be made very small, compared with that in the prior art. Thus, the amount of the plating liquid which is discarded is small, even without reuse. In some cases, the plating liquid recovery nozzle <b>365</b> may not be installed, and the plating liquid which has been used may be recovered as a plating waste liquid into the recovery vessel <b>361</b>, together with the cleaning liquid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0322">Then, the semiconductor substrate W is rotated at a high speed by the motor M for spin-drying, and then the semiconductor substrate W is removed from the holding means <b>311</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0323"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref> is a schematic constitution drawing of an electroless plating apparatus constituted using another embodiment of the present invention. The embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref> is different from the aforementioned embodiment in that instead of providing the backside heater <b>315</b> in the holding means <b>311</b>, lamp heaters (heating means) <b>317</b> are disposed above the holding means <b>311</b>, and the lamp heaters <b>317</b> and a shower head <b>341</b>-<b>2</b> are integrated. For example, a plurality of ring-shaped lamp heaters <b>317</b> having different radii are provided concentrically, and many nozzles <b>343</b>-<b>2</b> of the shower head <b>341</b>-<b>2</b> are open in a ring form from the gaps between the lamp heaters <b>317</b>. The lamp heaters <b>317</b> may be composed of a single spiral lamp heater, or may be composed of other lamp heaters of various structures and arrangements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0324">Even with this constitution, the plating liquid can be supplied from each nozzle <b>343</b>-<b>2</b> to the surface, to be plated, of the semiconductor substrate W substantially uniformly in a shower form. Further, heating and heat retention of the semiconductor substrate W can be performed by the lamp heaters <b>317</b> directly uniformly. The lamp heaters <b>317</b> heat not only the semiconductor substrate W and the plating liquid, but also ambient air, thus exhibiting a heat retention effect on the semiconductor substrate W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0325">Direct heating of the semiconductor substrate W by the lamp heaters <b>317</b> requires the lamp heaters <b>317</b> with a relatively large electric power consumption. In place of such lamp heaters <b>317</b>, lamp heaters <b>317</b> with a relatively small electric power consumption and the backside heater <b>315</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> may be used in combination to heat the semiconductor substrate W mainly with the backside heater <b>315</b> and to perform heat retention of the plating liquid and ambient air mainly by the lamp heaters <b>317</b>. In the same manner as in the aforementioned embodiment, means for directly or indirectly cooling the semiconductor substrate W may be provided to perform temperature control.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0326">Plating was actually performed using the electroless plating apparatus shown in FIG. <b>36</b> and the conventional electroless plating apparatus shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</figref>, and the results were compared.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0328">(1) Plating method according to the present invention Process: A semiconductor substrate W is set on the holding means <b>311</b> heated by the backside heater <b>315</b> (70° C.), and the dam member <b>331</b> is set on the semiconductor substrate W. Then, the plating liquid (50° C.) is supplied for 5 seconds in an amount of only 30 ml from the shower head <b>341</b> in such a state that the semiconductor substrate W is in a stationary state. Thereafter, the semiconductor substrate W is rotated at 100 rpm for only 1 second to wet the surface of the semiconductor substrate W uniformly with the plating liquid, and the semiconductor substrate W is held in a stationary state for 1 minute. Then, the plating liquid is recovered by the plating liquid recovery nozzle <b>365</b>, and then the dam member <b>331</b> is separated from the surface of the semiconductor substrate W. While the semiconductor substrate W is being rotated (800 rpm), the cleaning liquid (ultrapure water) is supplied onto the surface of the semiconductor substrate W for 30 seconds for water washing, thereby stopping a plating reaction. Supply of the cleaning liquid is stopped, and the semiconductor substrate W is spin-dried (1000 rpm, 30 sec) and then taken out.
<br/>
(2) Plating method according to a conventional example Process: A semiconductor substrate W is set on the holding means <b>81</b>, and a plating liquid of 70° C. is dripped onto the center of the semiconductor substrate W for 1 minute (600 ml/min) in such a state that the semiconductor substrate W is rotated at 40 rpm. After dripping of the plating liquid is finished, a cleaning liquid (ultrapure water) is supplied onto the surface of the semiconductor substrate W for 30 seconds, while the semiconductor substrate W is continued to be rotated, thus performing water washing and stopping the plating reaction. Then, the semiconductor substrate W is withdrawn from the holding means <b>81</b>, and dried separately with a dryer.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0329"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 46A and 46B</figref> are views showing the results of measurement of the film thicknesses, on the X axis, of semiconductor substrates W subjected to the electroless plating according to the above respective methods. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46A</figref> is a view showing electroless Cu film thickness inplane distribution according to the present plating method, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46B</figref> is a view showing electroless Cu film thickness inplane distribution according to the conventional plating method. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 46A and 46B</figref>, the horizontal axis represents locations of the wafer (substrate), while the vertical axis represents the thickness of the plated film. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 46A and 46B</figref>, in the plating method according to the present invention, the film thickness is uniform throughout the semiconductor substrate W. Whereas in the plating method according to the conventional example, the film thickness is extremely smaller at the center of the semiconductor substrate W. The plating method according to the present invention was verified to improve the inplane uniformity of the plated film thickness remarkably.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0330">The embodiment of the present invention has been described above, but the present invention is not limited to the above embodiment, and various modifications are possible within the scope of the claims and the scope of the technical ideas described in the specification and drawings. For example, the electroless plating apparatus according to the present invention is not limited to the formation of a seed layer and a copper layer for interconnects, but can be used in the formation of a wiring protective film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0331">Further, the electroless plating apparatus according to the present invention can also be used in the pretreatment step and the catalyst treatment step for electroless plating. That is, in the above embodiment, for example, electroless plating was performed by supplying an electroless plating liquid from the shower head <b>341</b> to the surface, to be plated, of the semiconductor substrate W. However, other electroless plating treatment liquid for use in thepretreatment step or the catalyst treatment step for electroless plating may be supplied from the shower head <b>341</b> before the electroless plating liquid supply step. Thus, these treatment steps can also be performed by this electroless plating apparatus, together with the electroless plating step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0332">In the above embodiment, plating was carried out in such a state that the plating liquid is held on the surface to be plated, and the substrate is kept stationary. However, the substrate may be rotated slowly to such a degree that uneven plating does not occur.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0333">Furthermore, the shower head is not restrictive, if the plating liquid can be supplied in a scattered manner to the surface to be plated. For example, there may be provided a nozzle which supplies the plating liquid while performing a swinging motion or a translational motion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0334">In the above embodiment, cleaning was performed in the cleaning step after plating by supplying the cleaning liquid while the holding means <b>311</b> is kept to be separated from the dam member <b>331</b>. However, the cleaning may be performed by supplying the cleaning liquid while the holding means <b>311</b> is not separated from the dam member <b>331</b>, and by causing the cleaning liquid to overflow from the upper edge of the dam member <b>331</b>. When the plating liquid remaining inside is diluted by supplying the cleaning liquid, the liquid temperature is simultaneously lowered, whereupon the electroless plating reaction comes to an end. Incidentally, the holding means <b>311</b> and the dam member <b>331</b> may be separated by raising the dam member <b>331</b>, instead of lowering the holding means <b>311</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0335">During heating of the semiconductor substrate W by the backside heater <b>315</b> (especially during the period from start of heating to contact of the plating liquid with the surface), it is desirable to blow an inert gas such as an argon (Ar) gas onto the surface, to be plated, of the semiconductor substrate W in order to prevent oxidation. If a seed layer formed by sputtering or the like is exposed at the surface of the semiconductor substrate W, heating of the seed layer may result in the oxidation of the surface of the seed layer. Thus, the use of such a gas is particularly effective when it is attempted to prevent the oxidation and form a plated layer of more uniform film thickness on the seed layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0336">In the above embodiment, the backside heater <b>315</b> or the lamp heater <b>317</b> was used as the heating means for the semiconductor substrate W, but a heater may be further provided at other position close to the substrate. Moreover, instead of using the heater, or in addition to the use of the heater, the temperature of surroundings for performing electroless plating may be made substantially equal to the electroless plating treatment temperature (the temperature preferred for plating of the surface, to be plated which is the reaction surface), whereby heat dissipation can be prevented to keep the treatment temperature constant. In this case, a heated gas may be supplied in the surroundings of the substrate, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0337">In the above embodiment, the step of instantaneously rotating the substrate was used as the step of bringing the electroless plating treatment liquid supplied onto the surface, to be plated, of the substrate in contact with the surface to be plated. Other steps may be used as the step of spreading the electroless plating treatment liquid all over the surface to be plated, by moving the substrate, or moving the supplied electroless plating treatment liquid. That is, the step of moving the substrate is, for example, to vibrate or swing (shakingly move) the substrate to which the electroless plating treatment liquid is supplied. The step of moving the supplied electroless plating treatment liquid is, for example, to rake the supplied electroless plating treatment liquid by using a raking member, or to blow air onto the liquid surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0338">As described in detail above, the second aspect of the present invention offers the following excellent effects:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0339">(1) The electroless plating treatment liquid is stored and held on the surface to be plated for a predetermined time to treat the surface to be plated. Thus, treatment of the surface can be performed using a small amount of the electroless plating treatment liquid, so that a cost reduction can be achieved. Further, a pump of a small size can be used as a pump for supplying the electroless plating treatment liquid, the electroless plating apparatus can be made compact, and the cost for a clean room housing the apparatus can be reduced. Since a small amount of the electroless plating treatment liquid is used, heating and warmth retention of the electroless plating treatment liquid can be easily and promptly performed. Furthermore, there is no need to constantly heat a large amount of the electroless plating treatment liquid, and hence deterioration of the electroless plating treatment liquid is not promoted.
<br/>
(2) Since the amount of the electroless plating treatment liquid used may be small, discarding this liquid as it is does not lead to a cost increase. A fresh electroless plating treatment liquid can be always used, and the composition of the treatment liquid can be made constant. By-products generated when the liquid is used in a circulated manner are not deposited in the system, and stable treatment such as plating can be carried out easily. A liquid analyzer or a liquid adjustor for the plating liquid becomes unnecessary, and a decrease in the equipment cost and a decrease in the clean room cost can be achieved. Since a large amount of the electroless plating treatment liquid is not used in a circulated manner, particles are difficult to be generated from the constituent members of the apparatus, thus obviating the need for a filter.
<br/>
(3) Because treatment is performed in such a state that the electroless plating treatment liquid is held on the surface to be plated, the treatment conditions for the respective parts of the surface to be plated can be equalized, in comparison with a case in which treatment is performed in such a state that the electroless plating treatment liquid is dripped onto the surface to be plated. Consequently, the inplane uniformity of the thickness of the resulting plated film can be achieved. Particularly, when treatment is performed in such a state that the substrate is in a stationary state, heat dissipation due to the peripheral speed of the substrate does not take place, the reaction temperature can be uniformized without a fall in the temperature, and a stable process can be obtained, in comparison with a case in which the treatment is performed in such a state that the substrate is rotated.
<br/>
(4) The electroless plating treatment liquid is brought into contact with the surface, to be plated, of the substrate in such a state that the substrate is heated to a temperature higher than the temperature of the electroless plating treatment liquid. Thus, the temperature of the plating liquid requiring a great electric power consumption for heating need not be raised so much, and the electric power consumption can be decreased, and change of the composition of the plating liquid can be prevented.
<br/>
(5) In the case where electroless plating treatment liquid supply means is provided above the surface to be plated, and adapted to supply the electroless plating treatment liquid in a scattered state, the electroless plating treatment liquid can be simultaneously supplied to the entire surface, to be plated, of the substrate substantially uniformly, and temperature control of the electroless plating treatment liquid can be performed stably.
<br/>
(6) The electroless plating apparatus comprises holding means for holding a substrate; a plating liquid holding mechanism for sealing the periphery of the surface to be plated; and electroless plating treatment liquid supply means for supplying an electroless plating treatment liquid to, and storing the electroless plating treatment liquid on, the surface, to be plated, of the substrate sealed with the plating liquid holding mechanism. Thus, apretreatment liquid, a catalytic treatment liquid, an electroless plating liquid or the like can be used as the electroless plating treatment liquid while switching any of these liquids, and hence a series of electroless plating steps can be carried out in a single cell, and the apparatus can be made compact.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0340">Next, a third aspect of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 47 through 56</figref>. The third aspect of the present invention relates to various substrate processing apparatuses such as a substrate plating apparatus and a substrate polishing apparatus, and more particularly to a substrate processing apparatus preferred for detecting a substrate surface state of a substrate to be treated, such as film thickness. The present invention is applicable to all substrate processing apparatuses that perform transportation and treatment of the substrate. Here, an explanation will be made, particularly, for cases in which the substrate processing apparatus is applied for measurement of film thickness in a copper plating apparatus and a CMP apparatus for use in the formation of interconnection of a semiconductor substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0341"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref> is a plan view showing an example of a plating apparatus to which the present invention is applied. This plating apparatus comprises two wafer cassettes <b>510</b>, <b>510</b> for accommodating a plurality of substrates therein, a transfer robot <b>514</b> for withdrawing the substrate from the wafer cassettes <b>510</b>, <b>510</b> and transporting the substrate, and two plating modules (substrate processing modules) <b>512</b>, <b>512</b>, each of which performs a series of plating treatment steps consisting of plating, cleaning and drying of the substrate by one module. The reference numeral <b>518</b> denotes liquid supply equipment with a plating liquid tank <b>516</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0342">The constitution of the plating module <b>512</b> is the same as the constitution shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, and hence the module <b>512</b> will be described with reference to FIG. <b>14</b>. This plating module <b>512</b> can perform a series of treatments consisting of plating, cleaning and drying. That is, a substrate W is held with a surface thereof to be treated facing upward at three positions A, B and C by a substrate holding portion <b>2</b>-<b>9</b>. After the substrate W is carried in and placed at the position A, a plating liquid is supplied at the position B onto the surface to be treated in such a state that a cathode electrode <b>2</b>-<b>17</b> is connected to an area close to the outer periphery of the substrate W. An anode electrode (not shown) is brought into contact with the plating liquid from above, and a voltage is applied to perform electroplating. After completion of plating, the plating liquid on the substrate W is sucked in by a nozzle (not shown). Instead, cleaning water is supplied at the position C, and the substrate holding portion <b>2</b>-<b>9</b> is rotated to spread cleaning water on the entire surface of the substrate W, thereby performing cleaning. After cleaning, supply of the cleaning water is stopped, and the rotational speed of the substrate W is increased to remove the cleaning water and perform spin-drying. If necessary, a precoating treatment for applying, for example, a surface active agent may be performed before plating, or cleaning in multiple stages may be performed using different kinds of cleaning liquids. The present invention is not limited to the plating module <b>512</b> of the above structure. That is, the plating tank may be of other type such as a cup type or a closed type. In this case, a cleaning tank and a dryer may be provided separately.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0343">On the other hand, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>, the transfer robot <b>514</b> has arms <b>542</b> having forward ends on which respective robot hands <b>540</b> are provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0344">Next, the operation of the whole of this plating apparatus will be described. First, the robot hand <b>540</b> withdraws the substrate W before treatment from one of the wafer cassettes <b>510</b>, and places it on a substrate holding portion <b>521</b> of one of the plating modules <b>512</b>. Then, the plating module <b>512</b> performs a series of plating treatments as described above, and dries the substrate W. The dried substrate W is returned again to one of the wafer cassettes <b>510</b> by the robot hand <b>540</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0345">The substrate W before treatment and the substrate W after treatment pass through around the transfer robot <b>514</b>. In order to measure the film thicknesses of both substrates W, in the following embodiments, film thickness sensors S are provided at the transfer robot <b>514</b> itself or in its surroundings, or at a position, such as the interior of the plating module <b>512</b>, where the substrate W before treatment and the substrate W after treatment will pass through. Examples of the location and state of installation of the film thickness sensor S will be explained later in summary, and detailed explanations are omitted here.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0346">That is, if the film thickness sensor S is provided at these positions, the film thicknesses of the substrate W (the film thicknesses of all multi-layer metal films formed on the substrate W) before treatment and after treatment can be measured, without wasteful operations during a series of treatment actions. Specifically, when the substrate W passes through the film thickness sensor S for the first time, for example, the film thickness of the substrate W with the seed layer on its surface before plating is measured. When the substrate W passes through the film thickness sensor S for the second time, the film thickness of the substrate W with a metal film plated on the seed layer is measured. If a difference between the two film thicknesses is found, the plated metal film thickness can be measured. Generally, the film thickness of the seed layer is in the range of about several tens of nanometers to 100 and tens of nanometers, while the thickness of the plated metal film is about several micrometers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0347">Signals from the film thickness sensor S are sent to an arithmetic unit where an arithmetic operation, such as calculation of a difference or calculation of a moving average, is performed for thereby measuring the film thickness. The arithmetic unit and the arithmetic method may be arbitrarily selected ones which are preferred for the location of the film thickness sensor S, its detection method, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0348"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref> is a plan view showing an example of a CMP apparatus to which the present invention is applied. This CMP apparatus comprises wafer cassettes <b>531</b>, <b>531</b> for loading and unloading, cleaning machines <b>533</b>, <b>533</b>, <b>535</b>, and <b>535</b> for cleaning substrates, two transfer robots <b>514</b> <i>a</i>, <b>514</b> <i>b</i>, reversing machines <b>539</b>, <b>539</b>, and polishing units (substrate processing modules) <b>541</b>, <b>541</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0349">There are various flows of substrates W, and an example is as follows: First, the transfer robot <b>514</b> <i>a </i>withdraws the substrate W before treatment from one of the wafer cassettes <b>531</b> for loading, and transfers it to one of the reversing machines <b>539</b>. The transfer robot <b>514</b> <i>a </i>only rotates without moving from the illustrated position, and is disposed at a position where it can transport the substrate W from the wafer cassette <b>531</b> to the reversing machine <b>539</b>. The substrate W has its surface, to be treated, changed by the reversing machine <b>539</b> from an upwardly facing state to a downwardly facing state, and is then transferred to another transfer robot <b>514</b> <i>b</i>. The transfer robot <b>514</b> <i>b </i>transfers the substrate W to one of the polishing units <b>541</b> where a predetermined polishing is performed. The substrate W after polishing is transported by the transfer robot <b>514</b> <i>b </i>to one of the cleaning machines <b>535</b> where primary cleaning is conducted. The substrate W after primary cleaning is transported by the transfer robot <b>514</b> <i>b </i>to one of the reversing machines <b>539</b> where its treated surface is turned over to face upward. Then, the substrate W is transported by the transfer robot <b>514</b> <i>a </i>to one of the secondary cleaning machines <b>533</b>. After secondary cleaning is finished, the substrate W is accommodated again by the transfer robot <b>514</b> <i>a </i>in the wafer cassette <b>531</b> for unloading.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0350">Therefore, in case of this CMP apparatus, the substrate W before treatment and the substrate W after treatment pass through near the transfer robots <b>514</b> <i>a</i>, <b>514</b> <i>b </i>and the reversing machines <b>539</b>, <b>539</b>. In order to measure the film thicknesses of both substrates W, in the following embodiments, the film thickness sensor S is disposed at a position where the substrate W before treatment and the substrate W after treatment will pass, such as at the transfer robots <b>514</b> <i>a</i>, <b>514</b> <i>b </i>per se or the surroundings thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0351">That is, if the film thickness sensors S are installed at these positions, the film thicknesses of the substrate W before treatment and after treatment can be measured, without wasteful operations during a series of treatment operations. Specifically, for example, the film thickness of the substrate W before polishing is measured for the first time, and the film thickness of the substrate W after polishing is measured for the second time. If a difference between the two film thicknesses is found, the amount of polishing can be measured. Further, if an optical sensor is used, the film thickness of a metal film or an insulating film can be directly measured, without calculating the difference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0352">In some CMP apparatuses, the transfer robots <b>514</b> <i>a</i>, <b>514</b> <i>b </i>are movable in a direction of an arrow A shown in FIG. <b>48</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0354">The flow of a substrate W is, for example, as follows: First, the transfer robot <b>514</b> <i>a </i>withdraws the substrate W before treatment from one of the wafer cassettes <b>531</b> for loading.

The two robot hands <b>540</b>, <b>540</b> are arranged so as to be placed vertically one above the other via a predetermined gap. The arms <b>542</b> extend and contract to enable a substrate W placed on the robot hand <b>540</b> to be transported in a fore-and-aft direction. Also, the robot body <b>543</b> rotates and/or moves to permit transportation of the substrate W in an arbitrary direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0359">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 51A and 51B</figref>, four film thickness sensors S are directly attached, in a buried state, to the robot hand <b>540</b>. Any film thickness sensor S may be used, if it can measure the film thickness. Preferably, an eddy current sensor is used. The eddy current sensor generates eddy currents, and detects the frequencies and losses of electric currents which have passed through the substrate W and returned, thereby measuring the film thickness. The eddy current sensor is used in a non-contact manner. An optical sensor is also preferred as the film thickness sensor S. The optical sensor irradiates a sample with light, and can directly measure film thickness based on information on reflected light. The optical sensor is capable of measuring film thickness of not only a metal film, but also an insulating film such as an oxide film. The positions of installation of the film thickness sensors S are not limited to the illustrated positions, and the film thickness sensor S is attached in an arbitrary number at a location where measurement is to be made. The robot hand <b>540</b> is available as a dry hand handling a dry substrate W, or as a wet hand handling a wet substrate W. The film thickness sensor S can be attached to either hand. When the transfer robot <b>514</b> is used in a plating apparatus as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>, however, there is need to measure the film thickness of the substrate W in such a state that only the seed layer is initially formed. Thus, it is necessary to measure the film thickness of the substrate W, initially in a dry state, which is placed in the wafer cassettes <b>510</b>, <b>510</b>. Hence, it is desirable to attach the film thickness sensor S to the dry hand.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0360">Signals detected by the film thickness sensors S are sent to an arithmetic unit where an arithmetic operation, such as calculation of a difference between the film thickness of the substrate W before treatment and the film thickness of the substrate W after treatment, is performed and the film thickness is outputted onto a predetermined display or the like. Any arithmetic method may be used, if it can measure the film thickness appropriately.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0361">According to the present embodiment, since the film thickness can be measured while the robot hand <b>540</b> is transporting the substrate W, there is no need to provide a film thickness measuring step separately during the substrate treatment process, and the throughput is not decreased. Since the film thickness sensors S are attached to the robot hand <b>540</b>, a space saving can be actualized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0362"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 52A and 52B</figref> are views showing the transfer robots <b>514</b>, <b>514</b> <i>a </i>and <b>514</b> <i>b </i>illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 47 and 48</figref> to which the second example of the present invention has been applied. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52A</figref> is a schematic plan view, while <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52B</figref> is a schematic side view. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 52A and 52B</figref>, according to this embodiment, five film thickness sensors S are disposed at a lower portion of the robot hand <b>540</b> of the robot body <b>543</b>. That is, a disk-shaped mounting plate <b>545</b> of substantially the same size as the substrate W is disposed at the lower portion of the robot hand <b>540</b>, and the five film thickness sensors S are attached onto the mounting plate <b>545</b>. The mounting plate <b>545</b> is fixed to the robot body <b>543</b>, but may be fixed to other members.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0363">The film thickness sensors S are attached at positions where the film thickness sensors S do not overlap with the robot hand <b>540</b> as illustrated, whereby the film thickness can be measured in a wide area of the entire substrate W. The present embodiment can also achieve a space saving, and can perform measurement in a very short time. By stopping the substrate W above the mounting plate <b>545</b>, measurement of the film thickness at fixed points of the substrate W can be made. If the substrate W on the robot hand <b>540</b> is caused to pass over the mounting plate <b>545</b> without stopping, measurement during scanning becomes possible. Since the film thickness sensors S are integral with the robot body <b>543</b>, stable detection can be performed. If the mounting plate <b>545</b> is fixed to other members, in place of the robot body <b>543</b>, it becomes possible to adjust the distance between the substrate W and the sensors by arbitrarily varying the height of the robot hand.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0364">The construction in which signals after detection are sent to the arithmetic unit to measure the film thickness is the same as in the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 51A and 51B</figref>. However, in the case of measurement simultaneous with scanning, the points of measurement change with the passage of time, so that it is preferred to perform computations by the method of moving averages and calculate the film thickness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0365"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 53A and 53B</figref> are views showing a third example of the present invention. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53A</figref> is a schematic plan view, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53B</figref> is a schematic side view. In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 53A and 53B</figref>, three film thickness sensors S are provided on an upper portion of an exit and entrance portion <b>550</b>, for a substrate W, of the plating module <b>512</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 47</figref>. That is, a rectangular mounting plate <b>551</b> is disposed above the exit and entrance portion <b>550</b>, and the three film thickness sensors S are attached in series to a lower surface of the mounting plate <b>551</b>. The mounting plate <b>551</b> may be fixed to the plating module <b>512</b>, or may be fixed to the robot body <b>543</b> of the transfer robot <b>514</b> (not shown), or may be fixed to other members.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0366">According to such a constitution, the film thickness sensors S scan the substrate W when the substrate W is placed into and withdrawn from the plating module <b>512</b>. This is suitable for scan measurement. By providing some rows of the film thickness sensors S as in this embodiment, moreover, arbitrary points on the substrate W can be measured by scanning. By arbitrarily varying the height of the robot hand, furthermore, it becomes possible to adjust the distance between the substrate W and the sensors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0367">Signals detected by the film thickness sensors S are computed by an arithmetic unit. In the case of scan measurement, it is desirable to perform computation by the method of moving averages as in the second example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0368">When this embodiment is applied to the CMP apparatus, the film thickness sensors S may be disposed near the exit and entrance, where the substrate W is introduced and withdrawn, of the polishing unit (substrate treatment module) <b>541</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 48 and 49</figref>. When the substrate W is carried into the polishing unit <b>541</b>, the surface, to be treated, of the substrate W faces downward. Thus, it is preferred to dispose the film thickness sensors S on a lower side of the location of the polishing unit <b>541</b> where the substrate W is carried in (of course, even when the film thickness sensors S are installed on the upper side of such location, measurement of the film thickness is possible, but installation on the lower side results in a higher accuracy). After polishing is completed, the treated surface of the substrate W is in a wet state. The use of film thickness sensors capable of measurement even in a wet condition makes it possible to measure the film thickness by the same method as in the plating module <b>512</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0369"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref> is a schematic front view of a reversing machine <b>539</b> and its surroundings to which a fourth example of the present invention has been applied. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref> is a plan view of reversing arm <b>553</b>, <b>553</b> portions. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 54 and 55</figref>, the reversing arms <b>553</b>, <b>553</b> put a substrate W therebetween and hold its outer periphery from right and left sides, and rotate the substrate W through 180°, thereby turning the substrate over. A circular mounting base <b>555</b> is disposed immediately below the reversing arms <b>553</b>, <b>553</b> (reversing stage), and a plurality of film thickness sensors S are provided on the mounting base <b>555</b>. The mounting base <b>555</b> is adapted to be movable upward and downward by a drive mechanism <b>557</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0370">During reversing of the substrate W, the mounting base <b>555</b> waits at a position, indicated by solid lines, below the substrate W. Before or after reversing, the mounting base <b>555</b> is raised to a position indicated by dotted lines to bring the film thickness sensors S close to the substrate W gripped by the reversing arms <b>553</b>, <b>553</b>, thereby measuring the film thickness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0371">According to the present embodiment, since there is no restriction such as the arms <b>542</b> of the transfer robot <b>514</b>, the film thickness sensors S can be installed at arbitrary positions on the mounting base <b>555</b>. Further, the mounting base <b>555</b> is adapted to be movable upward and downward, so that the distance between the substrate W and the sensors can be adjusted at the time of measurement. It is also possible to mount plural types of sensors suitable for the purpose of detection, and change the distance between the substrate W and the sensors each time measurements are made by the respective sensors. However, the mounting base <b>555</b> moves upward and downward, thus requiring certain measuring time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0372"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref> is a sectional view of an essential part of a plating module <b>512</b> to which a fifth example of the present invention has been applied. This plating module <b>512</b> is different from the plating module <b>512</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> in only that a mounting base <b>559</b> having film thickness sensors S mounted thereon is disposed immediately below a location of a substrate holding portion <b>29</b> where a substrate W is held (i.e. a plating stage). The film thickness sensors S may be installed at arbitrary locations on the mounting base <b>559</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0373">In the present embodiment, the film thickness sensors S are disposed immediately below the plating stage, so that the film thickness measurement can be made on a real-time basis while plating is being performed. Thus, if the results of the measurement are fed back in real time and reflected in plating, it is possible to perform plating with an extremely high accuracy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0374">The embodiments of the present invention have been described above, but the present invention is not limited to these embodiments, and various modifications are possible within the scope of the claims and within the scope of the technical ideas described in the specification and drawings. That is, the above embodiments have been shown as embodiments in which sensors for detection of film thickness (film thickness of a metal film or an insulating film) are used as the sensors. However, the present invention is not limited to these sensors. By selecting sensors and computation means according to various purposes, it is permissible to constitute and use other various sensors for substrate surface state detection, such as a sensor for detection of presence or absence of a metallic thin film, a sensor for detection of presence or absence of particles on a substrate, and a sensor for recognition of a pattern formed on a substrate. Furthermore, any shapes or materials, which are not directly described in the specification and drawings, fall within the scope of the technical ideas of the present invention, if they exhibit the operations and effects of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0375">As described in detail above, according to the third aspect of the present invention, various substrate surface states such as the metal film thickness of the substrate can be detected without stopping or interrupting the substrate treatment process. Thus, the surface state of the substrate can be detected, with high throughput being actualized, and the reliability and rapidity of substrate treatment such as plating or polishing can be increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0376">Further, feedback of the measurement results for adjustment of the substrate treatment conditions can be performed promptly, and hence it becomes possible to perform substrate treatment, such as plating or polishing, rapidly under optimal treatment conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0377">Furthermore, if a lightweight, and small-sized detection sensor is used, such sensor can be easily attached to a robot hand or the like of a plating apparatus, and the above-mentioned effects can be achieved with a space-saving.</div>

The facilities <b>710</b> have a partition wall <b>711</b> for dividing the facilities <b>710</b> into a plating section <b>712</b> and a clean section <b>713</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0380">In the clean section <b>713</b>, there are provided two loading and unloading sections <b>715</b> for placing a substrate cassette thereon, and two cleaning units <b>716</b> for cleaning (rinsing) a plated substrate with pure water and drying.

For example, the cleaning unit <b>716</b> has cleaning liquid supply nozzles for supplying ultrapure water to both surfaces of a substrate, and spins the substrate at a high speed to dewater and dry the substrate. The cleaning unit <b>716</b> is provided with a revolution member supporting apparatus shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3 through 6</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0381">On the other hand, in the plating section <b>712</b>, there are provided two pretreatment units <b>721</b> for pretreating a surface of a substrate for plating, and inverting thepretreated substrate by a inverter <b>720</b>, four plated film forming units <b>722</b> for plating a surface of a substrate with copper in such a state that the front surface of the substrate faces downwardly, and two first substrate stages <b>723</b> <i>a</i>, <b>723</b> <i>b </i>for holding a substrate placed thereon.

Accordingly, this construction facilitates maintenance and replacement of the anode <b>748</b>, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0396">The anode <b>748</b> is made of copper containing 0.03% to 0.05% phosphorus (residual-phosphorus copper), and hence a black film is formed on the upper surface of the anode <b>748</b> as plating proceeds. Such a black film can reduce generation of anode slime.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0397">Plating liquid supply nozzles <b>753</b> horizontally projecting toward the center of the plating chamber <b>749</b> are provided on the inner circumferential wall of the plating container <b>750</b> at equal intervals along the circumferential direction. Each of the plating liquid supply nozzles <b>753</b> is communicated with a plating liquid supply passage <b>754</b> extended vertically through the interior of the plating container <b>750</b>. In the present embodiment, four circumferentially divided plating liquid reservoirs in an arc-shaped form are provided in the inner circumferential wall of the plating container <b>750</b>. Each of the plating liquid reservoirs is communicated with the plating liquid supply passage <b>754</b> located at the central portion along the circumferential direction of the plating liquid reservoir. Each of the plating liquid reservoirs has two plating liquid supply nozzles <b>753</b> provided on both ends of the plating liquid reservoir. The plating liquid of the same flow rate is respectively supplied to each of the plating liquid reservoirs via control valves <b>756</b> described later. Therefore, the plating liquid is homogeneously ejected from each of the plating liquid supply nozzles <b>753</b> into the plating chamber <b>749</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0398">Each of the plating liquid supply passages <b>754</b> is connected to the plating liquid regulating tank <b>740</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 58 and 67</figref>) via a plating liquid supply pipe <b>755</b>. Control valves <b>756</b> for controlling the back pressure so as to be constant are disposed on each of the plating liquid supply pipes <b>755</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0399">Further, the plating container <b>750</b> is provided with first plating liquid discharge ports <b>757</b> for withdrawing the plating liquid <b>745</b> in the plating chamber <b>749</b> from the peripheral portion of the bottom of the plating chamber <b>749</b>, and second plating liquid discharge ports <b>759</b> for discharging the plating liquid <b>745</b> overflowing a weir member <b>758</b> provided at the upper end of the plating container <b>750</b>. Each of the first plating liquid discharge ports <b>757</b> is connected to a reservoir <b>926</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</figref>) via a plating liquid discharge pipe <b>760</b> <i>a</i>. A flow controller <b>761</b> <i>a </i>is provided on the plating liquid discharge pipe <b>760</b> <i>a</i>. On the other hand, each of the second plating liquid discharge ports <b>759</b> is connected to the reservoir <b>926</b> via a plating liquid discharge pipe <b>760</b> <i>b</i>. A flow controller <b>761</b> <i>b </i>is provided on the plating liquid discharge pipe <b>760</b> <i>b</i>. The flow controller <b>761</b> <i>b </i>may not be provided (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</figref> shows an example that omits the flow controller). The plating liquid fed into the reservoir <b>926</b> is supplied to the plating liquid regulating tank <b>740</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref>) from the reservoir <b>926</b> by a pump <b>928</b>. In the plating liquid regulating tank <b>740</b>, the temperature of the plating liquid is adjusted, and the concentration of various components in the plating liquid is measured and adjusted. Thereafter, the plating liquid is respectively supplied to the plated film forming unit <b>722</b> (see FIG. <b>67</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0400">The first plating liquid discharge ports <b>757</b> (16 ports in the drawing), which are in circular form having a diameter of 16 mm to 20 mm, for example, are disposed at equal intervals along the circumferential direction. The second plating liquid discharge ports (3 ports in the drawing) <b>59</b> are in arc-shaped form having a central angle of about 25°.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0401">The plating liquid <b>745</b> ejected from the plating liquid supply nozzles <b>753</b> is discharged to the reservoir <b>726</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</figref>) from one or both of the first plating liquid discharge ports <b>757</b> and the second liquid discharge ports <b>759</b>, for thereby keeping the liquid level of the plating liquid <b>745</b> in the plating chamber <b>749</b> at a constant value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0402">A vertical stream regulating ring <b>762</b> for damming off a flow of the plating liquid <b>745</b> directed outwardly along the horizontal direction is provided in the plating chamber <b>749</b>. A horizontal stream regulating ring <b>763</b> having an outer circumferential end fixed to the plating container <b>750</b> is provided in the plating chamber <b>749</b>. The vertical stream regulating ring <b>762</b> is connected to the inner circumferential end of the horizontal stream regulating ring <b>763</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0403">The plating liquid horizontally ejected from each of the plating liquid supply nozzles <b>753</b> collides with each other at the central portion of the plating chamber <b>749</b> to form an upward flow and a downward flow. When no substrate is held by the head <b>747</b>, the upward flow pushes up the liquid surface of the plating liquid <b>745</b> at the central portion inside the vertical stream regulating ring <b>762</b>. When the substrate is lowered, the substrate is firstly brought into contact with the plating liquid <b>745</b> at the central portion pushed up by the upward flow, and hence air bubbles on the lower surface of the substrate are pushed outwardly. On the other hand, the downward flow is changed to a horizontal flow flowing from the central portion of the anode <b>748</b> to the peripheral portion of the anode <b>748</b> to push away peeled fine pieces of a black film formed on the surface of the anode <b>748</b>. The peeled pieces of the black film is passed from the peripheral portion of the anode <b>748</b> through the lower portion of the horizontal stream regulating ring <b>763</b> to the first plating liquid discharge ports <b>757</b>, so that the peeled pieces of the black film can be prevented from approaching and being attached to the surface of the substrate to be processed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0404">In the electroplating, the current density in the plating liquid governs the thickness of the plated film. Therefore, in order to uniform the thickness of the plated film, it is necessary to uniform the distribution of the current density in the plating liquid. In the present embodiment, as described below, since the peripheral portion of the substrate has electrical contacts, the current density of the plating liquid present on the peripheral portion of the substrate tends to be increased. Therefore, the vertical stream regulating ring <b>762</b> extended vertically is disposed in the vicinity of the peripheral portion of the substrate, and the horizontal stream regulating ring <b>763</b> extended horizontally outwardly is disposed below the vertical stream regulating ring <b>762</b>, for thereby regulating the electric current flowing in the vicinity of the peripheral portion of the substrate. Thus, these stream regulating rings can reduce local concentration of the electric current and can uniform the current density of the plating liquid to thus prevent the plated film from being thick at the peripheral portion of the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0405">In the present embodiment, the vertical stream regulating ring and the horizontal stream regulating ring are used for regulating the electric current around the peripheral portion of the substrate. However, the present invention is of course not limited to this example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0406">On the other hand, the head <b>747</b> is provided with a rotatable housing <b>770</b> in a hollow cylindrical form and a disk-shaped substrate table <b>771</b> for holding a substrate W on its lower surface and is rotated together with the housing <b>770</b>. A ring-shaped substrate holding member <b>772</b> projecting radially inwardly is provided at the lower end of the housing <b>770</b>. For example, the substrate holding member <b>772</b> is formed of a packing material and has a tapered surface on a part of its inner circumferential surface for guiding the substrate W. The peripheral portion of the substrate W is held between the substrate holding member <b>772</b> and the substrate table <b>771</b>. The substrate table <b>771</b> is constituted as a pressing member for pressing the substrate W against the substrate holding member <b>772</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0407"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</figref> is an enlarged view showing a part of the head <b>747</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</figref>, a ring-shaped lower sealing member <b>773</b> is mounted on the substrate holding member <b>772</b>. The lower sealing member <b>773</b> projects inwardly, and the front end of its upper surface projects upwardly in an annular tapered form. An upper sealing member <b>774</b> is mounted on the peripheral portion of the lower surface of the substrate table <b>771</b>. The upper sealing member <b>774</b> has a spired portion projecting downwardly from the lower surface of the substrate table <b>771</b>. Thus, when the substrate W is held by the substrate holding member <b>772</b>, the lower surface of the substrate W is brought into pressure contact with the lower sealing member <b>773</b>, and the upper surface of the substrate W is brought into pressure contact with the upper sealing member <b>774</b>, for thereby sealing the peripheral portion of the substrate W reliably.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0408">In the present embodiment, eighty air vent holes <b>775</b> having a diameter of 3 mm are formed in the substrate holding member <b>772</b> at equal intervals along the circumferential direction. Each of the air vent holes <b>775</b> is extended horizontally outwardly and further extended outwardly in an upwardly inclined state. The air vent holes <b>775</b> are provided in such a state that, when the head <b>747</b> is located in the plating position as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref>, about half of the peripheral opening end of the air vent hole <b>775</b> is exposed to the exterior from the liquid surface of the plating liquid <b>745</b> in the plating chamber <b>749</b>. As described above, the upward flow of the plating liquid <b>745</b> in the plating chamber <b>749</b> is brought into contact with the substrate W to sweep away air bubbles to the exterior from the central portion of the substrate W. Accordingly, the air bubbles swept by the upward flow are successively discharged to the exterior through the air vent holes <b>775</b>. Thus, air bubbles can be prevented from remaining between the substrate W and the surface of the plating liquid <b>745</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0409">For example, the angle of inclination of the air vent holes <b>775</b> is set to be 30°. When the venting of air is taken into consideration, the air vent holes <b>775</b> should preferably have a diameter of 2 mm to 5 mm, and more preferably about 3 mm. Further, the air vent holes <b>775</b> should preferably be inclined upwardly in the outward direction at an angle of not less than 200, and more preferably about 30°.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0410">Further, the peripheral opening end of the air vent holes <b>775</b> may be located fully above the liquid surface of the plating liquid at the time of plating. The air vent holes <b>775</b> may be branched into two holes, one of which is opened in the vicinity of the liquid surface, and the other of which is opened at a position fully above the liquid surface. It has been confirmed that, when a gap S between the lower surface of the substrate W held on the lower surface of the substrate table <b>771</b> and the upper end of the air vent holes <b>775</b> is not more than about 1.5 mm, air can be vented in a short time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0411">Each of the air vent holes <b>775</b> may be provided in any form, e.g., in a linear form, or each of the air vent holes <b>775</b> may be branched outwardly into two holes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0412">Further, plate-spring-like contacts <b>776</b> for a cathode electrode are disposed on the substrate holding member <b>772</b> of the housing <b>770</b>. When the substrate W is held on the lower surface of the substrate table <b>771</b>, the contacts <b>776</b> for a cathode electrode energize the substrate W. Feeding contacts (probes) <b>777</b> are vertically downwardly provided at the outer circumferential side of the substrate table <b>771</b>. When the substrate table <b>771</b> is lowered, each of the feeding contacts <b>777</b> feeds power to each of the contacts <b>776</b> for a cathode electrode. Since the plating liquid <b>745</b> is sealed with a lower sealing member <b>773</b> disposed between the substrate W and the substrate holding member <b>772</b>, the contacts <b>776</b> for a cathode electrode and the feeding contacts <b>777</b> can be prevented from bringing into contact with the plating liquid <b>745</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0413">Openings <b>96</b> are provided on both sides of the cylindrical surface of the housing <b>70</b> for allowing the substrate W and the robot hand to pass therethrough (see FIG. <b>60</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0414">Next, a series of plating processes using the plating apparatus according to this embodiment will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0415">A cassette housing a plurality of substrates whose surfaces (surface on which semiconductor devices are formed, i.e., surface to be processed) face upward is placed on a loading and unloading sections <b>715</b> within the facilities <b>710</b>. The recess-type hand of the first transfer robot <b>717</b> is inserted into the cassette and holds the substrate, and then takes out the substrate from the cassette. The first transfer robot <b>717</b> which holds the substrate by the hand rotates about its own axis and places the substrate onto the second substrate stage <b>726</b> <i>a</i>. Next, the third transfer robot <b>727</b> holds the substrate placed on the second substrate stage <b>726</b> <i>a </i>by the recess-type hand, rotates about its own axis, and then places the substrate onto the first substrate stage <b>723</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0416">The second transfer robot <b>724</b> moves to a position close to the first substrate stage <b>723</b> <i>a</i>, and holds the substrate placed on the first substrate stage <b>723</b> <i>a </i>by the recess-type hand. Thereafter, the second transfer robot <b>724</b> holding the substrate rotates toward the pretreatment unit <b>721</b>, and transfers the substrate to the substrate chuck of the pretreatment unit <b>721</b> through a slit formed in the splash preventive cover for allowing the substrate to pass therethrough.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0417">In the substrate chuck of the pretreatment unit <b>721</b>, fingers are opened, and the substrate is positioned between the fingers, and then the fingers are closed to hold the substrate. Next, a pretreatment liquid nozzle, which has been in the stand-by position so as not to hinder the movement of the hands of the inverter <b>720</b>, is rotated to a position above and near the center of the substrate. While the substrate chuck holding the substrate is rotated at a medium speed of, for example, about 300 min<sup>−1</sup>, the pretreatment liquid is supplied through the pretreatment liquid nozzle onto the substrate. When the liquid has been speedily spreaded over the entire surface of the substrate, the rotational speed of the substrate is increased to remove excessive pretreatment liquid on the substrate under a centrifugal force.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0418">After the removal of the liquid from the substrate is completed and the substrate chuck is stopped, the hands of the inverter <b>720</b> are lowered. The hands hold the substrate, and the fingers of the substrate chuck in the pretreatment unit <b>721</b> are opened to transfer the substrate to the inverter <b>720</b>. The inverter <b>720</b> is raised to a position where the hands of the inverter <b>720</b> do not contact the substrate chuck while an inverting operation is performed. Thereafter, the hands of the inverter <b>720</b> and the substrate are rotated by an angle of 180 degrees about the horizontal inverting axis, and the surface of the substrate faces downwardly. The inverter <b>720</b> is lowered to a position where the substrate is transferred to the second transfer robot <b>724</b>, and then stopped.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0419">The hands of the inverter <b>720</b> are located at a position below the inverting axis when the hands receive the substrate from the third transfer robot <b>727</b> and receives the substrate from the substrate chuck after the pretreatment. On the other hand, when the hands are inverted about the inventing axis to transfer the substrate to the second transfer robot <b>724</b>, the hands are located at a position above the inverting axis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0420">The second transfer robot <b>724</b> inserts the recess-type hand into the splash preventive cover through the slit formed in the cover. The substrate is held by the hands of the inverter <b>720</b>. The recess-type hand is positioned so as to allow the hand to contact the lower peripheral edge portion of the substrate. The hands of the inverter <b>720</b> release the substrate, and the recess-type hand of the second transfer robot <b>724</b> holds the substrate with its surface facing downwardly. The second transfer robot <b>724</b> takes out the substrate from the pretreatment unit <b>721</b>, and moves to one predetermined plated film forming unit <b>722</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0421">The housing <b>770</b> and the substrate table <b>771</b> in the plated film forming unit <b>722</b> are raised to a position where the substrate is attached or detached. The substrate table <b>771</b> is further lifted to the upper end of the housing <b>770</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0422">The second transfer robot <b>724</b> inserts the hand and the substrate into the housing <b>770</b> through the opening <b>796</b> formed in the housing <b>770</b>, and lifts the hand to a position immediately below the substrate table <b>771</b>. In this state, the hooks are closed by the urging forces of the compression coil springs (not shown) to thus hold the substrate. After the substrate is held by the hooks, the hand of the second transfer robot <b>724</b> is slightly lowered and withdrawn through the opening <b>796</b> of the housing <b>770</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0423">Next, the substrate table <b>771</b> is lowered, and the substrate is centered by the tapered portion on the inner side of the substrate holding member <b>772</b> of the housing <b>770</b>, placed on the lower sealing member <b>773</b> of the substrate holding member <b>772</b>, and further pressed against the upper sealing member <b>774</b> near the peripheral portion of the substrate table <b>771</b> to form a seal for preventing the plating liquid from entering the electrode contact side. At the same time, the substrate table <b>771</b> is lowered to press the feeding contacts <b>777</b> against the contacts <b>776</b> for a cathode electrode, thereby achieving reliable contacts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0424">In this state, when the plating liquid is ejected through the plating liquid supply nozzles <b>753</b> in the plating process container <b>746</b>, the liquid surface in its center portion rises. At the same time, while the substrate W and the substrate table <b>71</b> are rotated at a medium speed of, for example, 150 min<sup>−1</sup>, and then lowered by a ball screw or the like. The rotational speed of the substrate is preferably about 100 to 250 min<sup>−1 </sup>from the viewpoint of the removal of air. In this case, after the central portion of the substrate comes into contact with the surface of the plating liquid <b>745</b>, the area of contact between the substrate and the raised liquid surface increases gradually, and then the plating liquid <b>745</b> reaches the periphery of the substrate. In the periphery of the lower surface of the substrate, the lower sealing member <b>773</b> projects from the substrate surface, and hence air is likely to be left on the periphery of the lower surface of the substrate. However, by allowing the plating liquid containing air bubbles to flow to the exterior through air vent holes <b>775</b> by the rotation of the housing <b>770</b>, air bubbles present on the lower surface of the substrate can be removed. Thus, air bubbles on the lower surface of the substrate can be completely removed, and uniform plating can be realized. The predetermined position where the substrate is plated is such that the substrate is immersed in the plating liquid <b>745</b> within the plating chamber <b>749</b> and the plating liquid does not enter the housing <b>770</b> through the openings <b>796</b> of the housing <b>770</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0425">When the substrate is lowered to a predetermined position, the housing <b>770</b> is rotated at a medium speed for several seconds to remove air. The rotational speed of the housing <b>770</b> is then changed to a low rotational speed of, for example, 100 min<sup>−1</sup>, and plating current is flowed for electroplating by utilizing the above anode and the treating face of the substrate as the cathode. In this case, the rotational speed is in the range of, for example, 0 to 225 min<sup>−1</sup>. During the plating process, the plating liquid is continuously fed at a predetermined flow rate through the plating liquid supply nozzles <b>753</b>, is discharged through the first plating liquid discharge ports <b>757</b> and the second plating liquid discharge ports <b>759</b>, and is circulated through the plating liquid regulating tank <b>740</b>. In this case, since the plating thickness is determined by the current density and the current feed time, the current feed time (plating time) is set according to a desired amount of deposition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0426">This plating time is, for example, 120 to 150 seconds. The plating process is carried out, for example, at about 1 A for about 40 seconds, and then, for example, at about 7.4 A for remaining time. Accordingly, a plated film with uniformity can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0427">After the completion of the feed of current, the housing <b>770</b>, the substrate W and the substrate table <b>771</b> is lifted to a position above the surface of the plating liquid <b>745</b> within the plating chamber <b>749</b> and below the upper end of the plating process container cover. Then, the substrate is rotated at a high speed of, for example, 500 to 800 min<sup>−1 </sup>to remove the plating liquid from the substrate under a centrifugal force. After the completion of the removal of the liquid from the substrate, the rotation of the housing <b>770</b> is stopped so that the housing <b>770</b> faces a predetermined direction. After the housing <b>770</b> is lifted to the position where the substrate is attachable or detachable, the substrate table <b>771</b> is further raised to a position where the substrate is attachable or detachable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0428">When the surface of the plating liquid is raised, the feed rate of the plating liquid is about 10 to 30 liters/min (preferably 20 liters/min), and the plating liquid is discharged through the first plating liquid discharge ports <b>757</b> at a rate of about 3 to 6 liters/min (preferably 5 liters/min). During plating, the feed rate of the plating liquid is about 8 to 20 liters/min (preferably 10 liters/min), and the plating liquid is discharged through the first plating liquid discharge ports <b>757</b> at a rate of about 3 to 6 liters/min (preferably 5 liters/min), and through the second plating liquid discharge ports <b>759</b> at a rate of about 3 to 6 liters/min (preferably 5 liters/min). When the liquid level is lowered after plating, the feed rate of the plating liquid is about 15 to 30 liters/min (preferably 20 liters/min), and the plating liquid is discharged through the first plating liquid discharge ports <b>757</b> at a rate of about 20 to 30 liters/min (preferably 25 liters/min). During stopping of the plating process for a long period of time, the plating liquid is fed at a rate of about 2 to 4 liters/min (preferably 3 liters/min), and is entirely flowed and circulated through the second plating liquid discharge ports <b>759</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0429">Next, the hand of the second transfer robot <b>724</b> is inserted into the housing <b>770</b> through the opening <b>796</b> of the housing <b>770</b>, and is raised to a position where the hand receives the substrate.

In this state, the hand is slightly lowered, and the hand and the substrate held by the hand are taken out through the opening <b>796</b> of the housing <b>770</b>. The substrate is held in such a manner that the surface of the substrate faces downwardly and only the peripheral edge of the substrate is brought into contact with the hand, as with mounting the substrate with the hand.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0430">The substrate held by the second transfer robot <b>724</b> is transferred to the inverter <b>720</b> in the first substrate stage <b>723</b> <i>b </i>in such a state that the surface of the substrate faces downwardly.

Next, the third transfer robot <b>727</b> holds the substrate placed on the inverter <b>720</b> in the first substrate stage <b>723</b> <i>b </i>by the hand, and transfers the substrate to the chemical liquid cleaning unit <b>725</b>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0434"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</figref> shows another embodiment of a plated film forming unit <b>722</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0435">Thus, the provision of the labyrinth seal <b>912</b> comprising a plurality of grooves <b>910</b> around the inlet of the anode support <b>752</b> in the plating container <b>750</b> can eliminate the need to tighten the sealing member <b>900</b> by large force, and can ensure reliable sealing of the gap between the plating container <b>750</b> and the anode support <b>752</b> to prevent the plating liquid from leaking out. The inert gas introduction passage <b>914</b> is connected to one of the grooves <b>910</b>, the plating liquid return passages <b>916</b> are connected to the bottoms of all the grooves <b>910</b>, and inert gas, such as nitrogen gas, having a pressure high enough to discharge the plating liquid remaining within the grooves <b>910</b> is introduced to the groove <b>910</b> through the inert gas introduction passage <b>914</b>. Thus, the plating liquid remaining within the grooves <b>910</b> can be discharged to the exterior, and a deterioration in the effect of the labyrinth seal <b>912</b> by the plating liquid remaining within the groove <b>910</b> can be prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0436">In this embodiment, the labyrinth seal <b>912</b> comprising a plurality of grooves <b>910</b> is provided on the plating container side. Alternatively, the labyrinth seal may be provided on the anode support side or on both the plating container side and the anode support side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0437"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</figref> schematically shows another embodiment of a plated film forming unit <b>722</b>. In the plated film forming unit <b>722</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 59 and 60</figref>, the transfer of the substrate is performed by moving the housing <b>770</b> up and down. In the a plated film forming unit <b>722</b> of this embodiment, the liquid level of the plating liquid within the plating process container is raised or lowered to transfer the substrate without the vertical movement of the housing <b>770</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0438">When this plated film forming unit <b>722</b> is provided, the second transfer robot <b>24</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref> which is mobile type and rotatable may have a suction-type hand which holds the substrate by suction and is rotatable to change the suction surface of the suction-type hand to face upwardly or downwardly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0439">The plated film forming unit <b>722</b> according to this embodiment will be described below.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0440">The plated film forming unit <b>722</b> comprises a plating process container <b>746</b> and a head <b>747</b>. The plating container <b>750</b> of the plating process container <b>746</b> has first plating liquid discharge ports (not shown) which are located around the anode <b>748</b> and are opened at the bottom of the plating container <b>50</b>, and second plating liquid discharge ports <b>759</b> for discharging the plating liquid <b>745</b> which have overflowed a weir member <b>758</b> in the plating container <b>750</b>. Further, the plating container <b>750</b> has third plating liquid discharge ports <b>820</b> which are open at a step portion <b>750</b> <i>a </i>provided at the halfway along the height direction of the circumferential wall of the weir member <b>758</b>. A shut-off valve <b>822</b> is provided in a plating liquid discharge pipe <b>821</b> extending from the third plating liquid discharge ports <b>820</b> to the reservoir <b>926</b> (see FIG. <b>67</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0441">With this construction, a plane defined by the upper end of the weir member <b>758</b> in the plating container <b>750</b> constitutes a liquid level A for plating, while a plane defined by the step portion <b>50</b> <i>a </i>constitutes a liquid level B for transferring the substrate. Specifically, at the time of plating process, the shut-off valve <b>822</b> is closed, and the plating liquid is ejected through the plating liquid supply nozzles <b>753</b> to raise the liquid level of the plating liquid <b>745</b> within the plating chamber <b>749</b>, and overflows the upper end of the weir member <b>758</b> in the plating container <b>750</b>, thereby maintaining the liquid level at the liquid level A for plating. After the completion of the plating process, the shut-off valve <b>822</b> is opened to discharge the plating liquid <b>745</b> within the plating chamber <b>749</b> through the third plating liquid discharge ports <b>820</b>, thereby bringing the liquid level to the liquid level B for transferring the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0442">Thus, by immersing the anode <b>748</b> in the plating liquid <b>745</b> in a period other than during the plating process, a black film formed on the surface of the anode <b>748</b> can be prevented from being dried and oxidized, and the plating process can be stably carried out.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0443">When the substrate W is held by the substrate holding member <b>772</b> provided at the lower end of the housing <b>770</b>, the housing <b>770</b> of the head <b>747</b> is not vertically movable, but is rotatable about its own axis, and the substrate W is located at a position between the liquid level A for plating and the liquid level B for transferring the substrate. The substrate table <b>771</b> is not provided with any means for holding the substrate, and the substrate W is placed on the substrate holding member <b>772</b> of the housing <b>770</b>, and then the substrate table <b>771</b> is lowered to sandwich the peripheral portion of the substrate W between the substrate holding member <b>772</b> and the lower peripheral portion of the substrate table <b>771</b>, thereby holding the substrate W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0444">Next, a substrate processing performed by the substrate processing apparatus provided with the substrate holding member <b>722</b> will be described below. This embodiment is substantially the same as the above-mentioned embodiments, except for transfer of the substrate through the second transfer robot <b>724</b> and the process in the plated film forming unit <b>722</b>. Therefore, only the different construction and operation will be described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0445">First, the substrate placed on the first substrate stage <b>723</b> <i>a </i>in such a manner that the surface of the substrate faces upwardly, is transferred to the pretreatment unit <b>721</b> in the following manner: The second transfer robot <b>724</b> holds the substrate in such a manner that the suction-type hand with the suction surface facing upward attracts the backside of the substrate by suction, and rotates toward the pretreatment unit <b>721</b>. The substrate and the suction-type hand are inserted into the pretreatment unit <b>721</b> through a slit formed in the splash preventive cover in the pretreatment unit <b>721</b>, and the substrate is positioned between two opened hands of the inverter <b>720</b> in the pretreatment unit <b>721</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0446">Further, the second transfer robot <b>724</b> receives the substrate from the pretreatment unit <b>721</b> in the following manner: The suction-type hand of the second transfer robot <b>724</b> with the suction surface facing downward is inserted into the pretreatment unit <b>721</b> through the slit of the splash preventive cover in the pretreatment unit <b>721</b>. The suction-type hand is then positioned immediately above the substrate held by the hands of the inverter <b>720</b> in the pretreatment unit <b>721</b>. The suction-type hand attracts the backside of the substrate by vacuum suction, and the hands of the inverter <b>720</b> are opened. Thus, the substrate with the surface facing downward is held completely by the suction-type hand of the second transfer robot <b>724</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0447">The substrate is transferred to the plated film forming unit <b>722</b> in the following manner: The suction-type hand of the second transfer robot <b>724</b> and the substrate W held by the suction-type hand in such a manner the surface of the substrate faces downwardly, are inserted into the housing <b>770</b> through the opening <b>796</b> of the housing <b>770</b>. The suction-type hand is then moved downwardly, and the vacuum suction is released to place the substrate W on the substrate holding member <b>772</b> of the housing <b>770</b>. Thereafter, the suction-type hand is raised and withdrawn from the housing <b>770</b>. Next, the substrate table <b>771</b> is lowered to sandwich the peripheral portion of the substrate W between the substrate holding member <b>772</b> and the lower peripheral portion of the substrate table <b>771</b>, thereby holding the substrate W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0448">Thereafter, the plating liquid discharge pipe <b>821</b> connected to the third plating liquid discharge ports <b>820</b> are closed by the shut-off valve <b>822</b>, and the plating liquid is ejected through the plating liquid supply nozzles <b>753</b>. At the same time, the housing <b>770</b> and the substrate W held by the housing <b>770</b> are rotated at a medium speed. After the plating liquid reaches a predetermined level and several seconds have elapsed, the rotational speed of the housing <b>770</b> is changed to a low rotational speed of, for example, 100 min<sup>−1</sup>, and a plating current is flowed, thereby performing electroplating by utilizing the anode <b>48</b> as the anode and the processing face of the substrate as the cathode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0449">After the completion of the supply of current, the shutoff valve <b>822</b> is opened to discharge, through the third plating liquid discharge ports <b>820</b>, the plating liquid <b>745</b> present at a position above the step portion <b>750</b> <i>a </i>to the reservoir <b>926</b>. Thus, the housing <b>770</b> and the substrate held by the housing <b>770</b> are located above the liquid level of the plating liquid and exposed to the atmosphere. In the state that the housing <b>770</b> and the substrate W held by the housing <b>770</b> are located above the liquid level of the plating liquid, the housing <b>770</b> and the substrate W are rotated at a high speed of, for example, 500 to 800 min<sup>−1 </sup>to remove the plating liquid from the substrate under a centrifugal force. After the completion of the removal of the plating liquid from the substrate, the rotation of the housing <b>770</b> is stopped at a position where the housing <b>770</b> faces a predetermined direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0450">After the rotation of the housing <b>770</b> is completely stopped, the substrate table <b>771</b> is raised to a position where the substrate is detached or attached. Next, the suction-type hand of the second transfer robot <b>724</b> with the suction surface facing downwardly is inserted into the housing <b>770</b> through the opening <b>796</b> of the housing <b>770</b>, and is lowered to a position where the suction-type hand can hold the substrate by suction. The substrate is then held by vacuum suction by the suction-type hand, and the suction-type hand is then moved to a position above the opening <b>796</b> of the housing <b>770</b>. Thereafter, the suction-type hand and the substrate held by the suction-type hand are withdrawn from the housing <b>770</b> through the opening <b>796</b> of the housing <b>770</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0451">According to this embodiment, the mechanism of the head <b>747</b> can be simplified and compact. In addition, the plating process is carried out when the surface of the plating liquid within the plating process container <b>746</b> is on a liquid level A for plating, while the substrate is dewatered and transferred when the surface of the plating liquid is on a liquid level B for transferring the substrate. Further, it is possible to prevent a black film formed on the surface of the anode <b>748</b> from being dried and oxidized. Further, since the position of the substrate which is plated is the same as the position of the substrate from which an excessive plating liquid is removed by rotation of the substrate, the position for performing mist-splash prevention can be lowered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0452">Furthermore, in this embodiment, the following process may be performed: When the surface of the plating liquid is on the liquid level B for transferring the substrate, the substrate W is inserted into the housing <b>770</b> and held by the housing <b>770</b>, and then the liquid level of the plating liquid is raised to the liquid level A for plating. At the same time, the housing <b>770</b> is raised by a certain distance. After the surface of the plating liquid is raised to the liquid level A for plating, the housing <b>770</b> is rotated at a medium speed of, for example, 150 min<sup>−1 </sup>and lowered, whereby the substrate W is brought into contact with the surface of the plating liquid which rises at its central portion. Thus, air bubbles on the surface of the substrate can be positively removed therefrom.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0454">According to this embodiment, when the actuators <b>831</b> are actuated to lower the pressing ring <b>830</b>, the peripheral portion of the substrate is sandwiched between the substrate holding member <b>772</b> of the housing <b>770</b> and the lower surface of the pressing ring <b>830</b>, and hence the substrate W is held.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0456">According to this embodiment, when the swing links <b>842</b> are swung inward through the clamp mechanism <b>841</b> so as to be located in the horizontal direction, the peripheral portion of the substrate is sandwiched between the substrate holding member <b>772</b> of the housing <b>770</b> and the swing links <b>842</b>, and hence the substrate W is held.

The parts or components identical to or corresponding to the parts or components in the plated film forming units according to the above embodiments are denoted by the same reference numerals, and a part of the explanation thereof will be omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0460">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 66</figref>, the plated film forming unit is composed mainly of a plating process container <b>746</b> which is substantially cylindrical and contains a plating liquid <b>745</b> therein, and a head <b>747</b> disposed above the plating process container <b>746</b> for holding the substrate W. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 66</figref>, the plated film forming unit is in such a state that the substrate W is held by the head <b>747</b> and the surface of the plating liquid <b>745</b> is on the liquid level for plating.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0461">The plating process container <b>746</b> has a plating chamber <b>749</b> which is open upward and has an anode <b>748</b> at the bottom thereof. A plating container <b>750</b> containing the plating liquid <b>745</b> is provided within the plating chamber <b>749</b>. Plating liquid supply nozzles <b>753</b>, which project horizontally toward the center of the plating chamber <b>749</b>, are disposed at circumferentially equal intervals on the inner circumferential wall of the plating container <b>750</b>. The plating liquid supply nozzles <b>753</b> communicate with plating liquid supply passages <b>754</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref>) extending vertically within the plating container <b>750</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0462">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</figref>, the plating liquid supply passages <b>754</b> are connected to the plating liquid regulating tank <b>740</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref>) through the plating liquid supply pipes <b>755</b>. A control valves <b>756</b> for controlling the back pressure so as to be constant are disposed on each of the plating liquid supply pipes <b>755</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0463">Further, according to this embodiment, a punch plate <b>920</b> having a large number of holes with a size of, for example, about 3 mm is disposed at a position above the anode <b>748</b> within the plating chamber <b>749</b>. The punch plate <b>920</b> prevents a black film formed on the surface of the anode <b>748</b> from curling up by the plating liquid <b>745</b> and consequently being flowed out.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0464">The plating container <b>750</b> has first plating liquid discharge ports <b>757</b> for withdrawing the plating liquid <b>745</b> contained in the plating chamber <b>749</b> from the peripheral portion of the bottom in the plating chamber <b>749</b>, and second plating liquid discharge ports <b>759</b> for discharging the plating liquid <b>745</b> which has overflowed a weir member <b>758</b> provided at the upper end of the plating container <b>750</b>. Further, the plating container <b>750</b> has third plating liquid discharge ports <b>820</b> for discharging the plating liquid before overflowing the weir member <b>758</b>. The plating liquid which has flowed through the second plating liquid discharge ports <b>759</b> and the third plating liquid discharge ports <b>820</b> join at the lower end of the plating container <b>750</b>, and then is discharged from the plating container <b>750</b>. Instead of providing the third plating liquid discharge ports <b>820</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 72A through 72D</figref>, the weir member <b>758</b> may have, in its lower part, openings <b>922</b> having a predetermined width at predetermined intervals so that the plating liquid <b>745</b> passes through the openings <b>922</b> and is then discharged to the second plating liquid discharge ports <b>759</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0465">With this arrangement, when the amount of plating liquid supplied is large during plating, the plating liquid is discharged to the exterior through the third plating liquid discharge ports <b>820</b> or is passed through the openings <b>922</b> and discharged to the exterior through the second plating liquid discharge ports <b>759</b> and, in addition, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72A</figref>, the plating liquid overflows the weir member <b>758</b> is discharged to the exterior through the second plating liquid discharge ports <b>759</b>. On the other hand, during plating, when the amount of plating liquid supplied is small, the plating liquid is discharged to the exterior through the third plating liquid discharge ports <b>820</b>, or alternatively as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72B</figref>, the plating liquid is passed through the openings <b>922</b> and discharged to the exterior through the second plating liquid discharge ports <b>759</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0466">Further, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72D</figref>, through holes <b>924</b> for controlling the liquid level, which are located above the plating liquid supply nozzles <b>753</b> and communicate with the plating chamber <b>749</b> and the second plating liquid discharge ports <b>759</b>, are provided at circumferentially predetermined pitches. Thus, when plating is not performed, the plating liquid is passed through the through holes <b>924</b>, and is discharged to the exterior through the second plating liquid discharge ports <b>759</b>, thereby controlling the liquid level of the plating liquid. During plating, the through holes <b>924</b> serve as an orifice for restricting the amount of the plating liquid flowing therethrough.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0467">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</figref>, the first plating liquid discharge ports <b>757</b> are connected to the reservoir <b>926</b> through the plating liquid discharge pipe <b>760</b> <i>a</i>, and a flow controller <b>761</b> <i>a </i>is provided in the plating liquid discharge pipe <b>760</b> <i>a</i>. The second plating liquid discharge ports <b>759</b> and the third plating liquid discharge ports <b>820</b> join with each other within the plating container <b>750</b>, and the joined passage is then connected directly to the reservoir <b>926</b> through the plating liquid discharge pipe <b>760</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0468">The reservoir <b>926</b> is constructed so that the plating liquid from all the other plated film forming units flows into the reservoir <b>926</b>. The plating liquid which has flowed into the reservoir <b>926</b> is introduced by a pump <b>928</b> into the plating liquid regulating tank <b>740</b> (see FIG. <b>58</b>). This plating liquid regulating tank <b>740</b> is provided with a temperature controller <b>930</b>, and a plating liquid analyzing unit <b>932</b> for sampling the plating liquid and analyzing the sample liquid. When a single pump <b>934</b> is operated, the plating liquid is supplied from the plating liquid regulating tank <b>740</b> through the filter <b>936</b> to the plating liquid supply nozzles <b>753</b> in each of the plated film forming units. A control valve <b>756</b> is provided in the plating liquid supply pipe <b>755</b> extending from the plating liquid regulating tank <b>740</b> to each of the plated film forming units. This control valve <b>56</b> serves to make the pressure on the secondary side constant, and, even when one plated film forming unit is stopped, the control valve <b>56</b> can make the supply pressure of the plating liquid in the other plated film forming units constant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0469">Thus, a plating liquid prepared in a plating liquid regulating tank <b>740</b> in a single plating process system is fed to a plurality of plated film forming units through a single pump <b>934</b>. The plating liquid preparation tank <b>740</b> having a large capacity is used in the plating process system to prepare a plating liquid. With this arrangement, the plating liquid is fed to each of the plated film forming units while controlling the flow rate in each of the plated film forming units through control valves <b>756</b>, and a variation of the plating liquid in quality can be suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0470">A vertical stream regulating ring <b>762</b> and a horizontal stream regulating ring <b>763</b> are disposed within the plating chamber <b>749</b> at a position near the internal circumference of the plating chamber <b>749</b>, and the central portion of the liquid surface is pushed up by an upward stream out of two divided upward and downward streams of the plating liquid <b>745</b> within the plating chamber <b>749</b>, whereby the downward flow is smoothened and the distribution of the current density is further uniformized. The horizontal stream regulating ring <b>763</b> has a peripheral portion which is fixed to the plating container <b>750</b>, and the vertical stream regulating ring <b>762</b> is connected to the horizontal stream regulating ring <b>763</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0471">On the other hand, the head <b>747</b> comprises a housing <b>770</b> which is a rotatable and cylindrical receptacle having a downwardly open end and has openings <b>796</b> on the circumferential wall, and vertically movable pressing rods <b>942</b> having, in its lower end, a pressing ring <b>940</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71</figref>, an inwardly projecting ring-shaped substrate holding member <b>772</b> is provided at the lower end of the housing <b>770</b>. A ring-shaped sealing member <b>944</b> is mounted on the substrate holding member <b>772</b>. The ring-shaped sealing member <b>944</b> projects inward, and the front end of the top surface in the ring-shaped sealing member <b>944</b> projects upward in an annular tapered form.

The slider <b>954</b> is vertically movable by actuation of a cylinder <b>952</b>, with a guide, fixed to a support <b>950</b> surrounding the motor <b>946</b>. With this construction, the pressing rods <b>942</b> are vertically movable by the actuation of the cylinder <b>952</b>, and, in addition, upon the holding of the substrate W, the pressing rods <b>942</b> are rotated integrally with the housing <b>770</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0474">The support <b>950</b> is mounted on a slide base <b>962</b> which is engaged with a ball screw <b>961</b> and vertically movable by the ball screw <b>961</b> rotated by energization of the motor <b>960</b>. The support <b>950</b> is surrounded by an upper housing <b>964</b>, and is vertically movable together with the upper housing <b>964</b> by energization of the motor <b>960</b>. Further, a lower housing <b>957</b> for surrounding the housing <b>770</b> during plating is mounted on the upper surface of the plating container <b>750</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0475">With this construction, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</figref>, maintenance can be performed in such a state that the support <b>950</b> and the upper housing <b>964</b> are raised. A crystal of the plating liquid is likely to deposit on the inner circumferential surface of the weir member <b>758</b>. However, the support <b>950</b> and the upper housing <b>964</b> are raised, a large amount of the plating liquid is flowed and overflows the weir member <b>758</b>, and hence the crystal of the plating liquid is prevented from being deposited on the inner circumferential surface of the weir member <b>758</b>. A cover <b>750</b> <i>b </i>for preventing the splash of the plating liquid is integrally provided in the plating container <b>750</b> to cover a portion above the plating liquid which overflows during plating process. By coating an ultra-water-repellent material such as HIREC (manufactured by NTT Advance Technology) on the lower surface of the cover <b>750</b> <i>b </i>for preventing the splash of the plating liquid, the crystal of the plating liquid can be prevented from being deposited on the lower surface of the cover <b>750</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0476">Substrate centering mechanisms <b>970</b> located above the substrate holding member <b>772</b> of the housing <b>770</b> for performing centering of the substrate W, are provided at four places along the circumferential direction in this embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0477"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73</figref> shows the substrate centering mechanism <b>970</b> in detail. The substrate centering mechanism <b>970</b> comprises a gate-like bracket <b>972</b> fixed to the housing <b>770</b>, and a positioning block <b>974</b> disposed within the bracket <b>972</b>. This positioning block <b>974</b> is swingably mounted through a support shaft <b>976</b> horizontally fixed to the bracket <b>972</b>. Further, a compression coil spring <b>978</b> is interposed between the housing <b>770</b> and the positioning block <b>974</b>. Thus, the positioning block <b>974</b> is urged by the compression coil spring <b>978</b> so that the positioning block <b>974</b> rotates about the support shaft <b>976</b> and the lower portion of the positioning block <b>974</b> projects inwardly. The upper surface <b>974</b> <i>a </i>of the positioning block <b>974</b> serves as a stopper, and is brought into connect with the lower surface <b>972</b> <i>a </i>of the bracket <b>972</b> to restrict the movement of the positioning block <b>974</b>. Further, the positioning block <b>974</b> has a tapered inner surface <b>974</b> <i>b </i>which is widened outward in the upward direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0478">With this construction, a substrate is held by the hand of a transfer robot or the like, is carried into the housing <b>770</b>, and is placed on the substrate holding member <b>772</b>. In this case, when the center of the substrate deviates from the center of the substrate holding member <b>772</b>, the positioning block <b>974</b> is rotated outwardly against the urging force of the compression coil spring <b>978</b> and, upon the release of holding of the substrate from the hand of the transfer robot or the like, the positioning block <b>974</b> is returned to the original position by the urging force of the compression coil spring <b>978</b>. Thus, the centering of the substrate can be carried out.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0479"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 74</figref> shows a feeding contact (a probe) <b>777</b> for feeding power to a cathode electrode plate <b>908</b> of a contact <b>776</b> for a cathode electrode. This feeding contact <b>777</b> is composed of a plunger and is surrounded by a cylindrical protective member <b>980</b> extending to the cathode electrode plate <b>908</b>, whereby the feeding contact <b>777</b> is protected against the plating liquid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0480">In the substrate processing apparatus employs the plated film forming unit, as described above, when the surface of the plating liquid is on a low level for transferring the substrate as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</figref>, the substrate is inserted into and held within the housing <b>770</b>. In this state, the liquid level of the plating liquid is raised and the substrate is plated. Thereafter, the liquid level of the plating liquid is lowered, and the plated substrate is withdrawn from the housing <b>770</b>. Further, maintenance is carried out in such a state that the support <b>950</b> and the upper housing <b>964</b> are raised. In this state, if necessary, a large amount of the plating liquid is flowed and overflow the weir member <b>758</b>, thereby preventing a crystal of the plating liquid from being deposited on the inner circumferential surface of the weir member <b>758</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0481">Further, in this embodiment, the following process may be performed: When the surface of the plating liquid is on the liquid level B for transferring the substrate, the substrate W is inserted into the housing <b>770</b> and held by the housing <b>770</b>, and then the liquid level of the plating liquid is raised to the liquid level A for plating. At the same time, the housing <b>770</b> is raised by a certain distance. After the liquid level of the polishing solution reaches the liquid level A for plating, the housing <b>770</b> is rotated at a medium speed of, for example, 150 min<sup>−1 </sup>and lowered, whereby the substrate W is brought into contact with the surface of the plating liquid which rises at its central portion. Thus, air bubbles on the surface of the substrate can be positively removed therefrom.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0482">In the above embodiments, a pre-dipping process is employed in the pretreatment unit, and a pretreatment liquid (a pre-dipping liquid) which is one component of the plating liquid is uniformly coated to improve adhesive property of plating on the surface, to be plated, of the substrate on which a barrier layer and a seed layer are successively provided. Alternatively, a pre-plating method in which a pre-plating is applied to reinforce an incomplete seed layer onto the surface, to be plated, of the substrate on which a barrier layer and a seed layer are successively provided may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0483"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 75</figref> shows another embodiment of a substrate processing apparatus in accordance with the present invention which employs the pre-plating method and is provided with a pre-plating unit <b>980</b>. The pre-plating unit <b>980</b> has a similar structure to the plated film forming unit <b>722</b>, and uses a weak alkaline high-polarization liquid of copper pyrophosphate as a plating liquid, and pure copper (oxygen-free copper) as an anode. According to this embodiment, one of the plated film forming units <b>722</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref> is replaced with the pre-plating unit <b>980</b> for performing pre-plating of a substrate to reinforce the incomplete seed layer. The pre-plated substrate is then subjected to the plating treatment in the plated film forming unit <b>722</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0484">While the plating liquid for use in the pre-plating unit <b>980</b> is alkaline, the plating liquid for use in the plated film forming unit <b>722</b> is acidic. It is therefore necessary to take a measure not to bring the alkaline plating liquid, which has adhered to the substrate in the pre-plating unit <b>980</b>, to the plated film forming unit <b>722</b>. In this regard, according to this embodiment, a cleaning unit <b>982</b> is provided in the plating section <b>712</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref>) for washing by water the substrate which has undergone the pre-plating in the pre-plating unit <b>982</b>. The cleaned substrate is then transferred to the plated film forming unit <b>722</b> for plating of the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0485">Further in this embodiment, a bevel-backside cleaning unit <b>984</b> and an annealing unit <b>986</b> are provided. In the bevel-backside cleaning unit <b>984</b>, the unnecessary Cu film (seed layer) in the edge portion of the semiconductor substrate is removed, and the substrate is rinsed with water and then spin-dried by rotating the substrate at a high speed. Thereafter, the dried substrate is transferred to the annealing unit <b>986</b> for annealing the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0486"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 76</figref> shows yet another embodiment of a semiconductor substrate processing apparatus in accordance with the present invention. The apparatus is provided with three loading and unloading sections <b>715</b>. A movable first robot <b>717</b>, for exclusive use for the loading and unloading sections, is provided between the loading and unloading sections <b>715</b> and a temporary storage <b>728</b> for transferring a substrate therebetween. Three plated film forming units <b>722</b> are disposed in series in a plating area <b>990</b> on one side of a movable second robot <b>724</b>. On the opposite side of the second robot <b>724</b> are disposed, in series, two bevel-backside cleaning units <b>984</b> and one annealing unit <b>986</b>. The second robot <b>724</b> transfers the substrate between the plated film forming units <b>722</b>, the bevel-backside cleaning units <b>984</b>, the annealing unit <b>986</b> and the temporary storage <b>728</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0487">According to this embodiment, loading and unloading of the substrate between the loading and unloading sections <b>715</b> and the temporary storage <b>728</b> are conducted by the first robot <b>717</b>. Separately, loading from the temporary storage <b>728</b>, transportation between the treatment units and unloading to the temporary storage <b>728</b> of the substrate are conducted by the second robot <b>724</b>. The provision of such two robots makes it possible to divide the interior of facilities into a loading and unloading area L which includes the first robot <b>717</b> and the loading and unloading sections <b>715</b>, and a treatment unit area P which includes the second robot <b>724</b>, the temporary storage <b>728</b> and the various treatment units including the annealing unit <b>986</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0488">Such division in the interior of facilities has the following advantages. Since the amount of contaminants is small in the loading and unloading area L compared to the treatment unit area (treatment section) P, air-conditioning facilities for the loading and unloading area L can be simplified. Further, the loading and unloading area L can be made detachable. This enables replacement of the treatment unit with another new treatment unit for combination with the loading and unloading area L so as to meet the rapid advance in the semiconductor industry. Alternatively, in order to meet a new model cassette and facilitate transportation of the substrate, the loading and unloading area L can be replaced with another new one.</div>
