<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/041,732 filed on Jan. 7, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,720,579, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</div>
<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device and method of manufacturing the same, and more particularly to a semiconductor device and method of manufacturing the same, which has elongated wiring of silicon material such as gate lines formed to cross with an active region in a cell area.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">In a flash memory device or a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) device, gate lines generally have elongated line shapes. Also, the gate lines are formed of silicon material having conductivity lower than that of metal material. Thus, voltages at portions, for example middle portions, of the gate lines remote from portions to which voltage is first supplied, become lower than the required voltage since the gate lines have line resistance. Accordingly, the memory device needs means to compensate for a drop in voltage in the middle portions of the gate lines. However, as the elements incorporated into a semiconductor device are integrated to a higher degree, a wiring width as well as a distance between cells becomes less and less, thereby increasing line resistance. In order to maintain voltage at all portions of the gate lines at a given level and to prevent an increased delay of the gate signal due to increased line resistance, means for restoring voltage are required. However, in most means for restoring voltage, a peripheral structure in the memory device is complicated, causing a loss of integration density. To reduce these problems, there have been proposed methods of increasing conductivity, such as forming silicon wiring of the gate lines by using a multi-layered silicon layer including a metal layer, or forming a metal silicide layer on an upper surface of each gate line as in a general flash memory device shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a top plan view showing a portion of a cell area of a general NAND type flash memory.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an isolation layer is formed on a substrate to form an active region <b>22</b> in a cell area. The active region <b>22</b> comprises a plurality of line shaped sub-regions which are defined respectively by a plurality of elongated openings or gaps of the isolation layer <b>23</b> shown in FIG. <b>2</b>. In a center portion of the cell area, a common source line <b>45</b> is disposed to cross the active region <b>22</b>. In each of upper and lower portions of the cell area divided by the common source line <b>45</b>, a plurality of gate lines comprising a ground select gate line <b>33</b> <i>g</i>, a plurality of, for example 8, 16, or 32 word lines WP, and a string select gate line <b>33</b> <i>s </i>are formed in order from one of both sides of the common source line <b>45</b>. Namely, two equal parts of gate lines formed in the upper and lower portion of the cell area are disposed symmetrically with respect to the common source line <b>45</b>. Thus, the common source line <b>45</b> is disposed between two ground select gate lines <b>33</b> <i>g</i>. Contacts <b>51</b>, which are connected with bit lines <b>55</b>, are formed in upper and lower end portions of the cell area forming drain regions of the string select gate lines <b>33</b> <i>s. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a cross-section taken along line I—I in FIG. <b>1</b> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a cross-section taken along line II—II in FIG. <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the common source line <b>45</b> is formed on the substrate in contact a portion of the active region forming common source regions <b>35</b> <i>s</i>′ of the ground select gate lines <b>33</b> <i>g </i>(shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and a portion of the isolation layer <b>23</b> therebetween. The bit lines <b>55</b> are disposed above the common source line <b>45</b> on an interlayer insulating layer <b>49</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the active region <b>22</b> is not shown upward and downward as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, but leftward and rightward. On the active region <b>22</b>, the gate lines <b>33</b> <i>g</i>, WP, <b>33</b> <i>s </i>are formed to cross the active region <b>22</b>. The common source line <b>45</b> is in contact with the common source regions <b>35</b> <i>s</i>′ between two ground select gate lines <b>33</b> <i>g. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">In a process of forming a cell area of a flash memory device shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, first an isolation insulating layer <b>23</b> is formed on a substrate <b>20</b> to define an active region by means of a general shallow trench isolation (STI) process. The active region comprises a plurality of line shaped sub-regions. Thereafter, a gate insulating layer <b>24</b> is formed in the active region. Then, a plurality of gate lines comprising string select gate lines <b>33</b> <i>s. </i>a plurality of word lines WP, arid ground select gate lines <b>33</b> <i>g </i>are formed to cross the active region. Also, source/drain regions <b>35</b>′, are formed to be overlapped with a plurality of line shaped sub-regions of the active region by doping an impurity on the exposed surface of the substrate between the gate lines. The source/drain regions <b>35</b>′, formed by general ion implantation processes of using the gate lines and spacer <b>37</b> on both side walls of the gate lines as a mask, form a dual doped structure. Namely, highly doped portions are formed in the active region of the substrate between the adjacent spacers <b>37</b>, and lightly doped portions in the active region of the substrate between the gate lines and the highly doped portions, i.e., in the active region of the substrate under the spacers <b>37</b>. Then, an interlayer insulating layer <b>41</b> is deposited and planarized. Thereafter, a groove is formed to expose the common source regions <b>35</b> <i>s</i>′ between the ground select gate lines <b>33</b> <i>g </i>and filled with a conductor such as a polysilicon layer to form a common source line <b>45</b>. Then, after an interlayer insulating layer <b>49</b> is formed over the resultant substrate, contact holes are formed to expose drain regions <b>35</b> <i>d</i>′ of the string select gate lines <b>33</b> <i>s, </i>and are then filled with a conductive layer to form bit line contacts. And then, bit lines are formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">In order to decrease line resistance of the gate lines, a metal silicide layer containing metal such as cobalt (Co) or titanium (Ti) can be formed on upper portions of the gate lines as shown in black in FIG. <b>3</b>. At this time, the metal silicide layer is also formed on the substrate in the source/drain regions <b>35</b>′. Therefore, break down is possible due to voltage in transistor channels between the source/drain regions under the gate lines, since in a high integrated NAND type flash memory device, width of the gate lines and distance between the gate lines are very minute, for example below 0.15 μm. Particularly, in case the source/drain regions are highly doped, the transistor channels are more apt to break down since in a subsequent annealing process, the doped area is more diffused, so that the length of the transistor channels is not maintained at a proper level. In this case, a leakage of current into the substrate may also occur. Therefore, the higher the integrated degree of the elements in the memory device is, the lighter the source/drain regions have to be doped. Also, in case the silicide layer is formed in the source/drain regions, conductivity of the source/drain regions is increased, so that problems such as the break down and the current leakage become more intensified.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which a preferred embodiment of the invention is shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiment set forth herein. Rather, this embodiment is provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully covey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a top plan view showing a portion of a cell area of a NAND type flash memory device in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line II—II of FIG. <b>4</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">Referring now to FIG. <b>4</b> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the flash memory device of the present invention has an active region <b>122</b> formed on a substrate in a cell area by an isolation layer. The active region comprises a plurality of line shaped sub-regions which are defined respectively by a plurality of elongated openings or gaps of the isolation layer. In a center portion of the cell area, a common source line <b>148</b> is disposed to cross the active region <b>122</b>. The common source line <b>148</b> has a wall shaped body <b>145</b> formed of silicon, and an upper metal silicide layer <b>147</b>. A plurality of gate lines <b>133</b> <i>g</i>, WP, <b>133</b> <i>s </i>are formed parallel to the common source line <b>148</b> and symmetrically with respect to the common source line <b>148</b> in upper and lower portions of the cell area which are divided by the common source line <b>148</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">In a general NOR type flash memory device, gate lines can be formed in pairs, each being disposed adjacent to each of both sides of a common source line, i.e., between a common source line and bit line contact regions. However, in the NAND type flash memory device of the present invention, a half of gate lines comprising a ground select gate line <b>133</b> <i>g</i>, a plurality of word lines WP, and a string select gate line <b>133</b> <i>s </i>are formed in order upward or downward from the common source line <b>148</b>, i.e., in each of the upper and lower portions of the cell area which are divided by the common source line <b>148</b>. Namely, one half of gate lines formed upwardly from the common source line <b>148</b> is symmetric with the other half of gate lines formed downwardly from the common source line <b>148</b>. Among the gate lines, at least word lines WP have silicon layer for control gates having upper metal silicide layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">On junction regions in which the word lines among the gate lines are crossed with the line shaped sub-regions of the active regions <b>122</b>, the gate lines form gate electrodes of cell transistors. Each of the gate electrodes formed on the junction regions has a general double-layered gate structure of a nonvolatile memory transistor. The double-layered gate structure is composed of a floating gate, a dielectric layer, and a control gate formed in order on a gate insulating layer <b>124</b> separating the gate electrodes from the active regions <b>122</b>. Adjacent transistors on same word lines WP are not connected through a floating gate layer, but a control gate layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">Source/drain regions <b>135</b>′ are formed by doping an impurity against an exposed portion of the substrate between the gate lines. Accordingly, in adjacent cell transistors formed in one of the line shaped subregions of the active regions, respective source and drain regions overlap each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">On the junction regions, the ground select gate lines <b>133</b> <i>g </i>and the string select gate lines <b>133</b> <i>s </i>do not need to have a double-layered gate structure having the floating gate and the control gate. Accordingly, these gate lines can be composed of line shaped structures formed using only a floating gate layer, making a control gate layer in a dummy pattern, or connecting electrically a control gate layer with a floating gate layer through butting contacts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">Insulating spacers <b>137</b> are generally formed on both side walls of the gate lines. In the source/drain regions <b>135</b>′, a general dual doped structure can be formed by using the gate lines and the insulating spacers <b>137</b> as a mask. Namely, highly doped portions are formed in the active region of the substrate between the adjacent insulating spacers <b>137</b> between the gate lines, and lightly doped portions in the active region of the substrate between the gate lines and the highly doped portions, i.e., in the active region of the substrate under the insulating spacers <b>137</b>. However, in the ion implantation for the highly doped portions, a concentration, i.e., a dose of impurity is restrained below 1.0×10<sup>15 </sup>ions/cm<sup>2 </sup>to prevent channels under the gate lines from being broken down when width of the gate lines, i.e., length of the channels is below 0.15 μm. Preferably, a supplementary insulating layer <b>139</b> is formed on the gate lines on which the insulating spacers <b>137</b> are formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">An interlayer insulating layer is formed over the whole surface of the substrate to cover the gate lines and the common source lines <b>148</b>. The interlayer insulating layer is composed of upper and lower layers <b>149</b>, <b>141</b>. The lower layer <b>141</b> of the interlayer insulating layer is formed at the same level as that of a metal silicide layer of the common source line <b>148</b> or the gate lines. Bit lines <b>155</b> formed parallel to the active region <b>122</b> are connected with drain regions <b>135</b> <i>d</i>′ of string select transistors on the string select gate lines <b>133</b> <i>s</i>, through bit line contacts <b>151</b>, silicon pads <b>145</b>′ and metal silicide layers <b>147</b>′. The common source line <b>148</b> is connected with common source regions <b>135</b> <i>s</i>′ of two ground select transistors formed on a portion of the substrate on which the active region <b>122</b> is overlapped with two ground select gate lines <b>133</b> <i>g. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">A method of manufacturing a NAND type flash memory device of the present invention shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> will now be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> to FIG. <b>10</b>. First, an isolation layer <b>123</b> is formed on a substrate <b>120</b> in a cell area to form an active region as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> <i>b</i>. The active region comprises a plurality of line shaped sub-regions which are defined respectively by a plurality of elongated openings or gaps of the isolation layer. The isolation layer <b>123</b> is formed by a shallow trench isolation (STI) process. However, in case of using a self-aligned STI process, a portion of a gate insulating layer and a floating gate silicon layer can be deposited before forming of the isolation layer <b>123</b>. In the cell area, the isolation layer <b>123</b> and the active region <b>122</b> are disposed to alternate with each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> <i>a</i>, a thin gate insulating layer <b>124</b> is formed on the active region <b>122</b> of the substrate <b>120</b> on which the isolation layer <b>123</b> is formed. On the gate insulating layer <b>124</b>, a silicon floating gate layer is formed and patterned to form a floating gate intermediate pattern. At this time, a portion of the silicon floating gate layer overlapped parallel to the active region <b>122</b> is remained, whereas a portion of the silicon floating gate layer on the isolation layer <b>123</b> of the rest except a region on which the ground select lines or the string select lines is to be formed is removed, so that it forms a continuous line shaped pattern crossing with the active region <b>122</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">Thereafter, a separating dielectric layer and a silicon control gate layer are formed over the whole surface of the substrate <b>120</b> over which the floating gate intermediate pattern is formed. The separating dielectric layer generally uses an oxide nitride oxide (ONO) layer. The silicon control gate layer uses a doped polysilicon layer to increase conductivity. Then, a plurality of required gate lines are formed in a direction vertical to a direction which the active region is formed, by etching partially the silicon control gate layer, the dielectric layer, and the intermediate pattern. At this time, each of gate electrodes <b>133</b> on conjunction portions which the gate lines are crossed with the active region is formed to have a layered structure composed of a floating gate pattern <b>126</b>, a dielectric layer pattern <b>128</b> and a silicon control gate layer pattern <b>130</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">The gate insulating layer <b>124</b> is patterned or remained as a buffer layer for ion implantation. Thus, two equal parts of gate lines, each being composed of a ground select gate line <b>133</b> <i>g</i>, a plurality of word lines WP, and a string select gate line <b>133</b> <i>s</i>, are formed upwardly and downwardly from the center of the cell area, respectively. Namely, a half of gate lines formed upwardly from the center of the cell area are symmetric with the other half of gate lines formed downwardly from the center of the cell area. At this time, the thin gate insulating layer <b>124</b> covering the active region <b>122</b> of the substrate <b>120</b> between the gate lines is exposed. The substrate <b>120</b> in exposed active region is lightly implanted to form low concentration impurity regions <b>135</b>. In the ion implantation, the gate lines act as an ion implantation mask.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> <i>b</i>, a region on which a common source line is to be formed is maintained in a state which the silicon control gate layer, the dielectric layer, and the floating gate intermediate pattern are removed from the substrate <b>120</b> by means of the gate line patterning process, so that the isolation layer <b>123</b> and common source regions <b>135</b> <i>s </i>forming a portion of the low concentration impurity regions <b>135</b> are disposed to be alternated each other. Also, in the region, there are no layers except the gate insulating layer <b>124</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, after the ion implantation, a plurality of insulating spacers <b>137</b>, each being composed of a nitride layer or an oxide layer, are formed on side walls of the gate electrodes <b>133</b>. The spacers <b>137</b> are formed by using a method of depositing an insulating layer over the substrate <b>120</b> over which the gate electrodes <b>133</b> are formed, and etching anisotropically the whole surface of the substrate <b>120</b> over which the insulating layer are formed. After forming the spacers <b>137</b>, a relatively high concentration in, purity implantation is earned out by using the gate lines and the spacer <b>137</b> as a mask. At this time, an impurity concentration is restrained to prevent break down in transistor channels under the gate lines from being occurred. Thus, source/drain regions <b>135</b>′ having dual doped structures are formed and a MOS transistor structure is obtained. For a subsequent process, an etch stop layer <b>139</b> is formed of a silicon nitride layer having a thickness of 1,000Å over the whole surface of the substrate <b>120</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> <i>a</i>, an interlayer insulating layer <b>141</b> is formed over the whole surface of the substrate <b>120</b> having the MOS transistor structure on which the gate electrodes <b>133</b> and the source/drain regions <b>135</b>′ are formed. The interlayer insulating layer <b>141</b> is deposited to a thickness enough to fill gaps or openings between the gate lines and then planarized. Thereafter, a groove is formed in the interlayer insulating layer <b>141</b> to expose common source regions <b>135</b> <i>s</i>′ in the active region between two ground select lines <b>133</b> <i>g </i>formed parallel to each other on the center of the cell area. At this time, the etch stop layer <b>139</b> on the exposed portion of the common source region on which a groove is formed is also etched and removed. Also, in order to form pads for bit line contacts, contact holes can be formed on drain regions <b>135</b> <i>d</i>′ of one side of each string select gate line <b>133</b> <i>s</i>. Then, a silicon layer <b>140</b>, for example a doped polysilicon layer is deposited over the whole surface of the substrate <b>120</b> to fill the groove and contact holes. Thereafter, the silicon layer <b>140</b> is planarized to expose the interlayer insulating layer <b>141</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> <i>b</i>, with filling the groove with the silicon layer <b>140</b>, unfinished silicon wall of the common source line which is in contact with the common source region <b>135</b> <i>s</i>′ crossing with the active region is obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> <i>a </i>and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> <i>b</i>, upper portions of the interlayer insulating layer <b>141</b> and the silicon layer <b>140</b> filling the groove shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> <i>a </i>and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> <i>b </i>are removed by carrying out a planarization etching process, and thereby the control gate layer pattern <b>130</b> of the gate lines is exposed. Accordingly, silicon pads <b>145</b>′ for bit line contacts and a silicon wall <b>145</b> of the common source line extended at a given depth parallel to the gate lines are formed from the silicon layer <b>140</b>. On exposed silicon surfaces, i.e., upper surfaces of the silicon wall <b>145</b> of the common source line, the silicon pads <b>145</b>′ for bit line contacts and the control gate layer pattern <b>130</b> of the gate lines, metal silicide layers <b>147</b>, <b>147</b>′, <b>147</b>″ are formed to decrease line resistance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">Metal material for forming the metal silicide layers <b>147</b>, <b>147</b>′, <b>147</b>″ uses one selected from cobalt (Co) and titanium (Ti). For example, in case of using Co, first, a Co layer is formed to a thickness of 100 Å to 500 Å by a sputtering process. Then, a first rapid thermal annealing (RTA) process is carried out at a temperature of about 450° C. to form a layer of Co silicide such as Co<sub>2</sub>Si. Unsilicified Co metal is removed from the substrate by a selective etching process. Thereafter, a second RTA process is carried out at a high temperature of about 850° C., so that a superior Co silicide layer in properties is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">Thus, the metal silicide layer <b>147</b> of the common source line is formed at the same level or height as that of the metal silicide layers <b>147</b>″ of the gate lines. Therefore, in the flash memory device of the present invention, there is an advantage that step coverage in a sequent process is reduced compared with that of a conventional flash memory device which an upper surface of the common source line is formed at a height higher than that of upper surfaces of the gate lines. Also, the invention has an advantage that conductivity of the common source line is improved since it has the upper metal silicide layer. Also, in case of forming a high integrated flash memory in which width of the gate lines is very small, the present invention can prevent a leakage of current into the substrate or break down in channels from being occurred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, after forming of the metal silicide layers <b>147</b>, <b>147</b>′, <b>147</b>″, an interlayer insulating layer <b>149</b> is deposited and then patterned to form bit line contact holes. At this time, since the common source line along with the pads <b>145</b>′ for bit line contacts <b>151</b> was formed at same level or height, depth of the contact holes can be decreased compared with that of the conventional flash memory device, so that the process time, cost and error in the fabrication can be reduced. Thereafter, a conductive layer is deposited and patterned, so that bit line contacts <b>151</b> and bit lines <b>155</b> are formed. In case the bit lines are formed of metal, the metal silicide layers <b>147</b>′ can assist to form ohmic contacts between the silicon pads <b>145</b>′ and the bit line contacts <b>151</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">As apparent from the foregoing description, it can be appreciated that the present invention provides a semiconductor device and method of manufacturing the same which can restrain break down in transistor channels and increase of current leakage due to increase of conductivity of source/drain regions from being occurred, by preventing a metal silicide layer from being formed on the substrate between gate lines when forming the metal silicide layer on upper surfaces of the gate lines to increase conductivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">In the drawings and specification, there have been disclosed typical preferred embodiments of the invention and, although specific terms are employed, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purpose of limitation, the scope of the invention being set forth in the following claims.</div>
