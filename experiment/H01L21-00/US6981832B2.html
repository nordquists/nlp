<div class="abstract" num="p-0001">A system for processing semiconductor wafers includes adaptations allowing the selective handling of cassettes for both 200-mm wafers and 300-mm wafers. The system is configured initially for handling standard 300-mm FOUP cassettes. Adaptions for handling 200-mm wafer open cassettes include a load port adapter frame for receiving such cassettes on a input/output platform; a cassette handler adapter configured for reversibly mounting on a cassette handler end effector and for receiving 200-mm open cassettes; a store adapter frame for converting 300-mm FOUP storage compartments into compartments for storing 200-mm open cassettes; and a Transhipment FOUP for holding 200-mm open cassettes upon a cassette transfer platform and bringing such cassettes into an interface with a wafer handler. The Transhipment FOUP has outer surfaces resembling a standard 300-mm FOUP cassette, but is configured to receive a 200-mm open cassette therein.</div>

<heading>REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This application is a divisional of application Ser. No. 09/769,088, filed Jan. 24, 2001 (now U.S. Pat. No. 6,632,068, issued Oct. 14, 2003), which claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. §119(e) of provisional Application No. 60/236,046, filed Sep. 27, 2000.</div>
<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The invention relates to processing tools utilized for semiconductor wafer processing and more particularly to wafer processing tools that are configured for 300-mm wafer processing in which the wafers are supplied in FOUP cassettes.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">When processing semiconductor wafers in processing tools, the processing tool is adapted to and optimized for the size of the wafer to be processed. The size of the wafers are standardized in a limited number of discrete sizes where there has been a tendency towards increasing size in the past decades in order to increase the production efficiency. The three most recently introduced wafer sizes are 150 mm, 200-mm and 300-mm diameter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">A given wafer fabrication facility will normally be configured for handling one wafer size. However, in R&amp;D, pilot production or implementation of a new technology in production, there is a need for tools that can process multiple wafer sizes alternatingly or that can easily be reconfigured for handling different wafer sizes. In the past, when using open cassettes that hold the wafers, this was not a major issue. A wafer handling device can easily be configured so that it can handle wafers of different sizes from/to their respective open cassettes. However, the use of the closed FOUP cassettes for 300-mm wafers requires specific features in the wafer handling and cassette handling system that do not allow handling 200-mm open cassettes alternatingly in the same system.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Accordingly, a need exists for a system capable of handling multiple sizes of substrates in a state-of-the-art facility.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">According to the invention a system, layed out for handling 300-mm wafers, supplied in 300-mm FOUP cassettes, is provided with a tool set to accommodate 200-mm cassettes during wafer transfer and cassette transfer. This tool set comprises a “Transhipment FOUP” cassette designed to receive a 200-mm open cassette in its interior. The term “Transhipment FOUP” is used herein as a label to distinguish 200-mm open cassettes and standard 300-mm FOUP cassettes. When 200-mm wafers need to be handled, the cassette handler places the 200-mm cassette in the Transhipment FOUP and, subsequently, the Transhipment FOUP, containing the 200-mm cassette, is brought into active connection with a wafer handling device. According to a further aspect of the invention, this tool set comprises a cassette handler adapter that allows the 300-mm FOUP cassette handler to handle 200-mm cassettes. The system is programmed such that the tools are automatically picked up from their storage position when needed.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">Initially, with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a wafer processing system according to the prior art is described. The subsequent figures and corresponding text below illustrate how the preferred embodiment is adapted to this particular wafer processing system. The skilled artisan will readily appreciate, however, that the principles and advantages of the cassettes described herein can be readily adapted to other processing systems where handling of cassettes and wafers therefrom is at least partially automated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows, diagrammatically and partially exposed, a perspective view and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a plan view of a wafer processing system for 300-mm wafers supplied 300-mm FOUP cassettes, according to the prior art. The wafer processing system is indicated in its entirety by reference numeral <b>1</b>. This system <b>1</b> comprises a housing <b>2</b> and is generally installed in a so-called “clean room.” In addition to the housing <b>2</b>, partitions <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> are also present. The housing <b>2</b> delimits, with the partition <b>3</b>, a processing area or chamber <b>21</b>. In this example, the processing area <b>21</b> comprises vertical furnaces <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>. The housing <b>2</b> and the partitions <b>3</b> and <b>4</b> define a wafer handling chamber <b>22</b>. A cassette transfer chamber <b>23</b> is defined between the housing <b>2</b> and partitions <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>. The input/output station, to transfer cassettes into and out of the system <b>1</b>, is indicated by reference numeral <b>33</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">Wafers <b>13</b> are supplied in cassettes <b>10</b>, which are placed on the input/output station <b>33</b>. A cassette handling device <b>31</b> transfers the cassettes <b>10</b> from the input/output station <b>33</b> through a closable opening <b>34</b> into a cassette store <b>8</b> located in the cassette transfer chamber <b>23</b>. The cassette store <b>8</b> is provided with a number of rotary platforms <b>27</b> above one another, on which the cassettes <b>10</b> are stored. The cassette handling device <b>31</b> is movable in vertical direction by means of an elevator <b>35</b> so that the different platforms <b>27</b> can be reached. The cassette handling device <b>31</b> is provided with a cassette end effector <b>32</b>, which has dimensions a little smaller than those of a series cut-outs <b>26</b> in the rotary platforms <b>27</b>. When the cassette handling device <b>31</b> has transferred a cassette into the store <b>8</b>, the end effector <b>32</b> can be lowered through one of the cut-outs <b>26</b> in one of the platforms <b>27</b> to place the cassette on the platform <b>27</b>. Subsequently, the cassette handler <b>31</b> can be retracted from cassette store <b>8</b>. The cassette handling device <b>31</b> is mounted such that it is able to transfer cassettes between the input/output station <b>33</b> and store <b>8</b>. The device <b>31</b> is also capable of transferring cassettes between the store <b>8</b> and a rotatable cassette transfer platform <b>30</b>, or between the input/output station <b>33</b> and the rotatable cassette transfer platform <b>30</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">The rotatable cassette transfer platform <b>30</b> is constructed such that, on rotation, the cassette is placed against the partition <b>4</b> between the cassette transfer chamber <b>23</b> and the wafer handling chamber <b>22</b>. The partition <b>4</b> is provided with a closure and a closure mechanism, together forming an interface schematically indicated by reference numeral <b>37</b>. The interface <b>37</b> is configured for 300-mm FOUP cassettes. After placing the cassette against the interface <b>37</b> in the partition <b>4</b>, the closure mechanism grips and unlocks the closure of the FOUP cassette and simultaneously opens the closure in the partition <b>4</b> and the closure of the FOUP cassette.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">A wafer handling device <b>24</b> within the wafer handling chamber <b>22</b> transfers wafers between the cassette concerned and a wafer boat <b>12</b>. After completion of the loading of wafers into the wafer boat <b>12</b>, a boat transfer arm <b>16</b> moves the wafer boat <b>12</b> through a closable opening in partition <b>3</b> from the wafer handling chamber <b>22</b> into the processing chamber <b>21</b>. The processing chamber <b>21</b> is provided with a rotary boat transfer platform <b>11</b>, supporting the wafer boat <b>12</b>. Two reactors, which in this case comprise furnaces <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, are arranged in processing chamber <b>21</b>. The furnaces <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> are positioned vertically and wafer boats, indicated by <b>12</b>, filled with wafers <b>13</b>, are introduced into the furnaces <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> in the vertical direction from below. To this end, each furnace <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> has an insertion arm <b>14</b>, which is movable in the vertical direction. Only one insertion arm <b>14</b> can be seen in FIG. <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">The treatment of a large number of wafers can be carried out as follows: The operator, shown diagrammatically in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, loads the store <b>8</b> by introducing a number of cassettes <b>10</b> on the input/output station <b>33</b> and carrying out control operations on a control panel <b>36</b>. Each of the cassettes <b>10</b> is transferred from the input/output station <b>33</b> with the aid of the cassette handling device <b>31</b> into the storage compartments <b>9</b> made for these cassettes in the store <b>8</b>, specifically on the stacked rotary platforms <b>27</b>. By rotation of the store <b>8</b> and use of the elevator <b>35</b>, it is possible to fill various compartments with the cassettes <b>10</b>. After filling the store <b>8</b>, no further human interaction is required with this automated installation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">The cassettes <b>10</b> concerned are then removed from the store <b>8</b> by the cassette handler device <b>31</b> and placed on the cassette transfer platform <b>30</b>. The cassette transfer platform <b>30</b> comprises two levels, schematically indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each level capable of receiving a FOUP cassette, where the two levels can be rotated independently of one another. Upon rotation of the cassette transfer platform <b>30</b>, the cassettes are placed against partition <b>4</b>. After opening of the closure of the FOUP cassette, together with the closure <b>37</b> in partition <b>4</b>, the wafers are removed by the wafer handler <b>24</b> and placed in a wafer boat <b>12</b>. After the wafer boat <b>12</b> has been filled, and becomes available for one of the reactors <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, the closure <b>19</b> in partition <b>3</b> is opened and the wafer boat <b>12</b> is placed on the rotary boat transfer platform <b>11</b> by the boat transfer arm <b>16</b>. The boat transfer platform <b>11</b> then moves the wafer boat <b>12</b> within the process chamber <b>21</b> to a position below the reactor to be loaded. Then the insertion mechanism or elevator <b>14</b> moves the boat into the reactor <b>6</b> or <b>7</b>. Treated wafers execute a movement counter to the above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">This system is described in further detail in published PCT application WO 99/38199 of applicant, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Although an operator is described as introducing the cassette on the input/output station <b>33</b>, the system is designed such that the cassettes can alternatively be introduced on the input/output station by means of an automatic guided vehicle (AGV) or by an overhead hoist system. In such a case, the control system of the wafer processing system can be connected to a host computer system that carries out the control functions. In this way, no human interaction at the wafer processing system is required at all.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a system according to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> and in addition provided with the features of the present invention. Features corresponding to those of the previously described system are referenced by similar reference numerals. The system <b>1</b> is provided with an input/output station <b>33</b> for receiving a cassette, which station is configured so that it can selectively receive a 300-mm FOUP cassette <b>212</b> or a 200-mm open cassette <b>112</b>. Preferably, no mechanical adjustments are required when changing from one cassette type to the other. In the illustrated embodiment of the input/output station <b>33</b>, shown in FIG. <b>3</b> and described in more detail with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>, two input/output positions are provided in the station <b>33</b>, one configured to receive a 300-mm FOUP cassette <b>212</b>, and another configured to receive a 200-mm open cassette <b>112</b>. In an alternative embodiment, one input/output position can be provided that is capable of selectively receiving a 300-mm FOUP cassette or a 200-mm open cassette without requiring any mechanical adjustments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">Further, the system <b>1</b> is provided with a cassette transfer region adjacent the input/output station <b>33</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the cassette transfer region is defined by the transfer chamber <b>23</b>, defined by the housing <b>2</b> and partitions <b>4</b> and <b>5</b>. The cassette transfer region thus includes a cassette store <b>8</b>, which can be loaded with a large number of cassettes for efficient access during processing without the need for continually retrieving cassettes from and returning cassettes to the clean room environment outside the system <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">The cassette transfer region also houses a cassette transfer mechanism. In the illustrated embodiment, the transfer mechanism includes a cassette handler <b>31</b> and a cassette transfer platform <b>30</b>. The cassette handler <b>31</b> includes an elevator <b>35</b> allowing access to the multiple rotary platforms <b>27</b> of the cassette store <b>8</b>, and serves to transfer cassettes among the input/output station <b>33</b>, the cassette store <b>8</b> and the cassette transfer platform <b>30</b>. The cassette transfer platform <b>30</b>, in turn, places cassettes into active communication with the interface <b>37</b> between the cassette transfer chamber <b>23</b> and the wafer handling chamber <b>22</b>, through which the wafer handling robot <b>24</b> can remove or replace wafers. In the illustrated embodiment, the cassette handler <b>31</b> transfers cassettes with the open side out, thus facilitating efficient storage on the round store <b>8</b> with narrow cassette ends facing the center of the rotary platforms <b>27</b>. The cassette transfer platform <b>30</b> is therefore configured to turn cassettes received from the cassette handler <b>31</b> until the open side faces the interface <b>37</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">Movements within the cassette transfer region are controlled by a cassette handling controller, including a central processing unit (CPU) and program therefor. In particular, the cassette handling controller instructs all movement of the cassette handler <b>31</b>, rotation of the rotary platforms within the cassette store <b>8</b>, rotation of the cassette transfer platform <b>30</b> and rotation of the input/output station <b>33</b>. Sensors (described below) are also connected to this controller.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">The cassette handler <b>31</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> is provided with an end effector that is configured to carry the 300-mm FOUP cassettes. The preferred embodiment additionally allows the end effector <b>32</b> of the cassette handler <b>31</b> to handle a 200-mm open cassette <b>112</b>. For this purpose, the preferred system <b>1</b> is provided with a cassette handler adapter <b>400</b>, described in more detail below with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-13</figref>. The cassette handler adapter is designed to be fitted on the bearing surface <b>32</b> of the cassette handler <b>31</b>, to accommodate a 200-mm open cassette, and to fit into a store for this adapter plate when it is not in use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">When a 200-mm open cassette <b>112</b> is to be handled, the cassette handling controller instructs the cassette handler <b>31</b> to automatically pick up the cassette handler adapter <b>400</b> from the store and, with the cassette handler adapter <b>400</b> on the bearing surface or end effector <b>32</b> of the cassette handler <b>31</b>, transfers the 200-mm cassette <b>112</b>. Instead of storing the cassette handler adapter at a storing or parking location, it is also possible that the cassette handler adapter be mounted permanently on the cassette handler. As a third option, the cassette handler adapter can be slidably or rotatably mounted on the cassette handler. In this third alternative, the cassette handler adapter can, for example, be hingedly attached to the cassette handler, such that the cassette handler adapter can be flipped or otherwise adjusted between an active position for handling 200-mm open cassettes and an inactive position that allows handling of 300-mm FOUP cassettes directly upon the cassette handler.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">The preferred embodiments also provide structures and methods for selectively bringing either a 300-mm FOUP or a 200-mm open cassette into active connection with the wafer handling device in such a way that the sealed environments, used in a standard 300-mm FOUP approach, remain intact. For this purpose, the system <b>1</b> is provided with a so-called “Transhipment FOUP” <b>100</b> designed to receive a 200-mm cassette <b>112</b> in its interior, as described in more detail below with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref> to <b>6</b>. Unlike standard FOUPs, the Transhipment FOUP <b>100</b> is not provided with a closure. The critical outside dimensions of the Transhipment FOUP <b>100</b> are substantially identical to those of a standard FOUP.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">When 200-mm wafers need to be handled, the cassette handling controller instructs the cassette handler <b>31</b> to pick up the Transhipment FOUP <b>100</b> from its storage position and places the Transhipment FOUP on the cassette transfer platform <b>30</b>. Then the cassette handler <b>31</b> picks up the cassette handler adapter <b>400</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-13</figref>) from its storage position and, equipped with the cassette handler adapter, the cassette handler <b>31</b> picks up a 200-mm cassette <b>112</b> from a storage position. The handler <b>31</b> then transports and places the 200-mm cassette <b>112</b> in the Transhipment FOUP <b>100</b> (see FIG. <b>17</b>). By rotation of cassette transfer platform <b>30</b>, the Transhipment FOUP <b>100</b> is placed against partition <b>4</b> and after opening of closure in the interface <b>37</b>, the Transhipment FOUP <b>100</b> containing the 200-mm cassette is brought into active connection with the wafer handler <b>24</b> within the handling chamber <b>22</b>. No special measures are required to allow the wafer handler <b>24</b> to handle 200-mm wafers from the 200-mm cassette. It suffices to program the wafer handler <b>24</b> with the positions of the center of the wafers and their mutual spacing, as is done for 300-mm wafer handling.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">In processing chamber <b>21</b>, a 300-mm wafer processing furnace is provided above position <b>60</b> and a 200-mm processing furnace is provided above position <b>70</b> of the boat transfer platform or turntable <b>11</b>. The fact that in this case the processing chamber contains furnaces is not relevant to the invention. The processing area can comprise any kind of processing tool or can comprise one or more metrology tools instead of processing tools. In the latter case, the wafer processing consists of analysis of the wafer. It is also possible that processing chamber <b>21</b> is completely absent and a wafer sorting operation forms the only “treatment” that the wafers undergo. In that case the system will comprise at least two positions where a FOUP cassette can be brought in active connection with the wafer handler <b>24</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">The invention will be explained in further detail below referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-17</figref>. The Transhipment FOUP <b>100</b> for facilitating 200-mm wafer handling in the system <b>1</b> is detailed in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref> to <b>6</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> illustrate adaptations to the input/output station <b>33</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref> to <b>13</b> illustrate the wafer handler's end effector <b>32</b>, the cassette handler adapter <b>400</b> and their interaction to receive 200-mm open cassettes <b>112</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A</figref> to <b>15</b> illustrate adaptations to the store <b>8</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref> illustrate adaptations to the rotatable cassette transfer platform <b>30</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates placement of a 200-mm open cassette <b>112</b> within the Transhipment FOUP. Corresponding parts are indicated by like reference numerals throughout the figures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, showing in perspective view a Transhipment FOUP without a 200-mm open cassette, the Transhipment FOUP is indicated in its entirety by 100 and comprises a top plate <b>101</b>, a bottom plate <b>102</b> and sidewalls <b>103</b>. The sidewalls <b>103</b> are provided with windows <b>104</b>. The front side is provided with a flange surface <b>105</b>, adapted to be placed sealingly against partition <b>4</b>. In its interior, the Transhipment FOUP comprises a cassette receiving plate <b>110</b> to accommodate a 200-mm open cassette. The receiving plate <b>110</b> is mounted on legs <b>111</b> and is provided with cassette positioning fixtures <b>114</b> to horizontally fix the 200-mm cassette on the receiving plate <b>110</b>. The bottom mechanical interface of the Transhipment FOUP is preferably identical to that of a standard 300-mm FOUP, at least in features relevant to interfacing with other elements of the system <b>1</b>. Similarly, other critical outside dimensions of the Transhipment FOUP <b>100</b> fall within the dimensions of the envelope of a standard FOUP cassette.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">The Transhipment FOUP is preferably also provided with a discharge pipe <b>121</b>, connected to an overpressure relief valve <b>120</b> that might become active when the Transhipment FOUP <b>100</b> is in active connection with the wafer handling chamber <b>22</b> (FIG. <b>3</b>). The Transhipment FOUP <b>100</b> is not provided with a closure for the open side. Despite lack of a door, because its out surfaces otherwise match those of a standard FOUP, the feature is referred to herein as a “FOUP” to distinguish the 200-mm “open” cassette.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the Transhipment FOUP <b>100</b> is shown accommodating a 200-mm “open” cassette <b>112</b> on the cassette receiving plate <b>110</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the outer surface of the bottom <b>102</b> of the Transhipment FOUP <b>100</b> with three positioning recesses <b>130</b>, intended to engage with three positioning pins, which pins are discussed below with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>9</b>, <b>16</b>A and <b>16</b>B. The position and the dimensions of these recesses <b>130</b> and pins are standardized for handling in the semiconductor industry. The recesses <b>130</b> form elongated grooves, extending in the radial direction. The combination of the recesses <b>130</b> with the positioning pins allows the Transhipment FOUP <b>100</b> to be self-centering on the pins, similar to a standard FOUP.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>, the preferred embodiment provides an input/output station <b>33</b> adapted to facilitate feeding 200-mm cassettes into the system <b>1</b> described above. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> is a top down view and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> is a rear view (seen from out of the system towards the input/output station <b>33</b>). The input/output station <b>33</b> is provided with two cassette receiving positions <b>208</b> and <b>209</b>. Receiving position <b>209</b> is configured to receive 300-mm FOUP cassettes <b>212</b> and position <b>208</b> is configured to receive 200-mm open cassettes <b>112</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">Receiving position <b>209</b> is provided with a bearing surface <b>201</b>, which can be rotated around an axis <b>205</b> to make the cassette accessible for the cassette handler <b>31</b> (FIG. <b>3</b>). The bearing surface <b>201</b> is provided with three positioning pins <b>202</b>, positioned and dimensioned according to SEMI STANDARD E 47.1 and the FOUP cassette is provided with matching recesses <b>130</b> (FIG. <b>6</b>). Near each of these positioning pins <b>202</b>, a sensor <b>203</b> is provided to detect the presence of a FOUP cassette <b>212</b>. A plurality of positions <b>204</b> are also shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> to indicate the points at which the positioning pins <b>302</b> of the cassette handler <b>31</b> contact a FOUP cassette <b>212</b> when lifting the cassette from the input/output station <b>33</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">The position <b>208</b> for receiving a 200-mm open cassette is designed as a position to receive a 300-mm FOUP cassette, as described above with respect to position <b>209</b>, with an additional a load port adapter frame <b>210</b> to accommodate the 200-mm open cassette. The load port adapter frame <b>210</b> is provided with a bottom mechanical interface identical to that of a 300-mm FOUP cassette so that it fits on the three positioning pins <b>202</b> of the 300-mm FOUP receiving position <b>209</b>. In this way, a receiving position can easily be reconfigured to the other cassette type by either removing or placing a load port adapter frame <b>210</b> from or onto a receiving position. The load port adapter frame <b>210</b> is provided with fixtures to fix the position of the 200-mm cassette <b>112</b> and with sensors (not shown) to detect the presence of a 200-mm cassette. In an alternative embodiment, a receiving position can be designed such that either a 200-mm cassette or a 300-mm cassette can be received at the same position and sensors can detect whether and of what size a cassette is present.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> (top view) and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> (side view), the end effector <b>32</b> of the cassette handler <b>31</b> is shown. The end effector is indicated in its entirety by reference numeral <b>32</b> and is provided with a bearing surface <b>301</b> to carry 300-mm FOUP cassettes. The bearing surface <b>301</b> is provided with three positioning pins <b>302</b> to pick up a FOUP cassette. The positions of the positioning pins <b>302</b> correspond to those of the positions <b>204</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>) of the input/output station <b>33</b> and are shifted inwardly as compared to the positions of positioning pins <b>202</b> (FIGS. <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B). Both positioning pins <b>202</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>) and <b>302</b> can be accommodated in the positioning recesses <b>130</b> in the bottom plate <b>102</b> of the FOUP cassette because these recesses <b>130</b> extend over some distance in the radial direction. In this way, the FOUP cassette can be picked up by the inner positioning pins <b>302</b> on the bearing surface <b>301</b> of the cassette handler end effector <b>32</b> while it is supported by the outer positioning pins <b>202</b> of the input/output station <b>33</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">The end effector bearing surface <b>301</b> is provided with three sensors <b>303</b> to detect the presence of a FOUP cassette. Furthermore, the end effector bearing surface <b>301</b> is provided with a substantially rectangular hole <b>305</b> to detect the presence of a cassette handler adapter on the bearing surface <b>301</b> of the cassette handler and two substantially rectangular holes <b>304</b> for the detection of the presence of the presence of a 200-mm cassette on the cassette handler adapter, as will be explained in further detail below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> (top view) and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> (side view), a cassette handler adapter is provided in order to be able to handle 200-mm cassettes. The cassette handler adapter is indicated in its entirety by reference numeral <b>400</b> and is designed to be fitted on the bearing surface <b>301</b> of the cassette handler end effector <b>32</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) and to receive a 200-mm open cassette on its bearing surface <b>401</b>. For this purpose the cassette handler adapter <b>400</b> is provided with three positioning holes <b>402</b> matching with the positioning pins <b>302</b> of the cassette handler end effector <b>32</b>. The cassette handler adapter <b>400</b> rests by gravity on the bearing surface <b>301</b> of the cassette handler end effector <b>32</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">When the cassette handler adapter <b>400</b> is placed on the cassette handler end effector <b>32</b>, sensors <b>303</b> are activated and the presence of an object on the bearing surface is detected. However, the sensors <b>303</b> cannot discriminate between the presence of a FOUP cassette and the presence of a cassette handler adapter <b>400</b>. To allow the unambiguous determination of the presence of the cassette handler adapter <b>400</b>, the bearing surface <b>401</b> of the cassette handler adapter <b>400</b> is provided with a bracket <b>405</b>, provided at one end with a downward pointing vane. The vane is not visible in the drawings because the cover <b>408</b> shields the position of the vane. When the cassette handler adapter <b>400</b> is placed on the bearing surface <b>301</b> of the cassette handler end effector <b>32</b>, the vane sticks through the rectangular hole <b>305</b> and activates a sensor mounted adjacent to the rectangular hole <b>305</b>, underneath bearing surface <b>301</b> and not shown in the drawings. In this way the presence of the cassette handler adapter <b>400</b> on the bearing surface <b>301</b> is detected.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">Furthermore, the cassette handle adapter <b>400</b> is provided with two leaf springs <b>403</b>, fixed at one end and provided with a vane <b>404</b> at the other end. When a 200-mm open cassette is placed on the bearing surface <b>401</b> of the cassette handler adapter <b>400</b>, the upwardly pointing ends of the leaf springs <b>403</b>, provided with the vanes <b>404</b>, are pressed downwards through the rectangular holes <b>304</b>. Adjacent to the holes <b>304</b> are mounted sensors (not shown), which detect the presence of the vanes <b>404</b> and, hence, the presence of the 200-mm open cassette.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">Furthermore, the bearing surface <b>401</b> is provided with fixtures <b>406</b> to horizontally fix the 200-mm open cassette thereon. The 200-mm open cassette rests by gravity on the bearing surface <b>401</b>. The cassette handler adapter <b>400</b> is also provided with a vertical bar <b>407</b> at the open side of the cassette to prevent the wafers from shifting out of the open cassette during cassette transfer. The bar is made of a material that does not damage or contaminate the wafers, like PEEK ®. A cover <b>408</b> covers one end of the cassette handler adapter <b>400</b>, adjacent the vertical bar <b>407</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">The cassette handler adapter <b>400</b>, with a bottom mechanical interface identical to that of a 300-mm FOUP cassette, can be stored, when not in use, at any storage location that is designed for storage of a 300-mm FOUP cassette. This can be any compartment or storage position <b>9</b> in the store <b>8</b>. In an alternative design, not shown in further detail, the cassette handler adapter can be made such that it is mounted permanently on the cassette handler, but such that it can be tilted or translated away when not is use.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> (top view) and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> (side view) the cassette handler end effector <b>32</b> is shown carrying the cassette handler adapter <b>400</b> while the cassette handler adapter <b>400</b> accommodates a 200-mm open cassette <b>112</b>. Features in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref> are referenced by the same reference numerals as for corresponding parts in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-11</figref>. The position of a wafer <b>13</b> is indicated in the cassette <b>112</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">In the store <b>8</b> for cassettes, a number of storage positions for 300-mm FOUP cassettes are similarly converted to 200-mm storage positions. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A</figref> to <b>14</b>D show a platform <b>27</b> of the store <b>8</b> from a top and side views. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref> show a platform <b>27</b> for receiving 300-mm FOUP cassettes <b>212</b>. The platform <b>27</b> comprises four receiving positions, each position provided with three positioning pins <b>502</b>. In the preferred embodiment, each receiving position for a 300-mm FOUP cassette can be converted to two receiving positions for 200-mm cassettes, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14C and 14D</figref>. This can be achieved by providing a receiving position for a 300-mm FOUP cassette with a store adapter frame <b>503</b>, designed to fit on the 3 positioning pins <b>502</b> and to receive two 200-mm cassettes on its upper surface. Each position to receive a 200-mm cassette is provided with fixtures <b>506</b> to horizontally fix the 200-mm cassette. The core of the rotatable store <b>8</b> is provided with a clean air supply channel <b>510</b>, and filters <b>511</b>, not shown in detail, can be mounted at each 200-mm compartment of the platform <b>27</b>. By the use of store adapter frames <b>503</b>, the number of 200-mm storage locations can simply be increased or decreased by placing or removing one or more of the store adapter frames <b>503</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> schematically shows the detection of cassettes in the cassette store <b>8</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A-14D</figref>. Adjacent to the cassette store <b>8</b>, a post <b>550</b> is mounted rigidly attached to the housing and extending in the vertical direction over the entire height of the cassette store <b>8</b>. On this post <b>550</b>, at each of the stacked platforms <b>27</b>, optical sensors <b>551</b> are mounted to detect the presence or absence of a cassette. Inside each storage compartment, a reflector is mounted on a leaf spring. The reflector is indicated by reference numeral <b>552</b> but not shown in detail. When no cassette is present, the light beam emitted by the optical sensor <b>551</b> is reflected back by the reflector <b>552</b> mounted on the leaf spring and the sensor <b>551</b> detects the reflected light. When a cassette is present, the bottom of the cassette presses downwards the leaf spring, the reflector <b>552</b> is moved out of the light beam and the emitted light is not reflected back to the sensor <b>551</b>. Consequently, the compartment is identified as being empty and available for loading a cassette only when the sensor detects a signal. The height of the sensors <b>551</b> on the post <b>550</b> with respect to the platform <b>27</b> and the direction in which the sensor is aligned are different for a 200-mm storage compartment as compared to a 300-mm storage compartment. The mounting of the post <b>550</b>, of the sensors <b>551</b> on the post <b>550</b>, and of the reflectors <b>552</b> relative to each other, are such that the presence of a cassette can be detected only when the cassette position on the rotary platform <b>27</b> is facing the cassette handler <b>31</b> (FIG. <b>3</b>). This position, however, is the most relevant situation for detection. Although the system keeps track of where the cassettes in the system are, the sensors provide an extra check and safety in order to prevent, for example, attempts to place a cassette in a position where a cassette is already present. With this sensing strategy, each cassette position of the rotatable cassette storage platform <b>27</b> does not require an individual sensor <b>551</b>. This avoids the need for electrical wiring being routed via a rotation feed-through to a controller, which would increase the complexity of the system significantly. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows also in greater detail the clean air supply channel <b>510</b> and the air filter <b>511</b> for a 200-mm compartment. Furthermore, an air guiding strip <b>512</b>, extending over substantially the entire height of the filter, is provided to guide the air in the direction of the respective centers of the 200-mm cassettes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref> show the rotatable cassette transfer platform <b>30</b> from top down and perspective views, respectively. The rotatable cassette transfer platform <b>30</b> has a bearing surface <b>601</b>. The bearing surface <b>601</b> is provided with a cutout <b>606</b> to allow vertical passage of the end effector <b>32</b> of the cassette handler <b>31</b>. Three positioning pins <b>602</b> are positioned and sized to mate with the recesses <b>130</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) in the bottom of a FOUP cassette and sensors <b>603</b> detect the presence of a FOUP cassette. Three sensors <b>603</b> are shown in FIG. <b>16</b>A. It will be clear that this provides a high degree of redundancy and safety and that a reduced number of sensors can also be used. The sensors <b>603</b> are not shown in FIG. <b>16</b>B. Opposite the open side of the cutout <b>606</b>, a sensor housing <b>610</b> is mounted on the bearing surface <b>601</b>. At the side facing the FOUP cassette, the sensor housing is provided with an opening <b>611</b> to pass a detection beam from and to a sensor, which mounted inside the sensor housing and not shown in the figures. When an empty Transhipment FOUP is placed on the bearing surface <b>601</b>, the sensors <b>603</b> detect its presence. However, the sensors <b>603</b> cannot discriminate between the presence of a standard FOUP and the Transhipment FOUP <b>100</b>. For this purpose the sensor inside sensor housing <b>610</b> is provided. The detection works similar to the detection of the presence of a cassette in the cassette store <b>8</b>, as described above. When a normal FOUP cassette is placed on the cassette transfer platform <b>30</b>, the light emitted by the sensor within the sensor housing <b>610</b> and passing through hole <b>611</b> will only be scattered diffusely, rather than reflected backwards in the direction of the sensor. Consequently, the sensor will not deliver a signal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">On the other hand, in case of a Transhipment FOUP <b>100</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>) the sensor will deliver a signal in the following way: The cassette receiving plate <b>110</b> in the Transhipment FOUP <b>100</b> is provided with a reflector mounted on a leaf spring and properly positioned. When an empty Transhipment FOUP <b>100</b> is placed on the cassette transfer platform <b>30</b>, the light emitted by the sensor in the sensor housing <b>610</b>, passing through hole <b>611</b> and the window <b>104</b> in wall <b>103</b> of the Transhipment FOUP that faces the sensor housing, hits the reflector. The reflector reflects the light back in the direction of the sensor and the sensor within the sensor housing <b>610</b> will detect the reflected light. The sensors are connected to the controller. When sensors <b>603</b> and the sensor inside the sensor housing <b>610</b> are simultaneously activated, the presence of the Transhipment FOUP <b>100</b> on the platform <b>30</b> is unambiguously detected. When a 200-mm open cassette is subsequently placed on the cassette receiving plate <b>110</b> of the Transhipment FOUP, the leaf spring is pressed downwards and the reflector, mounted on the leaf spring, is moved out of the beam and the sensor does not detect a signal anymore. By this sequence of events the presence of a 200-mm cassette <b>112</b> inside the Transhipment FOUP <b>100</b> is detected. As can be seen from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>, the position of the cassette on the platform <b>30</b> is somewhat asymmetrical.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">As noted above, movements within the cassette transfer region are controlled by a cassette handling controller, comprising a central processing unit (CPU) and associated programming. The controller communicates with the sensors described above and is programmed to have the cassette handler <b>31</b> automatically pick up (or otherwise install) the cassette handler adapter <b>400</b> when needed and to automatically store the cassette handler adapter <b>400</b> when not needed. Similarly, the cassette handling controller is programmed such that, when 200-mm wafers need to be handled from a 200-mm cassette, the cassette handler <b>31</b> automatically picks up the Transhipment FOUP <b>100</b> and places it on the cassette transfer platform <b>30</b> if not already there (as determined by sensor communications with the controller), and the handler <b>31</b> picks up the 200-mm open cassette and places it in the Transhipment FOUP <b>100</b>. The “need” for handling 200-mm open cassettes and the wafers stored therein can be pre-programmed or can be instructed by a user at the control panel <b>36</b> (see FIG. <b>1</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">In operation, when one or more 200-mm open cassettes <b>112</b> need to be introduced into the system <b>1</b> the procedure is as follows: a 200-mm cassette <b>112</b> is placed on the 200-mm position <b>208</b> of the receiving station <b>33</b>. When the system <b>1</b> is instructed to handle the 200-mm cassette <b>112</b>, the cassette handler controller is programmed such that before handling the 200-mm cassette <b>112</b>, the cassette handler <b>31</b> automatically picks up the cassette handler adapter <b>400</b> from its storage position. Then the cassette handler <b>31</b>, equipped with the cassette handler adapter <b>400</b>, transfers the 200-mm cassette <b>112</b> from the receiving position <b>208</b> at the input/output station <b>33</b> to a 200-mm storage position in the cassette store <b>8</b>. Sequentially, more than one 200-mm cassette can be introduced according to the need of the moment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">When 200-mm wafers need to be loaded into a boat <b>12</b>, the cassette handler controller instructs the cassette handler <b>31</b> to transfer the Transhipment FOUP <b>100</b> from its storage position in the store <b>8</b> to the cassette transfer platform <b>30</b>. Then, the cassette handler <b>31</b> picks up the cassette handler adapter <b>400</b> from its storage position and, equipped with the cassette handler adapter <b>400</b>, retrieves a 200-mm cassette <b>112</b> (typically from the store <b>8</b>) and places it on the cassette receiving plate <b>110</b> in the interior of the Transhipment FOUP <b>100</b>. Then the cassette transfer platform <b>30</b> rotates the Transhipment FOUP <b>100</b> and places it against partition <b>4</b>. After opening the closure of the interface <b>37</b> in partition <b>4</b>, the wafer handler <b>24</b> can transfer 200-mm wafers from the 200-mm open cassette <b>112</b> to a 200-mm wafer boat within the wafer handling chamber <b>22</b> for processing the wafers. The system is programmed such that it will load wafers only in a wafer boat corresponding with the size of the wafers to be loaded and the wafer boat will only be loaded into a furnace or other tool corresponding to the boat size (see FIG. <b>3</b>). When transfer of the 200-mm wafers out of the cassette <b>112</b> is complete, the cassette handling controller instructs the cassette transfer platform to rotate the Transhipment FOUP <b>100</b> away from the interface <b>37</b> and the cassette handler <b>31</b> removes the 200-mm open cassette <b>112</b> from the Transhipment FOUP <b>100</b>, to make room for another cassette.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">The procedure of placing a 200-mm cassette inside a 300-mm Transhipment FOUP is illustrated in FIG. <b>17</b>. The cassette handler <b>31</b>, equipped with the cassette handler adapter <b>400</b>, and bearing a 200-mm cassette <b>112</b>, moves into the Transhipment FOUP <b>100</b> at the appropriate height. When the cassette handler <b>31</b> has reached the correct distance into the Transhipment FOUP <b>100</b>, the cassette handler <b>31</b> moves downwardly through the cut-out <b>113</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) of the cassette receiving plate <b>110</b> till the 200-mm cassette <b>112</b> is placed on the cassette receiving plate <b>110</b>. Then the cassette handler <b>31</b> moves downward an incremental distance to release the 200-mm cassette <b>112</b> onto the plate <b>110</b> and the cassette handler <b>31</b> retracts from the Transhipment FOUP <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067">To someone skilled in the art, it will be clear that the invention can be embodied in other ways. It is possible to replace the rotatable store by a bookshelf store wherein the compartments are arranged side-by-side according to a rectangular grid. Then the cassette handler requires corresponding degrees of freedom in movement to be able to reach all the compartments. It is also possible that the cassette handler brings the cassette in active connection with the wafer handler, with the use of a stationary platform instead of the rotatable platform according to the present embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068">The skilled artisan will similarly appreciate that many other omissions, additions and modifications to the preferred embodiment can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. It is accordingly desired that the present embodiment be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, reference being made to the appended claims rather than to the foregoing description to indicate the scope of the invention.</div>
