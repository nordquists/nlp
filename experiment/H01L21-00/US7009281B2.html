<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The present invention relates generally to etching semiconductor substrates, and more particularly, to systems and methods for plasma etching semiconductor substrates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">In general, the manufacturing of the integrated circuit devices (in the form of semiconductor substrates and wafers) includes the use of plasma etching chambers. The plasma etch chambers are capable of etching selected layers on the substrate as defined by a photoresist mask. The plasma etch chambers are configured to receive processing gases (i.e., etch chemistries) while a radio frequency (RF) power is applied to one or more electrodes of the plasma etch chamber. The pressure inside the plasma etch chamber is also controlled for the particular process. Upon applying the desired RF power to the electrode(s), the process gases in the chamber are activated such that a plasma is created. The plasma is thus configured to perform the desired etching of the selected layers of the semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Low volatility byproducts are produced in some prior art plasma etch processes. By way of example, in a copper etch process using chlorine containing gases (e.g., Cl2 and HCl), the byproduct is CuClx. CuClx is non-volatile at room temperature. The low-volatility byproducts typically condense on the chamber walls. During each plasma etch cycle, the byproducts build-up on the chamber walls. Eventually the byproducts build-up to a certain thickness. The byproduct build-up then begins to “flake” off of the chamber walls and is therefore becomes a significant particle source. The particles can contaminate the substrates being etched in the chamber.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">Recognizing that the internal surfaces of the plasma etch chamber are exposed to the plasma, the chambers are often designed to permit the use of simple lining parts, such as, disks, rings, and cylinders. Because these lining parts are configured to confine the plasma over the substrate being processed, these parts are continuously exposed and attacked by the processing plasma energies. Due to this exposure, these parts ultimately erode or accumulate polymer buildup, requiring replacement or thorough cleaning. However, the cleaning and/or replacement costs of these lining parts can become very expensive both in actual cost and in lost production time required for the cleaning and replacement.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">In view of the foregoing, there is a need for a system and method of substantially eliminating particle contamination from byproduct build-up on the walls of the plasma etch chamber.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">Broadly speaking, the present invention fills these needs by providing an improved system for processing a substrate. It should be appreciated that the present invention can be implemented in numerous ways, including as a process, an apparatus, a system, computer readable media, or a device. Several inventive embodiments of the present invention are described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">One embodiment includes a method of processing a substrate. The method including loading a substrate into a plasma chamber and setting a pressure of the plasma chamber to a pre-determined pressure set point. Multiple inner surfaces that define a plasma zone are heated to a processing temperature. A process gas is injected into the plasma zone to form a plasma and the substrate is processed. The processing temperature can be greater than about 200 degrees (e.g., between about 200 degrees C. and about 400 degrees C. or a higher temperature).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">The method further includes drawing a byproduct vapor from the plasma zone through a cold trap to condense the byproduct vapor in the cold trap. The cold trap has a temperature of at least about 50 degrees C. cooler than the processing temperature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">Processing the substrate can include etching the substrate. Processing the substrate can also include etching a copper film on the substrate. Heating the inner surfaces defining the plasma zone to the processing temperature can include maintaining a surface of the substrate at a second temperature sufficient to cause a byproduct vapor to condense on the surface of the substrate to deposit a film on the substrate. The second temperature is about 50 degrees C. cooler than the processing temperature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">The pre-determined pressure set point is less than atmospheric pressure. The pre-determined pressure set point is within a range of about 1 mTorr and about 500 mTorr.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">The plasma chamber is a small volume plasma chamber. The small volume plasma chamber includes a first electrode. The first electrode forming a chuck for supporting the substrate. A second electrode is also included. The second electrode being deposed substantially parallel to the first electrode. The second electrode being one of the inner surfaces. The first electrode and second electrode being separated by a predetermined distance. The predetermined distance is equal to a range of between about 0.5 cm and about 5 cm. The small volume plasma chamber includes a hot liner, wherein the hot liner forms a portion of the plurality of inner surfaces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">Processing the substrate includes a stress free planarization wherein the substrate is patterned, having a conductive interconnect material filling multiple features in the pattern. The conductive interconnect material having an overburden portion having at least one non-uniformity. The stress free planarization includes planarizing the overburden portion that includes depositing an additional layer on the overburden portion and planarizing the additional layer and the overburden portion. The additional layer being substantially entirely removed in the planarizing process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">Another embodiment provides a small volume plasma chamber that includes a first electrode, the first electrode forming a chuck for supporting the substrate. A second electrode is also included. The second electrode being deposed substantially parallel to the first electrode. The first electrode and second electrode being separated by a predetermined distance. A hot liner is also included. The hot liner and the second electrode form a portion of several inner surfaces that define a plasma zone. The predetermined distance is equal to a range of between about 0.5 cm and about 5 cm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">The small volume plasma chamber can also include a cold trap. The cold trap being sufficiently cooler than the inner surfaces that define the plasma zone to substantially cause a plasma byproduct vapor to condense in the cold trap. The cold trap is coupled to the plasma zone by a passage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">Another embodiment provides a method of forming a semiconductor device including loading a patterned substrate into a plasma chamber. The substrate having a conductive interconnect material filling several features in the pattern. The conductive interconnect material having an overburden portion having at least one non-uniformity. A pressure of the plasma chamber is set to a pre-determined pressure set point. Multiple inner surfaces that define a plasma zone, are heated to a processing temperature of greater than about 200 degree C. A process gas is injected into the plasma zone to form a plasma. The substrate is processed which includes forming an additional layer on the overburden portion and planarizing the additional layer and the overburden portion. The additional layer being substantially entirely removed in the planarizing process. A byproduct vapor from the plasma zone is drawn through a cold trap to cause the byproduct vapor to condense in the cold trap. The conductive interconnect material can include copper.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">The present invention provides a small volume plasma chamber having multiple inner surfaces capable of being substantially uniformly heated to a processing temperature to ensure that byproduct vapors, especially byproduct vapors having a low volatility, will not condense on the inner surfaces so as to form particle contamination sources.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">Further, the byproduct vapors are drawn away from the plasma zone and through a cold trap where the byproduct vapors can condense. The cold trap is sufficiently physically isolated that particles formed by the condensed byproduct vapors are substantially prevented from migrating to the substrate being processed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">The present invention provides an advantage of substantially minimizing the particle generation and resulting substrate contamination. This is achieved by substantially eliminating condensation of plasma chemistries on the inner surfaces of the plasma chamber. Condensation is directed in a cold trap that is at least partially physically isolated from the plasma zone.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">Several exemplary embodiments for an improved system and method for performing a plasma etch process on a substrate will now be described. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without some or all of the specific details set forth herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">One embodiment provides a plasma etch chamber with a relatively small volume that includes a capacitively coupled RF source. The inner surface area of the small volume plasma etch chamber is sufficiently small that the inner surface area can be easily heated to an elevated temperature (e.g., greater than about 200 degrees C.). The elevated temperature is sufficient to substantially prevent a low volatility byproduct from condensing on the inner surface. The capacitively coupled RF plasma chamber uses parallel plates having a narrow gap between them. The parallel plates form a top and bottom electrodes with the substrate situated on the bottom electrode and the top electrode situated very close to the surface of the substrate. In this configuration, the top and bottom electrodes form a majority of the inner surface area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows side view of a small volume plasma etch process chamber <b>100</b>, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. A substrate <b>108</b> being processed is clamped to a heated chuck <b>102</b> that also serves as the bottom electrode. The chuck <b>102</b> can be an electro-static chuck. A focus ring <b>122</b> can also be included in the bottom electrode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">Process gases are delivered from a gas source trough an inlet port <b>126</b>. The process gases flow through an optional baffle plate <b>106</b> and through a perforated “showerhead-type” top electrode <b>104</b>. The baffle plate <b>106</b> disperses the gas flow. The baffle plate <b>106</b> can be separated from the top electrode <b>104</b> by a low contact dielectric <b>116</b> (e.g., quartz, insulator, etc.) so that the baffle plate <b>106</b> is not substantially connected to the tope electrode <b>104</b> either electrically or thermally. A plasma zone <b>114</b> is formed by the volume defined by the top electrode <b>104</b>, the bottom electrode <b>102</b> and the hot liner <b>124</b>. The gas flow is well dispersed in the plasma zone <b>114</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">The top electrode <b>104</b> and the bottom electrode <b>102</b> are separated by a distance d of about 0.5 cm to about 5 cm. In one exemplary embodiment, d is equal to about 2 cm. The top electrode <b>104</b> can be coupled to a ground potential <b>112</b> and the bottom electrode <b>102</b> coupled to the RF source <b>110</b> as shown. In an alternative embodiment, the bottom electrode <b>102</b> can be coupled to the ground potential <b>112</b> and the top electrode <b>104</b> coupled the RF source <b>110</b>. The RF source can have a frequency of between about 400 kHz and about 60 MHz. The RF source can have a voltage of between about 100 volts and about 2000 volts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">In an alternative embodiment, the plasma chamber <b>100</b> can be configured in a push-pull configuration. In the push-pull configuration, both the top electrode <b>104</b> and the bottom electrode <b>102</b> are powered by the RF source. The sputtering from ions in the push-pull configuration can further reduce the deposition of the low-volatile by-products on the top electrode <b>104</b>. As described above, the deposition of etch by-products on the top electrode <b>104</b> is a major concern since it is proximate to the surface substrate <b>108</b>. The push-pull configuration plasma chamber <b>100</b> can also be powered from a single RF source <b>110</b>. In this push-pull RF configuration, the plasma potential is reduced to one half, which allows the plasma to be more easily confined in the plasma zone <b>114</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">The process gases can be heated by hot plasma bombardment. If a higher temperature is needed to prevent deposition of the byproducts on the inner surface area, then additional electric heaters can be embedded in the top electrode <b>104</b>. A hot liner <b>124</b> between the electrodes is electrically heated to prevent any deposition on the liner. The hot liner <b>124</b> can be heated with embedded resistive heaters or other types of heat sources (e.g., hot oil, radiant heat source) The hot liner <b>124</b> can also serve as a plasma confinement barrier defining a plasma zone <b>114</b> formed between the top electrode <b>104</b>, the bottom electrode <b>102</b> and the hot liner. The hot liner <b>124</b> can be manufactured from a plasma resistant material (e.g., quartz or alumina or any suitable materials coated with plasma resistant layers).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">In an exemplary use, a copper film can be etched using a chlorine containing gaseous species. In such a use, the minimum temperature for all surfaces (e.g., hot liner <b>124</b>, top electrode <b>104</b>, and bottom electrode <b>102</b>) that are around the substrate <b>108</b>, should be between about 200 to about 400 degrees C. At that temperature range the etch byproducts (e.g., CuClx) and other chemistries in the plasma are vaporized at a sufficient vapor pressure and can therefore be pumped out of the plasma zone <b>114</b> in the plasma etch chamber and out of the outlet ports <b>116</b>. As the temperature is increased, the volatility of the various chemistries and byproducts in the plasma also increases. As a result, vapors having a low volatility (e.g., copper etch byproducts) can be more efficiently evacuated from the plasma zone <b>114</b> as the temperature is increased. Because the low volatility copper etch byproducts are more effectively evacuated, then the particle generation caused by build-up of the etch byproduct on the inner surfaces of the plasma zone <b>114</b> is substantially reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">It should be understood that while 400 degrees C. is cited herein is an exemplary upper temperature limit, the chamber is not limited to 400 degrees C. and could be heated to a much higher temperature if desired. By way of example, if a particular etch by product did not have a sufficient vapor pressure until heated to 500 degrees C., then the process chamber could be sufficiently heated to 500 degrees C. Temperatures higher than 500 degrees C. can also be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">In contrast, a typical prior art plasma etch chamber is too large to be effectively heated to 200 degrees C. and at least some portion of the inner surface of the prior art plasma etch chamber is sufficiently cool enough that the etch byproducts can condense and eventually build-up and flake off, thereby becoming a particle contamination source. The typical plasma etch processes occur at less than 100 degrees C. (e.g., 60 degrees C.) and as described above, the etch byproducts can condense on the inner surfaces, near the substrate, and cause particle contamination.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">Because the etch byproduct CuClx has a low volatility, the plasma etch process can be accomplished at a pressure less than or equal to about atmospheric pressure (i.e. less than or equal to about 1 Torr). By way of example the copper plasma etch process can be operated at a range of about 1–500 mTorr.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">A cold trap <b>120</b> is included adjacent to the hot liner <b>124</b>. A narrow passage <b>126</b> through the hot liner <b>124</b> couples the plasma zone <b>114</b> with the cold trap <b>120</b>. As gases and the etch byproduct vapor is pumped out of the plasma zone <b>114</b>, the etch byproduct vapor is drawn through the cold trap <b>120</b> and drawn out the outlet ports <b>116</b> by one or more pumps <b>144</b>. Much of the etch byproduct condenses in the cold trap <b>120</b>. As a result, the etch byproduct gradually builds up on the surfaces of the cold trap <b>120</b>. Any particles (e.g., flakes and other loose etch byproduct buildup) that form in the cold trap <b>120</b> cannot easily migrate back to the plasma zone <b>114</b>, and therefore to the substrate <b>108</b>, due to the relatively small width of the narrow passage <b>126</b>. By way of example, the narrow passage <b>126</b> can have a width of between about 5 mm to about 20 mm. In this manner the particles are sufficiently physically separated from the substrate <b>108</b> to substantially eliminate particle contamination resulting from the plasma etch byproducts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">The cold trap <b>120</b> can be actively cooled or may simply not be heated and therefore sufficiently cool to cause the etch byproducts to condense. The cold trap <b>120</b> can be thermally isolated from the heated portions of the plasma chamber <b>100</b> so that the cold trap will remain substantially cooler than the heated portions (e.g., more than about 50 degrees C. cooler, for example, than the hot liner <b>120</b> and the substrate <b>108</b>). By way of example the cold trap <b>120</b> can be thermally coupled to the wall of the chamber <b>100</b> or the chuck housing <b>142</b> so that the cold trap <b>120</b> will remain approximately the same temperature as the respective wall of the chamber <b>100</b> or the chuck housing <b>142</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">The substrate <b>108</b> can be loaded in to the plasma etch chamber <b>100</b> via a loading port <b>128</b>. The bottom electrode <b>1</b>-<b>2</b> can be lowered in the chuck housing <b>142</b> or the hot liner <b>124</b> can be lifted (e.g., by lifters <b>130</b>) or combinations thereof to provide substrate loading and unloading access to the plasma zone <b>114</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a flowchart of the method operations <b>150</b> for etching a substrate in the plasma chamber <b>100</b> described above, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. In an operation <b>155</b>, the substrate is loaded into the plasma chamber <b>100</b> (e.g., through the loading port <b>128</b>). The loading port can also be closed for processing. In an operation <b>160</b>, a pressure inside the plasma chamber <b>100</b> is adjusted to the desired set point as described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">In an operation <b>165</b>, the plasma chamber <b>100</b> is heated to the required processing temperature. The processing temperature can be any temperature sufficiently high enough to provide sufficient volatility of the desired species. As described above, in a copper etch process using a chlorine containing gaseous etchant species, the processing temperature is about 200 degrees C. or even higher (e.g., about 250 to about 400 degrees C.). If the intended process is an etch process, then all inner surfaces exposed to the plasma zone <b>114</b> are heated to the processing temperature. In the alternative, if the intended process is a deposition process, then all inner surfaces exposed to the plasma zone <b>114</b>, except the substrate <b>108</b>, are heated to the processing temperature. Heating the inner surfaces to the processing temperature can be accomplished by forming a plasma in the plasma zone <b>114</b> or by actively heating the various surfaces with resistive, radiant or other types of thermal energy sources.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">In an operation <b>170</b>, the process gases are injected into the plasma chamber <b>100</b> and a etch (or deposition) plasma is formed. In an operation <b>175</b>, the etching (or deposition) operation is performed. In an etching operation, the etching chemistry etches away a portion of the surface of the substrate <b>108</b> that is exposed to the plasma. By way of example, a copper layer can be etched by a chlorine containing species causing CuClx byproducts to be vaporized in the plasma.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">In an operation <b>180</b>, the byproduct vapors and gases are drawn out of the plasma zone <b>114</b> and through the cold trap <b>120</b> and out of the plasma chamber <b>100</b> by the pump(s) <b>144</b>. At least a portion of the byproduct vapors condense on the relatively cool surfaces of the cold trap <b>120</b>, as the byproduct vapors are drawn through the cold trap. In this manner substantially all of the particles that may be caused by the condensed byproduct vapors are formed away from the inner surfaces that the substrate <b>108</b> is exposed to. As a result, the particle contamination of the substrate <b>108</b> is substantially eliminated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">In an operation <b>185</b>, the etching (or deposition) operation is ended. The etching (or deposition) operation ends when a desired result is achieved. By way of example, the operation ends when an etching time has been achieved or when a desired end point has been achieved. In an operation <b>240</b>, the substrate <b>108</b> is removed from the plasma chamber <b>100</b> and the method operations end.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">While the above examples are described in terms of copper etch processes with chlorine based etchants, the present invention is not limited to copper etches. By way of example a platinum material could be etched by chlorine and carbon monoxide gases. Other etchant species can include HBr, HI, BCl<sub>3 </sub>and CF<sub>4</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">In an alternative embodiment, the chamber <b>100</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> can also be used to perform chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In a CVD operation, the chuck <b>102</b> may be cooled heated so that the vapor species will deposit on the substrate <b>108</b> mounted on the chuck <b>102</b>. By way of example, an organic film can be deposited using C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4 </sub>or C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2 </sub>as precursors. In another CVD embodiment, a copper film can be deposited either thermally or using plasma assistance on the substrate <b>108</b> and inner surfaces. After the substrate <b>108</b> is removed from the processing chamber, the copper film on hot inner surface can be cleaned using a chlorine or a bromine containing etchant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">The plasma chamber <b>100</b> can be used to perform a stress free planarization as described in co-owned and co-pending U.S. patent application Ser.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">Typical etch processes etch the overburden portion <b>212</b> of the conductive interconnect material <b>220</b> at a fairly uniform rate over the entire wafer area and therefore the typical etching process will expose the barrier layer <b>210</b> near the large feature <b>202</b> before the barrier layer <b>210</b> near the densely packed features <b>206</b> will be exposed. In sum, the typical etching process cannot planarize the overburden portion <b>212</b> of the conductive interconnect material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows an additional layer <b>222</b> added in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The additional layer <b>222</b> is formed on top of the overburden portion <b>212</b>. The additional layer <b>222</b> can be a substantially planar fill material (e.g., spin on glass (SOG), polysilicon, polymer resist, bilayer, UV or thermally curable material, or other material that can flow to form a planar surface and which has the appropriate etching characteristics). An optional, relatively thin (e.g., about 25–100 nm in thickness) conformal layer <b>224</b> may also be included between the additional layer <b>222</b> and the overburden portion <b>212</b>. The conformal layer <b>224</b> can be a barrier layer or an adhesion layer. The conformal layer <b>224</b> can allow a wider variety of materials that can be used for the additional layer <b>222</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">The additional layer <b>222</b> and the overburden portion <b>212</b> have a substantially 1:1 etch selectivity so that a subsequent etching process (e.g., plasma or gaseous etch process) can etch both the additional layer <b>222</b> and the overburden portion <b>212</b> at substantially the same rate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a substantially planar overburden portion <b>212</b>′ in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Because the additional layer <b>202</b> forms a substantially planar surface over the stack of layers <b>200</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>222</b>, a first etching process can uniformly etch the additional layer <b>222</b> and the overburden <b>212</b> over the entire area until the remaining overburden portion <b>212</b>′ is substantially locally planar in that the local variations <b>214</b>, <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> are substantially eliminated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">A typical recipe would involve conditions that provide a 1:1 etch selectivity between the additional layer <b>222</b> and the overburden portion <b>212</b>. By way of example, if the additional layer <b>222</b> is SOG, and the overburden portion <b>212</b> is copper, then a halogen (e.g., Cl, F, Br, I) based chemistry provides etch rate control for both the SOG as well as copper to allow for tuning for the desired 1:1 selectivity. Although any plasma feed gas producing reactive halogen radicals can be used, CF4, C12, and HCl are typical examples. Various process parameters can be adjusted to control etch rates, selectivity, uniformity and reduce corrosion include variation of process variables such as substrate temperature and inclusion of one or more additives (e.g., Ar, H2, Cl, O2, CH3X (X=F, Cl, Br, I), CH2F2, and CH4).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">Another approach involves a sputter dominant etch with Ar or other inert gas such as He, Xe, Ne, Kr, as the primary etchant of the copper overburden portion <b>212</b> with other additives to provide etch rate control of the additional layer <b>222</b> and passivation of the top surface of the remaining copper <b>212</b>. The other additives can include, for example H2 and/or CF4. Either of these processes is can operate over a wide temperature range of between about 75 degrees C. and about 400 degrees C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067">The first etching process is an etch process designed to leave the remaining overburden portion <b>212</b>′ substantially locally planar in that the local variations <b>214</b>, <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> are substantially eliminated. One or more subsequent etching processes will remove the bulk or the majority of the overburden portion <b>212</b>′. A finish etching process can be applied to continue the etching process to an endpoint at which the overburden portion <b>212</b>′ is removed from the barrier <b>210</b>. The finish etching process can also be included in the bulk etch process. Subsequent processes after the finish etch can include selective barrier removal and passivating the remaining conductive material <b>220</b> to prevent corrosion and provide stability for further processing. An additional operation after the finish etch can be designed not to significantly remove any material but only passivate the remaining conductive material <b>220</b> to prevent corrosion and provide stability for further processing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> shows the substrate <b>200</b> having undergone a second etching process in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The second etching process continues to an endpoint such that the barrier layer <b>210</b> will be exposed at all locations substantially simultaneously and leaving only the portion <b>220</b> of the conductive material (e.g., copper, copper-containing alloys and combinations, and other conductive material) that fills the features <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">The first etching process and the second etching process can be substantially similar or significantly different. By way of example, the first etching process can be an etching process for improving the local planarity of the overburden portion <b>212</b> due to local non-uniformities <b>214</b>, <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> (e.g., caused by feature <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> locations, sizes and concentrations in underlying layers). The entire additional layer <b>222</b> and a portion of the overburden portion <b>212</b> can be removed in the first etching process. By comparison, the second etching process can be a much more selective etching process that removes the bulk of the remaining, planar overburden <b>212</b>′ to the endpoint (i.e., when the barrier layer <b>210</b> is exposed).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0070"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> shows the substrate having undergone a barrier removal process in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. A portion of the barrier layer <b>210</b> is removed to expose an underlying mask layer <b>402</b>. Only the portion of the barrier layer <b>210</b> that is formed within the features <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> remain. A typical second etching process removes the bulk portion of the overburden <b>212</b> at high rate and preferably with a high selectivity to the barrier layer <b>210</b>. By way of example, if the overburden portion <b>212</b> is copper, a halogen—based chemistry (e.g., Cl2, CF4, HCl, HBr, BCl3) can be effectively used for the second etching process. In another approach a physically dominant etch process such as an Ar (or other noble or inert gas) based sputter process can be used. Various process parameters can be adjusted to control etch rates and selectivity. The various process parameters can include adjusting process variables such as substrate temperature balance of reactive species, and inclusion of one or more additives (e.g., H2, O2, Ar, He, Xe, Ne, Kr, etc.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flowchart <b>500</b> of the method operations of performing a local planarization, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. In operation <b>505</b>, the additional layer <b>222</b> is added on top of the conductive overburden portion <b>212</b>. In operation <b>510</b>, the first etch process is applied to remove the majority of the additional layer <b>222</b> and the conductive overburden portion <b>212</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0072">In an alternative embodiment, operation <b>515</b> can also include a finish etch process as described above. Subsequent processes after the finish etch can include selective barrier removal and passivating the remaining conductive material <b>120</b> to prevent corrosion and provide stability for further processing. An additional operation after the finish etch process can be designed not to significantly remove any material but only passivate the remaining conductive material <b>220</b> to prevent corrosion and provide stability for further processing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0073"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A–6D</figref> show a sequence of chemical conversion and etch-back processes applied to a substrate <b>600</b> to increase local uniformity, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flowchart <b>700</b> of the method operations of the chemical conversion and etch-back processes applied to a substrate <b>600</b> to increase local uniformity, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the substrate <b>600</b> has a substantially non-planar overburden portion <b>602</b> with non-planar surface profile <b>606</b>, similar to the substrate <b>100</b> described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0074">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6B and 7</figref>, in operation <b>705</b>, an additional layer <b>604</b> is formed on top of the overburden portion <b>602</b>. The additional layer <b>604</b> may be deposited or formed on the overburden portion <b>602</b>. By way of example, the additional layer <b>604</b> can be formed through a chemical conversion of a top-most portion of the overburden portion <b>602</b>. If the overburden portion <b>602</b> is copper or copper alloy, then a controlled exposure to a gas can form a copper reaction product layer <b>604</b>. One example is a halogen gas that can form a Cu-halide layer <b>604</b>. The copper reactant layer <b>604</b> diffuses into the surface of the copper overburden <b>602</b> to convert a top portion of the copper overburden <b>602</b>. Processes for chemical conversion of copper are known in the art, such as Nagraj S. Kulkarni and Robert T. DeHoff, “Application of Volatility Diagrams for Low Temperature, Dry Etching, and Planarization of Copper”, Journal of Electrochemical Society, 149 (11) G620–G632, 2002.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0075">In another example, the additional layer <b>604</b> can be deposited on the overburden portion <b>602</b>. The deposited layer <b>604</b> can include a polymer layer or an oxide layer being deposited on the overburden portion <b>602</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0076">Referring now to operation <b>710</b> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, an etch-back process is applied to remove the additional layer <b>604</b>. A portion of the overburden portion <b>602</b> may also be removed. Removing the additional layer <b>604</b> results in further softening (i.e., planarizing) of the profile of the overburden portion <b>602</b> to profile <b>606</b>′. The Cu-halide substantially softens the contours of the overburden portion <b>602</b>. A Cu-halide can also maintain a substantially 1:1 etch-back selectivity with the copper overburden portion <b>602</b>. Operations <b>705</b> and <b>710</b> can be repeated multiple times to substantially planarize the overburden portion <b>602</b> to subsequent profiles <b>606</b>′ and <b>606</b>″, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>, until the resulting profile is substantially planar.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0077">Chemical conversion of copper overburden portion <b>602</b> utilizing shape dependence of compound formation can be typically achieved by oxidizing the copper at the Cu-reactive species interface. Copper oxidization in this instance can include a chemical conversion of elemental copper to a copper compound with copper in a positive oxidation state. By way of example, oxidation of the copper to cuprous- or cupric chloride (CuCl or CuCl2) at the surface can occur in a chlorine plasma at lower temperatures (e.g.,&lt;200 degrees C.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0078">The etch-back process involves reduction of this copper compound to another chemical compound capable of being volatile and thus leaving the surface of the remaining overburden <b>602</b>′ at the fixed substrate temperature. By way of example, there can be a reduction of the CuCl2 to volatile Cu3Cl3 in the presence of reactive hydrogen species (e.g., H2 plasma). Alternating the shape-dependent conversion followed by etch-back of the converted portion can lead to bulk removal of the copper overburden portion <b>602</b>, while simultaneously planarizing the topography (e.g., profile) of the copper overburden <b>602</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0079">In operation <b>715</b>, if the overburden portion <b>602</b> is substantially planarized, then the method operations end. Alternatively, if in operation <b>715</b>, the overburden portion <b>602</b> is not substantially planarized, then the method operations continue at operation <b>705</b> above. In one embodiment, operations <b>705</b>–<b>715</b> can occur in situ within a single etch chamber. In an alternative embodiment, operation <b>710</b> can occur ex situ and can include ECD or low-down force CMP processes to achieve the substantially planar overburden portion <b>602</b>′ as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0080">The method operations described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A–7</figref> can be used as a planar bulk removal process that performs both planarization of the non-planar overburden portion <b>602</b> and removal of the bulk of the overburden portion <b>602</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0081">The local planarization of the substrates <b>200</b>, <b>600</b> can be determined through any one or more of several known layer thickness mapping technologies that are known in the art. By way of example, an eddy current sensor can map the thickness of the overburden portion <b>212</b>, <b>212</b>′ as described in commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/328,912 entitled System, Method And Apparatus For Thin-Film Substrate Signal Separation Using Eddy Current by Gotkis et al., filed on Dec. 23, 2002 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/251,033 entitled System And Method For Metal Residue Detection And Mapping Within A Multi-Step Sequence by Gotkis et al., filed on Sep. 19, 2002, which are incorporated by reference herein, in their entirety.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0082">The methods and systems described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A–7</figref> above describe various approaches to substantially eliminating local, pattern dependant non-uniformities in an overburden portion. However, methods and systems described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A–7</figref> above do not directly address correction of global non-uniformities. Global non-uniformities can include variations in removal rates of material in the center of the substrate as compared to the edge of the substrate and other non-uniformities that are not localized phenomena.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0083"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flowchart of the method operation <b>800</b> of correcting global non-uniformities in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. In operation <b>805</b>, a substrate having localized non-uniformities such as feature-pattern dependant non-uniformities in the overburden portion is received. In operation <b>810</b>, the localized non-uniformities are substantially eliminated such as through CMP, ECP or the methods and systems described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A–7</figref> above or any other method known in the art. Substantially removing the localized non-uniformities forms a substantially, locally planarized overburden portion such as the planarized overburden portion <b>212</b>′ shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0084"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a substantially removed, planarized overburden portion <b>902</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The substantially removed, planarized overburden portion <b>902</b> can be a relatively thin overburden portion such as a few hundred angstroms in thickness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0085">In operation <b>815</b>, the substrate with the planarized overburden portion is mapped to identify and quantify any global non-uniformities in the planarized overburden portion. The planarized overburden portion can be mapped with any one or more of several known layer thickness mapping technologies that are known in the art as described above. The mapping can be in situ (within the current process chamber) or ex situ (external to the current process chamber). An in situ mapping process can also be dynamic and allow for the subsequent processes to be dynamically adjusted as the subsequent processes progress.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0086">In operation <b>820</b>, the location and quantity of the global non-uniformities, as determined in operation <b>815</b> above, are removed in a substantially mechanical stress-free process by adjusting an etching process to address the specific requirements of the detected global non-uniformities in a finish etch process. By way of example, if the remaining overburden portion <b>902</b> were approximately 500 angstroms thick in the center and 300 angstroms thick on the edge, then the recipe can be adjusted such that the center to edge non-uniformity can be compensated for so that the entire barrier layer <b>210</b> will be exposed simultaneously. The stress-free process avoids the CMP problems described above because no mechanical force is applied to the substrate during the etch-back process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0087">The recipe (e.g., selected values of process variables) that is selected is selective to barrier layer <b>210</b> (i.e., will etch the barrier at a much slower rate than the recipe will etch the copper, e.g., a typical selectivity range of copper etch over barrier etch in these processes is greater than about 1 but less than about 3) and that will minimize any recesses (e.g., excess removal of the conductive material <b>120</b> in the features <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0088">The finish etch can have relatively slow etch rates for both copper of the remaining overburden portion <b>902</b> and the barrier layer <b>210</b> to minimize any recess into the features <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> with respect to the remaining height barrier of the barrier layer <b>210</b>. As a result, the finish etch cannot have a very high selectivity to etch the copper.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0089">A final etch-back process can also be included. The final etch-back process includes etch-back of the mask material and/or the ILD material with appropriate selectivity and uniformity control such that the final outcome provides substantially globally uniform and substantially planar features with minimal copper and IL loss (e.g., any copper recess is globally uniform across the substrate <b>200</b> at the end of the final etch and barrier removal processes). In this instance, the final etch would include a uniform process to etch-back the mask material with high selectivity to minimize copper loss and minimize the copper recess. By way of example, a halogen-based process where the halogen concentration is low and the substrate temperature is low (e.g., less than about 200 degrees C.) will maintain a low copper etch rate while still sufficiently chemically etching the mask material. Any plasma feed gas including halogen reactive species (e.g., CF4, C2F6, C4F6) can be used. Etch rate control additives can include Ar, O2, CH2F2 and others can also be included.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0090">If the global copper recess and/or mask/ILD loss are non-uniform across the substrate at the end of the finish etch and final etch-back process, then additional variations in the recipe must be taken to correct for the global non-uniformities. By way of example, typical instances are a result of etch non-uniformity are described as center fast or edge fast etch rates. In either of these instances, can result in a variation in copper recess and/or mask/ILD loss across the substrate. Compensation can be achieved to counter this variation to obtain globally planar features with minimal copper and mask loss utilizing appropriate uniformity and selectivity controls during the final etch-back of the mask/ILD material. In the instance of a center-fast finish etch process resulting in larger copper recess in the center of the substrate can be compensated for by an edge-fast final etch back process which selectively etches the mask material to bring to the same level as the copper level in the features <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>. Typical selectivity obtained in this process is greater than about 2. Variations of the recipe to provide for uniformity control include pressure, temperature variation across substrate, ion flux uniformity controls, gas concentrations and chamber wall temperature. Variations to control selectivity include reactive halogen species concentration, substrate temperature, and bias power.</div>
