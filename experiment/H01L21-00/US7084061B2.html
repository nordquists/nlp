<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The present invention relates to methods of fabricating a semiconductor device and, more particularly, to methods of fabricating a semiconductor device including a metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) transistor with a strained channel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">2. Description of Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">MOS transistors are widely employed as switching devices of semiconductor devices. Accordingly, fabrication of high performance MOS transistors is required in order to improve characteristics of the semiconductor devices. A salicide technique is widely used in fabrication of the high performance MOS transistors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">According to the salicide technique, a metal silicide layer is selectively formed on a gate electrode and source/drain region of a MOS transistor. Thus, it can substantially reduce electrical resistivity of the gate electrode and source/drain regions. A cobalt silicide layer or a titanium silicide layer is widely used as the metal silicide layer. In particular, the cobalt silicide layer exhibits low dependence of resistivity on its line width. Accordingly, the cobalt silicide layer has been widely used in fabrication of a gate electrode of a short channel MOS transistor. However, in the event that the gate electrode has a narrow width less than about 0.1 μm, there is a limitation in applying the cobalt silicide layer to the gate electrode because of the phenomenon called “agglomeration”. Thus, recently, a nickel salicide technique is widely used in fabrication of high performance MOS transistors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">A nickel silicide layer formed using the nickel salicide technique may have various composition ratios. For example, the nickel silicide layer may be a di-nickel mono-silicide (Ni<sub>2</sub>Si) layer, a mono-nickel mono-silicide (NiSi) layer, or a mono-nickel di-silicide (NiSi<sub>2</sub>) layer. The mono-nickel mono-silicide (NiSi) layer has the lowest resistivity out of the various nickel silicide layers. The mono-nickel mono-silicide layer is formed at a low temperature of 350–550° C., whereas the mono-nickel di-silicide layer is formed at a higher temperature than 550° C. Accordingly, the nickel silicide layer should be formed at a low temperature below 550° C. to have a low resistivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">There is an alternative approach to achieve the high performance MOS transistors. That is, a method of forming a strained channel has been proposed in order to improve performance of the MOS transistors. The strained channel has a greater lattice constant than silicon. Accordingly, mobility of carriers in the strained channel is increased, thereby improving a switching speed of the MOS transistor. The methods of forming the strained channel are taught in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,358,806 B1 and 5,683,934. According to the U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,358,806 B1 and 5,683,934, the strained channel is formed using a silicon carbide layer and/or an epitaxial growing technique. However, highly precise, accurate and complicated processes are required in order to employ the silicon carbide layer and the epitaxial growing technique.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">In the meantime, methods of forming a borderless contact are taught in U.S. Pat. No. 6,265,271 B1 to Thei et al. According to Thei et al., an etch stop layer is formed on an entire surface of a semiconductor substrate having a MOS transistor fabricated using a salicide technique. The substrate having the etch stop layer is annealed to densify the etch stop layer. The annealing process is performed at a temperature within the range of 850–900° C. In this case, the annealing process is performed in order to obtain a phase transformation of cobalt mono-silicide layers or titanium mono-silicide layers formed on the gate electrodes and source/drain regions of the MOS transistors as well as to densify the etch stop layer. The cobalt mono-silicide layer (or the titanium mono-silicide layer) exhibits a relatively high resistivity as compared to a cobalt di-silicide layer (or a titanium di-silicide layer). Thus, the annealing process is performed in order to convert the cobalt mono-silicide layers (or the titanium mono-silicide layers) into the cobalt di-silicide layers (or the titanium di-silicide layers).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">However, if the above salicide technique corresponds to a nickel salicide technique, the annealing process performed at the high temperature of 850–900° C. increases electrical resistance of nickel silicide layers formed on gate electrodes and source/drain regions of MOS transistors. Accordingly, the characteristics of the MOS transistors are degraded.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">Further, methods of fabricating a semiconductor device having low hydrogen content and low physical stress are taught in U.S. Pat. No. 6,071,784 to Mehta et al. According to Mehta et al., an etching stop layer is formed on a semiconductor substrate including MOS transistors. The etching stop layer is subjected to a heat treatment at a temperature of 725–775° C. to decrease hydrogen content therein. As a result, it is possible to stabilize the threshold characteristic of the MOS transistors. However, in the event that the MOS transistors are fabricated using a nickel salicide technique, the heat treatment of the etching stop layer causes phase transformation of nickel silicide layers formed by the nickel salicide technique. This is due to the high annealing temperature of 725–775° C. Thus, switching operations of the MOS transistors may be degraded.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">In conclusion, methods of fabricating a MOS transistor using a nickel salicide technique should be carefully optimized.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">In one embodiment, the stress layer is formed to a thickenss of 50–2000 Å.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">In one embodiment, annealing the stress layer is performed at a temperature of 400–550 Å. Annealing the stress layer can be performed using a nitrogen gas as an ambient gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">In another aspect, the invention is directed to another method of fabricating a semiconductor device.

N-type impurity ions are implanted into the active region using the gate electrode and the spacers as ion implantation masks to form an N-type source region and an N-type drain region at both sides of the gate electrode. A nickel silicide layer is formed on the gate electrode, the source region and the drain region using a nickel salicide technique. A stress layer is formed on a surface of the semiconductor substrate having the nickel silicide layer. The stress layer is annealed to convert its physical stress into a tensile stress or increase a tensile thereof. An interlayer insulating layer is then formed on the annealed stress layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">In one embodiment, N-type impurity ions are implanted into the active region using the gate electrode and the isolation layer as ion implantation masks to form N-type LDD regions prior to formation of the spacers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">In one embodiment, the nickel silicide layer is a pure nickel silicide layer or a nickel alloy silicide layer. The nickel alloy silicide layer can contain at least one material selected from the group consisting of tantalum (Ta), zirconium (Zr), titanium (Ti), hafnium (Hf), tungsten (W), cobalt (Co), platinum (Pt), molybdenum (Mo), palladium (Pd), vanadium (V) and niobium (Nb).</div>

As a result, an NMOS transistor is formed at the semiconductor substrate. In addition, a PMOS transistor may be formed at another active region adjacent to the active region. Nickel suicide layers are formed on the gate electrodes and the source/drain regions of the NMOS and PMOS transistors using a salicide technique. A stress layer is formed on a surface of the semiconductor substrate having the nickel silicide layers, and a lower interlayer insulating layer is formed on the stress layer.

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">The present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which exemplary embodiments of the invention are shown. In the drawings, the thickness of the layers and regions are exaggerated for clarity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a process flow chart showing methods of fabricating a semiconductor device in accordance with embodiments of the present invention, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 7</figref> are cross-sectional views illustrating methods of fabricating a semiconductor device according to embodiments of the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, an isolation layer <b>53</b> is formed at a predetermined region of a semiconductor substrate <b>51</b> to define an active region. A gate insulation layer <b>55</b> is formed on the active region (Step <b>1</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). A gate conductive layer is formed on an entire surface of the semiconductor substrate having the gate insulation layer <b>55</b>. The gate conductive layer may be formed of a silicon layer doped with N-type impurities. The gate conductive layer is patterned to form a gate pattern <b>57</b> (i.e., a gate electrode) on a predetermined region of the gate insulation layer <b>55</b> (Step <b>3</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The gate pattern <b>57</b> is formed to cross over the active region. First impurity ions are implanted into the active region using the gate pattern <b>57</b> and the isolation layer <b>53</b> as ion implantation masks to form lightly doped drain (LDD) regions <b>59</b> (Step <b>5</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The first impurity ions may be N-type impurity ions such as arsenic ions or phosphorus ions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, an insulating spacer layer is formed on the semiconductor substrate having the LDD regions <b>59</b>. The spacer layer may be formed of a silicon oxide layer, a silicon nitride layer or a combination layer thereof. The spacer layer is unisotropically etched to form spacers <b>61</b> on sidewalls of the gate pattern <b>57</b> (Step <b>7</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Second impurity ions are then implanted into the active region using the gate pattern <b>57</b>, the spacers <b>61</b> and the isolation layer <b>53</b> as ion implantation masks, thereby forming source/drain regions <b>63</b> (Step <b>9</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). As a result, the LDD regions <b>59</b> remain beneath the spacers <b>61</b>. The first impurity ions are the same conductivity type as the second impurity ions. That is, in the event that the first impurity ions are N-type impurity ions, the second impurity ions are also N-type impurity ions. The second impurity ions in the source/drain regions <b>63</b> are then annealed to form activated source/drain regions (Step <b>11</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The annealing process of the second impurity ions may be performed using a rapid thermal process (RTP) at a temperature of about 830–1150° C. The gate electrode <b>57</b> and the source/drain regions <b>63</b> constitute a MOS transistor. In the event that the source/drain regions <b>63</b> are N-type, the MOS transistor is an NMOS transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>, a salicide process, e.g., a nickel salicide process, is applied to the semiconductor substrate having the activated source/drain regions (Step <b>13</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In more detail, the semiconductor substrate having the activated source/drain regions <b>63</b> is cleaned to remove a native oxide layer and contaminated particles on the surfaces of the gate pattern <b>57</b> and the activated source/drain regions <b>63</b>, and a nickel layer is formed on the cleaned semiconductor substrate. The nickel layer may be formed of a pure nickel layer or a nickel alloy layer. The nickel alloy layer may contain at least one material selected from the group consisting of tantalum (Ta), zirconium (Zr), titanium (Ti), hafnium (Hf), tungsten (W), cobalt (Co), platinum (Pt), molybdenum (Mo), palladium (Pd), vanadium (V) and niobium (Nb).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">Subsequently, the semiconductor substrate having the nickel layer is annealed at a temperature of about 350–550° C. As a result, the nickel layer reacts with silicon atoms in the gate pattern <b>57</b> and the source/drain regions <b>63</b>, thereby forming a first nickel mono-silicide (NiSi) layer <b>65</b> <i>a </i>and second nickel mono-silicide (NiSi) layers <b>65</b> <i>b </i>on the gate pattern <b>57</b> and the source/drain regions <b>63</b>, respectively. If the silicidation temperature is higher than 550° C., nickel di-silicide (NiSi<sub>2</sub>) layers having high resistance are formed instead of the nickel mono-silicide (NiSi) layers. Accordingly, the annealing process, e.g., the silicidation process, is preferably performed at a low temperature within the range of about 350–550° C. Unreacted nickel layers on the spacers <b>61</b> and the isolation layer <b>53</b> are then removed to electrically disconnect the first nickel mono-silicide layer <b>65</b> <i>a </i>from the second nickel mono-silicide layers <b>65</b> <i>b</i>. The unreacted nickel layers may be removed using a mixture of sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) solution and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) solution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</figref>, a stress layer <b>67</b> is formed on the semiconductor substrate where the unreacted nickel layers are removed (Step <b>15</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The stress layer <b>67</b> may be formed of at least one layer selected from the group consisting of a silicon nitride (SiN) layer, a silicon oxynitride (SiON) layer, a low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) oxide layer, an atomic layer deposition (ALD) oxide layer and a spin on glass (SOG) layer. In this case, the stress layer <b>67</b> is preferably formed to a thickness of about 50–2000 Å. In addition, the stress layer <b>67</b> is preferably formed at a temperature lower than 550° C. to prevent phase transformation of the nickel mono-silicide layers <b>65</b> <i>a </i>and <b>65</b> <i>b</i>. Accordingly, the silicon nitride layer or the silicon oxynitride layer is preferably formed using a plasma CVD process or an ALD process at a low temperature below 550° C. Also, the LPCVD oxide layer is preferably formed using a low temperature oxide (LTO) layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">Subsequently, a lower interlayer insulating layer <b>69</b> is formed on the stress layer <b>67</b> (Step <b>17</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The lower interlayer insulating layer <b>69</b> may be formed of a silicon oxide layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">In the meantime, if both a PMOS transistor and a NMOS transistor are formed at the semiconductor substrate <b>51</b>, the lower interlayer insulating layer <b>69</b> is preferably patterned to selectively expose the stress layer <b>67</b> in the NMOS transistor region (Step <b>19</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In this case, the stress layer <b>67</b> in the PMOS transistor region is preferably covered with the patterned lower interlayer insulating layer <b>69</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">The semiconductor substrate having the patterned lower interlayer insulating layer <b>69</b> is annealed to convert a physical stress of the exposed stress layer <b>67</b> into a tensile stress or to increase a tensile stress of the exposed stress layer <b>67</b> (Step <b>21</b> of FIG. <b>1</b>)., For example, in the event that the initial stress layer <b>67</b> has a weak tensile stress, the annealing process enhances the weak tensile stress of the initial stress layer <b>67</b>. In this case, a strong compressive stress is applied to the source/drain regions <b>63</b> that are in contact with the stress layer <b>67</b>, as indicated by the arrows “M” of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. As a result, a tensile stress is relatively applied to the channel region between the source/drain regions <b>63</b>, as represented by the arrow “N” of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. That is, the channel region is converted to a strained channel, thereby to have an increased lattice constant. Thus, when an inversion channel is formed in the channel region, mobility of carriers (for example, free electrons) in the inversion channel is increased to improve the switching characteristic of the MOS transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">Also, the annealing process of the stress layer <b>67</b> is preferably performed at a temperature within the range of about 400–550° C. to prevent phase transformation of the nickel mono-silicide layers <b>65</b> <i>a </i>and <b>65</b> <i>b</i>. The annealing process of the stress layer <b>67</b> may be performed using a nitrogen gas as an ambient gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 6</figref>, an upper interlayer insulating layer <b>71</b> is formed on an entire surface of the semiconductor substrate having the annealed stress layer <b>67</b> (Step <b>23</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The upper interlayer insulating layer <b>71</b> may be formed of the same material as the lower interlayer insulating layer <b>69</b>. The upper interlayer insulating layer <b>71</b> may be planarized using a planarization technique such as a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">In the event that only NMOS transistors are formed at the semiconductor substrate <b>51</b>, the process for forming the lower interlayer insulating layer <b>69</b> may be skipped.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 7</figref>, the interlayer insulating layers <b>69</b> and <b>71</b> and the annealed stress layer <b>67</b> are patterned to form contact holes that expose the second nickel mono-silicide layers <b>65</b> <i>b</i>. The first nickel mono-silicide layer <b>65</b> <i>a </i>may also be exposed during the formation of the contact holes. In the event that the stress layer <b>67</b> is formed of a silicon nitride layer or a silicon oxynitride layer, the stress layer <b>67</b> may act as an etching stop layer during the formation of the contact hole.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0076">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, even though the annealing process was performed after sequentially forming the stress layer and the interlayer insulating layer, the drain saturation current I<sub>dsat </sub>of the annealed NMOS transistors was not increased. Therefore, it can be understood that a physical stress of the stress layer does not change if the annealing process is performed after formation of the interlayer insulating layer. Accordingly, to achieve the feature of the present invention, the annealing process of the stress layer should be performed after exposing the stress layer or before forming the interlayer insulating layer in order to obtain the strained channel.</div>
