<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">The present invention relates in general to integrated circuit packaging and more particularly to a process for fabricating an improved integrated circuit package.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">According to well known prior art IC (integrated circuit) packaging methodologies, semiconductor dice are singulated and mounted using epoxy or other conventional means onto respective die attach pads (attach paddles) of a leadframe strip. Traditional QFP (Quad Flat Pack) packages incorporate inner leads which function as lands for wire bonding the semiconductor die bond pads. These inner leads typically require mold locking features to ensure proper positioning of the leadframe strip during subsequent molding to encapsulate the package. The inner leads terminate in outer leads that are bent down to contact a mother board, thereby limiting the packaging density of such prior art devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">In order to overcome these and other disadvantages of the prior art, the Applicants previously developed a Leadless Plastic Chip Carrier (LPCC). According to Applicants' LPCC methodology, a leadframe strip is provided for supporting several hundred devices. Singulated IC dice are placed on the strip die attach pads using conventional die mount and epoxy techniques. After curing of the epoxy, the dice are wire bonded to the peripheral internal leads by gold (Au), copper (Cu), aluminum (Al) or doped aluminum wire bonding. The leadframe strip is then molded in plastic or resin using a modified mold wherein the bottom cavity is a flat plate. In the resulting molded package, the die pad and leadframe inner leads are exposed. By exposing the bottom of the die attach pad, mold delamination at the bottom of the die pad is eliminated, thereby increasing the moisture sensitivity performance. Also, thermal performance of the IC package is improved by providing a direct thermal path from the exposed die attach pad to the motherboard. By exposing the leadframe inner leads, the requirement for mold locking features is eliminated and no external lead standoff is necessary, thereby increasing device density and reducing package thickness over prior art methodologies. The exposed inner leadframe leads function as solder pads for motherboard assembly such that less gold wire bonding is required as compared to prior art methodologies, thereby improving electrical performance in terms of board level parasitics and enhancing package design flexibility over prior art packages (i.e. custom trim tools and form tools are not required). These and several other advantages of Applicants' own prior art LPCC process are discussed in Applicants' U.S. Pat. No. 6,229,200, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">In applicant's own U.S. Pat. No. 6,585,905, issued Jul. 1, 2003 and incorporated herein by reference, a process is provided for fabricating a leadless plastic chip carrier in which the semiconductor die sits in a portion of the die attach pad that is reduced in thickness. The leadframe strip is selectively etched to define a pattern for the die attach pad and the contact pads such that a portion of the die attach pad has reduced thickness compared to the thickness of the contact pads. The semiconductor die is mounted in the portion of the die attach pad with reduced thickness, followed by wire bonding and overmolding. This structure provides for several advantages. For example, the package profile can be reduced and the length of the wire bonds from the semiconductor die to the die attach pad and to the contact pads is reduced, thereby reducing electrical impedance in the package. Also, the three-dimensional nature of the die attach pad provides additional exposed metal for adhering to the molding compound, thereby providing a more robust package.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Still further improvements in high performance integrated circuit (IC) packages are driven by industry demands for increased thermal and electrical performance, decreased size and cost of manufacture.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a process for fabricating an integrated circuit package. The process includes: selectively etching a leadframe strip to define a die attach pad and at least one row of contact pads; mounting a semiconductor die to one side of the leadframe strip, on the die attach pad; wire bonding the semiconductor die to ones of the contact pads; releasably clamping the leadframe strip in a mold by releasably clamping the contact pads; molding in a molding compound to cover the semiconductor die, the wire bonds and a portion of the contact pads not covered by the clamping; releasing the leadframe strip from the mold; depositing a plurality of external contacts in the form of solder ball contacts, on the one side of the leadframe strip, on the contact pads, such that the external contacts protrude from the molding compound; and singulating to provide the integrated circuit package.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a integrated circuit package including a semiconductor die mounted to a die attach pad and at least one row of contact pads circumscribing the die attach pad. Wire bonds connect the semiconductor die to ones of the contact pads. A molding compound covers one side of the semiconductor die, the wire bonds and a portion of one side of the contact pads such that a remaining portion of the one side of the contact pads is uncovered and an opposing side of the contact pads is uncovered. External contacts are disposed on the one side of the contact pads, at the uncovered remaining portion, such that the external contacts protrude from the molding compound.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">Advantageously, the integrated circuit package of the present invention provides for connection to a motherboard through the external contacts that protrude from the molding compound. The contact pads and the die attach pad are exposed on an opposing side of the package to allow heat dissipation from the package, from a side of the package that is opposite the side that faces the motherboard after assembly. Thus, heat is dissipated away from the motherboard. Also, air flow over the top of the package provides additional heat dissipation from the exposed side of the die attach pad.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">In a particular aspect, the external contacts are solder balls that provide package standoff from the motherboard after assembly. This improves thermal characteristics of the package as thermal cycling of the package is less likely to cause fatigue failure of solder joints to the motherboard. Also, the solder balls facilitize reworking of the motherboard assembly by allowing for package removal and replacement or re-attachment to the motherboard without the addition of further solder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">During fabrication, the leadframe strip is releasably clamped in a mold by releasably clamping the contact pads, followed by molding in the molding compound. Thus, during molding, the contact pads are protected from mold flash contamination, a significant problem in prior art packages. This obviates the need for the use of deflash tape that is placed on the strip before molding to reduce the occurrence of mold flash contamination, thereby reducing manufacturing cost. Also, the need for deflash abrasion of the package is obviated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">In a particular embodiment, the die sits in a portion of the die attach pad that is reduced in thickness and therefore the length of the wire bonds can be reduced. Also, the wire bonds are lower in the profile of the package, which allows for reduction of the integrated circuit package profile.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">Also, the profile of the mold used in molding the package varies. Thus, the thickness of the molding compound is not uniform in the resulting package. Also, the molding compound is not continuous. The molding compound is broken up by the contact pads, where molding compound flows between but does not cover portions of the contact pads. This reduces the stress caused by mismatch in the coefficients of thermal expansion between the molding compound and the leadframe, in comparison with prior art packages.</div>

<heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">The invention will be better understood with reference to the drawings and to the following detailed description in which like numerals denote like parts, and in which:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1J</figref> show processing steps for fabricating a integrated circuit package (LPCC) according to an embodiment of the present invention.</div>
</description-of-drawings>
<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">Reference is made to the Figures to describe a process for fabricating an integrated circuit package according to an embodiment of the present invention. The integrated circuit package is indicated generally by the numeral <b>18</b> and includes a semiconductor die <b>22</b> mounted to a die attach pad <b>24</b> and at least one row of contact pads <b>26</b> circumscribing the die attach pad <b>24</b>. Wire bonds <b>28</b> are then bonded to connect the semiconductor die <b>22</b> to ones of the contact pads <b>26</b>. A molding compound <b>30</b> covers one side of the semiconductor die <b>22</b>, the wire bonds <b>28</b> and a portion <b>32</b> of one side of the contact pads <b>26</b> such that a remaining portion <b>34</b> of the one side of the contact pads <b>26</b> is uncovered and an opposing side of the contact pads <b>26</b> is uncovered. External contacts <b>36</b> are disposed on the one side of the contact pads <b>26</b>, at the uncovered remaining portion <b>34</b>, such that the external contacts <b>36</b> protrude from the molding compound <b>30</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">The integrated circuit package <b>18</b> will now be described in more detail with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1J</figref>, which show process steps for fabricating the integrated circuit package <b>18</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. As will be understood by those of skill in the art, the integrated circuit package <b>18</b> of the present invention is a leadless plastic chip carrier.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">Referring first to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, an elevation view is provided of a Cu (copper) panel substrate that forms the raw material of the leadframe strip <b>20</b>. As discussed in detail in Applicant's U.S. Pat. No. 6,229,200, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference, the leadframe strip <b>20</b> is divided into a plurality of sections, each of which incorporates a plurality of units in an array (e.g. 3×3 array, 5×5 array, etc.). Only one such whole unit is depicted in the elevation view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, portions of adjacent units being represented by stippled lines. It will be appreciated that adjacent units of the leadframe strip <b>20</b> are similar to the unit depicted in the Figures. It will also be appreciated that although the following description particularly describes a single unit of the leadframe strip <b>20</b>, the integrated circuit package is gang fabricated and each step of the process is carried out for each unit of the leadframe strip.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 1C</figref>, the leadframe strip <b>29</b> is selectively etched to pattern the die attach pad <b>24</b> and contact pads <b>26</b> for each unit. The selective etch is carried out by coating both sides of the leadframe <b>20</b> with a layer of photo-imagable etch resist such as photo-imagable epoxy. The etch resist is spin coated on the leadframe strip <b>20</b> and selectively exposed on sides of the leadframe strip <b>20</b>, with ultraviolet light using a photo-tool. The exposed portions are then removed. As best shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the etch resist is thereby patterned to provided pits on the two sides of the leadframe strip <b>20</b>, in which the metal substrate is exposed. The leadframe strip <b>20</b> is then etched in a conventional manner such as immersion or pressurized spray etching, to thereby pattern the die attach pad <b>24</b> and the contact pads <b>26</b>. The etch resist is then stripped away by conventional means. The resulting leadframe strip <b>20</b> is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 1C</figref>, the etch resist is patterned such that the resulting die attach pad <b>24</b> of the leadframe strip <b>20</b> has a central portion <b>38</b> with a thickness that is less than the thickness of the raw material of the leadframe strip <b>20</b>. The thickness of the resulting central portion <b>38</b> is less than the thickness of the remaining portion <b>34</b> of the contact pads <b>26</b>, on which the external contacts <b>36</b> are later mounted. Clearly the central portion <b>38</b> of the leadframe strip <b>20</b> is appropriately sized and shaped to receive the semiconductor die <b>22</b>. This reduction in thickness of the central portion <b>38</b> of the die attach pad <b>24</b> results in the formation of the ground ring <b>40</b> on the die attach pad <b>24</b>, which circumscribes the central portion <b>38</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">The contact pads <b>26</b> are also etched to provide portions of different thickness. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, the peripheral portions <b>42</b> of the contact pads <b>26</b> are selectively etched such that the peripheral portions <b>42</b> have a thickness that is less than the thickness of the raw material of the leadframe strip <b>20</b>. Clearly the thickness of the peripheral portions <b>42</b> is less than the thickness of the remaining portion <b>34</b> of the contact pads <b>26</b>. This variation in thickness facilitates bonding of the molding compound <b>30</b> with the contact pads <b>26</b> as an interlocking mechanical bond is provided between the molding compound <b>30</b> and the contact pads.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, the singulated semiconductor die <b>22</b> is then mounted via epoxy (or other suitable means) to the central portion <b>38</b> of the die attach pad <b>24</b> and the epoxy is cured. Clearly, the semiconductor die <b>22</b> sits in a cavity in the central portion <b>38</b> on one side of the die attach pad <b>24</b>. Gold wire bonds <b>28</b> are then bonded between the semiconductor die <b>22</b> and ones of the contact pads <b>26</b> and between the semiconductor die <b>22</b> and the ground ring <b>40</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">The leadframe strip <b>20</b> is then releasably clamped in a modified mold by releasably clamping the remaining portion <b>34</b> of the contact pads (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>). Molding using a molding compound <b>30</b> follows (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1G</figref>). The molding compound <b>30</b> covers one side of the semiconductor die <b>22</b>, the wire bonds <b>28</b> and the portion <b>32</b> of the contact pads <b>26</b> that is not covered by the mold during clamping. The opposing second side of the die attach pad <b>24</b> and the contact pads <b>26</b> is exposed. Clearly, the modified mold has a profile defining the bottom of the cavity, that results in varying thickness of the molding compound, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1G</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">After curing the molding compound <b>30</b>, the leadframe strip is released from the mold (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1H</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">Next, a plurality of external contacts <b>36</b> in the form of solder ball contacts are deposited on the exposed remaining portion <b>34</b> on one side of the contact pads <b>26</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). The solder ball contacts are deposited by applying a flux to the exposed remaining portion <b>34</b> on the one side of the contact pads <b>26</b> and after placement of the solder balls by pick and place technique, the solder balls are reflowed using known reflow techniques. As shown, the external contacts (solder balls) <b>36</b> protrude from the mold compound to provide integrated circuit package standoff. The external contacts <b>36</b> are thereby connected to the contact pads <b>26</b> and through the wire bonds <b>28</b> to the semiconductor die <b>22</b>. The external contacts <b>36</b> thus provide signal and power connections for the semiconductor die <b>22</b>. In the present embodiment, the external contacts are tin/lead eutectic solder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">Singulation of the individual units from the full leadframe strip <b>20</b> is then performed by die punching, resulting in the integrated circuit package shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1J</figref>. In an alternative embodiment, the individual unit is singulated by saw singulation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">Specific embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described herein. Modifications and variations to these embodiments may occur to those skilled in the art. For example, the size and shape of many of the elements may differ while still performing the same function. In one alternative embodiment, rather than tin/lead eutectic solder as described above, the external contacts <b>36</b> can be substantially lead-free solder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">Still other modifications and variations may occur to those skilled in the art. All such modifications and variations are believed to be within the sphere and scope of the present invention.</div>
