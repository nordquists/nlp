<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from prior Japanese Patent Application No. 2003-054688, filed Feb. 28, 2003, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device and an apparatus for manufacturing a semiconductor device and, more particularly, to a dicing step and dicing apparatus for forming semiconductor chips by dividing a semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally, a dicing step in the semiconductor device manufacturing process is performed as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B, and <b>1</b>C. That is, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, a semiconductor wafer <b>11</b> in which elements are formed is cut one way along dicing lines <b>12</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>12</b>-<b>2</b>, . . . , by using a diamond blade (rotating blade) <b>13</b>. The wafer <b>11</b> is then rotated 90° and, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, diced again in a direction perpendicular to the former dicing direction. In this manner, the wafer <b>11</b> is divided into individual semiconductor chips <b>14</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>14</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>14</b>-<b>3</b>, . . . .</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">The above dicing step can be performed by either a full-cut method by which the wafer <b>11</b> is completely cut, or a half-cut method by which the wafer <b>11</b> is diced to about ½ the thickness of the wafer <b>11</b> or to a depth with which the wafer <b>11</b> remains by about 30 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">The half-cut method requires a dividing operation after dicing; the wafer <b>11</b> is sandwiched between flexible films or the like and divided by applying an external force by rollers. When an adhesive sheet is adhered before dicing, the wafer <b>11</b> is divided via the sheet by applying an external force by rollers or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0009" num="0008">In a die bonding step, each of the chips <b>14</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>14</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>14</b>-<b>3</b>, . . . , of the divided wafer <b>11</b> is mounted on a lead frame. More specifically, the lower surface of the adhesive sheet of each of the chips <b>14</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>14</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>14</b>-<b>3</b>, . . . , is pushed up by a pickup needle, and the needle is brought into direct contact with the back surface of each chip through the adhesive sheet. Each chip is further raised and removed from the adhesive sheet. The removed chip is conveyed as its upper surface is held by suction by a tool called a collet, and mounted on a die pad of the lead frame.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0010" num="0009">Subsequently, a wire bonding step is performed to electrically connect pads of the chips <b>14</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>14</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>14</b>-<b>3</b>, . . . , to inner leads of the lead frame. When the chips are to be mounted on a TAB tape, a heated bonding tool is used to electrically connect pads of these chips to leads of the TAB tape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0011" num="0010">After that, a packaging step is performed to encapsulate each chip in a resin or ceramic package, thereby completing a semiconductor device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0012" num="0011">In the dicing step of the manufacturing method as described above, however, strain or chipping occurs on the side surface of each semiconductor chip owing to cutting streaks, and this lowers the bending strength of the chip. Therefore, if stress is applied which is produced by the pressure applied in the pickup step performed before the step of mounting the chip on the lead frame or TAB tape, or by the difference between the thermal expansion coefficients of the packaging material and chip, this stress concentrates to the strain or chipping, so the chip cracks from this strain or chipping.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0013" num="0012">Recently, to embed a semiconductor chip in a thin card-like package or the like, a manufacturing method is used by which when a semiconductor wafer is cut, the backside of the pattern formation surface (semiconductor element formation surface) of the wafer is thinned by grinding using a wheel or by polishing using free abrasive grains, and then the wafer is cut by dicing. Also, a technique called DBG (Dicing Before Grinding) is proposed to form thinner chips (e.g., Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. S61-112345). In this DBG, a cut (half cut) is formed to a predetermined depth from the element formation surface of a wafer, and the back surface of the wafer is ground to divide the individual chips and decrease the thickness at the same time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0014" num="0013">By this technique, chipping on the back surface or on an edge between the side surface and back surface of a chip can be removed by polishing the back surface of a semiconductor wafer. However, strain or chipping caused by cutting streaks formed on the side surface of a semiconductor chip cannot be removed. This inevitably lowers the bending strength when the thickness of a chip is decreased. Consequently, it is impossible to completely solve the problem that semiconductor chips crack in the assembly steps or in the reliability test before they are packaged, and defective products are formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">In recent years, therefore, a technique which cuts a semiconductor wafer by laser beam irradiation, instead of dicing using mechanical cutting as described above, is attracting attention (e.g., Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 2001-144037). This cutting using laser beam irradiation can eliminate streaks or chipping by mechanical cutting. However, a laser beam requires high power, so the side surface of a chip is damaged or roughened by recrystallization after melting. This inevitably lowers the bending strength. Also, a material melted by laser beam irradiation scatters and contaminates the surface of a chip. Furthermore, when a semiconductor wafer is to be cut via an adhesive sheet, the wafer must be irradiated with a laser beam twice by changing the focusing position (in the direction of depth of the wafer) of the laser beam. This complicates the dicing step.</div>

<heading id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="h-0006" num="0000">[First Embodiment]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0031" num="0030"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> are views for explaining a semiconductor device manufacturing method and semiconductor device manufacturing apparatus according to the first embodiment of the present invention. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a dicing step, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a step of processing a dicing region by irradiating the dicing region with a laser beam.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0032" num="0031">First, various semiconductor elements are formed in a semiconductor wafer <b>21</b> by known manufacturing process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0033" num="0032">Next, a sheet adhering apparatus is used to adhere an adhesive sheet <b>22</b> to the backside of the element formation surface of the semiconductor wafer <b>21</b> in which the elements are formed. The adhesive sheet <b>22</b> is fixed to a dicing table by suction. The major surface of the semiconductor wafer <b>21</b> is then diced into individual semiconductor chips <b>25</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>25</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>25</b>-<b>3</b>, . . . , along a dicing line <b>24</b> by using a dicer (e.g., a diamond blade <b>23</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0034" num="0033">After that, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a dicing region <b>26</b> formed by the diamond blade <b>23</b> is irradiated with a laser beam <b>28</b> from a laser emitting apparatus <b>27</b>, thereby melting or vaporizing the chip side surfaces in the dicing region <b>26</b>. The laser emitting apparatus <b>27</b> moves in a direction indicated by the arrow, and irradiates the dicing region <b>26</b> with the laser beam <b>28</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0035" num="0034">As the laser emitting apparatus <b>27</b>, it is possible to use, e.g., a YAG-THG laser, YVO4 laser, or CO<sub>2 </sub>laser. When an experiment was conducted by using the YAG-THG laser (wavelength 355 nm) at a Qsw frequency of 50 KHz, an average output of about 1.5 W, a melting diameter of about 15 μm, and a scanning rate (moving velocity) of 5 mm/sec, it was possible to melt or vaporize the cut surface and well remove strain or chipping caused by cutting streaks. In experiments conducted under different conditions, effects were obtained when the wavelength, average output, and scanning rate of the laser beam <b>28</b> were 266 to 1,064 nm, 0.8 to 4.5 W, and 1 to 400 mm/sec, respectively. If the laser beam output is small and the scanning rate is high, the cut surface melts and recrystallizes. If the laser beam output is large and the scanning rate is low, the cut surface vaporizes. If the laser beam wavelength is short, the cutting quality of the beam becomes sharp to readily cause damages. Preferably, the laser beam has a frequency ranging from 50 to 200 KHz. More preferably, the laser beam should have a frequency ranging from 100 to 200 KHz, to make the side surfaces of each semi-conductor chip more flat. The surface condition can be optimized by setting the various conditions such as the wavelength, frequency, average output, and scanning rate of the laser beam <b>28</b> in accordance with the size, thickness, and the like of the semiconductor wafer or chip.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0036" num="0035">Steps after that are the same as the well-known semiconductor device manufacturing method. That is, a dicing step is performed to mount each of the chips <b>25</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>25</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>25</b>-<b>3</b>, . . . , on a lead frame. More specifically, the lower surface of the adhesive sheet <b>22</b> of each of the chips <b>25</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>25</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>25</b>-<b>3</b>, . . . , is pushed up by a pickup needle, and the needle is brought into direct contact with the back surface of the chip through the adhesive sheet <b>22</b> (although the pickup needle need not always extend through the adhesive sheet <b>22</b>). Then, each chip is further raised and removed from the adhesive sheet <b>22</b>. The removed chip is conveyed as its upper surface is held by suction by a collet, and mounted on a die pad of the lead frame.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0037" num="0036">Subsequently, a wire bonding step is performed to electrically connect pads of the chip to inner leads of the lead frame. When the chips <b>15</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>15</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>15</b>-<b>3</b>, . . . , are to be mounted on a TAB tape, a heated bonding tool is used to electrically connect pads of these chips to leads of the TAB tape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0038" num="0037">After that, a packaging step is performed to encapsulate each chip in a resin or ceramic package, thereby completing a semiconductor device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0039" num="0038">In the manufacturing method as described above, the dicing region <b>26</b> of the semiconductor chips <b>25</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>25</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>25</b>-<b>3</b>, . . . , is melted or vaporized as it is irradiated with the laser beam <b>28</b>. This makes it possible to remove strain or chipping caused by cutting streaks formed on the side surface of each semi-conductor chip, and increase the bending strength of the chip. Therefore, it is possible to eliminate defective products resulting from cracking of the semiconductor chips in the assembly steps (the pickup step, mounting step and resin encapsulation step) or in the reliability test before the semiconductor chips are packaged. In addition, contamination on the chip surface by adhesion of the evaporated material can be reduced compared to dicing performed by laser beam irradiation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0040" num="0039"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a microphotograph of the side surface of a semiconductor chip formed by the conventional manufacturing method and manufacturing apparatus. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is a microphotograph of the side surface of a semiconductor chip formed by the manufacturing method and manufacturing apparatus of this embodiment. As is apparent from the comparison of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, a large number of cutting streaks formed by dicing are present on the side surface of the semiconductor chip formed by the conventional manufacturing method and manufacturing apparatus. In contrast, the side surface of the semiconductor chip whose surface is processed by the laser beam is smooth. Accordingly, stress concentration hardly occurs, so the bending strength of the chip can be increased. Consequently, it is possible to prevent defects such as cracks of semiconductor chips in the pickup step, mounting step resin encapsulation step, reliability test, and the like. It is also possible to suppress a decrease in chip bending strength caused by dicing.</div>
<heading id="h-0007">Second Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0041" num="0040">In the first embodiment described above, the semiconductor wafer <b>21</b> is fully cut by dicing. However, the present invention is also applicable to a manufacturing step (DBG) in which grooves are formed by half-cutting the semiconductor wafer <b>21</b>, and the semiconductor wafer <b>21</b> is divided by grinding its back surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0042" num="0041">That is, after various semiconductor elements are formed in a semiconductor wafer <b>21</b> by known manufacturing steps, the major surface of the semi-conductor wafer <b>21</b> is diced along a dicing line and chip dividing lines to form half-cut grooves. A diamond blade <b>23</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is used to form these half-cut grooves. The depth of the cut is larger by about 10 to 30 μm (at least 5 μm) than the final thickness of a chip. This difference is determined by the accuracy of the dicer and grinder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0043" num="0042">After that, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a dicing region <b>26</b> formed by the diamond blade <b>23</b> is irradiated with a laser beam <b>28</b> from a laser emitting apparatus <b>27</b>, thereby melting or vaporizing the chip side surfaces in the dicing region <b>26</b>. The laser emitting apparatus <b>27</b> moves in a direction indicated by the arrow, and irradiates the dicing region <b>26</b> with the laser beam <b>28</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0044" num="0043">Subsequently, a sheet adhesion apparatus is used to adhere an adhesive sheet (surface protection tape) on the element formation surface of the semiconductor wafer <b>21</b> having undergone the half-cut dicing and the surface processing using the laser beam. This surface protection tape prevents damage to the elements during the course of grinding and thinning the back surface of the wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0045" num="0044">Then, the back surface of the wafer <b>21</b> is ground. In this back surface grinding step, the wafer back surface is ground to a predetermined thickness by rotating a wheel having a whetstone at a high speed of 4,000 to 7,000 rpm. The whetstone is obtained by binding artificial diamond with a resin and molding the resultant material. This back surface grinding step is often performed in a biaxial manner. It is also possible to first roughly grind the surface uniaxially with a whetstone of No. 320 to 600, and then finely grind the surface biaxially with a whetstone of No. 1500 to 2000. A triaxial grinding method is also possible. When grinding reaches the grooves, the semiconductor wafer <b>21</b> is divided into individual semiconductor chips <b>25</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>25</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>25</b>-<b>3</b>, . . . . Even after the semiconductor wafer <b>21</b> is thus divided, back surface grinding is continued to obtain a predetermined thickness. As a consequence, chipping formed in the intersection of the side surface and back surface of each semiconductor chip can be removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0046" num="0045">Subsequently, the back surface of each semiconductor chip is planarized by mirror polishing, e.g., wet etching using a wet etching apparatus, plasma etching using a plasma etching apparatus, polishing using a polishing apparatus, buffing using a buffing apparatus, or CMP (Chemical Mechanical Polishing) using a CMP apparatus. Since cutting streaks formed by the back surface grinding can be removed by this planarization, the bending strength can be further increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0047" num="0046">Steps after that are the same as the well-known semiconductor device manufacturing method. That is, a semiconductor device is completed through packaging steps such as a step of picking up each semiconductor chip, a step of mounting the chip on a lead frame or TAB tape, and a step of encapsulating the chip into a package.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0048" num="0047">In the manufacturing method as described above, the dicing region <b>26</b> of the semiconductor chips <b>25</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>25</b>-<b>2</b>, <b>25</b>-<b>3</b>, . . . , is melted or vaporized as it is irradiated with the laser beam <b>28</b>. This makes it possible to remove strain or chipping caused by cutting streaks formed on the side surface of each semi-conductor chip, and increase the bending strength of the chip. Therefore, it is possible to eliminate defective products resulting from cracking of the semiconductor chips in the assembly steps (the pickup step, mounting step and resin encapsulation step) or in the reliability test before the semiconductor chips are packaged. Also, a decrease in chip bending strength caused by dicing can be suppressed. In addition, contamination on the chip surface by adhesion of the evaporated material can be reduced compared to dicing performed by laser beam irradiation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0049" num="0048">In the above second embodiment, the dicing region is irradiated with the laser beam before the back surface grinding step. However, the side surface (dicing region) of each semiconductor chip formed by dividing the semiconductor wafer after the back surface grinding step may also be irradiated with the laser beam.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0050" num="0049"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a graph, showing the relationship between the chip bending strength [MPa] and the percent defective [%], for comparing the conventional manufacturing method and manufacturing apparatus with the semiconductor device manufacturing methods according to the first and second embodiments of the present invention. Symbols ⋄, □, and Δ plot the chip bending strength [MPa] as a function of the percent defective [%] of the conventional manufacturing method, that of the manufacturing method according to the second embodiment of the present invention, and that of the manufacturing method according to the first embodiment of the present invention, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0051" num="0050">In the semiconductor device manufacturing method according to the first embodiment of the present invention, the bending strength greatly rises, and the percent defective decreases accordingly. In the semiconductor device manufacturing method according to the second embodiment, the bending strength decreases because the chips are thin. However, this bending strength is still higher than that of the conventional manufacturing method, and the percent defective is lower than that of the conventional manufacturing method. Accordingly, it is possible to eliminate defective products resulting from cracking of the semiconductor chips in the assembly steps (the pickup step, mounting step and resin encapsulation step) or in the reliability test before the semiconductor chips are packaged.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0052" num="0051">The semiconductor device manufacturing methods and semiconductor device manufacturing apparatuses according to the first and second embodiments also effectively prevent peeling of a low-dielectric-constant film called a Low-K film when the film is used as a dielectric interlayer. That is, when this Low-K film is used as an interlayer dielectric film, cracking occurs during blade dicing whether the full-cut method or half-cut method is used, so peeling occurs in TCT (Temperature Cycling Test). <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is a micro-photograph of the side surface of a semiconductor chip having undergone blade dicing. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> is a microphotograph of the side surface of a semiconductor chip when TCT is repeated <b>500</b> times. Even though the cut surface is relatively good upon dicing as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, fine cracks are formed, because Low-K films are used, on the substrate and between the Low-K films by thermal stress. These cracks cause peeling of the Low-K films.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0053" num="0052">In contrast, the cut surface obtained by laser dicing was good as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, and no serious abnormality was found as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> even after TCT was repeated 500 times. Also, no particular abnormality was detected by SAT (Scanning Acoustic Topography) measurement. However, when FIB (Focused Ion Beam) measurement was performed, peeling by destruction of a Low-K film was found. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, peeling occurs in a white portion from the lower left corner to the vicinity of the center.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0054" num="0053">That is, when Low-K films are used as interlayer dielectric films, the problem of peeling cannot be avoided during TCT whether blade dicing or laser dicing is performed. However, by irradiating the cut surface with a laser after blade dicing as in the first and second embodiments described above, it is possible to fix the exposed surface of a Low-K film by melting the surface or changing the properties of the surface, and prevent peeling of the film as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows the result of FIB (Focused Ion Beam) measurement when the cut surface was irradiated with a laser after blade dicing. As is evident by comparing <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, no white portion indicating peeling exists but patterns of the chip surface appear in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</div>

With this arrangement, a dicing region <b>26</b> can be irradiated with the laser beam <b>28</b> subsequently to dicing without aligning the dicing region <b>26</b> and the irradiation position of the laser beam <b>28</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0061" num="0060">This modification shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> can be applied to both the first embodiment in which a semiconductor wafer is fully cut and the second embodiment in which a semiconductor wafer is half-cut.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0062" num="0061">As described above, according to one aspect of this invention, it is possible to obtain a semi-conductor device manufacturing method capable of suppressing a decrease in chip bending strength, and preventing cracking of semiconductor chips in the assembly steps or in the reliability test.</div>
