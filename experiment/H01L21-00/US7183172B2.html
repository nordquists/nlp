<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">The present invention relates to a method of forming a semiconductor device and the semiconductor device formed thereby; more particularly, a method of forming an SOI semiconductor substrate and the SOI semiconductor substrate formed thereby.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">A typical transistor has a source/drain region, which is defined by forming an impurity diffusion layer at a semiconductor substrate. A PN junction is formed between the source/drain region and the semiconductor substrate. Accordingly, the semiconductor substrate and the source/drain region are electrically isolated from each other when a reverse bias is applied therebetween.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">With trends toward higher integration of semiconductor devices, a depth of the source/drain region is continually reduced. For this reason, current leakage, current leaked into the semiconductor substrate through the source/drain region, can become a serious problem. One proposed solution to suppress the current leakage is by placing a silicon-on-insulator layer on the substrate (hereinafter referred to as an “SOI substrate”). The SOI substrate has a structure where a buried oxide layer is disposed apart from a surface of the semiconductor substrate at a predetermined depth. The buried oxide layer may serve to prevent the leakage current through the source/drain region. However, in the case that the impurities used to form the source/drain region are boron ions, the boron ions can be diffused into the buried oxide layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view showing a transistor formed at an SOI semiconductor substrate and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a graph showing an impurity density, taken along a line I–I′ of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a horizontal axis represents a depth of a semiconductor substrate from a surface of an SOI layer and a vertical axis represents the impurity concentration according to the depth of the semiconductor substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, buried oxide and SOI layers <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> are sequentially staked on an entire surface of a semiconductor substrate <b>1</b>. A gate pattern <b>6</b> is disposed on an active region of the SOI layer <b>3</b> to cross over the active region. The gate pattern <b>6</b> consists of a gate insulating layer <b>4</b> and a gate electrode <b>5</b>, which are sequentially stacked on the active region. An impurity diffusion layer <b>7</b> is disposed at both active regions of the gate pattern <b>6</b>. The impurity diffusion layer <b>7</b> corresponds to a source/drain region and is doped with boron ions. Thus, a transistor having the foregoing structure is to be a positive-channel metal oxide semiconductor (“PMOS”) transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">A line ‘A’ of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> represents the boron ions concentration according to the depth of the semiconductor substrate. As shown by line ‘A’, the solubility and diffusion coefficient of the buried oxide layer <b>2</b> allows boron ions to be diffused into the buried oxide layer <b>2</b>. Further, the boron ions may be diffused into the semiconductor substrate <b>1</b> through the buried oxide layer <b>2</b>. Therefore, resistance of the impurity diffusion layer <b>7</b> is increased, thereby deteriorating characteristics of the transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">Also, in the case that the transistor is a negative-channel metal oxide semiconductor (“NMOS”) transistor (not shown), the boron ions are implanted into a channel region between the source and drain regions to control a threshold voltage. In this case, the boron ions may be diffused into the buried oxide layer <b>2</b> or the semiconductor substrate <b>1</b>. Thus, the concentration of the implanted boron ions is reduced to vary the threshold voltage of the NMOS transistor.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">A feature of the present invention is to provide a method of forming an SOI semiconductor substrate that prevents impurities implanted into an SOI layer from being diffused into a buried oxide layer and a semiconductor substrate, and the SOI semiconductor substrate formed thereby.</div>

<heading>DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">The present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. The invention may, however, be embodied in different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein.

It will also be understood that when a layer is referred to as being “on” another layer or substrate, it can be directly on the other layer or substrate, or intervening layers may also be present. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 6</figref> are cross-sectional views showing a method of forming an SOI semiconductor substrate according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, a porous silicon layer <b>102</b> is formed on a support semiconductor substrate <b>101</b> (hereinafter referred to as ‘support substrate’) having single crystalline silicon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">An anodizing method may be used for forming the porous silicon layer <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">The anodizing method will be briefly explained as follows. First, a surface of the support substrate <b>101</b> is exposed to a reaction liquid including fluoric acid (HF). A negative voltage is applied to the support substrate <b>101</b> and a positive voltage is applied to the reaction liquid. Accordingly, the surface of the support substrate <b>101</b> is partially oxidized and the oxidized portions are etched by the fluoric acid (HF). As a result, the porous silicon layer <b>102</b> with many pits is formed on the surface of the support substrate <b>101</b>. The amount of time necessary to form the porous silicon layer <b>102</b> or density of the porous silicon layer <b>102</b> is related to the amount of an electric current supplied to the reaction liquid or a concentration of the reaction liquid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">Since the porous silicon layer <b>102</b> has a lower density than the support substrate <b>101</b>, it has an etch selectivity with respect to the support substrate <b>101</b>. On the other hand, the porous silicon layer <b>102</b> has the same single crystalline structure as the support substrate <b>101</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">An epitaxial layer <b>105</b> is formed on the porous silicon layer <b>102</b>. The epitaxial layer <b>105</b> is a silicon layer having a single crystalline structure. This is because the porous silicon layer <b>102</b> has a single crystalline structure. Since the density of the epitaxial layer <b>105</b> is higher than the porous silicon layer <b>102</b>, the porous silicon layer <b>102</b> has etch selectivity with respect to the epitaxial layer <b>105</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">Preferably, a buffer insulating layer <b>110</b> is formed by a thermal oxide layer on the epitaxial layer <b>105</b>. In addition, the buffer insulating layer <b>110</b> may be formed by a CVD silicon oxide layer. A diffusion barrier layer <b>115</b> is formed on the buffer insulating layer <b>110</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">Meanwhile, a buried oxide layer <b>155</b> is formed on a handle semiconductor substrate <b>150</b> (hereinafter referred to as ‘handle substrate’). The buried oxide layer <b>155</b> may be formed by thermal oxide or CVD silicon oxide layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">The diffusion barrier layer <b>115</b> is formed by an insulating layer having a lower impurity diffusion coefficient as compared with the buried oxide layer <b>155</b>. For example, it is preferable that the diffusion barrier layer <b>115</b> is formed by the insulating layer having a lower boron ions diffusion coefficient. The diffusion barrier layer <b>115</b> may be composed of either one of a silicon nitride layer (SiN) and a silicon oxynitride layer (SiON).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">The buffer insulating layer <b>110</b> serves to alleviate a stress due to a difference between thermal expansion coefficients of the diffusion barrier and epitaxial layers <b>115</b> and <b>110</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the diffusion barrier layer <b>115</b> disposed on the support substrate <b>101</b> is in contact with the buried oxide layer <b>155</b> disposed on the handle substrate <b>150</b> to be bonded. Here, the support substrate <b>101</b> is disposed at an uppermost part of a bonded corporation and the handle substrate <b>150</b> may be disposed at a lowermost part of the bonded corporation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">Thereafter, the support substrate <b>101</b> is etched until the porous silicon layer <b>102</b> is exposed because the porous silicon layer <b>102</b> has etch selectivity with respect to the support substrate <b>101</b>. Here, a reactive ion etch method may be used for etching the support substrate <b>101</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">The exposed porous silicon layer <b>102</b> is etched until the epitaxial layer <b>105</b> is exposed. After exposing the epitaxial layer <b>105</b>, a polishing process can be further performed to planarize the surface of the epitaxial layer <b>105</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">Thus, the buried oxide, diffusion barrier and buffer insulating layers <b>155</b>, <b>115</b> and <b>110</b>, which are stacked sequentially, are interposed between the epitaxial layer <b>105</b> and the handle substrate <b>150</b>. Here, the epitaxial layer <b>105</b> is used as a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) layer. As a result, a SOI semiconductor substrate having the foregoing structure is formed. The diffusion barrier layer <b>115</b> may prevent impurities, such as the boron ions, which are implanted into the SOI layer <b>105</b>, from being diffused into the buried oxide layer <b>155</b> or the handle substrate <b>150</b>. Therefore, degradation in characteristics of a transistor formed by implanting impurities is prevented.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>8</b> and <b>9</b>, hydrogen ions (H) are implanted into the support substrate <b>101</b> to form a microbubble layer <b>117</b> apart from the surface of the support substrate <b>101</b> to a predetermined depth. At this time, a portion of the support substrate <b>101</b> on the microbubble layer <b>117</b> becomes an SOI layer <b>120</b>. The hydrogen ions (H) are implanted at a predetermined temperature. For example, the process may be performed at a temperature of 500° C. The hydrogen ions have a strong tendency to secede from the support substrate <b>101</b>, likewise, the implanted hydrogen ions tend to secede from the support substrate <b>101</b> due to the thermal energy obtained by the predetermined temperature.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, the combined support and handle substrates <b>101</b> and <b>150</b> are annealed at different predetermined temperature.
