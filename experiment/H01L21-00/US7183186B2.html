<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">This application relates generally to semiconductor devices and device fabrication and, more particularly, to dielectric layers and their method of fabrication.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Dielectric thin films have applications in semiconductor memory devices, such as dynamic random access memory, DRAM, devices and in wireless communication systems. Important characteristics for these applications include low dielectric losses (tan δ) and high dielectric constants (κ). The operating frequencies for devices using these dielectric thin films extend not only to hundreds of megahertz, MHz, but to tens of gigahertz, GHz. As a result, dielectric materials useful for increased scaling in microelectronic devices such as semiconductor memories need to provide low loss characteristics at GHz operating frequencies.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">Currently, the semiconductor industry relies on the ability to reduce or scale the dimensions of its basic devices, primarily, the silicon based metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET). A common configuration of such a transistor is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. While the following discussion uses <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to illustrate a transistor from the prior art, one skilled in the art will recognize that the present invention could be incorporated into the transistor shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to form a transistor according to the present invention. A transistor <b>100</b> is fabricated in a substrate <b>110</b> that is typically silicon, but could be fabricated from other semiconductor materials as well. Transistor <b>100</b> has a source region <b>120</b> and a drain region <b>130</b>. A body region <b>132</b> is located between source region <b>120</b> and drain region <b>130</b>, where body region <b>132</b> defines a channel of the transistor with a channel length <b>134</b>. A gate dielectric <b>140</b> is located on body region <b>132</b> with a gate <b>150</b> located over gate dielectric <b>140</b>. Although gate dielectric <b>140</b> may be formed from materials other than oxides, gate dielectric <b>140</b> is typically an oxide, and is commonly referred to as a gate oxide. Gate <b>150</b> may be fabricated from polycrystalline silicon (polysilicon), or other conducting materials such as metal may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">In fabricating transistors to be smaller in size and reliably operate on lower power supplies, one design criteria is gate dielectric <b>140</b>. The mainstay for forming the gate dielectric has been silicon dioxide, SiO<sub>2</sub>. A thermally grown amorphous SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer provides an electrically and thermodynamically stable material, where the interface of the SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer with underlying Si provides a high quality interface as well as superior electrical isolation properties. However, increased scaling and other requirements in microelectronic devices have created the need to use other dielectric materials as gate dielectrics.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">The abovementioned problems are addressed by the present invention and will be understood by reading and studying the following specification. An embodiment for a method for forming an oxide film containing titanium and zirconium by atomic layer deposition includes pulsing a titanium-containing precursor onto a substrate, and pulsing a zirconium-containing precursor. The pulsing of the titanium-containing precursor and the pulsing of the zirconium-containing precursor is controlled to provide a dielectric layer with a predetermined zirconium to titanium ratio.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">Dielectric layers containing an oxide including titanium and zirconium have a larger dielectric constant than silicon dioxide. Such dielectric layers provide a significantly thinner equivalent oxide thickness compared with a silicon oxide layer having the same physical thickness. Alternately, such dielectric layers provide a significantly thicker physical thickness than a silicon oxide layer having the same equivalent oxide thickness. Embodiments include structures for capacitors, transistors, memory devices, and electronic systems with dielectric layers containing an atomic layer deposited oxide of zirconium and titanium, and methods for forming such structures.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings that show, by way of illustration, specific aspects and embodiments in which the present invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the present invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and structural, logical, and electrical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The various embodiments disclosed herein are not necessarily mutually exclusive, as some disclosed embodiments can be combined with one or more other disclosed embodiments to form new embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">The terms wafer and substrate used in the following description include any structure having an exposed surface with which to form an integrated circuit (IC). The term substrate is understood to include semiconductor wafers. The term substrate is also used to refer to semiconductor structures during processing, and may include other layers that have been fabricated thereupon. Both wafer and substrate include doped and undoped semiconductors, epitaxial semiconductor layers supported by a base semiconductor or insulator, as well as other semiconductor structures well known to one skilled in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">The term “horizontal” as used in this application is defined as a plane parallel to the conventional plane or surface of a wafer or substrate, regardless of the orientation of the wafer or substrate. The term “vertical” refers to a direction perpendicular to the horizontal as defined above. Prepositions, such as “on”, “side” (as in “sidewall”), “higher”, “lower”, “over” and “under” are defined with respect to the conventional plane or surface being on the top surface of the wafer or substrate, regardless of the orientation of the wafer or substrate. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">In various embodiments, a dielectric layer having an oxide layer containing Zr and Ti is formed by atomic layer deposition. An oxide layer containing Zr and Ti described herein is a zirconium titanium oxide, which includes ZrTiO<sub>4</sub>, a mixture of ZrO<sub>2 </sub>and TiO<sub>2</sub>, and nanolaminates of ZrO<sub>2 </sub>and TiO<sub>2</sub>. In an embodiment, a dielectric layer formed by atomic layer deposition includes ZrTiO<sub>4 </sub>with a predetermined Zr/Ti ratio. Such a dielectric layer includes and can be written as Zr<sub>x</sub>Ti<sub>y</sub>O<sub>z</sub>, where the ratio x/y is predetermined. By selecting an appropriate ratio x/y, the dielectric layer can be formed as a layer including a variable amount of zirconium and titanium including a zirconium-rich layer, a titanium-rich layer, or a layer having zirconium and titanium in comparable amounts. Selecting the x/y ratio can depend on the application for the dielectric layer. For instances, a titanium-rich dielectric layer provides a higher dielectric constant since the dielectric constant of TiO<sub>2 </sub>is substantially greater than that of ZrO<sub>2</sub>. However, TiO<sub>2 </sub>films have been found to have a low resistivity, which leads to high leakage currents. On the other hand, ZrO<sub>2 </sub>has been shown to have good leakage current characteristics. Thus, a dielectric combining characteristics of ZrO<sub>2 </sub>and TiO<sub>2 </sub>should useful in a wide variety of applications. Further, the properties of a dielectric layer formed by ALD containing a mixture of ZrO<sub>2 </sub>and TiO<sub>2 </sub>can be controlled in a similar manner by controlling the Zr/Ti ratio.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">In various embodiments, a dielectric layer having an oxide containing Ti and Zr includes thin layers of TiO<sub>2 </sub>and ZrO<sub>2 </sub>forming a nanolaminate. The term “nanolaminate” means a composite film of ultra thin layers of two or more materials in a layered stack, where the layers are alternating layers of materials of the composite film. Typically, each layer in a nanolaminate has a thickness of an order of magnitude in the nanometer range. Further, each individual material layer of the nanolaminate can have a thickness as low as a monolayer of the material. A nanolaminate of TiO<sub>2 </sub>and ZrO<sub>2 </sub>includes at least one thin layer of TiO<sub>2</sub>, and one thin layer of ZrO<sub>2</sub>, which can be written as a nanolaminate of TiO<sub>2</sub>/ZrO<sub>2</sub>. Further, a TiO<sub>2</sub>/ZrO<sub>2 </sub>nanolaminate is not limited to alternating one TiO<sub>2 </sub>layer after a ZrO<sub>2 </sub>layer, but can include multiple thin layers of TiO<sub>2 </sub>alternating with multiple thin layers of ZrO<sub>2</sub>. Further, the number of thin layers of TiO<sub>2 </sub>and the number of thin layers of ZrO<sub>2 </sub>can vary independently within a nanolaminate structure. A dielectric layer containing alternating layers of TiO<sub>2 </sub>and ZrO<sub>2 </sub>has an effective dielectric constant related to the series combination of the layers of TiO<sub>2 </sub>and ZrO<sub>2</sub>, which depends on the relative thicknesses of the TiO<sub>2 </sub>layers and the ZrO<sub>2 </sub>layers. Thus, engineering an ALD dielectric layer having nanolaminates of TiO<sub>2</sub>/ZrO<sub>2 </sub>can provide a selected dielectric constant effectively based on its Zr/Ti ratio.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">A gate dielectric <b>140</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, when operating in a transistor, has both a physical gate dielectric thickness and an equivalent oxide thickness (t<sub>eq</sub>). The equivalent oxide thickness quantifies the electrical properties, such as capacitance, of a gate dielectric <b>140</b> in terms of a representative physical thickness. The equivalent oxide thickness, t<sub>eq</sub>, is defined as the thickness of a theoretical SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer that would have the same capacitance density as a given dielectric, ignoring leakage current and reliability considerations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">A SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer of thickness, t, deposited on a Si surface as a gate dielectric will have a t<sub>eq </sub>larger than its thickness, t. This t<sub>eq </sub>results from the capacitance in the surface channel on which the SiO<sub>2 </sub>is deposited due to the formation of a depletion/inversion region. This depletion/inversion region may result in t<sub>eq </sub>being from 3 to 6 Angstroms (Å) larger than the SiO<sub>2 </sub>thickness, t. Thus, with the semiconductor industry driving to scale the gate dielectric equivalent oxide thickness to under 10 Å, the physical thickness for a SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer used for a gate dielectric would be need to be approximately 4 to 7 Å.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">Additional characteristics for a SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer depend on the gate electrode used in conjunction with the SiO<sub>2 </sub>gate dielectric. Using a conventional polysilicon gate results in an additional increase in t<sub>eq </sub>for the SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer. This additional thickness could be eliminated by using a metal gate electrode, though metal gates are not currently used in typical complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (CMOS) technology. Thus, future devices would be designed towards a physical SiO<sub>2 </sub>gate dielectric layer of about 5 Åor less. Such a small thickness for a SiO<sub>2 </sub>oxide layer creates additional problems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">Silicon dioxide is used as a gate dielectric, in part, due to its electrical isolation properties in a SiO<sub>2</sub>—Si based structure. This electrical isolation is due to the relatively large bandgap of SiO<sub>2 </sub>(8.9 eV) making it a good insulator from electrical conduction. Signification reductions in its bandgap would eliminate it as a material for a gate dielectric. As the thickness of a SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer decreases, the number of atomic layers, or monolayers of the SiO<sub>2 </sub>decreases. At a certain thickness, the number of monolayers will be sufficiently small that the SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer will not have a complete arrangement of atoms as in a larger or bulk layer. As a result of incomplete formation relative to a bulk structure, a thin SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer of only one or two monolayers will not form a full bandgap. The lack of a full bandgap in a SiO<sub>2 </sub>gate dielectric could cause an effective short between an underlying Si channel and an overlying polysilicon gate. This undesirable property sets a limit on the physical thickness to which a SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer may be scaled. The minimum thickness due to this monolayer effect is thought to be about 7–8 Å. Therefore, for future devices to have a t<sub>eq </sub>less than about 10 Å, dielectrics other than SiO<sub>2 </sub>need to be considered for use as a gate dielectric.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">For a typical dielectric layer used as a gate dielectric, the capacitance is determined as one for a parallel plate capacitance: C=κ∈<sub>0</sub>A/t, where κ is the dielectric constant, ∈<sub>0 </sub>is the permittivity of free space, A is the area of the capacitor, and t is the thickness of the dielectric. The thickness, t, of a material is related to its t<sub>eq </sub>for a given capacitance, with SiO<sub>2 </sub>having a dielectric constant κ<sub>ox</sub>=3.9, as
<br/>
<i>t</i>=(κ/κ<sub>ox</sub>)<i>t</i> <sub>eq</sub>=(κ/3.9)<i>t</i> <sub>eq</sub>.
<br/>
Thus, materials with a dielectric constant greater than that of SiO<sub>2</sub>, 3.9, will have a physical thickness that may be considerably larger than a desired t<sub>eq</sub>, while providing the desired equivalent oxide thickness. For example, an alternate dielectric material with a dielectric constant of 10 could have a thickness of about 25.6 Å to provide a t<sub>eq </sub>of 10 Å, not including any depletion/inversion layer effects. Thus, a reduced t<sub>eq </sub>for transistors may be realized by using dielectric materials with higher dielectric constants than SiO<sub>2</sub>. The thinner t<sub>eq </sub>for lower transistor operating voltages and smaller transistor dimensions may be realized by a significant number of materials, but additional fabricating characteristics makes determining a suitable replacement for SiO<sub>2 </sub>difficult.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">The current view for the microelectronics industry is still for Si based devices. Thus, the gate dielectric employed will grow on a silicon substrate or silicon layer, which places significant restraints on the substitute dielectric material. During the formation of the dielectric on the silicon layer, there exists the possibility that a small layer of SiO<sub>2 </sub>could be formed in addition to the desired dielectric. The result would effectively be a dielectric layer consisting of two sublayers in parallel with each other and the silicon layer on which the dielectric is formed. In such a case, the resulting capacitance would be that of two dielectrics in series. As a result, the t<sub>eq </sub>of the dielectric layer would be the sum of the SiO<sub>2 </sub>thickness and a multiplicative factor of the thickness of the dielectric being formed, written as
<br/>
<i>t</i> <sub>eq</sub> <i>=t</i> <sub>SiO</sub> <sub> <sub2>2</sub2> </sub>+(κ<sub>ox</sub>/κ)<sub>t</sub>.
<br/>
Thus, if a SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer is formed in the process, the t<sub>eq </sub>is again limited by a SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer. Thus, use of an ultra-thin silicon oxide interface layer should be limited to significantly less than ten angstroms. In the event that a barrier layer is formed between the silicon layer and the desired dielectric in which the barrier layer prevents the formation of a SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer, the t<sub>eq </sub>would be limited by the layer with the lowest dielectric constant. However, whether a single dielectric layer with a high dielectric constant or a barrier layer with a higher dielectric constant than SiO<sub>2 </sub>is employed, the layer interfacing with the silicon layer must provide a high quality interface to maintain a high channel carrier mobility.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">One of the advantages for using SiO<sub>2 </sub>as a gate dielectric has been that the formation of the SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer results in an amorphous gate dielectric. Having an amorphous structure for a gate dielectric is advantageous because grain boundaries in polycrystalline gate dielectrics provide high leakage paths. Additionally, grain size and orientation changes throughout a polycrystalline gate dielectric may cause variations in the layer's dielectric constant. Many materials having a high dielectric constant relative to SiO<sub>2 </sub>also have a disadvantage of a crystalline form, at least in a bulk configuration. Thus, the best candidates for replacing SiO<sub>2 </sub>as a gate dielectric are those with high dielectric constant, a relatively large bandgap, and are able to be fabricated as a thin layer with an amorphous form.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">Materials such as Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, ZrO<sub>2</sub>, ZrSi<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub>, HfSi<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub>, and barium strontium titanate (BST) have been proposed as replacements for SiO<sub>2 </sub>as gate dielectric materials. For instance, the proposed materials ZrO<sub>2 </sub>and TiO<sub>2 </sub>have dielectric constants of 25 and 80, respectively, and bandgaps of 7.8 eV and 3.5 eV, respectively. See G. D. Wilk et al., <i>Journal of Applied Physics</i>, vol. 89: no. 10, pp. 5243–5275 (2001). In an embodiment of the present invention, a dielectric film having an atomic layer deposited oxide containing Zr and Ti allows for the engineering of a dielectric layer with a high dielectric constant selected to be in the range from about 25 to about 80 when an interfacial layer is absent from the region between a substrate and the dielectric layer. Other considerations for selecting the material and method for forming a dielectric layer for use in electronic devices and systems concern leakage current, the suitability of the material for applications requiring that the dielectric layer have an ultra-thin equivalent oxide thickness, form conformally on a substrate, and/or be engineered to specific thickness and elemental concentrations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">Another consideration concerns the roughness of the dielectric layer on a substrate. Surface roughness of the dielectric layer has a significant effect on the electrical properties of the gate oxide, and the resulting operating characteristics of the transistor. Leakage current through a physical 1.0 nm gate oxide has been found to be increased by a factor of 10 for every 0.1 increase in the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">During a conventional sputtering deposition process stage, particles of the material to be deposited bombard the surface at a high energy. When a particle hits the surface, some particles adhere, and other particles cause damage. High-energy impacts remove body region particles creating pits. The surface of such a deposited layer may have a rough contour due to the rough interface at the body region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">In an embodiment, an oxide layer containing Zr and Ti having a substantially smooth surface relative to other processing techniques is formed using atomic layer deposition (ALD). Further, forming a dielectric layer using atomic layer deposition provides for controlling transitions between material layers. Thus, dielectric layers having an oxide layer containing Zr and Ti formed by atomic layer deposition may have an engineered transition with a substrate surface that has an interfacial layer substantially limited in thickness to provide an effective dielectric constant that is significantly greater than that of a silicon oxide layer. Further, the ALD deposited oxide layer containing Zr and Ti provide conformal coverage on the surfaces on which they are deposited.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">ALD, also known as atomic layer epitaxy (ALE), was developed in the early 1970's as a modification of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and is also called “alternatively pulsed-CVD.” In ALD, gaseous precursors are introduced one at a time to the substrate surface mounted within a reaction chamber (or reactor). This introduction of the gaseous precursors takes the form of pulses of each gaseous precursor. Between the pulses, the reaction chamber is purged with a gas, which in many cases is an inert gas, and/or evacuated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">In a chemisorption-saturated ALD (CS-ALD) process, during the first pulsing phase, reaction with the substrate occurs with the precursor saturatively chemisorbed at the substrate surface. Subsequent pulsing with a purging gas removes precursor excess from the reaction chamber.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">The second pulsing phase introduces another precursor on the substrate where the growth reaction of the desired layer takes place. Subsequent to the layer growth reaction, reaction by-products and precursor excess are purged from the reaction chamber. With favourable precursor chemistry where the precursors adsorb and react with each other on the substrate aggressively, one ALD cycle may be performed in less than one second in properly designed flow type reaction chambers. Typically, precursor pulse times range from about 0.5 sec to about 2 to 3 seconds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">In ALD, the saturation of all the reaction and purging phases makes the growth self-limiting. This self-limiting growth results in large area uniformity and conformality, which has important applications for such cases as planar substrates, deep trenches, and in the processing of porous silicon and high surface area silica and alumina powders. Thus, ALD provides for controlling layer thickness in a straightforward manner by controlling the number of growth cycles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">ALD was originally developed to manufacture luminescent and dielectric layers needed in electroluminescent displays. Significant efforts have been made to apply ALD to the growth of doped zinc sulfide and alkaline earth metal sulfide layers. Additionally, ALD has been studied for the growth of different epitaxial II-V and II-VI layers, nonepitaxial crystalline or amorphous oxide and nitride layers and multilayer structures of these. There also has been considerable interest towards the ALD growth of silicon and germanium layers, but due to the difficult precursor chemistry, this has not been very successful.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">The precursors used in an ALD process may be gaseous, liquid or solid. However, liquid or solid precursors must be volatile. The vapor pressure must be high enough for effective mass transportation. Also, solid and some liquid precursors need to be heated inside the reaction chamber and introduced through heated tubes to the substrates. The necessary vapor pressure must be reached at a temperature below the substrate temperature to avoid the condensation of the precursors on the substrate. Due to the self-limiting growth mechanisms of ALD, relatively low vapor pressure solid precursors may be used though evaporation rates may somewhat vary during the process because of changes in their surface area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">There are several other characteristics for precursors used in ALD. The precursors must be thermally stable at the substrate temperature because their decomposition would destroy the surface control and accordingly the advantages of the ALD method that relies on the reaction of the precursor at the substrate surface. A slight decomposition, if slow compared to the ALD growth, may be tolerated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">The precursors have to chemisorb on or react with the surface, though the interaction between the precursor and the surface as well as the mechanism for the adsorption is different for different precursors. The molecules at the substrate surface must react aggressively with the second precursor to form the desired solid layer. Additionally, precursors should not react with the layer to cause etching, and precursors should not dissolve in the layer. Using highly reactive precursors in ALD contrasts with the selection of precursors for conventional CVD.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">The by-products in the reaction must be gaseous in order to allow their easy removal from the reaction chamber. Further, the by-products should not react or adsorb on the surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">In a reaction sequence ALD (RS-ALD) process, the self-limiting process sequence involves sequential surface chemical reactions. RS-ALD relies on chemistry between a reactive surface and a reactive molecular precursor. In an RS-ALD process, molecular precursors are pulsed into the ALD reaction chamber separately. The metal precursor reaction at the substrate is typically followed by an inert gas pulse to remove excess precursor and by-products from the reaction chamber prior to pulsing the next precursor of the fabrication sequence.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">By RS-ALD, layers can be layered in equal metered sequences that are all identical in chemical kinetics, deposition per cycle, composition, and thickness. RS-ALD sequences generally deposit less than a full layer per cycle. Typically, a deposition or growth rate of about 0.25 to about 2.00 Å per RS-ALD cycle may be realized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">The characteristics of RS-ALD include continuity at an interface, conformality over a substrate, use of low temperature and mildly oxidizing processes, freedom from first wafer effects and chamber dependence, growth thickness dependent solely on the number of cycles performed, and ability to engineer multilayer laminate layers with resolution of one to two monolayers. RS-ALD allows for deposition control on the order on monolayers and the ability to deposit monolayers of amorphous layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">Herein, a sequence refers to the ALD material formation based on an ALD reaction of a precursor or a precursor with its reactant precursor. For example, forming a metal layer from a precursor containing the metal forms an embodiment of a metal sequence. Additionally, forming a layer of metal oxide from a precursor containing the metal and from an oxygen containing precursor as its reactant precursor forms an embodiment of a metal/oxygen sequence, which may be referred to as the metal oxide sequence. A cycle of a metal sequence includes pulsing a precursor containing the metal and pulsing a purging gas for the precursor. Further, a cycle of a metal oxide sequence includes pulsing a precursor containing the metal, pulsing a purging gas for the precursor, pulsing a reactant precursor, and pulsing a purging gas for the reactant precursor. Additionally, a cycle for a compound metal oxide includes pulsing a precursor containing a first metal, pulsing a purging gas for this precursor, pulsing a reactant precursor for the first metal precursor, pulsing a purging gas for the reactant precursor, pulsing a precursor containing a second metal, pulsing a purging gas for this precursor, pulsing a reactant precursor for the second metal precursor, and pulsing a purging gas for this reactant precursor. The order of the metal precursors can depend on the compatibility of the metals with diffusion of atoms through the metal to the underlying substrate. The order employed can limit the amount of unwanted atomic diffusion to the substrate surface.</div>

The above description of the computer control in conjunction with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> provides information for those skilled in the art to practice embodiments for forming a dielectric layer having an oxide containing Zr and Ti using a computerized method as described herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0089">The embodiments described herein provide a process for growing an oxide containing Zr and Ti having a wide range of useful equivalent oxide thickness, t<sub>eq</sub>, associated with the oxide having a predetermined Zr/Ti ratio to provide a dielectric constant in the range from about 25 to about 80. The relatively large dielectric constant for an oxide containing Zr and Ti allows for the engineering of dielectric layers having a physical thickness in the 10 nm (100 Å) range, while achieving a t<sub>eq </sub>of less than 2.5 nm (25 Å). Without an interfacial layer between a substrate and an oxide containing Zr and Ti, a dielectric layer containing the oxide may be attained with a t<sub>eq </sub>ranging from about 1.5 Å to about 10 Å. Further, an atomic layer deposited oxide containing Zr and Ti layer may provide a t<sub>eq </sub>significantly less than 2 or 3 Å, even less than 1.5 Å.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0090">Attainment of a t<sub>eq </sub>in the thickness range of one to a several monolayers is associated with an interfacial layer between a semiconductor substrate surface and the an oxide containing Zr and Ti that is exceptionally small or composed of a material having a dielectric constant approaching the value for the oxide containing Zr and Ti. To obtain the smallest possible t<sub>eq</sub>, the formation of a SiO<sub>2 </sub>interfacial layer should be avoided. However, having a silicon oxide layer or a silicate layer between the substrate and the ZrTiO<sub>4 </sub>layer can aid in the reduction of leakage current. Alternately, a relatively thin barrier layer can be formed on the substrate prior to forming an oxide containing Zr and Ti. The material for the barrier layer is chosen such that the material has a dielectric constant larger than SiO<sub>2</sub>, in addition to preventing formation of a SiO<sub>2 </sub>interfacial layer. In an embodiment, a thin layer of silicon nitride is deposited on a substrate by atomic layer deposition prior to forming an oxide containing Zr and Ti. Atomic layer deposition of a silicon nitride barrier layer can include the use of SiCl<sub>4 </sub>and NH<sub>3 </sub>precursors to form a layer less than about 5 angstroms thick.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0091">Additional barrier layers to oxygen diffusion can be formed dependent on the application for the oxide containing Zr and Ti. In various embodiments in which a dielectric layer is directly connected to a contact layer, the contact layer can include one or more conductive layers that act as a barrier layer. In an embodiment, a contact to a dielectric layer containing Zr and Ti contains TiN formed by atomic layer deposition. ALD formation of the TiN layer can include the use of TiCl<sub>4 </sub>and NH<sub>3 </sub>precursors along with an Ar purging gas. Though the TiN layer can be formed by conventional chemical layer deposition (CVD), TiN layers deposited by ALD were found to provide layers of lower resistivity and low surface roughness with step coverage conformality at lower temperatures than for CVD processing. See B. Kim et al., <i>Materials Research Society Symposium Proceedings</i>, vol. 672, pp. 0.7.8.1–0.7.8.6 (2001). In various embodiments for dielectric layers having an oxide containing Zr and Ti, TiN layers can be formed as part of contacts to the dielectric layer such as for capacitor electrodes and gates in MOS devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0092">Dielectric layers having an oxide containing Zr and Ti using embodiments of the present invention may be engineered with various structures and compositions including an amorphous structure. Embodiments using low processing temperatures tend to provide an amorphous structure, which is better suited for reducing leakage current than structures exhibiting a polycrystalline structure or a partial polycrystalline structure. One embodiment for a dielectric structure includes a nanolaminate structure as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, which depicts an embodiment of a dielectric layer including atomic layer deposited nanolaminates of zirconium oxide and titanium oxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0093">The nanolaminate structure <b>500</b> includes a plurality of nano-layers <b>505</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>505</b>-N, where each nano-layer contains TiO<sub>2 </sub>or ZrO<sub>2</sub>. The sequencing of the nano-layers can depend on the application. The effective dielectric constant associated with nanolaminate structure <b>500</b> is that attributable to N capacitors in series, where each capacitor has a thickness defined by the thickness of the corresponding TiO<sub>2 </sub>or ZrO<sub>2 </sub>nano-layer. By selecting each thickness and the composition of each nano-layer, TiO<sub>2 </sub>or ZrO<sub>2</sub>, a nanolaminate structure can be engineered to have a predetermined dielectric constant. Also, by selecting each thickness and the composition of each thickness, TiO<sub>2 </sub>or ZrO<sub>2</sub>, a Zr/Ti ratio is predetermined for nanolaminate structure <b>500</b>. Further, selecting the Zr/Ti ratio can depend on the application for the dielectric layer. For instances, a titanium-rich dielectric layer provides a higher dielectric constant since the dielectric constant of TiO<sub>2 </sub>is substantially greater than that of ZrO<sub>2</sub>. On the other hand, ZrO<sub>2 </sub>has been shown to have good leakage current characteristics.

<heading>CONCLUSION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0104">A dielectric layer having an oxide containing Zr and Ti, formed by atomic layer deposition using methods described herein, provides a reliable dielectric layer having an equivalent oxide thickness thinner than attainable using SiO<sub>2</sub>. Forming dielectric layers having an oxide containing Zr and Ti by atomic layer deposition in relatively low processing temperatures allows for dielectric layers that are amorphous and conformally layered on a substrate surface. Further, the ALD formation of these dielectric layers provides for enhanced dielectric and electrical properties relative to those attained with an amorphous SiO<sub>x </sub>layer. These properties of dielectric layers having an oxide containing Zr and Ti formed by atomic layer deposition allow for application as dielectric layers in numerous devices and systems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0105">Capacitors, transistors, electro-optic devices, higher level ICs or devices, and electronic systems are constructed utilizing various embodiments for forming a dielectric layer having an oxide containing Zr and Ti structured to provide an ultra thin equivalent oxide thickness, t<sub>eq</sub>. Dielectric layers containing an atomic layer deposited oxide containing Zr and Ti are formed having a dielectric constant substantially higher than that of silicon oxide, where such dielectric layers are capable of a t<sub>eq </sub>thinner than 10 Å, thinner than the expected limit for SiO<sub>2 </sub>gate dielectrics. The thinner t<sub>eq </sub>of these dielectric layers allows for a higher capacitance than SiO<sub>2 </sub>gate dielectrics, which provides further effective scaling for microelectronic devices and systems. At the same time, the physical thickness of the dielectric layer having an oxide containing Zr and Ti formed by atomic layer deposition is much larger than the SiO<sub>2 </sub>thickness associated with the t<sub>eq </sub>limit of SiO<sub>2</sub>. Forming the larger thickness aids in the manufacturing process for gate dielectrics and other dielectric layers.</div>
