<heading>RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 2002-44318, filed Jul. 26, 2002, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety as if set forth fully herein.</div>
<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates to methods of forming thin films, and more particularly to methods of forming thin films through Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD).</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Integrated circuit devices, such as logic and memory devices, are widely used in consumer and commercial applications. As the integration density of integrated circuit devices continues to increase, it may be desirable to form ultra thin layers, such as ultra thin dielectric layers, on a semiconductor substrate. These dielectric layers may be used, for example, as a gate dielectric layer of an insulated gate field effect transistor, also referred to as a MOSFET, and/or as a capacitor dielectric for an integrated circuit capacitor. As is well known to those having skill in the art, a field effect transistor includes spaced apart source and drain regions, a gate dielectric therebetween, and a gate electrode on the gate dielectric. Moreover, as is well known to those having skill in the art, an integrated circuit capacitor includes a first or lower electrode, a second or upper electrode, and a dielectric therebetween. Integrated circuit capacitors are widely used in integrated circuit memory devices such as Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Silicon dioxide is widely used as a dielectric layer for integrated circuit field effect transistors and/or capacitors. However, as the integration density of integrated circuits continues to increase, dielectric materials having a higher dielectric constant than silicon, such as Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, HfO<sub>2</sub>, ZrO<sub>2</sub>, Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, BaTiO<sub>3</sub>, SrTiO<sub>3 </sub>and/or other materials have been used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Tantalum oxide (Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) has been widely used as the dielectric layer of a capacitor due to the potentially high thermal stability thereof. However, the tantalum oxide may react with a lower electrode of the capacitor. In particular, when polysilicon is used for the lower electrode, oxygen atoms contained in the tantalum oxide layer may react with silicon atoms contained in the polysilicon layer during a formation process of the tantalum oxide layer and/or during heat treatment after forming the tantalum oxide layer, so that the polysilicon layer may be oxidized. As a result, leakage current of the capacitor may increase.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Lower electrodes of a capacitor also have been made using metals, such as platinum (Pt), ruthenium (Ru), iridium (Ir) and the like, or of conductive metal nitride, such as titanium nitride (TiN). However, the metal or the conductive metal nitride used for the lower electrode may cause other problems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">In particular, the tantalum oxide layer may be continuously deposited in an atmosphere of oxygen by using a tantalum source and an oxygen source as an oxidizing agent. Examples of the tantalum source include TaCl<sub>5</sub>, Ta(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>, Ta(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>5</sub>, Ta(OC<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>)<sub>5</sub>, Ta(OC<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>)<sub>5</sub>, Ta(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>) (OC<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, or Ta(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>(DMAE) (Ta(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4 </sub>[OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>], tetraethoxy tantalum dimethylaminoethoxide (hereinafter referred to as “TAT-DAME”), etc. Examples of the oxygen source include O<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, alcohols including OH group, etc. The combination of the tantalum source and the oxidizing agent may oxidize the lower electrode, which may decrease the quality of the tantalum oxide layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">For instance, when ruthenium is used for the lower electrode of the capacitor, a surface of the ruthenium may be oxidized by the oxygen source to form a ruthenium oxide (RuO<sub>2</sub>) layer. The ruthenium oxide layer may prevent the tantalum oxide from being uniformly deposited on the lower electrode of the capacitor. When the tantalum oxide layer is used for a dielectric layer of a cylinder-shaped or a concave capacitor having a high aspect ratio, the above-mentioned low deposition quality may be particularly observed. That is, the tantalum oxide may not be deposited upon the ruthenium electrode at a lower opening portion of the cylindrical capacitor and may be excessively deposited on an upper opening portion of the cylindrical capacitor. Therefore, the step coverage of the tantalum oxide may be poor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">The dielectric layer of the capacitor can be deposited through a conventional Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) process, a low-pressure CVD (LPCVD) process, a plasma enhanced CVD (PECVD) process, and/or a sputtering process. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,339,009 and Japanese Published Application 2001-85423. However, the above and other CVD processes may be carried out at a relatively high temperature, which may have an adverse thermal effect on a device. Furthermore, a thin film layer deposited through the CVD process may have a non-uniform thickness and/or poor step coverage.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">Embodiments of the invention provide methods of forming a thin film layer through an atomic layer deposition process. A first reacting material including a tantalum precursor and a titanium precursor is introduced to a substrate so that a portion of the first reacting material is chemisorbed onto the substrate. A second reacting material including oxygen is introduced to the substrate so that a portion of the second reacting material is chemisorbed onto the substrate to form a solid material thereon. In some embodiments, a thin film layer having a high dielectric constant, good step coverage, and/or a superior leakage current characteristic is thereby formed on the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">Other methods of forming an atomic layer of a material on the substrate, according to other embodiments of the present invention, introduce a first precursor of the material to a substrate, such that a first portion of the first precursor is chemisorbed onto the substrate, and a second portion of the first precursor is not chemisorbed onto the substrate. At least some of the second portion of the first precursor that is not chemisorbed onto the substrate is then purged. A second precursor of the material is introduced to the substrate, such that a first portion of the second precursor is chemisorbed onto the substrate and reacts with the first portion of the first precursor that is chemisorbed onto the substrate to form the atomic layer of the material, and a second portion of the second precursor is not chemisorbed onto the substrate. At least some of the second portion of the second precursor that is not chemisorbed onto the substrate is purged.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">Still other embodiments of the present invention form an atomic layer of a material on a substrate by introducing a first precursor of the material to the substrate in a purge gas flow. Then, the introducing the first precursor is discontinued while maintaining the purge gas flow. Then, a second precursor of the material is introduced to the substrate in the purge gas flow. Finally, the introducing the first precursor is discontinued while maintaining the purge gas flow.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">Integrated circuit capacitors may be fabricated, according to some embodiments of the invention, by forming a lower electrode of the capacitor on a substrate, forming a dielectric layer of the capacitor including titanium tantalum oxide on the lower electrode, and forming an upper electrode of the capacitor on the dielectric layer. In order to form the dielectric layer of the capacitor, a first reacting material, a second reacting material, and a purge gas are discontinuously introduced onto the lower electrode, and a portion of the first reacting material and the second reacting material are chemisorbed onto the substrate. At least some non-chemisorbed first and second reacting materials are purged from the substrate. The first reacting material can include a tantalum precursor and a titanium precursor, and the second reacting material can include oxygen. The purging gas can include an inert gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">Integrated circuit field effect transistors may be fabricated, according to some embodiments of the invention, by forming a gate dielectric layer of the transistor including titanium tantalum oxide on a substrate, forming a gate electrode on the gate dielectric layer, and forming source and/or drain regions, for example, by implanting impurities into the substrate using the gate electrode as a mask. In order to form the gate dielectric layer of the transistor, a first reacting material, a second reacting material, and a purge gas are discontinuously introduced onto the substrate, and a portion of the first reacting material and the second reacting material are chemisorbed onto the substrate. At least some non-chemisorbed first and second reacting materials are purged from the substrate. The first reacting material can include a tantalum precursor and a titanium precursor, and the second reacting material can include oxygen. The purging gas can include an inert gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">According to embodiments of the present invention, a thin film layer may be formed to include titanium tantalum oxide so that the dielectric constant of the thin film layer may be increased, and the step coverage and leakage current characteristic thereof also can be improved. Further, the titanium tantalum oxide thin film layer may form the dielectric layer of a capacitor and/or the gate oxide layer of a transistor. Therefore, thin films according to embodiments of the present invention can be widely used in semiconductor devices having a high degree of integration.</div>

Also, each embodiment described and illustrated herein includes its complementary conductivity type embodiment as well.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1E</figref> are cross-sectional views showing a method for forming a thin film through an ALD process according to embodiments of the present invention. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a substrate <b>1</b> of semiconductor material such as silicon is disposed in a depositing chamber, conceptually shown as 3, and a first reacting material <b>2</b> including a tantalum precursor and a titanium precursor is introduced to the substrate <b>1</b>. The tantalum precursor includes TaCl<sub>5</sub>, Ta(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>, Ta(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>5</sub>, Ta(OC<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>)<sub>5</sub>, Ta(OC<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>)<sub>5</sub>, Ta(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)(OC<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, TAT-DAME (Ta(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4 </sub>[OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]), and/or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, only one tantalum precursor is used. Hereinafter, the word “DAME” is used as an abbreviation of dimethylaminoethoxide, meaning the group of —OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>—. Further, the titanium precursor includes TiCl<sub>4</sub>, Ti(OCH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, Ti(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, Ti(OC<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, Ti(OC<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, Ti(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)(OC<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, Ti(OC<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>C<sub>11</sub>H<sub>19</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, Ti(OEt<sub>2</sub>)(DAME)<sub>2</sub>, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, only one titanium precursor is used. Hereinafter, the word “OEt” is used to designate the group of —OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>—.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">In some embodiments, the tantalum precursor and the titanium precursor are introduced to the substrate <b>1</b> in a mixed state, which is referred to as a mixed precursor. Examples of the mixed precursors are TAT-DAME/Ti(OEt)<sub>2</sub>(DAME)<sub>2 </sub>(hereinafter, referred to as TT), and/or Ta(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>5</sub>/Ti(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>. The mixed precursor is preferably introduced to the substrate <b>1</b> through the same introducing line <b>5</b> in a mixed state. When the first reacting material <b>2</b> is introduced, an inert gas can be used as a carrier gas for carrying the first reacting material into the chamber <b>3</b>. The inert gas includes argon (Ar) gas, nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) gas, combinations thereof and/or other carrier gases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a first portion of the first reacting material <b>2</b> is chemisorbed (chemically absorbed) onto the substrate <b>1</b>, and therefore, a layer <b>4</b> is formed on a surface of the substrate <b>1</b>. A second portion of the first reacting material <b>2</b> is physisorbed (physically absorbed) on the upper (outer) portion of the layer <b>4</b>. That is, the second portion of the first reacting material <b>2</b> is loosely combined with the layer <b>4</b>. Continuously, the inert gas, which is used as a carrier gas of the first reacting material, is again introduced into the chamber <b>3</b> without the first reacting material <b>2</b>. As a result, the non-chemisorbed first reacting material, namely at least some of the second portion of the first reacting material, is purged out from the chamber <b>3</b> and, in some embodiments, only chemisorbed layer <b>4</b> of the first reacting material <b>2</b> remains on the substrate <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, a second reacting material <b>6</b> is introduced into the chamber <b>3</b>. The second reacting material <b>6</b> includes O<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, alcohols having —OH group, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, only a single second reacting material is used. In some embodiments, the second reacting material is introduced in an activated state by ultraviolet rays, in an activated state of a plasma, in an activated state by a remote plasma process and/or using other activation techniques. For example, an ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) gas created by a plasma generator, a plasma O<sub>2 </sub>gas, a plasma N<sub>2</sub>O gas, and/or a remote plasma O<sub>2 </sub>gas can be used as the second reacting material. Another example of the second reacting material can include an oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) gas and/or ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) gas created by an ozone generator. Then, the second reacting material <b>6</b> is reacted with the chemisorbed layer <b>4</b> of the first reacting material <b>2</b>. As a result, a solid material <b>8</b> of an atomic unit is formed on the substrate <b>1</b>. Namely, the solid material <b>8</b> including tantalum titanium is formed on the substrate <b>1</b> through reaction between the first reacting material <b>2</b> and the second reacting material <b>6</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, the inert gas is again introduced into the chamber <b>3</b>, without the second reacting material <b>6</b>, and at least some of the non-chemisorbed second reacting material <b>6</b> is purged from the chamber. As a result, the solid material <b>8</b> including tantalum titanium is completely formed on the substrate <b>1</b>. That is, a thin film having a thickness of an atomic unit (hereinafter, referred to as and atomic layer) is formed on the substrate <b>1</b>. Sequential repeating of the steps of introducing the first reacting material, purging the first reacting material, introducing the second reacting material, and purging the second reacting material can form an atomic layer <b>8</b> <i>a </i>having a desired thickness as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">Subsequently, in some embodiments, the atomic layer <b>8</b> <i>a </i>having a predetermined thickness is heat-treated to fill vacancies in the atomic layer. The heat treatment is carried out by radiating ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) ultraviolet rays at a temperature range of about 650° C. to about 700° C., by flowing activated oxygen at a temperature range of about 700° C. to about 800° C. and/or using other techniques. Therefore, the atomic layer <b>8</b> <i>a </i>can be condensed into a compact structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">As is well known, the tantalum precursor and the titanium precursor, which may be used as precursors in a conventional CVD process, may be decomposed at a high temperature. Therefore, in some embodiments, the ALD process using the tantalum precursor and the titanium precursor according to embodiments of the present invention is carried out in a temperature range of about 200° C. to about 600° C. and, in some embodiments, at a temperature of about 400° C. Further, the tantalum precursor and the titanium precursor has a higher vapor pressure than that of some other precursors, such as a halogenide precursor. Namely, the number of molecules in a vapor state of the tantalum precursor or the titanium precursor is larger than that of some other precursors. Therefore, in performing the ALD process, a larger quantity of precursor gas may be provided into the process chamber compared with the other precursors, so that a larger number of the precursor gas molecules can reach a bottom surface of a stepped portion of the atomic layer. As a result, when the tantalum precursor and the titanium precursor are used during a deposition process according to embodiments of the present invention, the layer can be deposited to have good step coverage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">In addition, since the conventional CVD process for depositing a thin film is carried out at not less than about 500° C., a heat budget of high temperature is created during the process, which may make it difficult to deposit the thin film with a thickness no more than about 20 Å. However, ALD processes according to some embodiments of the present invention can deposit the thin film with a thickness of several Ångstroms.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">As described above, embodiments of the present invention can deposit a tantalum titanium oxide (TaTiO) layer having relatively good step coverage and relatively constant thickness at a relatively low temperature. Furthermore, an atomic ratio of the tantalum and the titanium in the TaTiO layer can be controlled according to embodiments of the present invention. In one embodiment, the atomic ratio of the tantalum and the titanium is set to be about 1:0.01 to 0.2. This controlling of the atomic ratio of the tantalum and the titanium can improve a dielectric constant and/or a leakage current characteristic of the thin film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">Hereinafter, characteristics of a layer deposited by embodiments of the present invention will be described. A TaTiO layer specimen was deposited through an ALD process in which TAT-DAME was used as the tantalum precursor, Ti(OEt)<sub>2</sub>(DAME)<sub>2 </sub>was used as the titanium precursor, and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) was used as an oxidizer. A TT depositing step, a first argon (Ar) purging step, an ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) depositing step, and a second argon (Ar) purging step were carried out for 4 seconds, 4 seconds, 2 seconds, and 4 seconds, respectively. A temperature of the chamber was varied from about 200° C. to about 550° C. during the ALD process. Then, various characteristics of the TaTiO layer specimen were measured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">Relation between the Deposition Rate and the Deposition Temperature</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a graph showing a relation between a deposition temperature and a deposition rate of a tantalum titanium oxide layer deposited according to some embodiments of the present invention. The horizontal axis in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a temperature of deposition, and the vertical axis is a deposition rate (Å/cycle).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the deposition rate of the TaTiO layer has a minimum value at a temperature of about 200° C., and rapidly increases at a temperature of 450° C., which indicates that the TaTiO layer shows ALD characteristics in a temperature range of about 200° C. to about 450° C., and shows CVD characteristics at a temperature of about 450° C. or more. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the TaTiO layer is deposited at a temperature less than about 450° C. and, in other embodiments, in a temperature range of about 250° C. to about 350° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">Relation between Number of Deposition Cycles and a Layer Thickness</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a graph showing a relation between a thickness of the TaTiO layer and the number of deposition cycles thereof according to some embodiments of the present invention. The horizontal axis of the graph as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is number of deposition cycles and the vertical axis is layer thickness. The deposition process was carried out at a temperature of about 400° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, since the TaTiO layer shows the ALD characteristics around the temperature of 400° C., the thickness of the layer is linearly increased as the number of deposition cycles is increased. Therefore, the TaTiO layer deposited through the ALD process using the TT and the ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), can have good thickness controllability and superior uniformity, and can also be reduce a pattern-loading effect. In addition, the TaTiO layer can provide good step coverage of no less than about 90% in a structure having an aspect ratio no less than about 10:1, in some embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">Relation between Post Heat Treatment and Crystallization of a Thin Film</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a graph showing a crystal density of the TaTiO layer before and after a heat treatment. An X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis apparatus was used for measuring the crystal density. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, curve A shows the crystal density of the TaTiO layer before a heat treatment. Curve B shows the crystal density of the TaTiO layer after the heat treatment wherein activated oxygen is introduced at a temperature of about 650° C. Curve C shows the crystal density of the TaTiO layer after the heat treatment wherein activated oxygen is introduced at a temperature of about 700° C. The horizontal axis is the diffraction angle, also called a Bragg diffraction angle, and the vertical axis is an intensity of emitted ions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, it can be seen that a state of the TaTiO layer as shown in curve A and curve B is amorphous, and a state of the TaTiO layer in curve C is not amorphous since the curve C shows at least one peak. The peak points of the curve C are formed since the state of the TaTiO layer is transferred from the amorphous state into a crystal structure of an orthorhombic system when activated oxygen is introduced at a temperature of about 700° C. Therefore, ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) radiation in a temperature range of about 650° C. to about 750° C. or heat treatment wherein activated oxygen is introduced at a temperature of about 700° C. to about 800° C. may be used for depositing the TaTiO layer of a compact crystal structure. Furthermore, tantalum oxide (TaO) is found at the peak points of the curve C, which appears to indicate that the TaTiO layer is not formed of chemical bonds of Ta—Ti or Ta—Ti—O but, rather, chemical bonds of Ta—O and Ti—O independent from each other. In experiments related to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the chemical bond of Ti—O was rare, which apparently is not because Ti—O bond does not exist in the TaTiO layer but, rather, appears to be because the number of Ta atoms is relatively larger than that of the Ti atoms.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">Depth Profile of a Thin Film</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a graph showing a relation between an etching time and ion density emitted from the cross-sectional surface of the TaTiO layer deposited by embodiments of the present invention. The graph is formed based on data measured by time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometer (TOF-SIMS). The horizontal axis is an etching time, and the vertical axis is intensity of ions that is emitted from an etched cross-sectional surface per unit time. A specimen TaTiO layer of the <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> was deposited according to the above-described method after a nitride layer was deposited on a silicon substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the chemical bond of TaO and TiO was uniformly detected irrespective of the TaTiO layer depth. Therefore, the TaTiO layer can be deposited to have good stoichiometric characteristics without including impurities that can be electron trap sites and/or leakage current sites.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A to 6E</figref> are cross-sectional views showing methods for fabricating a semiconductor device according to embodiments of the present invention. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, a gate dielectric layer <b>104</b>, gate electrode <b>110</b> and source/drain regions <b>116</b> <i>a </i>and <b>116</b> <i>b </i>are formed on a semiconductor substrate <b>100</b> including an active area <b>101</b> defined by an isolation region (or field area) <b>102</b>.

Namely, in some embodiments, the gate dielectric layer <b>104</b> is formed to include TaTiO through the ALD process using an activated oxidizer. Examples of the activated oxidizer may include tantalum precursors, titanium precursors, ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), plasma O<sub>2</sub>, remote plasma O<sub>2 </sub>and/or plasma N<sub>2</sub>O. The TT and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) can be used for forming the gate dielectric layer <b>104</b> including the TaTiO in some embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">The gate electrode <b>110</b> may have a polycide structure including a polysilicon layer <b>106</b> doped with impurities and a silicide layer <b>108</b>.

Both the capping insulating layer <b>112</b> and the side spacer <b>114</b> may comprise silicon oxide and/or silicon nitride.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, a first insulating layer <b>118</b> comprising an oxide is formed on the whole surface of the substrate <b>100</b>. Then the first insulating layer <b>118</b> is selectively etched through a photolithography process to thereby form a contact hole <b>120</b> partially exposing the source region <b>116</b> <i>a</i>. Subsequently, a first conductive layer, for example a polysilicon layer doped with phosphorus (P), is deposited in the contact hole <b>120</b> and on the first insulating layer <b>108</b>, and removed to a surface of the first insulating layer <b>118</b> through an etch-back process and/or a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, an etch stop layer <b>123</b> is formed on the contact plug <b>122</b> and/or the first insulating layer <b>118</b>. In some embodiments, the etch stop layer <b>123</b> can be formed as a high etching selectivity layer with respect to the first insulating layer <b>118</b>, such as silicon nitride (Si<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>, wherein x and y are positive numbers) layer and/or a silicon oxynitride (SiON) layer. A second insulating layer <b>124</b> comprising an oxide is formed on the etch stop layer <b>123</b>, and then is selectively etched, to thereby form an opening portion <b>126</b> exposing the contact plug <b>126</b>. In more detail, the second insulating layer <b>124</b> is selectively etched until the etch stop layer <b>123</b> is exposed, and then is still further etched, that is over-etched. As a result, the opening portion <b>126</b> is formed. A sidewall of the opening portion <b>126</b> may be formed to slope downwards so that a cross-sectional area of an opening upper portion of the opening portion <b>126</b> is larger than that of a bottom portion of the opening portion <b>126</b>, since an etching rate of the opening upper portion is different than that of the bottom portion of the opening portion due to a loading effect during the etching process. Then, a second conductive layer <b>127</b> is deposited on the sidewall and on the bottom surface of the opening portion <b>126</b> and on a surface of the second insulating layer <b>124</b>. The second conductive layer <b>127</b> comprises a semiconductor material such as polysilicon, rare metals, such as ruthenium (Ru), platinum (Pt), Iridium (Ir) and the like, or conductive metal nitride, such as titanium nitride (TiN), tantalum nitride (TaN) and/or tungsten nitride (WN).</div>

Accordingly, the second conductive layer <b>127</b> deposited on a surface of the second insulating layer <b>124</b> is removed, and only the second conductive layer <b>127</b> deposited along an inside profile of the opening portion <b>126</b> remains so that the second conductive layer <b>127</b> is separated into respective cell units of the substrate.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">A dielectric layer <b>130</b> of the capacitor including TaTiO is formed on the lower electrode layer <b>128</b> through an ALD process according to some embodiments of the present invention using activated oxides, such as tantalum precursors, titanium precursors, ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), plasma oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), remote plasma oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and/or plasma N<sub>2</sub>O.

Four groups of capacitors, a first to a fourth sample capacitors, were put into the experiment for measuring the leakage current of the capacitor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">The first sample capacitor was formed through the process as described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A to 6E</figref>. First, a surface of the lower electrode layer including polysilicon doped with phosphorus (P) was nitrified through the RTP process. Then, a first TaTiO atomic layer was formed to a thickness of 20 Å on the lower electrode layer at a temperature range of about 200° C. to about 400° C. by using the TT and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), and a first heat treatment was carried out on the first TaTiO atomic layer by using UV-O<sub>3 </sub>at a temperature of about 700° C. A second TaTiO atomic layer was formed to a thickness of 35 Å on the first TaTiO layer through an in situ multi-layer process by using the TT and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), and a second heat treatment was carried out on the second TaTiO atomic layer by using the UV-O<sub>3 </sub>under the same conditions as the first heat treatment. Therefore, the TaTiO dielectric layer was formed of two atomic layers. Subsequently, a titanium nitride (TiN) layer was deposited on the TaTiO dielectric layer by using source gases, such as TiCl<sub>4 </sub>or NH<sub>3</sub>, and a P-doped polysilicon layer was deposited on the titanium nitride (TiN) layer. Thus, an upper electrode layer of capacitor was formed as a composite layer of TiN/polysilicon.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, it can be noted that the effective thickness is increased when the thickness of the dielectric layer is about 55 Å, which indicates that the capacitance of the capacitor can be improved by forming the capacitor to have a thickness of dielectric layer at which the effective thickness is minimized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">According to embodiments of the present invention, a thin film of superior leakage current characteristic may be formed to have a high dielectric constant and good step coverage, which can be used in semiconductor devices including minute patterns.

In addition, the thin film may be hardly oxidized on a lower electrode layer having a high aspect ratio. Furthermore, the thin film can also be used as a gate dielectric layer of a transistor that can reduce or minimize oxidation on a boundary surface. Therefore, the reliability of the semiconductor device can be improved by forming a thin film using the above-described methods.</div>
