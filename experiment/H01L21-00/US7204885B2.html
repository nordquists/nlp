<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This application is a Divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 09/642,976, filed Aug. 18, 2000, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,451,692, which is incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates generally to chemical vapor deposition, and in particular to methods for chemical vapor deposition including preheating of the chemical vapor deposition precursors, systems to perform the methods, and apparatus produced by such methods.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Semiconductor integrated circuits (ICs) contain individual devices that are typically coupled together using metal line interconnects and various contacts. In many applications, the metal lines are formed on a different level than the devices, separated by an intermetal dielectric, such as silicon oxide or borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG). Commonly used metal lines include aluminum, tungsten and copper, as well as combinations of these materials with refractory metals and silicon. Interconnects used to electrically couple devices and metal lines are formed between the individual devices and the metal lines. A typical interconnect is composed of a contact hole (i.e. opening) formed in an intermetal dielectric layer over an active device region. The contact hole is often filled with a metal, such as aluminum or tungsten.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Interconnects often further contain a diffusion barrier layer sandwiched between the interconnect metal and the active device region at the bottom of the contact hole. Such layers prevent intermixing of the metal and the material from the active device region, such as silicon. Reducing intermixing generally extends the life of the device. Passive titanium nitride (TiN) layers are commonly used as diffusion barrier layers. An example may include the use of titanium nitride interposed between a silicide contact and a metal fill within a contact hole. Further uses of diffusion barrier layers may include a barrier layer interposed between a polysilicon layer and a metal layer in a gate stack of a field effect transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Titanium nitride is a desirable barrier layer because it is an impermeable barrier for silicon, and because it presents a high barrier to the diffusion of other impurities. Titanium nitride has relatively high chemical and thermodynamic stability and a relatively low resistivity. Titanium nitride layers are also often used as adhesion layers, such as for tungsten films. While titanium nitride can be formed on the substrate by physical vapor deposition (PVD) or chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques, CVD is often the technique of choice.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">CVD is a process in which a deposition surface is contacted with vapors of volatile chemical compounds, generally at elevated temperatures. The compounds, or CVD precursors, are reduced or dissociated at the deposition surface, resulting in an adherent coating of a preselected composition. In contrast to physical deposition, CVD does not require high vacuum systems and permits a wide variety of processing environments, including low pressure through atmospheric pressure, and is an accepted method for depositing homogeneous films over large areas and on non-planar surfaces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">CVD is often classified into various types in accordance with the heating method, gas pressure, and/or chemical reaction. For example, conventional CVD methods include cold-wall CVD, in which only a deposition substrate is heated; hot-wall CVD, in which an entire reaction chamber is heated; atmospheric CVD, in which reaction occurs at a pressure of about one atmosphere; low-pressure CVD (LPCVD) in which reaction occurs at pressures from about 10<sup>−1 </sup>to 100 torr; and plasma-assisted CVD (PACVD) and photo-assisted CVD in which the energy from a plasma or a light source activates the precursor to allow depositions at reduced substrate temperatures. Other classifications are known in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">In a typical CVD process, the substrate on which deposition is to occur is placed in a reaction chamber, and is heated to a temperature sufficient to drive the desired reaction. The reactant gases containing the CVD precursors are introduced into the reaction chamber where the precursors are transported to, and subsequently adsorbed on, the deposition surface. Surface reactions deposit nonvolatile reaction products on the deposition surface. Volatile reaction products are then evacuated or exhausted from the reaction chamber. While it is generally true that the nonvolatile reaction products are deposited on the deposition surface, and that volatile reaction products are removed, the realities of industrial processing recognize that undesirable volatile reaction products, as well as nonvolatile reaction products from secondary or side reactions, may be incorporated into the deposited layer. Integrated circuit fabrication generally includes the deposition of a variety of material layers on a substrate, and CVD may used to deposit one or more of these layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">As an example, one LPCVD process combines titanium tetrachloride (TiCl<sub>4</sub>) and ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) to deposit titanium nitride. However, LPCVD titanium nitride using these precursors has a tendency to incorporate a large amount of residual ammonium chloride in the film. This residual ammonium chloride detrimentally effects the resistivity and barrier properties of the titanium nitride layer. Once exposed to air, the residual ammonium chloride will cause the titanium nitride layer to absorb water and to form particles, both undesirable effects. It is known that residual ammonium chloride can be reduced by the use of ammonia post-flow, or annealing in an ammonia atmosphere, subsequent to deposition. However, such post-processing leads to reduced throughput and a higher risk of particle formation. It is also known that increased reaction temperatures can be used to reduce the incorporation of residual ammonium chloride. However, this, too, is detrimental as increased processing temperatures reduce the thermal budget available for subsequent processing and often lead to undesirable dopant diffusion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">For the reasons stated above, and for other reasons stated below which will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading and understanding the present specification, there is a need in the art for alternative methods of chemical vapor deposition.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">The various embodiments of the invention include chemical vapor deposition methods, chemical vapor deposition systems to perform the methods, and apparatus produced by such chemical vapor deposition methods. The methods involve preheating one or more of the reactant gases used to form a deposited layer. The reactant gases contain at least one chemical vapor deposition precursor. Heating one or more of the reactant gases prior to introduction to the reaction chamber may be used to improve physical characteristics of the resulting deposited layer, to improve the physical characteristics of the underlying substrate and/or to improve the thermal budget available for subsequent processing. One example includes the formation of a titanium nitride layer with reactant gases containing the precursors of titanium tetrachloride and ammonia. Preheating the reactant gases containing titanium tetrachloride and ammonia can reduce ammonium chloride impurity levels in the resulting titanium nitride layer, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for post-processing to remove the ammonium chloride impurity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">For one embodiment, the invention provides a method of depositing a layer of material on a substrate. The method includes heating a reactant gas containing at least one chemical vapor deposition precursor to a temperature within approximately 150° C. of an auto-reaction temperature of each chemical vapor deposition precursor of the reactant gas, introducing the heated reactant gas to a reaction chamber containing the substrate, and reacting the reactant gas in the reaction chamber. Reacting the reactant gas involves reaction of the chemical vapor deposition precursors to deposit the layer of material on the substrate. It is recognized that additional compounds may be incorporated into the layer of material, such as nonvolatile reaction products from side reactions deposited in the layer of material as well as volatile reaction products from desired or side reaction products entrapped in the layer of material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">For another embodiment, the invention provides a method of depositing a layer of material on a substrate. The method includes heating a reactant gas containing at least one chemical vapor deposition precursor to a temperature below an auto-reaction temperature of each chemical vapor deposition precursor of the reactant gas, combining the heated reactant gas and at least one additional reactant gas, introducing the combined gases to a reaction chamber containing the substrate, and reacting the combined gases in the reaction chamber. Reacting the combined gases deposits at least the layer of material on the substrate. For yet another embodiment, the additional reactant gases are also heated prior to introduction to the reaction chamber.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">For a further embodiment, the invention provides a method of depositing a layer of titanium nitride on a substrate. The method includes heating a first reactant gas containing titanium tetrachloride to a first temperature and heating a second reactant gas containing ammonia to a second temperature. The first and second temperatures are each below an auto-reaction temperature of titanium tetrachloride and ammonia. The method further includes combining the heated first and second reactant gases, introducing the combined first and second reactant gases to a reaction chamber containing the substrate, reacting the first and second reactant gases in the reaction chamber to produce titanium nitride, and depositing the titanium nitride on the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">For another embodiment, the invention provides a chemical vapor deposition system. The chemical vapor deposition system includes a gas source, a reaction chamber, a gas conduit coupled between the gas source and the reaction chamber, a heater, a gas flow temperature sensor coupled to the gas conduit between the heater and the reaction chamber, and a control system coupled to the gas flow temperature sensor and the heater. The control system is adapted to adjust energy input from the heater to the gas conduit in response to data from the gas flow temperature sensor. For yet another embodiment, the chemical vapor deposition system further includes a gas flow control valve coupled to the gas conduit. For this embodiment, the control system is further coupled to the gas flow control valve and is further adapted to control an opening of the gas flow control valve in response to data from the gas flow temperature sensor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">Further embodiments of the invention include deposition methods and chemical vapor deposition systems of varying scope, as well as apparatus making use of such deposition methods and chemical vapor deposition systems.</div>

<heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">In the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the inventions may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that process or mechanical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The terms wafer and substrate used in the following description include any base semiconductor structure. Both are to be understood as including silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) technology, silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology, thin film transistor (TFT) technology, doped and undoped semiconductors, epitaxial layers of a silicon supported by a base semiconductor structure, as well as other semiconductor structures well known to one skilled in the art. Furthermore, when reference is made to a wafer or substrate in the following description, previous process steps may have been utilized to form regions/junctions in the base semiconductor structure, and terms wafer or substrate include the underlying layers containing such regions/junctions. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims and equivalents thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a simplified schematic block diagram illustrating one embodiment of a Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) system <b>100</b> in accordance with the invention. It is to be understood that the CVD system <b>100</b> has been simplified to illustrate only those aspects of the CVD system <b>100</b> relevant for a clear understanding of the present invention, while eliminating, for the purposes of clarity, many of the elements found in a typical CVD system <b>100</b>. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that other elements are required, or at least desirable, to produce an operational CVD system <b>100</b>. However, because such elements are well known in the art, and because they do not relate to the design which is the subject of the various embodiments, a discussion of such elements is not provided herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">The design and construction of CVD systems is well known, and the present invention is applicable to any CVD system. The CVD system <b>100</b> for one embodiment comprises a cold wall reaction chamber <b>112</b>, typically constructed of stainless steel. The bottom and sides of the reaction chamber <b>112</b> may be lined with quartz to protect the walls from film deposition during the processing steps. The walls of the reaction chamber <b>112</b> may be cooled by a circulating water jacket (not shown) in conjunction with a heat exchanger (not shown). The walls are generally maintained at or below 100° C., because higher temperatures may induce the deposition of films on the walls of the reaction chamber <b>112</b>. Such depositions are undesirable because they absorb energy and effect heat distribution within the reaction chamber <b>112</b>, causing temperature gradients which adversely affect the processing steps. Furthermore, depositions on walls may flake and produce particulates that can contaminate a wafer in the reaction chamber <b>112</b>. However, such cooling of the walls of the reaction chamber <b>112</b> is within the discretion of the designer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">A wafer support table <b>114</b> or the like is located near the bottom of the reaction chamber <b>112</b>, and is used for supporting a wafer or substrate <b>116</b>. The support table <b>114</b> is generally a flat surface, typically having three or more vertical support pins <b>115</b> with low thermal mass. The support table <b>114</b> may be heated to help reduce temperature variations on the supported substrate <b>116</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">A wafer handling system <b>118</b> is adjacent to the reaction chamber <b>112</b>, and includes a wafer cassette <b>120</b> and a wafer handler <b>122</b>. The wafer cassette <b>120</b> holds a plurality of wafers (substrates <b>116</b>), and the wafer handler <b>122</b> transports one wafer at a time from the wafer cassette <b>120</b> to the wafer support table <b>114</b>, and back again. A door <b>124</b> isolates the wafer handling system <b>118</b> from the reaction chamber <b>112</b> when the wafers are not being transported to and from the wafer support table <b>114</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">A showerhead <b>126</b> introduces reactant gases <b>127</b> into the reaction chamber <b>112</b>, and a plurality of light sources <b>128</b> heat the substrate <b>116</b>. For the purposes of this description, the embodiment will be described in terms of light sources <b>128</b>, although other sources of heating a substrate <b>116</b>, such as RF and microwave energy, are known and applicable to the present invention. In addition, the showerhead <b>126</b> is depicted to be above the surface of substrate <b>116</b>, although showerhead <b>126</b> may optionally be disposed to the side of substrate <b>116</b> as well as underneath substrate <b>116</b>. Furthermore, distribution devices other than showerhead <b>126</b> may be used to introduce and distribute reactant gases <b>127</b> to the reaction chamber <b>112</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">One or more gas sources <b>130</b>A–B are coupled to the showerhead <b>126</b> to provide one or more of the reactant gases <b>127</b> to be disbursed by the showerhead <b>126</b> within the reaction chamber <b>112</b>. More than one type of gas may be available from each gas source <b>130</b>, and reactant gases <b>127</b> may be provided to the showerhead <b>126</b> individually or in combination.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">Each reactant gas includes at least one CVD precursor. Examples of CVD precursors include titanium tetrachloride and ammonia. These precursors can be combined to deposit titanium nitride. In a pyrolysis system, the reactant gases may require only one CVD precursor. An example of such a system includes silane (SiH<sub>4</sub>) which can be used to deposit silicon (Si) without further precursors. Although the term “reactant gas” is used, one or more of the reactant gases <b>127</b> may include a carrier, or non-reactive, gas. Examples of carrier gases include nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>), argon (Ar), helium (He), and other non-reactive gases used in the art of chemical vapor deposition. CVD system <b>100</b> may further include additional gas sources providing only carrier gases. </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">Gas flow control valves <b>132</b>A and <b>132</b>B control the flow of gases from gas sources <b>130</b>A and <b>130</b>B, respectively, through gas conduits <b>133</b>A and <b>133</b>B, respectively. Gas conduits represent a flow path for the reactant gases <b>127</b> between the gas sources <b>130</b> and the reaction chamber <b>112</b>. Gas conduits include such things as piping between elements of the CVD system <b>100</b> as well as spaces or channels for gas flow within elements of the CVD system <b>100</b>. Gas conduits <b>133</b>A and <b>133</b>B merge at combination node <b>135</b> to become a single gas conduit <b>137</b>, thus combining the gases from gas sources <b>130</b>A and <b>130</b>B. Gas conduits <b>133</b>A and <b>133</b>B can be thought of as inputs to combination node <b>135</b>, while gas conduit <b>137</b> can be thought of as an output of combination node <b>135</b>. One example of combination node <b>135</b> includes a simple Y-fitting of piping making up the gas conduits. Another example of combination node <b>135</b> includes a gas manifold allowing selection of reactant and carrier gases from a variety of gas sources. Gas conduit <b>137</b> may contain a static mixer or other mixing element to improve homogeneity of the reactant gases <b>127</b>. For one embodiment, the gas conduits <b>133</b>A and <b>133</b>B are not merged outside the reaction chamber. For this embodiment, the gases from gas sources <b>130</b>A and <b>130</b>B are combined subsequent to heating, but within the reaction chamber <b>112</b>. One example includes a heated showerhead <b>126</b> having separate flow channels <b>129</b> for each reactant gas <b>127</b>, thus heating the reactant gases <b>127</b> prior to combination in the reaction chamber <b>112</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">Heaters <b>134</b>A and <b>134</b>B supply energy to the gas conduits <b>133</b>A and <b>133</b>B, respectively, and thus supply energy to the flow of gases from gas sources <b>130</b>A and <b>130</b>B, respectively. Heaters <b>134</b> may be any heater or heat exchanger capable of supplying energy to the gas conduits <b>133</b> in order to produce a rise in temperature to the gases from gas sources <b>130</b>. Supplying energy to the gas conduits <b>133</b> may include passing radiation or other energy through the gas conduits <b>133</b> that is absorbed by gases within the gas conduits <b>133</b>. Examples of heaters <b>134</b> include resistive heat tracing, IR radiation sources or other electric heaters as well as direct-fired, jacketed or wrapped heat exchangers. Heating thus involves raising the gas temperature above an ambient temperature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">Gas flow temperature sensors <b>136</b>A and <b>136</b>B sense the temperature of the flow of gases from gas sources <b>130</b>A and <b>130</b>B, respectively. For one embodiment, gas flow temperature sensors <b>136</b> sense the temperature of the flow of gases directly from the gas flow. For another embodiment, gas flow temperature sensors <b>136</b> sense the temperature of one or more portions of heaters <b>134</b> and derive the temperature of the flow of gases from the heater temperatures and the theoretical approach temperatures predicted by the physical characteristics of the heaters <b>134</b>, conduits <b>133</b> and reactions gases <b>127</b>. For one embodiment, gas flow temperature is sensed after combination of the reactant gases <b>127</b> in addition to being sensed prior to combination as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. For a further embodiment, gas flow temperature is sensed only after combination of the reactant gases <b>127</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">Jacket <b>144</b> may be used downstream of heaters <b>134</b> to reduce any tendency of the gases to condense prior to reaching reaction chamber <b>112</b>. Jacket <b>144</b> may be a simple insulative jacket to control energy loss of reactant gases <b>127</b> by conduction. Alternatively, jacket <b>144</b> may control energy loss by supplying additional energy input to the reactant gases <b>127</b>, as described with reference to heaters <b>134</b>, in addition to or in lieu of providing insulation. Heaters <b>134</b> and jacket <b>144</b> maybe separate units, as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, or they may be a single unit supplying energy to reactant gases <b>127</b> before and after combination. Although not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, jacket <b>144</b>, if not merely an insulative jacket, may be coupled to the control system <b>146</b>, described below, for control of energy input by jacket <b>144</b>. In a similar manner, showerhead <b>126</b> may be adapted to supply energy to the reactant gases <b>127</b>, as described with reference to heaters <b>134</b> and jacket <b>144</b>, in addition to or in lieu of heaters <b>134</b> and jacket <b>144</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">Jacket <b>144</b> is coupled to at least gas conduit <b>137</b> to control energy loss of reactant gases <b>127</b> between combination node <b>135</b> and reaction chamber <b>112</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, jacket <b>144</b> may be further coupled to at least a portion of gas conduits <b>133</b> extending between heaters <b>134</b> and combination node <b>135</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">Exhaust gases are removed from the reaction chamber <b>112</b>, and a vacuum may be created within the reaction chamber <b>112</b>, by a gas exhaust and vacuum system <b>142</b>, as is well known in the art. Also present is a wafer temperature sensor <b>138</b>, such as a pyrometer, which is used to measure the temperature of the substrate <b>116</b> through a window <b>140</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">A control system <b>146</b> monitors and controls the various elements that make up the CVD system <b>100</b>, such as the wafer handler <b>122</b>, the gas flow control valves <b>132</b>, the heaters <b>134</b>, the gas flow temperature sensors <b>136</b>, the wafer temperature sensor <b>138</b>, and the gas exhaust and vacuum system <b>142</b>. Control system <b>146</b> is in communication with the various elements of CVD system <b>100</b> such that process information is passed from these elements to control system <b>146</b> through communication lines, and process control information is passed from control system <b>146</b> to various elements of CVD system <b>100</b> through communication lines. It is noted that communications may be bidirectional across a communication line. Control system <b>146</b> may include distributed and centralized computerized industrial process control systems, as are well known in the art. Such control systems generally include a machine-readable medium containing instructions capable of causing the control system, or more directly, a processor within the control system, to monitor and control the various elements coupled to the control system. Examples of such machine-readable medium include random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), optical storage mediums, magnetic tape drives, and magnetic disk drives. The machine-readable medium may be fixed, such as an installed hard drive or memory module, or removable, such as a magnetic diskette or data cartridge.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">Data indicating the temperature of the substrate <b>116</b> is generated by the wafer temperature sensor <b>138</b>, and is used by the control system <b>146</b> to adjust the intensity of the light sources <b>128</b> so as to produce a desired wafer temperature. Data indicating the temperature of the gas flow from gas sources <b>130</b> is generated by the gas flow temperature sensors <b>136</b>, and is used by the control system <b>146</b> to adjust the energy input of heaters <b>134</b>, jacket <b>144</b> (if not a simple insulative jacket) and/or the flow rate of flow control valves <b>132</b> (reductions in flow rate can be used to increase the gas flow temperature at a given energy input).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">In addition, multiple wafer temperature sensors <b>138</b> may be used to sense the temperature of different regions of the substrate <b>116</b>. That data may be used by the control system <b>146</b> to selectively adjust the intensity of some of the light sources <b>128</b> so as to compensate for uneven heating of the substrate <b>116</b>. The control system <b>146</b> also controls when and what gases are provided to the showerhead <b>126</b>, as well as when exhaust gases are removed from the reaction chamber <b>112</b>, in a known manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">The operation of the CVD system <b>100</b> will be described with reference to the deposition of titanium nitride (TiN) from titanium tetrachloride (TiCl<sub>4</sub>) and ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>). However, the invention is not limited to this chemical system. Other reactant gases may utilized to form layers of TiN as well as layers having other compositions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">For one embodiment, gas source <b>130</b>A provides titanium tetrachloride and gas source <b>130</b>B provides ammonia. Flow control valve <b>132</b>A controls the flow of titanium tetrachloride from gas source <b>130</b>A as directed by control system <b>146</b> in response to a desired titanium nitride deposition rate. Flow control valve <b>132</b>B controls the flow of ammonia from gas source <b>130</b>B as directed by control system <b>146</b> in response to the desired titanium nitride deposition rate. Gas flow may be directly controlled by the control system <b>146</b> by producing a set opening of a flow control valve <b>132</b> based on a desired deposition rate. Alternatively, gas flow may be indirectly controlled by the control system <b>146</b> by utilizing a feedback controller (not shown) and producing a flow rate setpoint for the feedback controller which, in turn, controls the opening of a flow control valve <b>132</b>. Control of gas flows may be responsive to other factors in addition to or in lieu of a desired deposition rate. As one example, flow of titanium tetrachloride may be responsive to a desired deposition rate while flow of ammonia may be responsive to a desired ammonia concentration in the reaction chamber <b>112</b>. To extend this example, the flow of ammonia may have a maximum limit such that an ammonia concentration calling for ammonia flow rates above the maximum limit may direct a reduction in titanium tetrachloride flow rate despite being lower than expected for the desired deposition rate. As a further example, control of both flow rates may be responsive to desired concentrations within the reaction chamber <b>112</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">Energy is supplied by heaters <b>134</b>A and <b>134</b>B to the gases from gas sources <b>130</b>A and <b>130</b>B, respectively, prior to combination of the gases for this embodiment. It is generally preferred to heat the gases prior to combination in order to reduce the probability of forming an adduct or inclusion complex of the gas molecules. Combining gases cold may lead to formation of an adduct. It is preferred to avoid forming an adduct as the adduct may require excessive or undesirable energy input to break the association of the individual gas molecules. Adducts having a negative effect on deposition may form between a precursor and other constituents of the reactant gases, e.g., another precursor or a carrier gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">For one embodiment, one or more of the gases from gas sources <b>130</b>A and <b>130</b>B are heated to a temperature below the auto-reaction temperature, or the lowest temperature at which at least one precursor will react without further energy input, prior to introduction to the reaction chamber <b>112</b>. For another embodiment, the gases from gas sources <b>130</b>A and <b>130</b>B are each heated to a temperature within approximately 150° C. of the auto-reaction temperature prior to introduction. For a further embodiment, the gases from gas sources <b>130</b>A and <b>130</b>B are each heated to a temperature within approximately 50° C. of the auto-reaction temperature prior to introduction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">For yet another embodiment, one or more of the gases from gas sources <b>130</b>A and <b>130</b>B are heated to a temperature at or above which they generally will not form an adduct when combined. For a further embodiment, the gases from gas sources <b>130</b>A and <b>130</b>B are each heated, prior to combination, to a temperature at least approximately 50° C. above the temperature at which they generally will not form an adduct. It is recognized that the auto-reaction temperature and the temperature above which the gases will generally not form an adduct are dependent upon the pressure chosen for operation of the CVD system <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">When only one reactant gas is heated, its temperature should be chosen such that, when combined with other reactant or carrier gases, no adduct will form and auto-reaction will not occur. While temperatures approaching the auto-reaction temperature, and diverging from conditions favoring adducts, are preferred, the designer should recognize that hot spots within the heaters may lead to localized reaction if a temperature too close the auto-reaction temperature is chosen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">For one embodiment, the temperature of each reactant gas is adjusted to be substantially equal at the time of combination. For another embodiment, the range of temperatures of the reactant gases has a magnitude of at least approximately 10° C. at the time of combination. When the temperatures of the various reactant gases are not substantially equal at the time of combination, temperatures should be chosen such that, when combined, no adduct will form and auto-reaction will not occur.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">For an embodiment utilizing the precursors of titanium tetrachloride and ammonia to form titanium nitride, and a CVD system <b>100</b> operating at a chamber pressure of approximately 0.2–10 torr and a substrate temperature of 450–650° C., the titanium tetrachloride and the ammonia are each heated to a temperature in the range of approximately 200–300° F. (90–150° C.) prior to combination. Typical flow rates under these conditions may be 10–50 sccm for titanium tetrachloride and 50–150 sccm for ammonia. For a specific embodiment, the chamber pressure is approximately 1 torr, the substrate temperature is approximately 580° C., the titanium tetrachloride flow rate is approximately 30 sccm and the ammonia flow rate is approximately 100 sccm. It has been reported that reaction of titanium tetrachloride and ammonia can be effected at temperatures as low as 200° C. Therefore, the substrate temperature chosen to drive the reaction at the surface of the substrate should not be confused with the auto-reaction temperature of the precursors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">For one embodiment, the temperature of the reactant gas containing the titanium tetrachloride and the temperature of the reactant gas containing the ammonia are substantially equal at the time of combination. For another embodiment, the difference between the temperature of the reactant gas containing the titanium tetrachloride and the temperature of the reactant gas containing the ammonia has a magnitude of at least approximately 10° C. at the time of combination. The temperature of the gases before and after combination is maintained by jacket <b>144</b>. For one embodiment, the temperature of the gases after combination is further raised by jacket <b>144</b> in accordance with the above guidelines relating to the auto-reaction temperature, i.e., maintaining the gas temperature below the auto-reaction temperature prior to introduction to the reaction chamber <b>112</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">The heated reactant gases <b>127</b> enter the reaction chamber <b>112</b> where the precursors are transported to the surface of the substrate <b>116</b>. The reactant gases <b>127</b> react to deposit a layer of material on the surface of the substrate <b>116</b>. In more detail, the precursors of the reactant gases <b>127</b> are adsorbed on the surface of the substrate <b>116</b> where they react and deposit, in this case, titanium nitride. Heating the reactant gases <b>127</b> prior to introduction to the reaction chamber <b>112</b> as described above has been shown to reduce the formation of ammonium chloride in deposited titanium nitride layers, thus reducing or eliminating the need for an ammonia post-flow procedure. Reducing the formation of impurities during deposition can also permit deposition at reduced chamber temperatures, thus reducing undesirable diffusion within the substrate and improving the thermal budget available for subsequent processing. Accordingly, reactant gas preheating may be used to improve physical characteristics of the resulting deposited layer, to improve the physical characteristics of the underlying substrate and/or to improve the thermal budget available for subsequent processing. Furthermore, a given impurity level may be attained at reduced thermal input to the substrate, thus reducing undesirable diffusion of implants in integrated circuit devices.</div>

<heading>CONCLUSION </heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">Chemical vapor deposition methods utilizing preheating of one or more of the reactant gases used to form deposited layers, chemical vapor deposition systems to perform the methods, and apparatus containing deposited layers produced using the methods have been described herein. The reactant gases include at least one chemical vapor deposition precursor. Heating one or more of the reactant gases prior to introduction to the reaction chamber may be used to improve physical characteristics of the resulting deposited layer, to improve the physical characteristics of the underlying substrate and/or to improve the thermal budget available for subsequent processing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">One example includes the formation of a titanium nitride layer with reactant gases including the precursors of titanium tetrachloride and ammonia. Preheating these reactant gases prior to introduction to the reaction chamber can reduce ammonium chloride levels in the resulting titanium nitride layer, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for post-processing to remove the ammonium chloride impurity. Chemical vapor deposition systems as described herein include one or more heaters to raise the temperature of the reactant gases prior to introduction to the reaction chamber.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">Although specific embodiments have been illustrated and described herein, it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that any arrangement which is calculated to achieve the same purpose may be substituted for the specific embodiments shown. Many adaptations of the invention will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, a chemical vapor deposition system may further include a heater for a carrier gas to raise the temperature of the carrier gas prior to combination with a precursor gas or other reactant gas. Furthermore, the heated carrier gas may be combined with a first, unheated, reactant gas, with the heated carrier gas supplying the energy input necessary to raise the temperature of the combined reactant gas to a desired level in lieu of direct heating of the first reactant gas.
