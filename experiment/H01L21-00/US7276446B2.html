<heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates to planarizing solutions, planarizing machines and methods for planarizing microelectronic-device substrate assemblies using mechanical and/or chemical-mechanical planarization processes.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Mechanical and chemical-mechanical planarizing processes (collectively “CMP”) are used in the manufacturing of microelectronic devices for forming a flat surface on semiconductor wafers, field emission displays and many other microelectronic-device substrate assemblies. CMP processes generally remove material from a substrate assembly to create a highly planar surface at a precise elevation in the layers of material on the substrate assembly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically illustrates an existing web-format planarizing machine <b>10</b> for planarizing a substrate assembly <b>12</b>. The planarizing machine <b>10</b> has a support table <b>14</b> with a top panel <b>16</b> at a workstation where an operative portion (A) of a polishing pad <b>40</b> is positioned. The top panel <b>16</b> is generally a rigid plate to provide a flat, solid surface to support the operative section of the polishing pad <b>40</b> during planarization.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">The planarizing machine <b>10</b> also has a plurality of rollers to guide, position and hold the polishing pad <b>40</b> over the top panel <b>16</b>. The rollers include a supply roller <b>20</b>, first and second idler rollers <b>21</b> <i>a </i>and <b>21</b> <i>b</i>, first and second guide rollers <b>22</b> <i>a </i>and <b>22</b> <i>b</i>, and a take-up roller <b>23</b>. The supply roller <b>20</b> carries an unused or preoperative portion of the polishing pad <b>40</b>, and the take-up roller <b>23</b> carries a used or post-operative portion of the polishing pad <b>40</b>. Additionally, the first idler roller <b>21</b> <i>a </i>and the first guide roller <b>22</b> <i>a </i>stretch the polishing pad <b>40</b> over the top panel <b>16</b> to hold the polishing pad <b>40</b> stationary during operation. A drive motor (not shown) drives at least one of the supply roller <b>20</b> and the take-up roller <b>23</b> to sequentially advance the polishing pad <b>40</b> across the top panel <b>16</b>. As such, clean preoperative sections of the polishing pad <b>40</b> may be quickly substituted for used sections to provide a consistent surface for planarizing the substrate assembly <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">The web-format planarizing machine <b>10</b> also has a carrier assembly <b>30</b> that controls and protects the substrate assembly <b>12</b> during planarization. The carrier assembly <b>30</b> generally has a carrier head <b>31</b> with a plurality of vacuum holes <b>32</b> to pick up and release the substrate assembly <b>12</b> at appropriate stages of the planarizing cycle. A plurality of nozzles <b>41</b> attached to the carrier head <b>31</b> dispense a planarizing solution <b>42</b> onto a planarizing surface <b>43</b> of the polishing pad <b>40</b>. The carrier assembly <b>30</b> also generally has a support gantry <b>34</b> carrying a drive assembly <b>35</b> that translates along the gantry <b>34</b>. The drive assembly <b>35</b> generally has actuator <b>36</b>, a drive shaft <b>37</b> coupled to the actuator <b>36</b>, and an arm <b>38</b> projecting from the drive shaft <b>37</b>. The arm <b>38</b> carries the carrier head <b>31</b> via another shaft <b>39</b> such that the drive assembly <b>35</b> orbits the carrier head <b>31</b> about an axis B-B offset from a center point C-C of the substrate assembly <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">The polishing pad <b>40</b> and the planarizing solution <b>42</b> define a planarizing medium that mechanically and/or chemically-mechanically removes material from the surface of the substrate assembly <b>12</b>. The web-format planarizing machine <b>10</b> typically uses a fixed-abrasive polishing pad having a plurality of abrasive particles fixedly bonded to a suspension material. The planarizing solutions <b>42</b> used with fixed-abrasive pads are generally “clean solutions” without abrasive particles because the abrasive particles in conventional abrasive CMP slurries may ruin the abrasive surface of fixed-abrasive pads. In other applications, the polishing pad <b>40</b> may be a nonabrasive pad composed of a polymeric material (e.g., polyurethane), a resin, or other suitable materials without abrasive particles. The planarizing solutions <b>42</b> used with nonabrasive polishing pads are typically “abrasive” CMP slurries with abrasive particles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">To planarize the substrate assembly <b>12</b> with the planarizing machine <b>10</b>, the carrier assembly <b>30</b> presses the substrate assembly <b>12</b> against the planarizing surface <b>43</b> of the polishing pad <b>40</b> in the presence of the planarizing solution <b>42</b>. The drive assembly <b>35</b> then orbits the carrier head <b>31</b> about the offset axis B-B to translate the substrate assembly <b>12</b> across the planarizing surface <b>43</b>. As a result, the abrasive particles and/or the chemicals in the planarizing medium remove material from the surface of the substrate assembly <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">CMP processes should consistently and accurately produce, a uniformly planar surface on the substrate assembly <b>12</b> to enable precise fabrication of circuits and photo-patterns. During the fabrication of transistors, contacts, interconnects and other components, many substrate assemblies develop large “step heights” that create a “topographical” surface across the substrate assembly <b>12</b>. For the purposes of the present application, a “topographical” surface is a non-planar surface having high and low regions. To enable the fabrication of integrated circuits with high densities of components, it is necessary to produce a highly planar surface at several stages of processing the substrate assembly <b>12</b> because even slightly topographical surfaces significantly increase the difficulty of forming submicron features. For example, it is difficult to accurately focus photo-patterns to within tolerances of 0.1 μM on topographical surfaces because submicron photolithographic equipment generally has a very limited depth of field. Thus, CMP processes ate often used to transform a topographical surface into a highly uniform, planar surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">In the competitive semiconductor industry, it is also highly desirable to produce such a uniformly planar surface at a desired endpoint on a substrate assembly. For example, when a conductive layer on the substrate assembly <b>12</b> is under-planarized in the formation of contacts or interconnects, many of these components may not be electrically isolated from one another because undesirable portions of the conductive layer may remain on the substrate assembly <b>12</b>. Additionally, when a substrate assembly <b>12</b> is over-planarized, components below the desired endpoint may be damaged or completely destroyed. Thus, to provide a high yield of operable microelectronic devices, CMP processing should remove material until the desired endpoint is reached.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">To accurately create highly planar substrate surfaces at the desired endpoint many CMP applications should initially remove material from high regions on topographical surfaces faster than low regions to change the topographical surface to a planar “blanket” surface. After creating a blanket surface on the substrate assembly, CMP applications should remove material from the blanket surface as quickly as possible without adversely affecting its planarity. The CMP processes should then stop removing material at the desired endpoint on the substrate assembly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">One problem with existing CMP techniques, however, is that it is difficult to selectively remove material from high regions on topographical surfaces without also removing significant amounts of material from low regions. It is also difficult to quickly remove material from a blanket substrate surface. For example, many existing CMP techniques that can selectively remove material from high regions on a topographical substrate surface are limited because they have very low polishing rates of the blanket surface. Such topographically selective CMP techniques are thus ineffective at expediently removing material from the blanket surface. Conversely, existing CMP techniques that have high polishing rates of blanket surfaces do not remove high regions on topographical surfaces without also removing material from low regions. Thus, existing CMP techniques generally do not provide both highly selective planarization of high regions on topographical surfaces and fast removal of material from blanket surfaces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">Another problem of CMP processing is that it is difficult to accurately stop planarization at the desired endpoint. One technique for accurately endpointing CMP processing is stop-on-feature (“SOF”) planarization in which a hard polish-stop layer of material having a relatively low polishing rate is formed on the substrate assembly so that the polish-stop layer has high points at the desired endpoint of the planarizing process. A softer cover layer of material having a higher polishing rate is then deposited over the polish-stop layer. The polish-stop layer resists planarization at the desired endpoint because the cover layer planarizes faster than exposed high points of the polish-stop layer. Even SOF planarizing techniques, however, may not accurately endpoint CMP processing because the difference in polishing rates between the cover layer and the polish-stop layer may cause “dishing” in the cover layer at contacts, damascene lines, shallow-trench-isolation structures, and other areas one the substrate surface where the cover layer dips below the exposed surfaces of the polish-stop layer. Thus, another problem of CMP processing is accurately stopping planarization at the desired endpoint.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">The present invention is directed toward planarizing solutions, planarizing machines and methods for planarizing microelectronic-device substrate assemblies using mechanical and/or chemical-mechanical planarizing processes. In one aspect of the invention, a microelectronic-device substrate assembly is planarized by abrading material from the substrate assembly using a plurality of first abrasive particles and removing material from the substrate assembly using a plurality second abrasive particles. The first abrasive particles have a first planarizing attribute, and the second abrasive particles have a second planarizing attribute. The first and second planarizing attributes are different from one another to preferably selectively remove topographical features from the substrate assembly and/or selectively remove different types of material at the substrate surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">In one particular application of a method in accordance with the invention, the first and second abrasive particles are mixed together in a single slurry including a liquid mixture, a plurality of the first abrasive particles, and a plurality of the second abrasive particles. The single slurry is then deposited onto a polishing pad to provide an abrasive medium having both the first and second abrasive particles. Thus, during a planarizing cycle in accordance with this embodiment, the first abrasive particles abrade material from the substrate assembly at the same time that the second abrasive particles remove material from the substrate assembly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">In an alternative method in accordance with the invention, the first abrasive particles are suspended in a first planarizing solution that is deposited onto the polishing pad during the first stage of the planarizing cycle, and the second abrasive particles are suspended in a separate second planarizing solution that is deposited onto the polishing pad during a second stage of the planarizing cycle. The first and second stages of the planarizing cycle are preferably separate, distinct periods of the planarizing cycle. During the first stage of the planarizing cycle, the first solution is preferably deposited on the polishing pad to selectively remove high regions from a topographical substrate surface. During the second stage of the planarizing cycle, which occurs after the substrate surface becomes planar, the first solution is preferably removed from the polishing pad and the second solution is deposited onto the polishing pad to quickly remove material from the planar surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">In still another aspect of the invention, the first and second planarizing attributes of the first and second abrasive particles can be the particle size and/or the composition of the abrasive particles. For example, the first abrasive particles can have a first particle size distribution with a first mode and the second abrasive particles can have a second particle size distribution with a second mode. The first and second particle size distributions are preferably selected so that the first abrasive particles selectively planarize high regions on topographical substrate surfaces and the second abrasive particles quickly planarize blanket substrate surfaces. Alternatively, the first abrasive particles can be composed of a first material and the second abrasive particles can be composed of a second material. The first and second materials are preferably selected so that the first abrasive particles aggressively planarize a first type of material on the substrate assembly and the second abrasive particles planarize a second type of material on the substrate assembly either more or less aggressively than the first type of material. The first abrasive particles can also have a first particle size distribution with a first mode and be composed of a first material, and the second abrasive particles can also have a second particle size distribution with a second mode and be composed of a second material.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">The present invention is directed toward planarizing solutions, planarizing machines and methods for planarizing microelectronic-device substrate assemblies using mechanical and/or chemical-mechanical planarization processes. Many specific details of certain embodiments of the invention are set forth in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-9</figref> and the following description to provide a thorough understanding of such embodiments. One skilled in the art, however, will understand that the present invention may have additional embodiments, or that certain embodiments of the invention may be practiced without several of the details described the following description.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic view of a planarizing solution <b>142</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the invention for selectively removing material from a substrate assembly. In this embodiment, the planarizing solution <b>142</b> includes a liquid mixture <b>144</b>, a plurality of first abrasive particles <b>146</b>, and a plurality of second abrasive particles <b>148</b>. The liquid mixture <b>144</b> is preferably composed of water, solvents, surfactants, dispersants, oxidants and/or other suitable additives for CMP planarizing solutions. In this embodiment, the first and second abrasive particles <b>146</b> and <b>148</b> are preferably composed of the same material, but, as explained below, they can also be composed of different materials. Suitable materials for the first and second abrasive particles <b>146</b> and <b>148</b> include aluminum oxide, ceria, silicon dioxide, titanium oxide, titania, tantalum oxide, ceria treated silica, silica and/or other suitable abrasive particles for removing material from microelectronic device substrate assemblies.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">The first and second planarizing particles <b>146</b> and <b>148</b> have specific planarizing attributes that control certain aspects of the planarizing process. More particularly, the first abrasive particles <b>146</b> have a first planarizing attribute that imparts a desired planarizing property to the first abrasive particles <b>146</b>, and the second abrasive particles <b>148</b> have a second planarizing attribute that imparts a different planarizing property to the second abrasive particles <b>148</b>. In this particular embodiment, the first and second planarizing attributes of the first and second abrasive particles <b>146</b> and <b>148</b> are the particle sizes of the first and second abrasive particles <b>146</b> and <b>148</b>. The first abrasive particles <b>146</b>, for example, have smaller particle sizes relative to the second abrasive particles <b>148</b>. The planarizing solution <b>142</b> is accordingly a bi-modal solution in which the first abrasive particles <b>146</b> have particle sizes in a first particle size distribution with a first mode and the second abrasive particles <b>148</b> have particle sizes in a second particle size distribution with a second mode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a bar graph illustrating one embodiment of the first and second particle size distributions for the first and second abrasive particles <b>146</b> and <b>148</b> of the planarizing solution <b>142</b>. The first abrasive particles <b>146</b> can have a first particle size distribution <b>180</b> between 0.020 μm and 0.20 μm with a first mode <b>182</b> at approximately 0.10 μm. The second abrasive particles <b>148</b> can have a second particle size distribution <b>190</b> between 0.20 μm and 1.0 μm with a second mode <b>192</b> at approximately 0.3 μm. The first and second particle size distributions <b>180</b> and <b>190</b> can also cover other ranges of particle sizes, and the particle sizes of the first and second modes <b>182</b> and <b>192</b> can also be different. For example, the first abrasive particles <b>146</b> can have a first size distribution from 0.010-0.050 μm with a first mode at approximately 0.020-0.030 μm, and the second abrasive particles <b>148</b> can have a second size distribution from 0.070-0.40 μm with second mode of approximately 0.25-0.30 μm. Moreover, the planarizing solution <b>142</b> can have more than two modes to create more than two particle size distributions. As explained below, the particular range and mode of each particle size distribution can be chosen to selectively remove high regions from topographical substrate surfaces, quickly remove material from blanket substrate surfaces, selectively remove different types of material, or impart other planarizing properties to the planarizing solution <b>142</b> according to the particular CMP application.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of a substrate assembly <b>12</b> being planarized using the planarizing solution <b>142</b> at one stage of a planarizing cycle in accordance with an embodiment of a method of the invention. In this example, the substrate assembly <b>12</b> has a base layer <b>13</b>, a polish-stop layer <b>14</b> over the base layer <b>13</b>, and a plurality of trenches <b>15</b> etched in the base layer <b>13</b> and the polish-stop layer <b>14</b>. The base layer <b>13</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is actually a microelectronic-device substrate (e.g, a silicon wafer or a glass substrate), but the base layer <b>13</b> can alternatively be a layer of material deposited on a substrate (e.g., a dielectric layer). A cover layer <b>16</b> conforms to the topography of the polish-stop layer <b>14</b> and fills the trenches <b>15</b>. At this point of the planarizing cycle, the cover layer <b>16</b> accordingly has a topographical substrate surface <b>17</b> with a plurality of first regions <b>18</b> <i>a </i>aligned with the polish-stop layer <b>14</b> and second regions <b>18</b> <i>b </i>aligned with the trenches <b>15</b>. When the substrate assembly <b>12</b> is inverted to face upward, the first regions <b>18</b> <i>a </i>are typically known as “high regions” and the second regions <b>18</b> <i>b </i>are typically known as “low regions.”</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">The substrate assembly <b>12</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is merely a schematic illustration of a semiconductor wafer at a point in a process for constructing either shallow-trench-isolation (“STI”) structures using a dielectric cover layer <b>16</b> or damascene conductive lines using a conductive cover layer <b>16</b>. It will be appreciated that the size of the features is greatly exaggerated to better explain the operation of the planarizing solution <b>142</b> during the planarizing cycle of the substrate assembly <b>12</b>. Additionally, although the planarizing solution <b>142</b> is described in the context of forming STI structures and damascene lines, it can be used to planarize substrate assemblies having many other and/or different structures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, more specifically, illustrates the substrate assembly <b>12</b> being planarized at a first stage of the planarizing cycle by moving the carrier head <b>31</b> to translate the topographical substrate surface <b>17</b> across the planarizing surface <b>43</b> of the polishing pad <b>40</b> and the planarizing solution <b>142</b>. During the first stage of the planarizing cycle, the smaller first abrasive particles <b>146</b> selectively remove material from the first regions <b>18</b> <i>a </i>much faster than they remove material from the second regions <b>18</b> <i>b</i>. The topographical selectivity of the small abrasive particles <b>146</b> creates a large difference in removal rates between the first and second regions <b>18</b> <i>a </i>and <b>18</b> <i>b </i>on the topographical substrate surface <b>17</b>. The larger second abrasive particles <b>148</b>, on the other hand, do not have such a large difference in removal rates between the first and second regions <b>18</b> <i>a </i>and <b>18</b> <i>b</i>. The smaller first abrasive particles <b>146</b> accordingly dominate the removal of material from the substrate assembly during the first stage of the planarizing cycle while the substrate assembly <b>12</b> has a topographical substrate surface <b>17</b>. As a result, many embodiments of the planarizing solution <b>142</b> selectively remove material from the first regions <b>18</b> <i>a </i>faster than the second regions <b>18</b> <i>b </i>to quickly form a planar blanket surface on the substrate assembly <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of the substrate assembly <b>12</b> during a second stage of the planarizing cycle in which the substrate assembly <b>12</b> has a planar blanket substrate surface <b>19</b>. During the second stage of the planarizing cycle, the larger second abrasive particles <b>148</b> remove material from the blanket substrate surface <b>19</b> much faster than the smaller first abrasive particles <b>146</b>. The second abrasive particles <b>148</b> accordingly dominate the second stage of the planarizing cycle to provide a high removal rate of material from the blanket substrate surface <b>19</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> together, the bi-modal planarizing solution <b>142</b> produces more uniformly planar surfaces in less time compared to “singlet slurries” that have a mono-modal particle size distribution of either small or large abrasive particles. The planarizing solution <b>142</b> produces a blanket substrate surface because the first abrasive particles <b>146</b> selectively remove material from the high regions on the topographical substrate surface much faster than the low regions. The planarizing solution <b>142</b> also quickly removes material from the blanket substrate surface because the second abrasive particles <b>148</b> have a high polishing rate for blanket substrate surfaces. In contrast to this embodiment of the bi-modal planarizing solution <b>142</b>, singlet slurries with only small abrasive particles have a very low removal rate of material from blanket substrate surfaces. Moreover, singlet slurries with only large abrasive particles may not selectively remove material from the high regions of a topographical substrate surface in a manner that produces a highly planar blanket substrate surface. Thus, compared to singlet slurries that have either only small or large abrasive particles, the bi-modal particle size planarizing solution <b>142</b> is expected to enhance the planarity and reduce the process time of CMP processing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a schematic view of a planarizing solution <b>242</b> in accordance with another embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, the planarizing solution <b>242</b> includes a liquid mixture <b>244</b>, a plurality of first abrasive particles <b>246</b>, and a plurality of second abrasive particles <b>248</b>. The liquid mixture <b>244</b> can contain the same components as the liquid mixture <b>144</b> of the planarizing solution <b>142</b>, and the first and second abrasive particles <b>246</b> and <b>248</b> can also be composed of the materials described above with respect to the first and second planarizing particles <b>146</b> and <b>148</b>. In this embodiment, however, the first planarizing particles <b>246</b> are composed of a first material and the second abrasive particles <b>248</b> are composed of a second material different than the first material of the first abrasive particles <b>246</b>. Thus, the planarizing solution <b>242</b> is a bi-material solution in which the first and second planarizing attributes of the first and second abrasive particles <b>246</b> and <b>248</b> are accordingly the first and second materials, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">It is expected that the first and second materials can be selected so that the first and second abrasive particles <b>246</b> and <b>248</b> selectively remove material from the substrate assembly according to topographical differences across the substrate surface. In one embodiment, the first abrasive particles <b>246</b> are composed of a first material that selectively removes high regions on a topographical substrate surface faster than low regions. The second abrasive particles <b>248</b> can accordingly be composed of a second material that quickly removes material from a blanket substrate surface. This embodiment of the planarizing solution <b>242</b> will thus operate in much the same manner as the bi-modal particle size planarizing solution <b>142</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">In another embodiment, the first abrasive particles <b>246</b> are composed of a first material that quickly removes the material of the cover layer on the substrate assembly. The second abrasive particles <b>248</b> of this embodiment are preferably composed of a second material that selectively removes material from the cover layer either faster or slower than the polish-stop layer to impart the desired planarizing characteristics at the endpoint. The first and second materials of the first and, second abrasive particles <b>246</b> and <b>248</b> can accordingly be selected so that the first and second abrasive particles <b>246</b> and <b>248</b> selectively remove one type of material on the substrate assembly at a different rate than another type of material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of the substrate assembly <b>12</b> being planarized with the planarizing solution <b>242</b>. The substrate assembly <b>12</b>, more particularly, is shown near the endpoint of the planarizing cycle when surfaces of the polish-stop layer <b>14</b> are exposed to isolate the remaining portions of the cover layer <b>16</b> in the trenches <b>15</b>. The planarizing solution <b>242</b> accordingly contacts both the material of the polish-stop layer <b>14</b> and the material of the cover layer <b>16</b> at this point of the planarizing cycle. It is expected that the second material of the second abrasive particles <b>248</b> can be selected so that, compared to the first abrasive particles, the second abrasive particles <b>248</b> either: (1) less aggressively planarize the material of the cover layer <b>16</b> to avoid dishing between the exposed portions of the polish-stop layer <b>14</b>; and/or (2) less aggressively planarize the polish-stop layer <b>14</b> to avoid over-planarizing beyond the surface of the polish-stop layer <b>14</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a schematic view of a planarizing solution <b>342</b> in accordance with another embodiment of the invention. The planarizing solution <b>342</b> also generally includes a liquid mixture <b>344</b>, a plurality of first abrasive particles <b>346</b>, and a plurality of second abrasive particles <b>348</b>. The liquid mixture <b>344</b> can contain the same components as the liquid mixture <b>144</b> of the planarizing solution <b>142</b>. In this embodiment, the first planarizing particles <b>346</b> have particle sizes in a first particle size distribution with a first mode, and the first abrasive particles <b>346</b> are composed of a first material. The first planarizing attribute of the first abrasive particles <b>346</b> is thus a combination of both the first particle size distribution and the first material of the abrasive particles. Additionally, the second abrasive particles <b>348</b> preferably have particle sizes in a second particle size distribution with a second mode, and the second abrasive particles <b>348</b> are preferably composed of a second material. The second planarizing attribute is thus a combination of the second particle size distribution and the second material of the second abrasive particles. The planarizing solution <b>342</b>, therefore, uses a bi-modal, bi-material solution that selectively planarizes the substrate assembly <b>12</b> according to both the topography and the material at the substrate surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">The first abrasive particles <b>346</b> preferably have a relatively small particles sizes and are composed of a material that aggressively abrades the material of the cover layer <b>16</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) on the substrate assembly <b>12</b>. The second abrasive particles <b>348</b> preferably have relatively large particle sizes and are composed of a material that removes material from the polish-stop layer <b>14</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) or the cover layer <b>16</b> less aggressively than the first abrasive particles <b>346</b>. The planarizing solution <b>342</b> can accordingly selectively remove the high regions from the cover layer <b>16</b> to quickly produce a planar blanket substrate surface on the substrate assembly <b>12</b> because the first abrasive particles <b>346</b> have relatively small particle sizes. The planarizing solution <b>342</b> can also have a high polishing rate of the blanket substrate surface because the second abrasive particles <b>348</b> have relatively large particle sizes. Moreover, the planarizing solution <b>342</b> can also selectively remove one of the cover layer <b>16</b> or the polish-stop layer <b>14</b> with respect to the other because the larger second abrasive particles <b>348</b> dominate the removal of material from the blanket substrate surface and they are composed of a material that is selective to one of these layers. The planarizing solution <b>342</b> accordingly operates in a manner that combines the characteristics of the bi-modal planarizing solution <b>142</b> and the bi-material planarizing solution <b>242</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">In one particular embodiment for forming damascene lines from a cover layer <b>16</b> composed of tungsten, the planarizing solution <b>342</b> has a small particle size distribution of first abrasive particles <b>346</b> composed of alumina or ceria and a large particle size distribution of second abrasive particles <b>348</b> composed of silica. In general, either alumina or ceria more aggressively planarizes tungsten than silica. When the tungsten cover layer <b>16</b> is topographical (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), the small alumina or ceria first particles <b>346</b> aggressively and selectively planarize the first regions <b>18</b> <i>a </i>from the tungsten cover layer <b>16</b>. After the tungsten cover layer <b>16</b> becomes planar (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), the larger silica second abrasive particles <b>348</b> dominate the removal of tungsten to maintain a relatively high polishing rate of the blanket substrate surface even though silica is less aggressive to tungsten than alumina or ceria. Additionally, as the blanket surface reaches the endpoint defined by the polish-stop layer <b>14</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), the silica particles planarize the portions of the tungsten cover layer <b>16</b> in the trenches <b>15</b> less aggressively than similarly sized alumina or ceria particles to reduce dishing in the trenches <b>15</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">In another particular embodiment for forming damascene lines from a cover layer <b>16</b> composed of copper and a polish-stop layer <b>14</b> composed of tantalum or tantalum nitride, the planarizing solution <b>342</b> has a first distribution of small first abrasive particles <b>346</b> composed of alumina and a second distribution of relatively larger second abrasive particles <b>348</b> composed of titania. Compared to the small alumina particles <b>346</b>, the titania abrasive particles <b>348</b> less aggressively planarize the tantalum or tantalum oxide polish-stop layer <b>14</b> to reduce the removal rate of material from the polish-stop layer <b>14</b>. Thus, this embodiment of the planarizing solution <b>342</b> accordingly has second abrasive particles <b>348</b> that avoid over-planarizing the substrate assembly <b>12</b> beyond the surface of the polish-stop layer <b>14</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a schematic side view of a planarizing system <b>400</b> having a planarizing machine <b>110</b> and a slurry dispensing assembly <b>402</b> in accordance with yet another embodiment of the invention. The planarizing machine <b>110</b>, shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, is similar to the web-format planarizing machine <b>10</b> described above with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and thus like reference numbers refer to like parts. The planarizing machine <b>110</b> could also be a rotary planarizing machine having a rotating platen and a circular polishing pad as set forth in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,645,682 and 5,792,709, which are both herein incorporated by reference. Suitable planarizing machines without the slurry dispensing assembly <b>402</b> are manufactured by Obsidian Corporation (web-format), Westech Corporation (rotary), and Strasbaugh Corporation (rotary).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">The slurry dispensing assembly <b>402</b> generally includes a first supply container <b>410</b> containing a first planarizing solution <b>412</b> and a second supply container <b>420</b> containing a second planarizing solution <b>422</b>. In this particular embodiment, the carrier head <b>31</b> is coupled to the first and second containers <b>410</b> and <b>420</b> by first and second feed lines <b>430</b> and <b>432</b>, respectively. As explained in detail below, the first and second feed lines <b>430</b> and <b>432</b> preferably dispense the first and second solutions <b>412</b> and <b>422</b> at separate first and second stages of a planarizing cycle for the substrate assembly <b>12</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">The first solution <b>412</b> includes a liquid mixture <b>414</b> and a plurality of first abrasive particles <b>416</b>. The liquid mixture <b>414</b> can be the same as the liquid mixtures <b>144</b>, <b>244</b> and <b>344</b> described above, and the first abrasive particles <b>416</b> can be the same as the first abrasive particles <b>146</b>, <b>246</b> or <b>346</b> described above. Accordingly, the first abrasive particles <b>416</b> have a first planarizing attribute that can be the particle size distribution and/or the type of material of the first abrasive particles <b>416</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">The second solution <b>422</b> includes a liquid mixture <b>424</b> and a plurality of first abrasive particles <b>426</b>. The liquid mixture <b>424</b> can also be the same as the liquid mixtures <b>144</b>, <b>244</b> and <b>344</b>, and the second abrasive particles <b>426</b> can be the same as the second abrasive particles <b>148</b>, <b>248</b> or <b>348</b>. Accordingly, the second abrasive particles <b>426</b> have a second planarizing attribute that can be the particle size distribution and/or the second type of material of the second abrasive particles <b>426</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">One method for planarizing the substrate assembly <b>12</b> using the planarizing system <b>400</b> includes a single planarizing cycle having a first stage during which the substrate assembly <b>12</b> has a topographical substrate surface and a second stage during which the substrate assembly <b>12</b> has blanket substrate surface. In the first stage of the planarizing cycle, the carrier head <b>31</b> dispenses the first planarizing solution <b>412</b> from the nozzles <b>41</b> and onto the polishing pad <b>40</b>. The first abrasive particles <b>416</b> preferably have relatively small particle sizes within a first particle size distribution having a first mode. The first abrasive particles <b>416</b>, for example, can have particles sizes from approximately 0.010 μm to 0.050 μm and a first mode of approximately 0.020-0.030 μm like the first abrasive particles <b>146</b>. Thus, during the first stage of the planarizing cycle, the first planarizing solution <b>412</b> can planarize high regions on the topographical substrate surface faster than low regions to form a highly planar blanket substrate surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">Once the first planarizing solution <b>412</b> forms a blanket substrate surface on the substrate assembly <b>12</b>, the planarizing system <b>400</b> terminates dispensing the first planarizing solution <b>412</b> to stop the first stage of the planarizing cycle and begins dispensing the second planarizing solution <b>422</b> to commence the second stage of the planarizing cycle. The second abrasive particles <b>426</b> preferably have relatively large particle sizes within a second particle size distribution having a second mode. The second abrasive particles <b>426</b>, for example, can have particles sizes from approximately 0.070 μM to 0.40 μm and a second mode of approximately 0.25-0.30 μm like the second abrasive particles <b>148</b>. Thus, during the second stage of the planarizing cycle, the second abrasive particles <b>426</b> can planarize the blanket substrate surface faster than the first abrasive particles <b>416</b> to reduce the time of the planarizing cycle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">In another embodiment of a method for planarizing the substrate assembly <b>12</b> using the planarizing system <b>400</b>, the first planarizing solution <b>412</b> has abrasive particles <b>416</b> composed of a first material and the second planarizing solution has abrasive particles <b>426</b> composed of a second material different than the first material. As explained above with respect to the first abrasive particles <b>246</b>, the first material of the first abrasive particles <b>416</b> preferably aggressively removes material from the cover layer <b>16</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The first planarizing solution <b>412</b> is accordingly dispensed onto the polishing pad <b>40</b> during the first stage of the planarizing cycle while the substrate assembly <b>12</b> has a topographical substrate surface. Additionally, as explained above with respect to the second abrasive particles <b>248</b>, the second material of the second abrasive particles <b>426</b> is preferably selected to less aggressively remove material from either the exposed portions of the polish-stop layer <b>14</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) or the remaining portions of the cover layer <b>16</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) at the endpoint of the planarizing cycle. The second planarizing solution <b>422</b> is dispensed onto the polishing pad <b>40</b> during the second stage of the planarizing cycle to planarize the blanket substrate surface and to provide the desired selectivity to the polish-stop layer or the cover layer at the endpoint.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">In one particular application of this two-stage method, tungsten damascene lines are formed from a tungsten cover layer by initially dispensing a first planarizing solution <b>412</b> having alumina first abrasive particles <b>416</b> during the first stage of the planarizing cycle. This embodiment of the method continues by subsequently dispensing a second planarizing solution <b>422</b> having silica second abrasive particles <b>426</b> during the second stage. In another particular application of this two-stage method, copper contacts or damascene lines are formed from a copper cover layer over a tantalum polish-stop layer by initially dispensing a first planarizing solution <b>412</b> having alumina first abrasive particles <b>416</b> during the first stage of the planarizing cycle. This embodiment of the method continues by dispensing a second planarizing solution <b>422</b> having titania second abrasive particles <b>426</b> during the second stage. In either of these embodiments, the first abrasive particles <b>416</b> preferably have small first particle sizes in a first particle size distribution and the second abrasive particles <b>426</b> preferably have particle sizes in a second particle size distribution that are larger than the first abrasive particles <b>416</b>.</div>
