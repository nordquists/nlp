<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This application is a divisional of application Ser. No. 10/728,413, filed Dec. 5, 2003, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,109,572, issued Sep. 19, 2006, which is a divisional of application Ser. No. 09/933,297, filed Aug. 20, 2001, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,967,125, issued Nov. 22, 2005.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The present invention relates generally to semiconductor packaging. More specifically, the present invention relates to semiconductor packaging using a quad flat package design incorporating a lead frame and providing an increased number of input/output contacts arranged in a grid array.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">2. State of the Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Conventional quad flat packages (QFP) are formed with a semiconductor die connected to a lead frame and being encapsulated to form a package such that a plurality of leads extends laterally outwardly from each side of the periphery of the encapsulating structure. Such a configuration is relatively simple in design and may be efficiently produced. However, the QFP-type semiconductor has shown various design and production limitations. For example, reducing the overall package size of a QFP becomes difficult because of the arrangement of leads about the lateral periphery of the package. This is particularly evident when reduced package size is attempted to be combined with increasing the number of input/output (I/O) connections required for the smaller yet ever-more complex dice representing the state of the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">In order to either reduce the size of a conventional QFP while at least maintaining, if not increasing, the number of connections or to increase the number of I/O connections while at least maintaining, if not decreasing, the package size, a higher density of connections would be required along the package perimeter. However, such an increased density of leads about the package perimeter inherently requires a reduced pitch or spacing between adjacent leads and promotes an increased likelihood of cross-talk and signal interference as well as making such packages more difficult to fabricate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">In an effort to increase the number of connections in an integrated circuit (IC) package while maintaining or decreasing the overall size, alternative packaging arrangements have been implemented. For example, grid array devices such as pin grid arrays (PGA), ball grid arrays (BGA), land grid arrays (LGA) and their associated variants have been used to reduce package size and increase input/output connections. As an example of a grid array type device, a BGA device employs a number of input/output connections in the form of conductive bumps, such as solder balls, extending transversely from a major surface of the package in a pattern, or “array,” of columns and rows. The conductive bumps may be formed on one surface of a circuit board or other interposer substrate and are in electrical connection with bonding pads on the opposing surface of the circuit board. A semiconductor die is coupled to the bonding pads, such as by wire bonding, to establish electrical connections from the bond pads of the semiconductor die to the conductive bumps. The resulting assembly is then typically encapsulated such as by transfer molding with a filled polymer with the array of conductive bumps being left exposed for subsequent electrical connection to higher level packaging such as a carrier substrate. The conductive bumps are configured to be coupled to a mirror image pattern of terminal pads on the carrier substrate which may comprise a printed circuit board (PCB) or another structure by reflowing the solder. In essence, a BGA device increases the number of input/output connections by allowing the connections to be positioned over substantially the entirety of a major surface of the package rather than extending laterally outwardly from the periphery of the package such as in a QFP.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">While BGA and other grid array devices provide an increased number of input/output connections and may allow a simultaneous reduction in size for a given package, such devices are not without their own limitations and drawbacks. For example, the use of circuit board interposers, upon which the array of conductive elements is formed, imposes limitations on the size of the package since the circuit board is typically larger than the semiconductor die. Additionally, the circuit boards used in making BGA packages have been known to take on moisture during the fabrication process, leading to subsequent cracking and warpage which ultimately renders the device unusable. Furthermore, the cost of circuit boards used in the fabrication of grid array type devices may also be viewed as a drawback.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">In view of the shortcomings in the art, it would be advantageous to provide a semiconductor die package which allows for a higher density of input/output connections without increasing package size. It would further be advantageous to provide such a package having a patterned array of input/output connections formed from a lead frame.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">Additionally, it would be advantageous to provide a method of producing such a package, and the lead frame utilized in such a package, which does not require significant changes in tooling or fabrication processes such that the method is easily and efficiently implemented without incurring significant capital costs for new equipment or an increase in process steps.</div>
<heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">One aspect of the invention includes a method of forming a semiconductor die or IC package. The method includes providing a semiconductor die having a plurality of bond pads located on an active surface thereof. A lead frame having a plurality of conductive leads is provided adjacent the semiconductor die. A first bond bad on the semiconductor die is electrically coupled to a first portion of at least one conductive lead and a second bond pad is coupled to a second portion of the same lead. The first portion and second portion of the lead are then electrically isolated from one another to form two individual conductive elements from the original conductive lead. Additionally, an insulative encapsulant may be formed about the semiconductor die and at least partially about the lead frame while allowing a portion of each individual conductive element to remain exposed for subsequent electrical coupling with an external electrical circuit such as a carrier substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">The individual conductive elements may, for example, be electrically isolated from one another by saw cutting the conductive lead subsequent to the first and second portion being coupled to the bond pads of the semiconductor die. Also, a severance region may be predefined in the lead between the first portion and second portion so as to help facilitate the electrical isolation of the two portions. The severance region may include a notch or recess formed by scoring, cutting or etching partially through the material of the lead. Encapsulant covering the semiconductor die may be extended into the notch or recess of the severance region prior to isolating the first portion and second portion to help retain the first portion and second portion in their respective positions once they have been separated from one another by complete removal of any intervening lead material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">Another aspect of the present invention includes a method of forming an array of electrically conductive elements for an IC package. The method includes disposing a semiconductor die having a plurality of bond pads on an active surface thereof on a lead frame including a plurality of leads. At least two bond pads of the semiconductor die are electrically coupled with each lead of the lead frame. The leads are then severed between the locations of coupling to form at least two electrically isolated conductive elements, each such electrically isolated conductive element being coupled to an individual bond pad on the semiconductor die.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">The present invention also includes a lead frame of a first design. The lead frame includes a plurality of individual leads. At least one of the plurality of leads includes a first bonding region, a second bonding region and a severance region located between the first and second bonding regions. The severance region is configured to facilitate separation of the first bonding region from the second bonding region subsequent to connection of bond pads of a semiconductor die to the respective first and second bonding regions and encapsulation of the lead frame and semiconductor die to form an IC package.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">The present invention further includes a lead frame of a second design. This lead frame includes a die paddle configured for attachment of a semiconductor die thereto. The lead frame also includes a plurality of conductive elements, each having at least two bonding regions. The bonding regions are arranged in a grid array pattern which includes a first peripheral row of bonding regions spaced about a periphery of the die paddle and at least one other peripheral row of bonding regions spaced laterally outwardly from the first peripheral row.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">Yet another aspect of the invention includes a semiconductor die or IC package. The IC package includes a semiconductor die, a lead frame and an electrically insulative encapsulant. The lead frame includes a plurality of spaced conductive elements arranged in an array including a first set of conductive elements on a major surface of the package and adjacent a lateral periphery thereof and at least one other set of conductive elements inwardly adjacent the first set. The insulative encapsulant extends over the semiconductor die and at least partially over the lead frame while allowing a portion of each of the conductive elements to be exposed on the major surface for connection with an external electrical circuit. At least one concavity or other recess is defined between and electrically isolates at least one conductive element of the first set and an adjacent conductive element of the at least one other set.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">In accordance with another aspect of the invention, another IC package is provided. The IC package includes a semiconductor die having a plurality of bond pads and a lead frame having a plurality of conductive leads. Each of the plurality of leads is electrically coupled to at least two bond pads of the plurality of bond pads.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a memory module is provided. The memory module includes a carrier substrate in the form of a module board configured to be electrically coupled to another, higher-level packaging structure such as a motherboard, enabling the memory module to communicate with a processor. At least one IC package having features such as those described above is electrically coupled to the module board.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a computer system is provided.

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> depict one embodiment of an IC package of the present invention in the form of a quad flat no-lead (QFN) grid array package <b>10</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> presents a view of a major surface comprising the underside of the QFN package <b>10</b>, while <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a cross section of the QFN package <b>10</b> taken along section line <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The QFN package <b>10</b> includes a semiconductor die <b>12</b> positioned on and secured by its back side to a die paddle <b>14</b>, die paddle <b>14</b> originally comprising a portion of a lead frame as will be hereinafter described. Conductive elements <b>16</b> are positioned about the die paddle <b>14</b> in a grid array pattern, outwardly of semiconductor die <b>12</b> and adjacent the lateral periphery of QFN package <b>10</b>. The die paddle <b>14</b> and conductive elements <b>16</b> may be formed of any suitable material such as copper, aluminum, alloy <b>42</b> or any other suitable conductive material for lead frames as understood by those of ordinary skill in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">The grid array pattern of the conductive elements <b>16</b> may be described in various geometrical terms such as a grid having a specified number of columns and rows. However, due to the general placement of the conductive elements <b>16</b> outwardly of the semiconductor die <b>12</b> and generally adjacent the periphery of the QFN package <b>10</b>, the grid array structure will be discussed in terms of peripheral rows. Thus, the QFN package <b>10</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> includes a first inner peripheral row <b>18</b>A and a second outer peripheral row <b>18</b>B of conductive elements <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">The language “peripheral row” is used herein for convenience in describing the configuration of the QFN package <b>10</b> and should not be understood as requiring all of the conductive elements <b>16</b> to be located at or on the peripheral edge of the QFN package <b>10</b>, nor should such phraseology be taken to mean that a given peripheral row of conductive elements <b>16</b> must circumscribe the entire die paddle <b>14</b> and semiconductor die <b>12</b>. While it is desirable to have the conductive elements <b>16</b> positioned about each side of the QFN package <b>10</b> so as to maximize the number of conductive elements <b>16</b> in the package, some designs may not require such an arrangement. Alternatively, some configurations may include peripheral rows that only partially circumscribe the die paddle <b>14</b> and semiconductor die <b>12</b>, such as arrangements where peripheral rows lie on opposing sides of the QFN package <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">The conductive elements <b>16</b> are each conductively coupled to a bond pad <b>22</b> on the active surface of semiconductor die <b>12</b> such as by wire bonds <b>24</b>. The semiconductor die <b>12</b> and wire bonds <b>24</b> are encapsulated with an electrically insulative (dielectric) material <b>26</b> which also partially encapsulates the conductive elements <b>16</b> and extends between die paddle <b>14</b> and the inner peripheral row <b>18</b>A of conductive elements <b>16</b>, between the inner peripheral row <b>18</b>A of conductive elements <b>16</b> and the outer peripheral row <b>18</b>B of conductive elements <b>16</b> and between laterally adjacent conductive elements <b>16</b> of each of the peripheral rows <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B. The encapsulant material <b>26</b> may comprise a silicon particle-filled polymer encapsulant applied under heat and pressure by transfer molding, as well known in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">The conductive elements <b>16</b> each have an exposed surface <b>28</b> on the bottom major surface of the QFN package <b>10</b> for subsequent electrical coupling with another electrical component such as a carrier substrate (not shown). Such connection may be made, for example, through the use of conductive bumps <b>28</b> <i>b</i>, shown in broken lines for clarity. Such bumps may include, for example, solder bumps which are stenciled onto conductive elements <b>16</b> and then reflowed to form balls, conductive or conductor-filled epoxy columns or pillars, or self-supporting spheres (either conductive or insulative) covered with a conductive material. It is further contemplated that an anisotropic, so-called “Z-axis” conductive material comprising laterally-spaced conductive elements in a dielectric film and oriented transversely to the plane thereof may also be employed to connect conductive elements <b>16</b> to a carrier substrate. All of the foregoing approaches, and others, are known to those of ordinary skill in the art and are not to be taken as limiting of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">The inner peripheral rows <b>18</b>A and outer peripheral rows <b>18</b>B of conductive elements <b>16</b> adjacent each edge of QFN package <b>10</b> are shown to be separated from one another by an elongated, trough-like concavity or recess <b>30</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the concavity or recess <b>30</b> is formed as an elongated saw cut or scribe line extending from a first lateral edge of the QFN package <b>10</b> to an opposing lateral edge. However, the concavity may be formed according to other techniques known in the art such as, for example, a masking and etching process. In the embodiment shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the concavity or recess <b>30</b> serves to create the individual conductive elements <b>16</b> of the two peripheral rows <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B from a single row of individual, laterally extending leads of a lead frame. The fabrication process can be seen more clearly with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> depicts a partial section of the QFN package <b>10</b> showing the QFN package <b>10</b> at a stage in fabrication prior to formation of the individual conductive elements <b>16</b>. The QFN package <b>10</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> includes a single lead <b>16</b>′ rather than individual conductive elements <b>16</b>. It is further noted that there are multiple wire bonds <b>24</b> connected to different bonding regions <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> of the lead <b>16</b>′. A severance region <b>36</b>, shown as an upwardly facing notch, is preformed in the lead <b>16</b>′ and subsequently filled with encapsulant material <b>26</b> subsequent to attachment of semiconductor die <b>12</b> to die paddle <b>14</b> and wire bonding of a bond pad <b>22</b> (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) to bonding regions <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>. The notch of severance region <b>36</b> may be formed by various processes such as saw cutting, scribing, scoring or etching of the lead <b>16</b>′ prior to encapsulation of the lead <b>16</b>′ and wire bond <b>24</b> and preferably prior to attachment of semiconductor die <b>12</b> to die paddle <b>14</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">Subsequent to the application of encapsulant material <b>26</b>, the lead <b>16</b>′ may be severed, such as through the aforementioned saw cutting or etching, to form individual, electrically isolated conductive elements <b>16</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. Each conductive element <b>16</b> is connected to a wire bond <b>24</b> and thus to a bond pad <b>22</b> of the semiconductor die <b>12</b> (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). It is noted that the severance region <b>36</b> serves various purposes. First, the severance region <b>36</b> identifies an area of separation on the lead <b>16</b>′. This helps to identify the individual bonding regions <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> during wire bonding of the lead <b>16</b>′ to the bond pads <b>22</b> of the semiconductor die <b>12</b>. Additionally, the severance region <b>36</b> allows for the formation of a more shallow concavity or recess <b>30</b> during the separation of the lead <b>16</b>′ into individual conductive elements <b>16</b>, such as to minimize the potential for damage to QFN package <b>10</b>. Also, by forming the upwardly facing notch in the severance region <b>36</b> prior to encapsulation, the transfer-molded encapsulant material <b>26</b> flows under pressure into the notch and substantially laterally about at least three sides of the ultimate location of each conductive element <b>16</b> to form a structural member <b>38</b> between and about the locations of individual conductive elements <b>16</b> to more effectively tie the conductive elements <b>16</b> to encapsulant material <b>26</b>, precisely fixing their locations and enabling the package to withstand the stresses placed on leads <b>16</b>′ without damage thereto or movement thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">While the severance region <b>36</b> is desirably in the form of a notch or recess as shown, it is contemplated that the severance region <b>36</b> of the lead <b>16</b>′ may simply be a designated area of separation without a notch or other physical feature. It is noted that, in such a case, the concavity or recess <b>30</b> extending upwardly from the bottom major surface of QFN package <b>10</b> would penetrate through the entire thickness of the lead <b>16</b>′ and there would be no encapsulant <b>26</b> formed between the adjacent inner and outer individual conductive elements <b>16</b> to serve as a structural member <b>38</b>. If desired, a structural member <b>38</b> could be formed after the formation of the concavity <b>30</b> by filling same with dielectric material regardless of whether or not an upwardly facing, preformed notch or recess in each lead <b>16</b>′ is used to facilitate the formation of individual conductive elements <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> alternative embodiments are shown with regard to the grid array pattern. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> shows the bottom surface of a QFN package <b>10</b>′ having three different peripheral rows <b>18</b>A, <b>18</b>B and <b>18</b>C of conductive elements <b>16</b>. The conductive elements <b>16</b> are formed in a manner similar to that described above except that additional severance regions <b>36</b> (or notches) would be located in each lead <b>16</b>′ and that there are additional concavities <b>30</b> to assist in forming the third peripheral rows <b>18</b>C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> shows the bottom surface of a QFN package <b>10</b>″ also having three peripheral rows <b>18</b>A′, <b>18</b>B′ and <b>18</b>C′. However, in the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> the conductive elements <b>16</b>″ of the peripheral rows <b>18</b>A′, <b>18</b>B′ and <b>18</b>C′ are staggered such that a conductive element <b>16</b>″ in peripheral row <b>18</b>B′ is shifted slightly to one side as compared to an adjacent conductive element <b>16</b>″ in peripheral row <b>18</b>A′. Similarly, a conductive element <b>16</b>″ in peripheral row <b>18</b>C′ is shifted slightly to one side as compared to an adjacent conductive element <b>16</b>″ in peripheral row <b>18</b>B′. Such an arrangement is possible by forming a lead frame having leads <b>16</b>′ positioned at an angle other than perpendicular with respect to an adjacent edge of the die paddle <b>14</b>. The individual peripheral rows <b>18</b>A′, <b>18</b>B′ and <b>18</b>C′ are formed in a manner similar to that described above, with elongated, trough-like concavities <b>30</b> being formed to ultimately create the individual conductive elements <b>16</b>″. The staggered configuration serves to allow more flexibility in wire bonding configurations and potentially lower bond loop heights due to the lateral staggering of the conductive elements <b>16</b>″. Thus, depending on the angle at which a lead <b>16</b>′ is formed on a lead frame, the offset of one peripheral row relative to another may be controlled and wire bonding configurations may be flexibly designed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">Referring now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an exemplary lead frame strip <b>50</b> including a plurality of individual lead frames <b>52</b> for use in forming QFN packages <b>10</b> is shown. The multiple lead frames <b>52</b> are formed in a single, longitudinally extending strip <b>50</b> as is known by those of ordinary skill in the art. Each lead frame <b>52</b> includes an outer frame portion <b>52</b> <i>o </i>bearing a die paddle <b>14</b> supported substantially in the center thereof by tie bars and multiple inwardly extending, cantilevered leads <b>16</b>′. A reduced number of leads <b>16</b>′ is shown for clarity, but is not intended to be limiting of the invention. The leads <b>16</b>′ are each formed with a severance region <b>36</b>, such as a notch or similar recess, for subsequent formation of individual conductive elements <b>16</b> from the leads <b>16</b>′. As discussed above, the severance regions <b>36</b> may be formed by various techniques such as scoring, saw cutting, or etching. The severance regions <b>36</b> define the locations of the peripheral rows <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B which will be subsequently formed in the QFN package <b>10</b>. The lead frames <b>52</b> depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are representative of a lead frame <b>52</b> which might be used in the formation of a QFN package <b>10</b> described in conjunction with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. Other lead frames of suitable configuration and with similar features would be utilized in forming the QFN packages <b>10</b>′, <b>10</b>″ discussed in conjunction with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</figref> or <b>4</b>B respectively as is understood by those of ordinary skill in the art. In fabricating QFN packages of the present invention, the outer frame portions <b>52</b> <i>o </i>are severed from the packages to effect electrical isolation of die paddle <b>14</b> as well as each set of conductive elements <b>16</b> from the outer frame portions <b>52</b> <i>o</i>, while mutual electrical isolation between the conductive elements <b>16</b> formed from each lead <b>16</b>′ is effected by cutting through the leads <b>16</b>′ from the lead surfaces opposite the notches of severance regions <b>36</b>. To facilitate alignment of the packages for creating the concavities or recesses <b>30</b>, it is preferred currently that QFN packages <b>10</b> be severed from outer frame portions <b>52</b> <i>o </i>after such concavities or recesses are cut or otherwise formed. If conductive bumps <b>28</b> <i>b </i>are to be formed or placed on conductive elements <b>16</b>, it may also be desirable to form or place conductive bumps <b>28</b> <i>b </i>while QFN packages <b>10</b> are still unsevered from lead frame strip <b>50</b> to facilitate alignment and handling.</div>
