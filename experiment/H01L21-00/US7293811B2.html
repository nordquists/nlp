<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. §120 to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/888,819, entitled “Ultra Low Contact Area End Effector,” filed with the U.S. Patent &amp; Trademark Office on Jul. 10, 2004, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/486,330, now abandoned, both of which are assigned to Applicants and are incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention generally relates to an end effector for handling semiconductor workpieces. More particularly, the present invention relates to a vacuum gripping end effector that provides minimal contact between the workpiece supports and the backside of the workpiece.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Conventional robotic vacuum chuck end effectors transfer significant particulate contamination to the backside of the wafer at areas where the chuck contacts the backside of the wafer. Vacuum grips often cause backside contamination and/or damage to a wafer due to: (1) scratching the backside of the wafer—particularly from hard ceramic or anodized aluminum contacts; (2) particles from the grip pad that are worn off and left on bottom of wafer; and (3) particles that fall onto the grip pad and are pressed onto bottom of wafer. Vacuum chuck end effectors also have difficulty achieving a low leak rate vacuum seal if the wafer placed on the end effector is warped or imperfectly aligned with the end effector surfaces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Edge support or edge grip end effectors minimize the amount of particulate contamination transferred to the backside of the wafer. Edge grip end effectors, however, present difficulties in accurate wafer pick up and transfer and edge damage and/or contamination.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Gripping the perimeter edge of the wafer requires that structural features protrude from the upper surface of the end effector to a sufficient height such that the protrusions extend above the top surface of the wafer being gripped. This method also requires features to actuate the protrusions, extending and contracting them as required, which increases complexity and failure modes. Further, either the protrusion must be left as a remnant of a thicker piece of raw material than would otherwise be necessary, or the protrusions have to be attached to the end effector. The first method involves more raw material and machining. Also, these protrusions are not replaceable. The second method involves multiple parts and potentially complex permanent assembly methods, such as those discussed above. Edge gripping structures, however, can be expected to be relatively thick, and therefore difficult to maneuver through vertical stacking cassettes where the wafers are stored because the separation between wafers is on the order of only about 5-10 mm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">There are increasing uses for ultra-thin wafers—low profile chip designs, direct mount on boards, etc. These wafers are often less than 250 microns thick and are subjected to distortion and waviness. This presents challenges for handling thin substrates—which are conventionally not suitable for edge-grip technology end effectors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">One constraint with thin wafers includes ensuring that the vacuum source does not apply too much vacuum to the bottom surface of the wafer. A full 10-15 psi vacuum source, for example, will likely cause the wafer to warp. It is important, however, that the circular edge conform to the bottom surface of the wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">Accordingly, there is a need for a low profile vacuum end effector that includes workpiece supports that work in conjunction with distorted wafer surfaces. It is also desirable for the end effector to accommodate a wide variety of support materials and reliably retain the pads in place, while permitting damaged or worn supports to be readily replaced.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">One aspect of the present invention is to provide an end effector that eliminates or greatly minimizes particulate transfer to the backside of the wafer. In one embodiment, the workpiece chucks or supports include a circular knife-like edge that provides the only contact between the wafer support and the wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">Another aspect of the present invention is to provide an end effector that includes self-aligning vacuum chucks or supports. The workpiece supports accommodate any lack of wafer planarity and work in conjunction with distorted wafer surfaces. The supports provide an effective vacuum seal under the conditions of lack of planarity between the backside of the wafer and the vacuum supports.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">Still another aspect of the present invention is to provide an end effector that includes replaceable workpiece supports. In one embodiment, each workpiece support may be readily exchanged without having to remove the end effector from the robot assembly. The workpiece supports may comprise, by way of example only, a ceramic, a plastic, or a metal. The workpiece support preferably comprises a material suited for the type of workpiece that end effector will be handling.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">Another aspect of the present invention is to provide an end effector that minimizes or eliminates the amount of deformation and/or stress induced into the workpiece transferred by the end effector, with particular respect to fragile workpieces (e.g., thin wafers, SOI wafers, etc.). Even though the contact area between the workpiece support and the wafer is very small, the workpiece support provides a sufficiently large effective vacuum surface to hold the workpiece on the end effector.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">Still another aspect of the present invention is to provide an end effector that provides a choice of manufacturing approaches for the workpiece supports. The workpiece supports, by way of example only, may be manufactured through a machining, injection molding, plating, or chemical milling process.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">The bottom surface of end effector, in many embodiments, comprises a membrane. The membrane seals the bottom surface of the end effector and forms a vacuum cavity under the wafer support.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">The present invention will now be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-11</figref>. In general, the present invention comprises an end effector <b>100</b> having a combination of workpiece or wafer supports that contact the wafer in zones where particulate contamination is less critical, such as, for example, the outer edge of the wafer. In another embodiment, one or more wafer supports are used with accommodation for lack of co-planarity achieved by allowing the support(s) to tilt as required. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates that the end effector <b>100</b> includes two wafer supports <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> in front of the center of gravity of the wafer <b>108</b>. It is within the spirit and scope of the invention to have more than or fewer than two supports on the end effector.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">A very low contact area circumferential sealing feature is utilized. The wafer supports <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> provide a knife-edged or small radius contact geometry, thus reducing the contact area between the wafer support chuck <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> and the wafer's backside <b>130</b> (and the potential for particulate transfer).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">The end effector <b>100</b>, in a first embodiment, includes a first end <b>104</b> adapted to secure to a wafer handling robot and a second end or platen <b>106</b> for supporting the wafer <b>108</b>. The platen <b>106</b> includes a first finger <b>110</b> and a second finger <b>112</b>. The first and second fingers <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> are preferably spaced apart so that the first wafer support <b>114</b> and the second wafer support <b>116</b> contact different areas of the backside of the wafer <b>108</b>. For ease of describing the embodiments of the invention, wafer support or chuck <b>114</b> will often be referenced throughout. Any attributes of wafer support or chuck <b>114</b> of course apply to wafer support <b>116</b>. In this embodiment, the wafer <b>108</b> is also supported by first and second edge supports <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>. The platen <b>106</b> may include any number of fingers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2B</figref> illustrates that the first and second edge supports <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> preferably only contact the wafer <b>108</b> along its edge or periphery. Each edge support includes a wafer support surface <b>122</b> and a backstop <b>124</b>. The wafer support surface <b>122</b> is stationary and preferably comprises a low friction non-particulate generating material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">The end effector <b>100</b> includes a support retention area <b>126</b> for supporting each wafer support <b>114</b> and <b>116</b>. The support retention area <b>126</b> is a partial bore or recessed pocket. The support <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> is used to support the wafer <b>108</b> and keep the wafer <b>108</b> from contacting the surface <b>128</b> of the end effector <b>100</b>. By preventing the wafer <b>108</b> from contacting the top surface <b>128</b> of the end effector <b>100</b>, the wafer <b>108</b> is protected from contamination by the end effector <b>100</b> during handling.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">The pivoting ball and socket joint <b>146</b> eliminates or greatly minimizes the lateral scrubbing of the wafer support chuck contact area <b>136</b> due to the tilting action.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2B</figref> illustrates a first embodiment of a wafer support <b>114</b>. In this embodiment, the wafer support <b>114</b> has a circular raised edge <b>132</b> that contacts the wafer's backside <b>130</b>. The central region <b>134</b> of the wafer support chuck <b>114</b> is recessed below the contact portion <b>136</b> of the raised edge <b>132</b> so that only the contact portion <b>136</b> contacts the wafer's backside <b>130</b>. The center region <b>134</b> includes a bore <b>138</b> that extends completely through the wafer support <b>114</b>. The bore <b>138</b> extends from the bottom surface <b>142</b> of the wafer support <b>114</b> toward the central region <b>134</b>. When the bore <b>138</b> approaches the central region <b>134</b>, the bore <b>140</b> begins to taper outward such that the diameter of the bore <b>138</b> at the central region <b>134</b> is larger than the diameter of the bore <b>138</b> at the bottom surface <b>142</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">The wafer support <b>114</b> and <b>116</b>, therefore, are only in contact with the wafer by a distance d<b>1</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). The raised edge <b>132</b>, by forming a seal with the wafer's backside <b>130</b>, forms a vacuum seal with the wafer's backside <b>130</b> across an effective diameter d (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>). A vacuum passage <b>144</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) travels through each finger <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, and terminates substantially beneath the wafer support <b>114</b> and <b>116</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> illustrates that a passageway from a vacuum source is provided by the vacuum passage <b>144</b> and the bore <b>138</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the wafer support <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> forms a substantially air-tight seal with the wafer's backside <b>130</b> and the pivot socket <b>146</b> when the vacuum and source is activated or turned on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">The circular edge <b>132</b> must have a diameter large enough so that the vacuum provides a force large enough to hold the wafer <b>108</b> on the wafer support <b>114</b> and <b>116</b>. A smaller diameter support, however, better accommodates any localized non-flatness of the wafer. If, for example, the wafer support <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> includes a circular edge <b>132</b> four inches in diameter, the wafer support <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> may still leak even with the gimbaling features. By achieving a good seal with a small diameter circular edge, the wafer support imparts maximum efficiency of the available vacuum force.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">The wafer supports <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> and the edge supports <b>118</b> are located such that the wafer's center-of-gravity falls within the supports. This configuration ensures a stable condition for the wafer <b>108</b> prior to activating the vacuum source. The wafer supports <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> preferably comprise a low friction material so that the weight of the wafer <b>108</b> is sufficient to gimbal the wafer support chuck <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> to an optimum conformance to the wafer's bottom surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">The wafer support <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> also prevents any lateral motion by the wafer <b>108</b> or the chuck <b>114</b> itself when the vacuum is applied. The lack of motion is particularly important when high accuracy transfers/hand-offs are required, such as between a wafer prealigner and a metrology or process station. In the semiconductor industry, transfer accuracy requirements are currently less than 25 microns and will likely continue to decrease.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">The wafer supports <b>114</b> may comprise different material (e.g., ceramic for high temperature applications) and are easily replaceable. An operator may change out a wafer support <b>114</b> without affecting the structure of the end effector <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">The actuation of vacuum simultaneously pulls the wafer's backside <b>130</b> against the sealing surface <b>136</b> of the support <b>114</b> and brings the support <b>114</b> into contact with the pivot socket <b>146</b>. The pivot socket <b>146</b>, by way of example only, primarily serves four functions: (1) enables tilting motion of the wafer support chuck <b>114</b> for optimum sealing between the wafer support chuck <b>114</b> and the backside of the wafer; (2) provides vertical support for the wafer support chuck <b>114</b> and a wafer <b>108</b> seated on the chuck <b>114</b>; (3) provides self-actuated vacuum sealing of the pivot socket <b>146</b> due to force exerted by projected area when vacuum is applied; and (4) provides accurate and unambiguous location of a wafer <b>108</b> seated on the wafer support chuck <b>114</b> due to the chuck's self-centering design.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">The geometry of the wafer support <b>114</b> provides a center of rotation that is coincident with the wafer support plane. This feature is defined as zero scrub radius. The wafer support <b>114</b> and the pivot socket <b>146</b> comprise a gimbal joint. A gimbal joint represents a composite joint with three rotational degrees-of-freedom.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">If the wafer support <b>114</b> is gimbaling or pivoting, the instantaneous center of gimbaling is where the centerline is drawn (centerline of spherical surface). If the center of rotation of the wafer support <b>114</b> is positioned correctly, the center of rotation of the wafer support <b>114</b> is coincident with wafer support plane. Small angles of deflection create substantially no lateral sliding of the wafer support <b>114</b> against the wafer <b>108</b>, even if there is angular misalignment between the wafer support <b>114</b> and the wafer <b>108</b>. The center of rotation of the wafer support <b>114</b> may be higher/lower than that shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, however, the wafer support <b>114</b> will likely generate more particulates.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">The wafer support <b>114</b> is seated in the pivot socket <b>146</b>. Once a vacuum source is activated, the projected area of the wafer support <b>114</b> in contact with the pivot socket <b>146</b> sucks the wafer support <b>114</b> against the pivot socket <b>146</b>. An o-ring, having a diameter slightly smaller than the diameter of the wafer support <b>114</b>, ensures that the wafer support <b>114</b> remains in the pivot socket <b>146</b>. The retaining feature may also comprise a coil or leaf spring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">Each wafer support <b>114</b> may wiggle because there is a clearance between the o-ring/clip and the edge of the support. The wafer support <b>114</b> conforms to the bottom surface of a wafer seated on the end effector. The wafer support <b>114</b>, once the vacuum source is activated, remains substantially in the same position until the vacuum source is turned off. If a wafer <b>108</b> settles down on the wafer support <b>114</b> at an angle, for example, the wafer support <b>114</b> will comply with the backside of the wafer (e.g., the wafer remains at the angle relative to the end effector).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">When the vacuum source is turned on, for example, the circular edge <b>132</b> of the wafer support <b>114</b> forms a seal with the bottom surface of the wafer. For example, if the end effector <b>100</b> raises up to the backside <b>130</b> of the wafer <b>108</b>, the wafer support <b>114</b> gimbals until the circular edge <b>132</b> makes 360° contact with wafer backside <b>130</b>. The entire circular edge <b>132</b> preferably forms a seal with wafer backside <b>130</b>. As previously discussed, the contact surface between the circular edge <b>132</b> and the wafer <b>108</b> should be knife-like (e.g., contact distance of less than 0.05 mm). Basically, the contact area between the circular edge <b>132</b> and the wafer <b>108</b> is preferably very small.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4B</figref> illustrate the contact area between a wafer support <b>114</b> and the backside of the wafer. A conventional wafer support, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, includes a circular edge <b>36</b>, having a width d<b>3</b>. Thus, a large contact area is formed between the wafer support and the wafer <b>8</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> illustrates the knife-like contact edge <b>136</b> of a wafer support <b>114</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention. The contact edge <b>136</b> only contacts the backside <b>130</b> of the wafer <b>108</b> by a distance d<b>1</b>. In comparison with the conventional wafer support, the distance d<b>1</b> is much smaller than the distance d<b>3</b>—achieving a minimal contact area between the wafer support <b>114</b> and the wafer <b>108</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates one embodiment of a vacuum path <b>144</b> that provides a passageway between a vacuum source and the cavity located beneath each wafer support <b>114</b>. The end effector <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> includes two wafer supports <b>114</b>. It is within the scope and spirit of the invention for the end effector to include more or less than the two wafer supports <b>114</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates another embodiment of a wafer support. The wafer support includes a raised central peak <b>236</b>, a clearance area <b>240</b> surrounding the raised central peak <b>236</b>, and a raised edge <b>238</b>. Vacuum is fed through the vertical holes in wafer support. The cross sectional area of the vertical holes is preferably greater than area between the raised edge <b>238</b> and the bottom surface of the wafer <b>130</b> (defined as a “leakage zone”). The central peak <b>236</b> is preferably the only area of contact between the wafer support and the wafer <b>108</b>. The central peak <b>238</b> therefore provides a minimal contact area to support the wafer. The leakage zone creates a pressure drop across the raised edge <b>238</b> providing reduced pressure in the clearance area that holds the wafer down. The leakage zone may also create a Bernoulli effect—creating negative lift to hold the wafer down.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">A second embodiment of a wafer support chuck is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Instead of edge supports, the wafer support chuck <b>214</b> includes a center contact surface or ridge <b>232</b>, or other support element geometries, to support the backside of the wafer. The center contact ridge <b>232</b> is the apex of the central region <b>234</b> of the wafer support chuck <b>214</b>. One embodiment of the central region <b>234</b> comprises a conical section, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, yet may comprise other geometries. The chuck concept could also be used in non-robotic applications, for example, on process or metrology wafer holding stations. The chucks could be arranged in a non-planar manner to produce a curved or cylindrical wafer surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates that the contact ridge <b>232</b> is preferably a rounded surface, having a radii R. Accordingly, the contact ridge <b>232</b> and the wafer's backside <b>130</b> form a contact area d. The wafer support chuck <b>232</b> also includes an outer contact area or ridge <b>236</b>. The outer contact ridge <b>238</b> preferably does not contact the wafer's backside <b>130</b> when a wafer <b>108</b> is seated on the chuck <b>114</b> to minimize the contact area between the chuck <b>114</b> and the wafer <b>108</b>. The outer ridge <b>236</b> may, however, contact the backside <b>130</b> if the wafer <b>108</b> or the chuck <b>114</b> tilts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">Each wafer support chuck <b>114</b> may comprise a wear resistant polymer such as, but not limited to, Teflon or PEEK. The difficulty of using such plastics is that the plastics are soft and easily damaged so that a seal between the contact area suction cups and the backside of the wafer is hard to achieve. This difficulty is generally compensated for by using a large contact surface area. But a large contact surface area is more likely to collect particles and pass them onto the wafer backside <b>130</b>. In one embodiment, each chuck <b>114</b> includes a thin, knife-edge contact that is extremely flat at the contact point and is damage resistant. By using removable ridged rings or chucks as contact pads, a durable yet non-abrasive knife-edge thin contact seal can be achieved practically and cost effectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">The wafer support chuck <b>114</b> may be made from a variety of materials. Desirable characteristics include low vapor pressure at temperature, high hardness, and inertness. Typical materials include metals such as stainless steel, crystals such as quartz, ruby, and sapphire, and ceramics such as silicon carbide, silicon nitride, and tungsten carbide. Because some of these materials are rather brittle and difficult to machine, cylindrically shaped pins of the correct axial length can be advantageously used in accordance with the invention. These materials exhibit a relatively high coefficient of friction and better “grip” the wafer during acceleration and deceleration of the end effector by the robot, protecting against slippage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">In an alternative embodiment, the end effector support plate <b>106</b> is milled or ground with three round areas <b>126</b> that are recessed. A vacuum is routed through the end effector <b>100</b> and terminates at the center region of the round pockets <b>126</b>. Replaceable wafer supports are placed in the pockets and held with a thin adhesive. Alternatively, vacuum may be routed to each cup <b>126</b> independently so that a leak in one does not reduce the vacuum grip of the others.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">The end effector <b>100</b> may be made of any suitable material. Desirable characteristics include low weight and structural stability at high temperature. Typical materials include metals, such as stainless steel, aluminum, titanium, molybdenum, ceramics, composites and combinations thereof. The end effector <b>100</b> can be manufactured from machined plate stock or can be pressed powder materials. Because the invention does not require bonding or otherwise attaching the wafer support chuck <b>114</b> to the end effector <b>100</b>, any combination of pad material and end effector material can be used. Also, because the chucks <b>114</b> can be readily removed and replaced, worn or damaged, chucks <b>114</b> can be changed quickly, without rework of or damage to the end effector <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">Several designs for the rings and chucks <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> are possible and could be selected depending on the demands of the application. An example of ring and chuck designs are:</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">Design #1: PEEK or another stable, strong, clean polymer is turned on a lathe into any number of shapes (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>). The thin contact edge may be flat and parallel with the bottom surface of the wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">Design #2: The same chuck may also be made out of metal, either on a lathe or with a forming process such as sintered powder forming. This metal base is then coated with a thin (e.g., less than 0.001″) Teflon coating. The edge contact is far more durable and precisely flat than if the part were Teflon alone. A good seal can therefore be maintained with the backside of the wafer with a minimal contact area. In a preferred embodiment, only the non-abrasive chemically inert pure Teflon comes in contact with the wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">Design #3: A hard elastomer like 100 durometer Viton® is molded in any shape, or with a flat top. This is appropriate for applications requiring high grip strength where cleanliness is not as critical.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">Because of the low contact area, the rings are more likely to wear out or become damaged than normal vacuum pads. This is mitigated by the fact that the rings are easily installed and removed and can be replaced during scheduled maintenance. To make removal of the rings easy, a hole is provided on the back side of the end effector for each ring so that each ring can be pushed out with a piece of wire (e.g., a paper clip).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">The surface can then be cleaned and another ring installed. A thin double sided adhesive tape is attached to the bottom surface of the ring. The rings are provided on a backing sheet from which they can be easily removed without wrinkling the adhesive. They are then placed into the pocket that locates them centered over the vacuum hole.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> illustrates another embodiment of a wafer support or chuck <b>314</b>. The disc-shaped wafer support includes a central body <b>318</b> that extends outward into cantilevered body <b>326</b>. The outer edge of the cantilevered body <b>334</b> transitions into a raised contact edge <b>326</b>. As shown, the contact edge <b>326</b> of the wafer support is elevated a distance d<b>7</b> above the top surface of the end effector <b>300</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> illustrates that the contact edge <b>326</b> comprises a width d<b>5</b> at the wafer contact surface and is raised a distance d<b>6</b> above the cantilevered body <b>316</b>. The distances d<b>5</b> and d<b>6</b> may vary. The contact area between the raised edge <b>326</b> and the backside of the wafer is preferably minimal. Thus, the distance d<b>5</b> is preferably similar to the distance d<b>4</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. In this embodiment, the wafer support <b>314</b> is secured to the end effector by an adhesive device or ring <b>350</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">The central body <b>318</b> includes a vacuum passage <b>342</b>. The vacuum passage <b>342</b> aligns with the vacuum passage <b>340</b> in the end effector <b>300</b>. The contact edge <b>326</b> of the wafer support <b>314</b> is preferably the only area of contact between the wafer support and the wafer <b>8</b>. After the wafer <b>8</b> is placed on the wafer supports <b>314</b> of the end effector <b>300</b>, a vacuum source (connected to the vacuum passage <b>344</b>) reduces the pressure within the clearance area between the backside of the wafer and the cantilevered body <b>334</b> (e.g., the area defined by the distance d<b>6</b> and the diameter of the raised contact edge <b>326</b>). The vacuum zone creates a pressure drop within in the clearance area and holds the wafer down on the edge <b>326</b> of the wafer support.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> illustrates that the contact edge <b>326</b> has a flat top surface having a width d<b>5</b>. The top surface of the contact edge <b>326</b> may also comprise a rounded surface. Accordingly, the contact edge <b>326</b> only contacts the backside of the wafer <b>8</b> by the width d<b>5</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates that the rings may be attached via a foam or otherwise compliant layer to allow the rings to tilt slightly to compensate for un-flat wafers or end effector paddles. The contact diameter of each ring is preferably large enough to hold a wafer securely on the end effector while the wafer is in transport. An end effector that includes two wafer supports, for example, requires that the contact diameter of each chuck be approximately 0.50″ in order to prevent the wafer seated on the end effector from sliding off the end effector during transport.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">Vacuum may be routed to each chuck independently so that a leak in one does not reduce the vacuum grip of the others.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">For 200 mm cassettes and 300 mm FOSB, the end effector vertical profile is preferably less than 3-3.5 mm to be able to enter between wafers that are stacked in a cassette at ¼″ or 6 mm pitch with acceptable clearances. It is very difficult to manufacture a ball and socket design using a separate socket bushing part and using an external retainer part that would fit in this profile.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">The contact chuck is still made from relatively rigid plastic such as PEEK, PET, Ultem, Vespel, or Torlon (could also be metal or ceramic with appropriate surface treatment). It is supported via a compliant elastomer ring. The elastomer allows a small amount of angular tilt of the rigid chuck.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates another embodiment of a wafer support or chuck <b>414</b>. The disc-shaped wafer support includes a central body <b>418</b> that extends outward into cantilevered body <b>434</b>. The outer edge of the cantilevered body <b>434</b> transitions into a raised contact edge <b>426</b>. As shown, the contact edge <b>426</b> of the wafer support is elevated above the top surface of the end effector <b>400</b> to prevent the wafer from contacting the end effector. Like the contact edge shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, the contact edge <b>426</b> comprises a flat or rounded contact surface and is raised above the end effector <b>400</b> when the support <b>414</b> is seated in the end effector bore. The diameter d<b>10</b> of the support <b>414</b> is preferably less than the diameter d<b>11</b> of the bore so that the support <b>414</b> is partially seated in the bore. Again, the contact area between the raised edge <b>426</b> and the backside of the wafer is preferably minimal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068">The central body <b>418</b> includes a vacuum passage <b>442</b>. In this embodiment, the central body <b>418</b> extends into the vacuum passage <b>444</b> of the end effector <b>400</b>. The wafer support <b>314</b> is secured to the end effector <b>400</b> by a fastening device <b>454</b>, which is secured to the central body <b>418</b> and has a diameter greater than the diameter of the central body <b>418</b> so that the support <b>414</b> cannot raise out of the bore in the end effector <b>400</b>. In order to stabilize the support <b>414</b> within the bore, an o-ring <b>452</b> is placed around the central body <b>418</b> to prevent lateral movement of the support <b>414</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">The contact edge <b>426</b> of the wafer support <b>414</b> is preferably the only area of contact between the wafer support and the wafer. After the wafer is placed on the wafer supports <b>414</b> of the end effector <b>400</b>, a vacuum source (connected to the vacuum passage <b>444</b>) reduces the pressure within the clearance area between the backside of the wafer and the cantilevered body <b>434</b>. The vacuum zone creates a pressure drop within in the clearance area and holds the wafer down on the edge <b>426</b> of the wafer support.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0070"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-11</figref> illustrate additional ways for a chuck to pivot as an alternative to the gimbaling ball and socket shown in the preferred embodiments. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-11</figref> illustrate alternative lower profile and/or chucks that are cheaper to manufacture. These chucks comprise of deformable, yet still hard, material. These chucks, however, do not provide a full gimbaling range of motion (e.g., three degrees of freedom)—the chucks primarily tilt one way or another. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a foam ring that retains the wafer support. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates an o-ring that retains the wafer support. The o-ring may snap into a groove or be secured to the end effector by a retaining ring or device. The foam ring and the o-ring allow the wafer support or chuck to flex or tilt. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> provides a perspective view of the chucks shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-11</figref> placed in an end effector.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">In one embodiment, the elastomer is a foam ring with adhesive on both sides, such as 3M's VHB polyurethane foam tape with acrylic adhesive. The foam ring provides a seal and attaches the chuck to the support plate. The chuck is constrained in X, Y and Z directions by a ball in cone or ball in socket feature. As illustrated, the chuck has a small spherical protrusion which engages a conical surface in the support plate. In another embodiment, the elastomer is an o-ring. The chuck is retained by a standard retaining ring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0072">According to the invention, the end effectors can be made relatively thin, on the order of about 0.1 inches in thickness to accommodate high density semiconductor wafer storage cassettes. The end effectors can be sized to support and transport any size wafer, such as conventional 300 mm, 600 mm, and 900 mm diameter wafers. Also, the end effectors according to the invention are relatively light, minimizing the cantilever loading and resultant sagging or deflection of the robotic arm when fully extended to retrieve or replace a wafer in a storage cassette or carousel. Accordingly, the end effector can be accurately positioned and mishandling of wafers is minimized.</div>
