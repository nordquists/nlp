<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from prior Japanese Patent Application P2001-370365 filed on Dec. 4, 2001; the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The present invention relates to a method for correcting a mask pattern, a computer program product, a method for producing a photomask, and a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device. In particular, it relates to a correction of optical proximity effects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Accompanying the miniaturization of semiconductor devices in recent years, various lithography technologies have been developed making it now possible to obtain fine patterns. For instance, using modified illumination or a phase-shifting photomask, it has become possible to resolve patterns having a pattern dimension value normalized with an exposure light wavelength λ and a numerical aperture NA of a projection optical system of well below 0.5.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Under such photolithography conditions, a phenomenon of being unable to transfer a mask pattern of a photomask onto a wafer as designed, namely the Optical Proximity Effect (OPE), has become apparent. Optical Proximity Correction (OPC), which is a technique for matching a pattern shape that is transferred onto a wafer, to the original design, has become important.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">Through the introduction of the OPC technique, it has become possible to control variations in critical dimensions (CD) on the wafer. As a result, a fine pattern may be faithfully fabricated as designed on the wafer. Accordingly, the mask pattern on the photomask has become remarkably different from corresponding designed pattern on the wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">Until now, “a rule based correction method” and “a model based correction method” have been proposed as the OPC technique.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">With the rule based correction method, mask pattern correction amounts corresponding to mask pattern placement are made into a rule table beforehand. Correction proceeds based on the mask pattern placement information while referencing the rule table. The rule table is normally produced through test results. With the rule based correction method, although the correction process is simple, it is difficult to generate all of the actual variations in circuit patterns into a rule table.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">With the most simplified rule based correction method, the amount of correction is in accordance with a distance between neighboring mask patterns. With a general optical system, even though distances between mask patterns are the same, if line widths of the mask patterns differ, it has ben shown theoretically that light intensity distributions on the wafer are different during transfer. Accordingly, if the amount of correction is coordinated as a single-value function of the distance between the neighboring mask patterns, sufficient accuracy for the correction may not be possible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">Methods that complexify design rules in order to improve correction accuracy are also being studied. However, the number of rules increases with rule complexification and therefore the procedure for correction is also made more complicated. In addition, problems develop such as in deciding how the rules themselves should be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">Meanwhile, the model based correction method predicts the shape that will be transferred onto the wafer based on mask pattern information and wafer process conditions; and then adds corrections to the mask pattern to obtain desired values. With the model based correction method, to begin with, evaluation points are allocated and edges are partitioned for input mask pattern data. Light intensity calculations on adjacent evaluation points are then performed and the amount of deviation from the transferred pattern edge location on the wafer is calculated. Then, the amount of mask pattern correction for each partitioned edge is found in accordance with the amount of deviation. The edges are then shifted, transforming the mask pattern. Deviation evaluation and mask pattern correction are then repeated on a post-transformation mask pattern. If the amount of deviation has been brought down below a certain level, correction is ended.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">Here, it is important to decide how much shift to apply to the mask pattern in response to the amount of deviation. Although the mask pattern is normally only shifted by an amount proportional to the amount of deviation, it is not easy to set a proportionality coefficient. The amount of deviation of the transferred pattern on the wafer changes depending on the mask pattern shape. As a result, the deviation evaluation and the mask pattern correction is usually repeated several times.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">Highly accurate correction becomes possible if the calculation of light intensity is performed for deviation evaluation using a precision model. However, using the precision model requires a long time for the deviation evaluation. Consequently, it takes a long time to perform the correction. In general, there are many cases where a rough model having low accuracy is used to implement a high speed calculation, sacrificing a certain degree of calculation accuracy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">As described above, while highly accurate correction may be carried out with the model based correction method using the precision model with a high accuracy, the time required for correction increases. Accordingly, it is difficult to obtain a desired level of correction accuracy within a practical length of correction time.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">Various embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. It is to be noted that the same or similar reference numerals are applied to the same or similar parts and elements throughout the drawings, and the description of the same or similar parts and elements will be omitted or simplified.</div>
<heading>First Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a lithography apparatus according to a first embodiment of the present invention includes: a pattern correction processor <b>10</b> performing OPC on input designed mask pattern data and outputting corrected mask pattern data; an external storage unit <b>15</b> reading out OPC program codes stored on a memory medium and supplying the OPC program codes to the pattern correction processor <b>10</b>; a pattern data storage unit <b>16</b> for acquiring the corrected mask pattern data from the pattern correction processor <b>10</b> as write data; and an electron beam (EB) lithography system <b>18</b> for writing a mask pattern on a mask blank <b>4</b> based on the corrected mask pattern data output from the pattern data storage unit <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">The pattern correction processor <b>10</b> includes a data input module <b>11</b> acquiring the designed mask pattern data; a correction module <b>12</b> performing OPC on the designed mask pattern data; a data output module <b>13</b> outputting the corrected mask pattern data to the pattern data storage unit <b>16</b>; and an internal storage <b>14</b> storing the program code for implementing OPC. The pattern correction processor <b>10</b> is realized with a central processing unit (CPU) of computers or the like. The OPC program implemented with the correction module <b>12</b> is read out from the internal storage <b>14</b>. Alternatively, it is also allowable for the OPC program codes stored on the memory medium loaded into the external storage unit <b>15</b> to be read out.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">In accordance with the write data, the EB lithography system <b>18</b> writes the mask pattern onto the mask blank <b>4</b> using an electron beam. For example, with a raster scan method, the mask pattern is transferred onto the mask blank <b>4</b> by scanning the electron beam in a fixed direction and turning the electron beam on and off according to the write data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">With the pattern correction processor <b>10</b> implementing a model based correction method according to the first embodiment, for instance as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a line pattern <b>101</b> having a line width W is input to the data input module <b>11</b> as the designed mask pattern data. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, along a perimeter of the line pattern <b>101</b>, the allocation of evaluation points Q<b>1</b> through Q<b>8</b> and partitioning into edge segments E<b>1</b> through E<b>8</b> is performed with the correction module <b>12</b>. A transferred pattern is simulated on the wafer at the evaluation points Q<b>1</b> through Q<b>8</b>. In a case where there is little pattern adjacent to the line pattern <b>101</b>, an OPE emerges strongly, and in particular ends in the longitudinal direction of the transferred pattern shrink. Accordingly, a shape of the corrected mask pattern, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, has serifs <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> that include jogs <b>102</b> <i>a</i>, <b>102</b> <i>b </i>and <b>103</b> <i>a</i>, <b>103</b> <i>b</i>, respectively, at the ends along the length of the line pattern <b>101</b>. A serif length Xs of the serif <b>102</b> is longer than the edge segments E<b>2</b> and E<b>3</b> of the line pattern <b>101</b>, and a serif width Ys is wider than the line width W of the edge segment E<b>1</b>. A serif length Xt of the serif <b>103</b> is longer than the edge segments E<b>6</b> and E<b>7</b> of the line pattern <b>101</b>, and a serif width Yt is wider than the line width W of the edge segment E<b>8</b>. A length Xu of a center portion between the serifs <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> is the same length as the edge segments E<b>4</b> and E<b>5</b> of the line pattern <b>101</b>, and a width Yu is substantially equal to the line width W. The corrected mask pattern is output from the data output module <b>13</b> and stored in the pattern data storage unit <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">With the model based correction method according to the first embodiment, correction amounts are first found at each evaluation point by executing a correction calculation using a rough correction with a rough model obtained by simple approximation. After reaching convergence conditions in the rough correction, the correction calculation is again executed using a precision correction with a precision model with a rough correction result as an initial value.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">The rough correction and the precision correction are carried out using similar loop processing. More specifically, a predicted transferred pattern is simulated upon the wafer through a calculation of a light intensity, using a setting calculation model. An amount of deviation between the predicted transferred pattern and the designed mask pattern is found and compared with a criterion. When the amount of deviation is larger than the criterion, processing returns to a stage simulating the predicted transferred pattern, repeating the loop processing until the amount of deviation is less than the criterion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">For the rough correction, the rough model defined by an approximate expression that sacrifices calculation accuracy but allows high-speed calculation is applied. On the other hand, for the precision correction, a precision model that requires more time but allows highly accurate processing is applied. The approximate expression used for the rough model has a smaller number of parameters than those for the computation expression used for the precision model. The rough correction allows simulation at a higher speed than the precision correction due to the smaller number of parameters.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">A difference in dimensions between a designed pattern and a maximum value of a variation allowed for a semiconductor device performance in a fabricated pattern dimension, is defined as a “process-induced permissible dimension error (CD tolerance)”. In particular, a contribution of the OPE to the process-induced permissible dimension error is defined as a “permissible dimension error”. A calculation accuracy of the rough model is set lower than the permissible dimension error, and a rough criterion is set larger than the permissible dimension error. The calculation accuracy of the precision correction is several times higher than the permissible dimension error, and a precision criterion is set at the permissible dimension error.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">With the first embodiment of the present invention, following application of the OPC using the rough correction, it is possible to shorten the length of time for highly accurate correction processing by implementing the precision correction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">In the model based correction method according to the first embodiment, an exposure apparatus used in the description of each model, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, is assumed to be a scanning excimer laser reduced projection exposure apparatus having a reduction ratio of 1:4. It should be noted that the reduction ratio of the exposure apparatus is made 1:4 solely for the sake of convenience, and an arbitrary reduction ratio may naturally be allowed. In addition, a step-and-repeat exposure apparatus (stepper) or any other appropriate exposure apparatus may naturally be used as the exposure apparatus. A krypton fluoride (KrF) excimer laser having a wavelength λ of 248 nm may be used as a light source <b>21</b>, and exposure light directed from the light source <b>21</b> is incident to a photomask <b>5</b> through an aperture <b>22</b> and an illumination optics system <b>23</b>. A projection optics system <b>25</b> causes an image of a mask pattern of the photomask <b>5</b> to be projected onto a wafer (semiconductor substrate) <b>6</b>. The photomask <b>5</b> and the wafer <b>6</b> are disposed on a mask stage <b>24</b> and a wafer stage <b>26</b>, respectively. The mask stage <b>24</b> and the wafer stage <b>26</b> are aligned along the optical axis so that the mask pattern of the photomask <b>5</b> is focused on the wafer <b>6</b>. A controller <b>27</b> adjusts an amount of emitted light from the light source <b>21</b> based on preset data. The controller <b>27</b> also adjusts a resolution of a transferred pattern on the wafer <b>6</b>, a depth of focus, aberration correction, etc., for the aperture <b>22</b>, the illumination optics system <b>23</b>, and the projection optics system <b>25</b>. Moreover, the controller <b>27</b> drives the mask stage <b>26</b> and the wafer stage <b>24</b> with a mask stage drive <b>28</b> and a wafer stage drive <b>29</b>, respectively, and exposes after positioning within a plane intersecting the optical axis. Here the wavelength of the light source <b>21</b> is given as λ, the numerical aperture of the lens of the projection optics <b>25</b> as NA, and the coherence factor of the optical system as σ.</div>

Normally, M ranges up to 8 and N ranges between 10 and 20, which means that the rough correction takes 1/10th the calculation time of the precision correction or less.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">Next, a correction method algorithm for the mask pattern according to the first embodiment of the present invention is described using a flowchart shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> through <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">(a) To begin with, in step S<b>111</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a designed mask pattern <b>31</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, is input. In step S<b>112</b>, evaluation points Q<b>1</b>, Q<b>2</b>, . . . , Q<b>5</b>, . . . are allocated along an edge of the designed mask pattern <b>31</b>, and in step <b>113</b>, edge segments E<b>1</b>, E<b>2</b>, . . . , E<b>5</b>, . . . are partitioned to define the location of jog and serif generation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">(b) Next, the rough correction is carried out with the model based correction method using the rough model. The rough criterion is set at several times, for instance 2 to 3 times, larger than the permissible dimension error. In step S<b>114</b>, the image intensity simulation is carried out at each of the evaluation points Q<b>1</b>, Q<b>2</b>, . . . , Q<b>5</b>, . . . in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> using the rough model shown with equation (8), and then, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, a first amount of deviation T<b>1</b> is calculated from the position of the edge segment E<b>1</b> on the end of the designed mask pattern <b>31</b> to an end of a predicted transferred pattern <b>41</b>. In step S<b>115</b>, the first amount of deviation T<b>1</b> is compared with the rough criterion. If the first amount of diversion T<b>1</b> is larger than the rough criterion, in step S<b>116</b>, a rough correction amount for the designed mask pattern <b>31</b> is found by multiplying the first amount of deviation T<b>1</b> at edge segments E<b>1</b>, E<b>2</b>, and E<b>3</b> with a correction coefficient found empirically. In accordance with the rough correction amount, in step S<b>117</b>, the edges are shifted to transform the designed mask pattern <b>31</b>. Loop processing again returns to step S<b>114</b> to perform simulation on a transformed mask pattern, and then in step S<b>115</b>, a second amount of deviation T<b>2</b> to the predicted transferred pattern <b>42</b> is evaluated. If the second amount of deviation T<b>2</b> is larger than the rough criterion level, the rough correction is repeated based on the second amount of deviation T<b>2</b>. If the second amount of deviation T<b>2</b> has been brought down to below the rough criterion level, the rough correction ends. As a result, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, jogs <b>32</b> <i>a </i>and <b>32</b> <i>b</i>, and serif <b>32</b> are added to the end of the designed mask pattern <b>31</b>. Loop processing again returns to step S<b>114</b> to perform simulation on a transformed mask pattern, and then in step S<b>115</b>, a second amount of deviation T<b>2</b> to the predicted transcription pattern <b>42</b> is evaluated. If the second amount of deviation T<b>2</b> is larger than the rough criterion level, the rough correction is repeated based on the second amount of deviation T<b>2</b>. If the second amount of deviation T<b>2</b> has been brought down to below the rough criterion level, the rough correction ends. As a result, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, jogs <b>32</b> <i>a </i>and <b>32</b> <i>b</i>, and serif <b>32</b> are added to the end of the designed mask pattern <b>31</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">(c) Thereafter, using a rough corrected mask pattern data obtained after the rough correction as an initial value, precision correction is carried out with the model based correction method with the precision model. The precision criterion is set equal to the permissible dimension error. In step S<b>118</b>, the image intensity simulation is carried out at each of the evaluation points Q<b>1</b>, Q<b>2</b>, . . . , Q<b>5</b>, . . . using the precision model shown with equation (1), and a third amount of deviation T<b>3</b> is calculated from the position of the edge segment E<b>1</b> on the end of the designed mask pattern <b>31</b> to the end of the predicted transferred pattern <b>42</b>. In step S<b>119</b>, the third amount of deviation T<b>3</b> is compared with the precision criterion. If the third amount of deviation T<b>3</b> is larger than the precision criterion level, in step S<b>120</b>, a precision correction amount is found in accordance with the third amount of deviation T<b>3</b>, and then in step S<b>121</b>, the edge of the serif <b>32</b> is shifted to transform the mask pattern. Processing again returns to step S<b>118</b> to perform simulation on a transformed mask pattern, and then in step S<b>119</b>, the third amount of deviation T<b>3</b> to the predicted transferred pattern is newly evaluated. If the new third amount of deviation T<b>3</b> is larger than the precision criterion level, the precision correction is repeated based on the new third amount of deviation T<b>3</b>. Loop processing is repeated until the third amount of deviation T<b>3</b> falls below the precision criterion, then as a result, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, jogs <b>33</b> <i>a </i>and <b>33</b> <i>b</i>, and serif <b>33</b> are added to the ends of the designed mask pattern data <b>31</b>. In this manner, the predicted transferred pattern <b>43</b> is corrected to within the permissible dimension error.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">Here, the first amount of deviation T<b>1</b> prior to OPC implementation is larger than the permissible dimension error, or in other words, the precision criterion. The second amount of deviation T<b>2</b> eventually obtained through the rough correction is brought to below than the rough criterion, or in other words, lower than a value of two or three times the precision criterion level. The third amount of deviation eventually obtained through the precision correction is kept within the precision criterion. Accordingly, relation for the first through the third amounts of deviation becomes T<b>3</b>&gt;&gt;T<b>2</b>&gt;T<b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">With the mask pattern correction method according to the first embodiment of the present invention, the rough corrected mask pattern data obtained using the rough correction is applied as the initial value for the precision correction. Accordingly, the correction processing time is the sum of the rough correction time and the precision correction time. As described above, the rough correction time is shorter, equal to or less than one-tenth the precision correction time. On the other hand, the rough correction has inferior correction accuracy in comparison with the precision correction. If the rough criterion were to be set to the precision criterion, which is the permissible dimension error, the number of rough correction iterations would increase, requiring longer time. Conversely, if the rough criterion were to be made too lax, shortening of the subsequent precision correction time would not be possible. Therefore, the rough criterion level is set approximately several times larger than the precision criterion. In addition, the rough criterion may be set so that the number of iterations of precision correction performed with the rough corrected mask pattern having the second amount of deviation T<b>2</b> as the initial value is lower than the number of iterations for performing OPC using only the precision correction. For instance, when OPC is performed using only the precision correction, the iterations are between 10 and 20. If the rough criterion level is set to between two and three times that of the precision criterion, then the rough correction and the precision correction iterations fall within 10 times and 1-2 times, respectively. Accordingly, the total correction processing time for the first embodiment is less than one-tenth compared with that using only the precision correction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">With the first embodiment of the present invention, since the precision correction is performed using the rough corrected mask pattern obtained through the rough correction as the initial value, it is possible to reduce the amount of processing time necessary to obtain high correction accuracy.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0073">In a second embodiment of the present invention, a rough correction of a mask pattern correction method differs from that set forth in the first embodiment. With the mask pattern correction method according to the first embodiment, both the rough correction and the precision correction are model based correction methods.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0074">Next, a mask pattern correction method algorithm according to the second embodiment of the present invention is described using a flowchart shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> through <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10D</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0076">(b) Next, rough correction is carried out with the rule based correction method.
