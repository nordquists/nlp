<heading>RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/823,420, filed on Apr. 13, 2004, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,033,895 which claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119 to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2003-0030614, filed May 14, 2003, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference, in their entirety.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The present invention pertains, in general, to a semiconductor element and a method of fabricating the same and, more particularly, to a metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS) transistor with an elevated source/drain structure and a method of fabricating the same, using a selective epitaxial growth (SEG) process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">As well-known to those skilled in the art, Field Effect Transistors (FET) have been gradually scaled down in size in accordance with the recent trend toward small-sized, lightweight, and slim electronic devices. However, as a result of the downsizing of the FETs, the corresponding effective channel lengths are reduced. This, in turn, causes an undesirable effect, referred to as the “short-channel” effect, which degrades the punch-through characteristics between a source electrode and a drain electrode of the FET.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">In an attempt to avoid this problem, a shallow junction source/drain structure has been developed. According to this configuration, a source and a drain are constructed in the form of an LDD (Lightly Doped Drain) structure to suppress the short channel effect. However, such an LDD structure is limited in use, since it can be applied to only a semiconductor element with a gate line width of 0.35 μm or larger to suppress the short channel effect, and cannot be applied to a semiconductor element with a gate line width of 0.35 μm or less. This is because there is a limit to the extent to which the depth of the junction can be reduced, and thus formation of a junction in the LDD structure is impractical or impossible.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">In order to avoid the above limitations of the LDD structure, the present invention provides a field effect transistor (FET) that includes an elevated source/drain junction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">In a metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS) transistor with an elevated source/drain structure and in a method of fabricating the MOS transistor with the elevated source/drain structure using a selective epitaxy growth (SEG) process, a source/drain extension junction is formed after an epi-layer is formed, thereby preventing degradation of the source/drain junction region. In addition, the source/drain extension junction is partially overlapped by a lower portion of the gate layer, since two gate spacers are formed and two elevated source/drain layers are formed in accordance with the SEG process. This mitigates the short channel effect and reduces sheet resistance in the source/drain layers and in the gate layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">In a first aspect, the present invention is directed to a MOS transistor with an elevated source/drain structure, including a gate dielectric formed on an active region of a semiconductor substrate, and a gate electrode formed on the gate dielectric.

In this regard, a second gate spacer is formed on lateral side surfaces of the first gate spacer, and a second epi-layer is formed on the first epi-layer.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">Furthermore, the MOS transistor may further include a source/drain extension layer formed by a dopant ion-implanting process, and a deep source/drain layer formed by deeply ion-implanting the dopant in a portion of the semiconductor substrate positioned under the second epi-layer. At this time, the source/drain extension layer is positioned under the first epi-layer and partially overlapped by a lower portion of the gate electrode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">In one embodiment, the thickness of the first epi-layer is about 20 to 30% of the thickness of the resulting elevated source/drain layer. Additionally, the thickness of the second epi-layer is about 70 to 80% of the thickness of the resulting elevated source/drain layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">In one embodiment, the first epi-layer or second epi-layer consists of silicon or silicon-germanium. Moreover, the second gate spacer is four to six times wider than the first gate spacer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">The present invention is further directed to a method of fabricating an MOS transistor with an elevated source/drain structure, including forming a gate dielectric on an active region of a semiconductor substrate and forming a gate electrode on the gate dielectric. A first gate spacer is formed on lateral side surfaces of the gate electrode. A first epi-layer is formed on the semiconductor substrate. A second gate spacer is formed on lateral side surfaces of the first gate spacer. A second epi-layer is formed on the first epi-layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">The method may further include forming a first gate oxide before the first gate spacer is formed, and forming a second gate oxide before the second gate spacer is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">In one embodiment, the method further includes forming a first poly-layer on the gate electrode while the first epi-layer is formed, and forming a second poly-layer on the first poly-layer while the second epi-layer is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">In one embodiment, the method further includes ion-implanting a dopant in the semiconductor substrate to form a source/drain extension layer after the first epi-layer is formed, and ion-implanting a dopant in the semiconductor substrate to form a deep source/drain layer after the second epi-layer is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">The thickness of the first epi-layer is about 20 to 30% of the resulting thickness of the elevated source/drain layer. Additionally, the thickness of the second epi-layer is about 70 to 80% of the resulting thickness of the elevated source/drain layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">In one embodiment, the second gate spacer is four to six times wider than the first gate spacer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">In one embodiment, the first epi-layer or second epi-layer consists of silicon.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 6</figref> are sectional views illustrating the fabrication of an MOS transistor with an elevated source/drain structure according to the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, device separators <b>104</b>, or isolation structures, are formed on a semiconductor substrate <b>101</b> to define an active area, or active region, between the separators <b>104</b>. Preferably, the semiconductor substrate <b>101</b> is composed of silicon. The device separators may be formed, for example, by any of the well-known techniques including the formation of field oxide structures <b>104</b> according to the local oxidation of silicon (LOCOS) process, and the shallow trench isolation (STI) method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">A gate dielectric <b>106</b> is formed on the active region of the semiconductor substrate <b>101</b>, for example, by a deposit of a material selected from the group consisting of SiO<sub>2</sub>, SiON, SiN, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, the resulting gate dielectric <b>106</b> thus formed is 20 to 100 Å in thickness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">A conductive film for a gate electrode is then deposited on the active area of the semiconductor substrate <b>101</b> on which the gate dielectric <b>106</b> is formed, and the resulting semiconductor substrate <b>101</b> is patterned to form the gate electrode <b>108</b> structure on the semiconductor substrate <b>101</b>. In this regard, in one embodiment, the material of the conductive film is selected from the group consisting of poly-silicon (poly-Si), silicon-germanium (SiGe), and germanium (Ge), and other applicable conductive materials. The gate electrode <b>108</b> is subjected to an oxidation process or a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process to form a first gate oxide <b>110</b> on lateral surfaces, or side walls, of the gate electrode <b>108</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">A dielectric layer, such as a nitride (e.g. SiN) layer, is then formed on the semiconductor substrate <b>101</b> according to the CVD process, and the resulting semiconductor substrate <b>101</b> is etched to form a first gate spacer <b>114</b> on the first gate oxide <b>110</b>. At this time, the gate dielectric layer, other than that portion covered by a lower portion of the first gate oxide <b>110</b> surrounding the gate electrode <b>108</b> and other than that portion positioned under the first gate electrode <b>108</b> is etched in an anisotropic etching procedure, while the semiconductor substrate <b>101</b> is etched to form the first gate spacer <b>114</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">After the formation of the first gate spacer <b>114</b>, a high-temperature hydrogen baking process using hydrogen gas is conducted so as to smoothly deposit a first epi-layer <b>118</b> on the semiconductor substrate <b>101</b> in accordance with a selective epitaxial growth (SEG) process. At this time, it is preferable to conduct the hydrogen bake process at 800 to 900° C. under hydrogen atmosphere for one to five minutes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the SEG process is conducted in a low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) or a ultra-high vacuum chemical vapor deposition (UHV-CVD) procedure to form a gate silicon <b>116</b> on the gate electrode <b>108</b> and to form the first epi-layer <b>118</b> between the field oxide <b>104</b> and the first gate spacer <b>114</b>. In this regard, the first epi-layer <b>118</b> is about 20 to 30% of the resulting elevated source/drain layer, in terms of thickness. The gate silicon <b>116</b> is extended by the SEG process to form a poly-layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">Turning to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a dopant is implanted in a portion of the semiconductor substrate <b>101</b> under the first epi-layer <b>118</b> at a concentration of about 10<sup>−14 </sup>ions/cm<sup>2</sup>, for example BF<sub>2 </sub>is ion-implanted at 3 keV in the case of PMOS (p-channel metal-oxide semiconductor) and As is ion-implanted at 10 keV in the case of NMOS (n-channel metal-oxide semiconductor) in the semiconductor substrate <b>101</b> to form a source/drain extension layer <b>112</b> in the semiconductor substrate <b>101</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a second gate oxide <b>130</b> is formed on the first gate spacer <b>114</b> in accordance with the CVD process. A dielectric, such as nitride (e.g. SiN), is then deposited on the second gate oxide <b>130</b> by the CVD process so as to construct a second gate spacer <b>134</b>. Subsequently, the resulting semiconductor substrate <b>101</b> is etched to form the second gate spacer <b>134</b>. At this time, it is preferable that a lateral thickness ratio of the first gate spacer <b>114</b> to the second gate spacer <b>134</b> is about 1:5.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the SEG process is conducted, for example using an LPCVD or UHV-CVD procedure, to form a second epi-layer <b>140</b> on the gate silicon <b>116</b> and the first epi-layer <b>118</b>. In this regard, the second epi-layer <b>140</b> is about 70 to 80% of the resulting elevated source/drain layer, in terms of thickness. Accordingly, it is preferable that a thickness ratio of the first epi-layer <b>118</b> to the second epi-layer <b>140</b> is about 2:5. In the present invention, the thickness of the first epi-layer <b>118</b> is about 100 Å, and that of the second epi-layer <b>140</b> is about 250 Å.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">The extended gate silicon <b>116</b> is once again extended by the SEG process of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>: As a result, the width of the poly-layer positioned on the gate electrode is larger than the width of the gate. It is preferable that the poly-layer <b>116</b> positioned on the gate electrode <b>108</b> includes silicon or germanium. Accordingly, when the gate silicon is extended in this manner, the gate resistance is reduced, and the device junction leakage property is improved because, owing to the extension, the gate silicide is farther away from the junctions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the dopant is deeply ion-implanted into a portion of the semiconductor substrate <b>101</b> positioned under the second epi-layer <b>140</b> to form deep source/drain regions <b>120</b> under the source/drain electrodes, and the resulting semiconductor substrate <b>101</b> is annealed to activate the dopant ion-implanted in the semiconductor substrate <b>101</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">Additionally, when the first or second epi-layer <b>118</b> or <b>140</b> contains silicon, the silicon epi-layer may be grown under deposition conditions with a pressure of about 10 to 30 torr and a temperature of about 850° C. using a source gas consisting of dichlorosilane (DCS) and HCl in accordance with the LPCVD process. It is preferable to grow the silicon epi-layer at deposition pressure of about 20 torr.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">Alternatively, when the first or second epi-layer <b>118</b> or <b>140</b> contains silicon, the silicon epi-layer may be grown under deposition conditions of a pressure of about 10<sup>−4 </sup>to 10<sup>−5 </sup>torr and a temperature of about 600 to 700° C. using a source gas consisting of Si<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6 </sub>in accordance with the UHV-CVD process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">On the other hand, when the first or second epi-layer <b>118</b> or <b>140</b> contains silicon-germanium, the silicon-germanium epi-layer may be grown under deposition conditions with a pressure of about 20 torr and a temperature of about 650 to 750° C. using a source gas consisting of dichlorosilane (DCS), HCl, and GeH<sub>4 </sub>in accordance with the LPCVD process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">Furthermore, when the first or second epi-layer <b>118</b> or <b>140</b> contains silicon-germanium, the silicon-germanium epi-layer may be grown under deposition conditions with a pressure of about 10<sup>−4 </sup>to 10<sup>−5 </sup>torr and a temperature of about 550 to 600° C. using a source gas consisting of dichlorosilane (DCS), HCl, and GeH<sub>4 </sub>in accordance with the UHV-CVD process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">Meanwhile, the dopant content in the first or second epi-layer <b>118</b> or <b>140</b> may be controlled to 10<sup>−20 </sup>ions/cm<sup>2 </sup>or more by in-situ doping the dopant, such as boron, phosphorous, arsenic, indium, or antimony, while growing the first or second epi-layer <b>118</b> or <b>140</b> according to the SEG process. Additionally, the dopant may be implanted into the first or second epi-layer by well-known techniques. In the case of an NMOS device, As or P is implanted at 40 keV into the first or second epi-layer, and B is implanted at 3 keV into the first or second epi-layer in the case of a PMOS device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">As described above, the present invention provides a method of fabricating a MOS transistor with an elevated source/drain structure in accordance with a selective epitaxial growth (SEG) process, in which a source/drain extension junction is formed after an epi-layer is formed, thereby preventing the short channel effect which otherwise would have been caused by the diffusion of the source/drain junctions; leakage current is therefore reduced. Furthermore, the configuration and process of the present invention are advantageous in that the source/drain extension junctions are partially overlapped by a lower portion of the gate structure, because two lateral gate spacers are formed and two elevated source/drain layers are formed in accordance with the selective epitaxial growth process, thereby preventing the short channel effect and, at the same time, reducing sheet resistance of the source/drain layer and the gate layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">While this invention has been particularly shown and described with references to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</div>
