<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This is a division of application Ser. No. 09/959,644, filed Nov. 2, 2001, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates to a semiconductor thin film that is fabricated by a laser crystallizing method, as well as a thin film transistor and semiconductor devices, such as a liquid crystal display apparatus, an active matrix type liquid crystal apparatus, a solar cell and the like, which use the semiconductor thin film, and a method of fabricating the semiconductor thin film, the thin film transistor and the semiconductor devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The laser crystallizing technology is most widely viewed as a means to fabricate a crystalline semiconductor at a low cost, which crystalline semiconductor is of the type which is applied to a high performance thin film transistor, a high value-added liquid crystal display apparatus and a solar cell. Because the crystallization of a semiconductor thin film locally heats only the vicinity of the semiconductor surface by laser irradiation, a low-cost glass substrate and a low-cost organic resin substrate can be used for the supporting substrate, and, accordingly, the laser crystallizing technology contributes to a reduced cost. Since the laser-irradiated semiconductor is first liquefied and then solidified so as to be crystallized, a high-quality crystalline semiconductor having less defects can be obtained. One way to improve the film quality of the crystalline semiconductor is to increase the crystal grain size. By increasing the crystal grain size, the volumetric ratio of the crystal grain boundary, including defects, to the whole semiconductor film is decreased, and, consequently, the mobility of electrons and holes is improved. Further, a decrease itself in number of the defects improves the quality of the crystalline semiconductor. In regard to a way to increase the crystal grain size, (1) Dig. Of Tech. Papers, 1997, Int. Workshop Active Matrix Liquid Crystal Display (Business Center of Academic Societies, Tokyo 1997), p59, proposes a method in which, after crystallizing an amorphous silicon by laser irradiation, an amorphous silicon film is formed on the fabricated polycrystalline silicon, and then the amorphous silicon is crystallized by laser irradiation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">On the other hand, a problem of the crystalline semiconductor, for example, the polycrystalline silicon fabricated by a laser crystallizing method, concerns the formation of an uneven surface due to many projections which are produced when a high-quality polycrystalline silicon having large crystal grain size is fabricated. The height of the projections is nearly equal to the film thickness of the semiconductor before irradiating the laser light. A mechanism for producing such projection is considered in the Applied Physics Letters, Vol.68, No.15, 1996, p2138, which indicates that the projections are formed by volumetric expansion caused by the phase transition from the melted silicon to the solid silicon at a boundary where surfaces of crystal growth in a direction lateral to the substrate surface collide with each other. The crystal growth in the lateral direction generally occurs when a crystal having a crystal grain size larger than the thickness of the semiconductor thin film is formed. When a semiconductor thin film having large unevenness is used to form the active layer of a coplanar type thin film transistor, the concentration of an electric field occurs at the projections so as to cause dielectric breakdown in the gate insulation film serving as the upper layer, of the active layer or to cause reduction of the reliability of the gate insulation film such as by production of defects due to hot carriers. In order to protect against these problems, the thickness of the gate insulation film needs to be formed so as to be thicker than 100 nm, and, consequently, it becomes difficult to drive the thin film transistor with low power consumption. Further, since the crystallinity of the projection is very low and the projection is located in a channel area when the semiconductor having many projections is used for a coplanar type or a normal stagger type thin film transistor, the ON current is reduced. In regard to techniques for suppressing the occurrence of the projections when the semiconductor thin film is crystallized with laser light, the following techniques have been reported.
</div> <ul> <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0005">(2) A method of irradiating laser light in stages with a pitch of 10 mJ/cm2 is described in IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRON DEVICES, Vol.42, No.2, 1995, p251.</li> <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0006">(3) A method of irradiating laser light after poly-crystallizing amorphous silicon using a solid phase growth method is described in Dig. of Tech. Papers 1997, Int. Workshop Active Matrix Liquid Crystal Displays (Business Center of Academic Societies, Tokyo 1997), p167.</li> <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0007">(4) A method of changing the shape of a laser beam so as to have a wide lower slopes is described in Shin-etsu Chemical Technical Report EID98-19 (1998-06), p67.</li> </ul>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">The above-described conventional technology (1) which proposes to increase the crystal grain size of the crystalline semiconductor has a problem in that the crystal grain size can be certainly increased, but projections having a height nearly equal to the film thickness of the semiconductor are produced, and, accordingly, a large unevenness is produced. Further, there is another problem in that, because the amorphous silicon before laser irradiation is exposed to the atmosphere in order to perform dehydrogenation and, thereby, a natural oxide film is formed on the surface, oxygen enters into the silicon film when it is crystallized by laser light to reduce the quality of the film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">On the other hand, the conventional technology (2) for suppressing production of the projections has a problem in that, since laser light is irradiated in stages with a small pitch of 10 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>and the fine crystalline silicon that is first formed is difficult to melt, what can be fabricated is only polycrystalline silicon having a crystal grain size of nearly 60 nm, and, accordingly, polycrystalline silicon having a large crystal grain size above 500 nm can not be fabricated. The conventional technology (3) for suppressing production of the projections has a problem in that, because the solid phase growth method is used and, consequently, the silicon is heated at 1000Â° C., an economical glass substrate can not be used, and, accordingly, the crystalline semiconductor can not be fabricated with a low cost. The conventional technology (4) for suppressing production of the projections has a problem in that, since the crystal grain size becomes small as the projection is made small, the small roughness and the large crystal grain size are not compatible with each other.</div>

<heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">Embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067">Initially, a first embodiment in which the present invention is applied to fabrication of a polycrystalline silicon thin film will be described below with reference to the drawings. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1(A)</figref> and (B) are a plan view and a sectional view, respectively, showing the crystal structure of polycrystalline silicon formed on a glass substrate <b>1</b> and a lower base insulation film <b>2</b> through a method of the present invention. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1(C)</figref> and (D) are a plan view and a sectional view, respectively, showing the crystal structure of polycrystalline silicon having an average crystal grain size of 210 nm fabricated through a conventional laser crystallization method. The film thickness of the polycrystalline silicon in both examples is 60 nm. It can be understood from the plane structure of the polycrystalline silicon that is formed in accordance with the present invention, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(A)</figref>, that the average crystal grain size is as large as 530 nm, and from the cross-sectional view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(B)</figref> that projections are hardly produced at the crystal grain boundaries. On the other hand, in the polycrystalline silicon that is formed according to the conventional fabrication method, a projection having a level of height equal to the thickness of the film is produced at the crystal grain boundary. In accordance with the present invention, the size of a crystal grain is defined as the size of a pattern whose periphery is surrounded by etched grain boundaries appearing when the surface of the polycrystalline silicon is treated with SECCO etching solution to selectively etching the crystal grain boundaries. This pattern can be observed using an analysis apparatus, such as a scanning electron microscope (SEM), an atomic force microscope (AFM), a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) or the like. Further, the grain size of each crystal grain is defined by the diameter of a circle having an area equal to the area of each crystal grain, and the average crystal grain size 1a of an arbitrary region (an area S) containing m crystal grains is defined by the following equation. In accordance with the present invention, in the case of using a SEM, the area S of the region to obtain an average crystal grain size is defined as the sum of areas of crystal grains each of which is photographed at a magnification capable of checking the size of a crystal grain and each of which is photographed so that the whole grain boundary falls within the field of view without being cut out of the field of view. In a case where there are a plurality of fields of view, the area S of the region is defined as the total sum of the sums of areas of crystal grains each of which falls within the individual field of view in the whole grain. In the case of using an AFM or a STM, the area S of the region is defined as the sum of areas of crystal grains, each whole grain boundary of which falls within the arbitrary measuring field.

</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068">In accordance with the present invention, the shape of each crystal grain is irregular because the polycrystalline silicon is formed by laser crystallization. However, since the polycrystalline silicon isotropically grows from a generated crystal seed in a direction parallel to the substrate when the melted silicon is crystallized, the shape of the polycrystalline silicon crystal does not become a complex dendrite which can be observed in polycrystalline silicon formed through a solid phase growth method. From observation of crystal grains after treating a surface of the polycrystalline silicon with SECCO etching solution, it was found that, in the polycrystalline silicon that is formed in accordance with the present invention, at least more than 50% of the crystal grains satisfied the relation Lnâ¦4ÏRn. Therein, Rn=(Sn/Ï)<sup>1/2</sup>, Sn is a surface area of an arbitrary crystal grain, and Ln is a circumferential length on the surface of the arbitrary crystal grain. From the above relation, it can be understood that the volume of the crystal grain boundary of the polycrystalline silicon in accordance with the present invention is smaller than that of the polycrystalline silicon film prepared through a solid phase growth and composed of crystal grains for which the above relation generally does not hold, and that the polycrystalline silicon formed in accordance with the present invention is a high-quality crystalline semiconductor having a small defect density over the whole silicon film. Further, from observation of a cross section of the polycrystalline silicon of the present invention using a transmission electron microscope (TEM), it was found that more than 70% of all the crystal grains continuously extended from an interface between the semiconductor layer and a base layer to the semiconductor surface without a discontinuity at some midpoint. Because there are few regions in the film where plural crystal grains are stacked up in the direction of the film thickness, the polycrystalline silicon in accordance with the present invention is a high-quality polycrystalline silicon having less defects caused by crystal grains extending in the lateral direction of the substrate. It was found from measurement of the surface of the semiconductor film using an atomic force microscope (AFM) that the average roughness of the surface was 2 nm. Therein, the average roughness of the surface with respect to the present invention means an arithmetic average roughness (Ra), and in a case of three-dimensionally analyzing the surface form of the semiconductor, the average roughness of the surface is a value obtained by dividing a volume of a portion that is surrounded by a quadric surface of the surface form and a plane at the average level of the surface form by the measured area. In accordance with the present invention, when an analyzing apparatus that is capable of three-dimensionally analyzing the surface form, such as an AFM, a scanning tunneling electron microscope (STM) or the like, is used for analyzing a measured area, the measured area is an arbitrary region of the semiconductor surface having a size larger than an analysis limit area which is analyzable by the analyzing means. On the other hand, in the case of analyzing a surface form of the two-dimensional cross-sectional structure of a semiconductor, the average roughness of the surface is a value obtained by dividing an area of a portion surrounded by a quadric curve of the surface form and a line in the average level of the surface form by the measured length, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The cross-sectional structure can be observed by a photograph taken by a TEM or a high-resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM). Further, the cross-sectional structure can be observed by scanning the measuring needle of an AFM or an STM once. In accordance with the present invention, when an electron microscope, such as an AFM or an STM, is used as an analyzing means, the region of measured length for calculating the average roughness is a field of view or plural fields of view of the electron microscope in a magnitude capable of calculating the roughness. When an AFM or STM is used, the measured length is an arbitrary region of the semiconductor surface having a length longer than an analysis limit length. In accordance with the present invention, the method of calculating the average roughness may employ either a method of calculating from a three-dimensional form or a method of calculating from a cross-sectional form. Letting the average height of the plane be the X-Y plane, the longitudinal direction be the Z axis, and the curve of the measured surface form be z=f(x, y), when a three-dimensional form is observed, the average roughness Ra can be expressed by the following equation:
<br/>
<i>Ra</i>=(1/(<i>LxÂ·Ly</i>))<i>Xâ«</i> <sup>Lx</sup> <sub>0</sub>â«<sup>Ly</sup> <sub>0</sub> <i>f</i>(<i>x, y</i>)<i>dxdy</i>
<br/>
where Lx is a measured length in the X direction, and Ly is a measured length in the Y direction.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">On the other hand, Letting the average height of the line be on X axis, the longitudinal direction be on Y axis, and the curve of the measured surface form be y=f(x), when the cross-sectional form is observed, the average roughness Ra can be expressed by the following equation:

<i>Ra</i>=(1<i>/Lx</i>)<i>X â«</i> <sup>Lx</sup> <sub>0</sub> <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)<i>dx,</i>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0070">Further, from observation of the polycrystalline silicon film in accordance with the present invention by X-ray diffractometry, it was found that the crystal plane of the silicon film was oriented to mainly the (1. 1. 1) plane. The polycrystalline silicon in accordance with the present invention is very useful for an active layer of a thin film transistor and a semiconductor layer of a solar cell because the crystal grain size is as large as 530 nm and the roughness is as even as 2 nm; and, accordingly, the performance of the thin film transistor or the solar cell can be largely improved by using the polycrystalline silicon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">A method of fabricating the polycrystalline silicon film in accordance with the present invention will be described below. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(A)</figref> shows a semiconductor thin film fabricating apparatus used in the process according to the present invention, which apparatus comprises a substrate loading chamber L, an insulation film forming chamber R<b>1</b>, an intrinsic semiconductor film forming chamber R<b>2</b> and a laser processing chamber LA arranged so as to surround a transfer chamber T, which is composed of a substrate transfer robot and an evacuating pump, and the respective chambers are connected to the transfer chamber T. A substrate can be transferred without being exposed to the atmosphere between each of the film forming chambers and the laser processing chamber through the transfer chamber T, in which the vacuum level is maintained higher than 10-5 torr. The polycrystalline silicon film in accordance with the present invention also can be fabricated by an apparatus having a layout in which a substrate loading chamber L, an insulation film forming chamber R<b>1</b>, an intrinsic semiconductor film forming chamber R<b>2</b> and a laser processing chamber LA are arranged in line, and a transfer chamber T composed of a substrate transfer robot and an evacuating pump is arranged along the four chambers, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(B)</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0072">Initially, a base insulation film <b>2</b> having a thickness of 300 nm formed of silicon oxide is formed on a glass substrate <b>1</b> while maintaining the substrate at a temperature below 350Â° C. through plasma assisted chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) using tetra-ethyl ortho-silicate (TEOS) and oxygen as raw materials, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(A)</figref>. As an example, the glass substrate <b>1</b> can be a no-alkali glass substrate having a softening point lower than 700Â° C. Next, an amorphous silicon film <b>3</b> having a thickness of 35 nm and a combined hydrogen concentration in the film of 7% is formed while maintaining the substrate at a temperature below 400Â° C. using mono-silane and hydrogen as raw materials in the intrinsic semiconductor film forming chamber R<b>2</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(B)</figref>. Next, the glass substrate <b>1</b> is transferred from the intrinsic semiconductor film forming chamber R<b>2</b> to the laser processing chamber LA through the transfer chamber T while maintaining a vacuum. In the laser processing chamber LA, the substrate temperature is kept at 350Â° C. using a heater. Then, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(C)</figref>, a polycrystalline silicon <b>5</b> is formed by irradiating a Xe-Cl excimer laser beam <b>4</b> having a line beam shape by selecting an irradiation pitch so that the preceding laser beam and the following laser beam are overlapped by 90% with respect to each other (an irradiation pitch equivalent to performing 10 times of laser irradiation on any position) and increasing the energy density of the laser beam from 200, 300 to 380 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>stepwise. Because the laser is irradiated in multi-steps, the amorphous silicon film <b>3</b> is dehydrogenated while the weak energy laser is being irradiated. Therefore, the amorphous silicon film <b>3</b> can be crystallized without damaging the film even if the combined hydrogen concentration in the film is above 3%. If the combined hydrogen concentration in the film is below 10%, a sufficient number of steps of laser irradiation is three or less. Therefore, the fabrication time can be shortened, and, accordingly, the throughput can be improved. After completion of the laser irradiation, the glass substrate <b>1</b> is transferred from the laser processing chamber LA to the intrinsic semiconductor film forming chamber R<b>2</b> through the transfer chamber T while maintaining a vacuum, then, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(D)</figref>, an amorphous silicon film <b>3</b> having a thickness of 25 nm and a combined hydrogen concentration in the film of 7% is formed while maintaining the substrate at a temperature below 400Â° C. using moni-silane and hydrogen as raw materials in the intrinsic semiconductor film forming chamber R<b>2</b>. Next, the glass substrate <b>1</b> is transferred from the intrinsic semiconductor film forming chamber R<b>2</b> to the laser processing chamber LA through the transfer chamber T while maintaining a vacuum. Then, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(E)</figref>, a large grain size polycrystalline silicon <b>6</b> is formed by irradiating a Xe-Cl excimer laser beam <b>4</b> having a line beam shape by selecting an irradiation pitch so that the preceding laser beam and the following laser beam are overlapped by 90% with respect to each other and by increasing the energy density of the laser beam from 200, 300 to 520 mJ/cm<sup>2 </sup>stepwise. Thus, fabrication of the polycrystalline silicon is completed. As described above, according to the present invention, it is possible to form a high-quality polycrystalline silicon film having a film thickness of 60 nm, an average size of the crystal grains of 530 nm and an average surface roughness of 2 nm on an economical glass substrate. Accordingly, the fabrication cost of the high-quality polycrystalline silicon can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0073">The laser crystallization mechanism of the present invention will be described below. The inventors have found that a polycrystalline silicon film having an average surface roughness below 5 nm and small projections and an average crystal grain size above 300 nm could be fabricated by irradiating laser light in three steps from low energy to high energy on an amorphous silicon film having a film thickness below 40 nm. This was determined from the fact that the crystal growth during laser irradiation in the third step was mainly crystal growth of secondary grain growth by melt-combining of crystal grains having a grain size of 100 to 200 nm which had been produced from isotropic growth by melting and solidifying by the laser irradiation up to the second step, and not that the crystal growth during laser irradiation in the third step was crystal growth of melted silicon in the lateral direction which produced the projections. The amorphous silicon <b>3</b> of the first layer crystallized first is a film as thin as 35 nm, and the polycrystalline silicon <b>5</b> of the first layer, having an average roughness in the surface of 5 nm and an average crystal grain size of 400 nm, is formed by the laser crystallization method of three step irradiation in accordance with the present invention. When the laser crystallization for the second layer is performed, the film of the first layer is already crystallized to polycrystalline silicon, and, consequently, the melting point becomes higher than that of amorphous silicon. Therefore, the melted zone of the polycrystalline silicon <b>5</b> of the first layer during the laser crystallization for a second layer is only in the vicinity of the boundary zone with the silicon in the second layer. The film thickness of the amorphous silicon in the second layer is 25 nm, and, accordingly, the silicon melted during the laser crystallization for the second layer is the whole silicon in the second layer and only the very thin zone in the upper layer of the silicon of the first layer. Therefore, the thickness of the silicon melted during the second laser crystallization is thinner than the thickness of the silicon melted during the first laser crystallization. It is believed that the grain size of the semiconductor thin film is likely to grow larger by the secondary grain growth caused by melt-combining with an adjacent crystal grain by plural times of laser irradiation, as the thickness of the semiconductor thin film becomes thinner. The theoretical explanation is reported in the Applied Physics Letter, Vol. 44, No. 6, 19894, p602. The non-melted polycrystalline silicon <b>5</b> in the lower layer is heated up to 1000Â° C. or more by heat conduction by contact with the melted silicon and absorption of the laser light. Since this portion serves as a heat reservoir when the melted silicon in the upper layer is crystallized, the cooling speed is slowed down, and, accordingly, the crystallization speed is decreased to form the large grain sized polycrystalline silicon <b>6</b> having an average crystal grain size of 530 nm. This grain size is larger than the average crystal grain size of 210 nm, which is obtained from laser-crystallizing a single amorphous silicon layer having a thickness of 60 nm, which is equal to the sum of the thickness of the silicon films of the first layer and the second layer, similar to the conventional method. In order to improve the effect of the heat reservoir, it is preferable that the thickness of the silicon of the first layer is set to a value larger than the thickness of the silicon in the second layer. Further, since the secondary grain growth obtained by melt-combining with the adjacent crystal grain occurs when the semiconductor layer is in a high temperature state above 600Â° C. even if the semiconductor layer is not melted, growth of the crystal grains in the heated polycrystalline silicon of the first layer by the secondary grain growth and the melt-combination between the growing crystal grains of the first layer and the crystal grains under growing by solid crystallization occur at the same time. As a result, in the produced large grain sized polycrystalline silicon <b>6</b>, at least more than 70% of the crystal grains continuously extend from the interface between the semiconductor layer and a base insulation layer <b>2</b> to the semiconductor surface without discontinuity at some midpoint. Therefore, since the ratio of the region where the crystal grains overlap in the film-thickness direction is decreased, the number of defects caused by the crystal grain boundaries in the polycrystalline silicon become small, and, accordingly, the characteristic of the semiconductor can be improved. Further, since the mechanism of crystal grain growth obtained in the first and the second layers is the secondary grain growth by melt-combining of the crystal grains, as described above, which is not growth in the lateral direction which tends to produce a projection on the surface, the height of the projection produced during laser crystallization becomes lower than the height of the projection which is obtained from laser-crystallizing a single amorphous silicon layer having a thickness equal to the sum of the thickness of the silicon films of the first layer and the second layer, similar to the conventional method, and, consequently, it is possible to suppress the occurrence of the unevenness on the polycrystalline silicon surface. Furthermore, even if the projections are formed in the polycrystalline silicon of the first layer, the projections are melted first in the polycrystalline silicon of the first layer when the amorphous silicon of the second layer is laser crystallized, because the crystal quality of the projections is bad and the melting point is as low as that of amorphous silicon. Therefore, the projections on the surface are suppressed over the whole polycrystalline silicon film so as to make the surface even. As a result, the average roughness of the surface of the polycrystalline silicon fabricated according to the present invention becomes 2 nm, and the greater evenness increases the applicability of the polycrystalline silicon to various kinds of semiconductor devices, such as a thin film transistor and so on, as will be described in connection with the following embodiments. The film thickness of the polycrystalline silicon <b>6</b> in the above-described embodiment is 60 nm. However, if the film thickness of the polycrystalline silicon <b>6</b> is below 40 nm, a small amount of metallic ions and oxygen, nitrogen, and a carbon impurity contained in the base glass substrate <b>1</b> and the base insulator film <b>2</b> are diffused into the polycrystalline silicon <b>6</b> by heat during laser irradiation to decrease the quality of the film, not only in the lower portion, but also in the upper portion of the polycrystalline silicon. From this viewpoint, a thickness of 60 nm is preferable. It is advantageous for controlling the film thickness and preferable from the viewpoint of application to a semiconductor device, such as a thin film transistor, that the film thickness of the polycrystalline silicon <b>6</b> is above 40 nm. On the other hand, in regard to the upper limit of the film thickness, a film thickness below 100 nm is preferable from the viewpoint of the ability to cover silicon steps of metal or insulation to be deposited on the island-shaped polycrystalline silicon <b>6</b> when a semiconductor device, such as a thin film transistor or a liquid crystal display apparatus, is fabricated. This upper limit is not applied in a case where the polycrystalline silicon is applied to a semiconductor apparatus requiring a thick semiconductor film such as a solar cell or the like. In accordance with the present invention, by repeating the steps of forming the amorphous silicon film and crystallizing the amorphous silicon film by irradiating laser light at least two times, a polycrystalline silicon having a film thickness above 40 nm and below 100 nm, an even surface and a large crystal grain size can be easily fabricated. The film thickness of the amorphous silicon of the first layer and the film thickness of the amorphous silicon of the second layer are set to 35 nm and 25 nm in the above embodiment, respectively, but are not fixed to these values. If the film thickness of the first layer is thicker than the thickness of the second layer and the total thickness of the first and the second layers is above 40 nm, the values of film thickness may be varied depending on the film quality of each semiconductor and the kind of semiconductor apparatus to which the semiconductor is applied. In accordance with the present invention, since the substrate is transferred from the film forming chamber to the laser processing chamber while maintaining a vacuum, no concentration peak of silicon oxide will exist on the surface of the polycrystalline silicon <b>5</b> of the first layer during film-forming of the amorphous silicon of the second layer, and, consequently, the characteristics of the polycrystalline silicon are not deteriorated by diffusion of oxygen atoms in the melted silicon during laser-crystallizing of the amorphous silicon of the second layer. Of course, no concentration peak of oxygen exists in the polycrystalline silicon. In addition, since no silicon oxide layer exists on the surface of the polycrystalline silicon <b>5</b> of the second layer, and, consequently, oxygen atoms do not diffuse from the surface to the inside during being melted at the time of laser crystallization, the characteristic of the polycrystalline silicon can be improved. As described above, according to the present invention, it is possible to form a polycrystalline silicon film having a film thickness above 40 nm, an even surface having an average surface roughness of 2 nm, an average size of the crystal grains above 500 nm and a good semiconductor characteristic with less oxygen concentration in the film on an economical glass substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0074">In the above embodiment, although the silicon oxide base film under the silicon film is an even film, the shape of the base film may be patterned through the photo-lithography method and the wet or dry etching method. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5(A) and 5(B)</figref>, a 10 nm step was provided on a base film <b>2</b> made of silicon oxide, and the steps of forming of an amorphous silicon film by the PECVD process and laser crystallization was repeated twice through the same process as described above. In this case, the inventors found that a crystal grain boundary was produced at the step portion, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(C)</figref>. Further, it was also found that the crystal grains in contact with the step on the base insulation film located at the lower position of the step were oriented mainly in the (1, 1, 0) plane or the (1, 0, 0) plane. Although the cause of occurrence of these phenomena is unknown, the position producing deterioration at the crystal grain boundary of the electric characteristic of the polycrystalline silicon could be controlled by changing the shape of the base insulator film. By doing so, it was possible to obtain a high-quality polycrystalline silicon having an average crystal grain size above 500 nm and an average surface roughness of 2 nm, in which at least a part of the crystal grain boundaries were positioned.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0075">Further, in accordance with the present invention, since the substrate is heated during laser crystallization, the heating time of the substrate after transferred between the laser crystallization process and the semiconductor thin film forming process can be shortened. Therefore, the throughput of the fabrication of the crystalline semiconductor thin film can be improved. Further, since the cooling speed of the semiconductor melted by laser irradiation can be made slow by heating the substrate during laser crystallization, the crystal grain size of the crystalline semiconductor thin film can be made large, and, consequently, the quality of the crystal can be improved. In the present embodiment, although the film forming temperature of the base insulation film, the film forming temperature of the amorphous silicon and the base temperature during laser crystallization are set to 350Â° C., 400Â° C. and 350Â° C., respectively, it is possible that these temperatures need not be fixed, but may be varied depending on the film quality of the insulation film or the semiconductor or the performance of the target semiconductor apparatus. However, when a glass substrate is used for the substrate and silicon is used for the semiconductor, these temperatures are preferably set to a value between 200Â° C. and 500Â° C. In the apparatus for fabricating the polycrystalline silicon used in the present embodiment, each of the film forming chambers and the laser crystallizing chamber and the substrate loading chamber are connected with the transfer chamber T, which is composed of a substrate transfer robot and an evacuating pump, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3(A) and 3(B)</figref>. However, the polycrystalline silicon in accordance with the present invention can be fabricated by an in-line type semiconductor fabricating apparatus in which each of the film forming parts, a laser crystallizing part and a transfer part are arranged in a single chamber, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. By using an in-line type semiconductor fabricating apparatus which is low in manufacturing cost, the cost of equipment can be suppressed, and, consequently, the semiconductor apparatus can be fabricated with a low cost. In the present, embodiment the substrate is transferred by maintaining the transfer system at a high vacuum below 10<sup>â5 </sup>torr. However, the substrate may be transferred under an atmosphere of an inert gas, such as nitrogen, helium, neon, argon or the like, because the present invention requires that a natural oxide film not be formed on the silicon surface after forming the amorphous silicon film or after laser crystallizing the amorphous silicon. In this regard, the transfer under an atmosphere of an inert gas can attain the same effect as the transfer in a vacuum.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0076">In the above embodiment, the XeâCl excimer laser is used for crystallizing the silicon film. However, various kinds of excimer lasers, such as a KrâF excimer laser, an ArâF excimer laser or the like, or a continuous-wave laser, such as an Ar ion laser and the like, or an energy beam, such as an electron beam or the like, may be used for crystallizing regardless of the kind of device in principle, if it can crystallize the silicon film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0077">Further, in the above embodiment, although the present invention is applied to amorphous silicon, the present invention can be applied to fine-crystalline silicon, polycrystalline silicon, impurity-doped silicon, silicon-germanium (SiGe), germanium (Ge) and so on, regardless of the kind of semiconductor, if it can be crystallized by heating using a laser. Further, in the above embodiment, the film forming apparatus is of the plasma assisted chemical vapor deposition type. However, a low-pressure chemical vapor deposition type (LPCVD), a sputtering type, an ion beam type, an atom beam type, a molecule beam type, a spin-coat type or a vapor deposition type film forming apparatus may be employed regardless of the type, if it can be connected to the transfer chamber T and can transfer the substrate between the transfer chamber and the laser processing chamber LA without exposing the substrate to the atmosphere or while maintaining a vacuum. Furthermore, in the above embodiment, the substrate used is made of glass. However, a substrate made of an organic resin, such as a substrate made of polyimide, polyamide or polyester can be used if the film forming temperatures of the base insulator film <b>2</b> and the amorphous silicon <b>3</b> are reduced to a value lower than 300Â° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0078">The second embodiment of fabrication of a copalanar type thin film transistor to which the present invention is applied will be described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0079">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(A)</figref>, a large grain size polycrystalline silicon <b>6</b>, which is selected to be an active layer of a thin film transistor, is formed on a glass substrate <b>1</b> having a base insulator film <b>2</b> using a method similar to that in the first embodiment. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(B)</figref>, after forming the polycrystalline silicon <b>6</b> into an island-shape through the photo-lithographic method and the dry etching method, a gate insulation film <b>7</b>, having a film thickness of 100 nm, is formed by the plasma assisted chemical vapor deposition method using TEOS and oxygen as raw materials. Then, after forming a niobium (Nb) film having a film thickness of 250 nm through the sputtering method, a gate electrode <b>8</b> is formed by processing the niobium film using the photo-lithographic method and the dry etching method. Next, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(C)</figref>, after implanting the impurity phosphorus (P) into a region of the active layer not overlapping with the gate electrode <b>8</b> using the ion implantation method, a source region <b>9</b> and a drain region <b>10</b> are formed by activating the impurity by heating the substrate at 500Â° C. for 2 hours using an electric furnace. Then, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(D)</figref>, after forming an inter-layer insulation film <b>11</b> having a film thickness of 500 nm through the plasma assisted chemical vapor deposition method using TEOS and oxygen as raw materials, contact holes are formed through the photo-lithographic method and the dry etching method. Finally, after forming a chromium-molybdenum alloy (CrâMo) film having a film thickness of 500 nm through the sputtering method, a gate electrode, a source electrode <b>12</b> and a drain electrode <b>13</b> are processed through the photo-lithographic method and the wet etching method. Thus, the thin film transistor is completed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0080">By using polycrystalline silicon having a large crystal grain size of 530 nm and an average surface roughness of 2 nm for the active layer, it was possible to fabricate a high-performance thin film transistor having a mobility of 300 cm<sup>2</sup>/VÂ·s which is largely improved compared to the mobility of 140 cm2/VÂ·s of a thin film transistor fabricated through the conventional method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0081"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a graph which compares the gate voltage versus drain current characteristics of a polycrystalline silicon thin film transistor in accordance with the present invention with those of a thin film transistor having an active layer made of a polycrystalline silicon which is fabricated in the conventional manner, in which an amorphous silicon film having a film thickness of 60 nm formed through the plasma assisted chemical deposition method is heated at 450Â° C. under a nitrogen atmosphere to perform dehydrogenating treatment, and then the amorphous silicon is laser crystallized. It is clear from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> that the ON current in the polycrystalline silicon thin film transistor of the present invention is increased by the effects of an increase in the crystal grain size and a decrease in the roughness (projections) of the active layer film. Further, because the electric field concentration in the projection is suppressed by the even surface of the active layer of the polycrystalline silicon <b>6</b> in accordance with the present invention, the dielectric breakdown voltage of the gate insulator film <b>7</b> is largely increased from 4 MV/cm to 7 MV/cm to improve the withstand voltage characteristic, and the reliability relative to hot carriers is also improved. Furthermore, since the thickness of the gate insulation film can be made thinner, that is, below 80 nm, compared to that in the conventional method, the thin film transistor can be driven by a lower voltage, and, accordingly, the power consumption of a semiconductor apparatus using the thin film transistor can be reduced. By using the polycrystalline silicon in accordance with the present invention in an active layer of a thin film transistor, the film thickness of the gate insulation film and the film thickness of the active layer can be set so that a ratio of the film thickness of the gate insulation film to the film thickness of the active layer becomes a value smaller than 8/6. Further, by optimizing the film quality of the gate insulation film, the thickness of the gate insulation film can be made thinner, and, accordingly, the thin film transistor can be driven by a lower consumed power.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0082">Although application of the present invention to a coplanar type thin film transistor has been described in the above embodiment, the present invention can be applied to an inverse stagger type or a normal stagger type thin film transistor regardless of the type of the thin film transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0083">A third embodiment of an active matrix type liquid crystal display apparatus to which the thin film transistors in accordance with the present invention are applied will be described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0084"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a circuit diagram showing the construction of the embodiment of the active matrix type liquid crystal display apparatus in accordance with the present invention. Referring to the figure, a thin film transistor (TFT) is provided in each of a plurality of liquid cells (LC) arranged in the form of a matrix, and each of the liquid cells is driven by switching operation of the TFT. Therein, a gate voltage is sequentially applied to gate lines G<b>1</b> to GM of electrodes commonly led out from individual gates of the TFTs aligned in the lateral direction on a glass substrate <b>1</b> to switch on the gates from gate line to gate line. On the other hand, a data voltage for each switched-on gate line is sequentially applied to drain lines D<b>1</b> to DN of electrodes commonly led out from individual drains of the TFTs aligned in the perpendicular direction to be supplied to each of the liquid cells.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0085"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a plan view showing the plane structure of one pixel composed of one liquid cell and one TFT. Further, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows the cross-sectional structure along the fine X-Xâ² of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The pixel is composed of a TFT formed near a cross point of the drain wire D and the gate wire G and the liquid cell LC connected to the TFT through a source electrode <b>12</b>. The sectional structure of the TFT is nearly equal to that of the second embodiment. The structure can be obtained through the fabricating method described in the second embodiment, but points different from the above-described process are as follows. Ion implantation at the time of forming the source-drain region is separately performed twice, and a locally doped drain (LDD) region having a lower impurity concentration is provided in the source-drain region in contact with the active layer in order to reduce the OFF current. Further, the gate wire G is formed by processing film-forming and etching together with the gate electrode <b>8</b>. An inter-layer insulator film <b>14</b> made of SiN is formed after forming the source and the drain electrodes <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>. After processing this workpiece to bore a contact hole to the source electrode <b>12</b>, an indium-tin oxide film (ITO) is formed and patterned to form a pixel electrode <b>15</b>. Parts other than the TFT, such as the liquid crystal, will be described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0086">TN type liquid crystal <b>16</b> is filled between the glass substrate <b>1</b> having the TFT formed thereon and a glass substrate <b>17</b> (an opposite substrate) opposite to the glass substrate <b>1</b>. A black matrix <b>18</b> for cutting off unnecessary light and an opposite electrode <b>19</b> made of ITO are formed on the opposite substrate. The liquid crystal is driven by a voltage between the opposite electrode <b>19</b> of the opposite substrate <b>17</b> and the pixel electrode <b>15</b> of the TFT substrate, and an image is displayed on the matrix of the pixels by changing the display brightness pixel-by-pixel. A polarizing plate <b>20</b> for polarizing light is attached onto each of the glass substrates <b>1</b>, <b>17</b>. By orientating the polarization axes of these two polarizing plates in orthogonal or parallel directions relative to each other, a normally black display mode or a normally white display mode is obtained, respectively. Polarizing films <b>21</b> for polarizing the liquid crystal are applied onto the surfaces in contact with the liquid crystal, that is, onto the surface of the inter-layer insulation film <b>14</b> and the pixel electrode in the glass substrate <b>1</b> side and onto the surface of the opposite electrode <b>19</b> in the opposite substrate <b>17</b> side. After applying the polarizing film, the surface of the polarizing film is processed by the lapping method to add anisotropy for orientating the liquid crystal molecules to the polarizing film. A back light serving as a light source is placed on the substrate <b>1</b> side to give brightness to the display.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0087">By using the TFTs fabricated as described above in accordance with the present invention for the driving elements of the display part pixels of the active matrix type liquid crystal display apparatus, the TFT can be made small because the grain size of the active layer polycrystalline silicon is large and the mobility is large. Therefore, the opening ratio of the pixel is increased, and, accordingly, the power of the back light can be reduced by that amount, whereby a reduction in the power consumption of the liquid crystal display apparatus can be attained. Further, since the surface of the TFT active layer is made even and the projections are eliminated, the thickness of the gate insulation film can be made thinner than 80 nm. Therefore, the TFT can be driven by a low voltage, and, accordingly, low power consumption in the liquid crystal display apparatus can be attained. Furthermore, since the surface is made even and, accordingly, the characteristic inside the polycrystalline silicon is made uniform, display defects caused by non-uniformity of the characteristic of the polycrystalline silicon TFT can be eliminated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0088">As shown by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12(A)</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12(B)</figref>, which is a cross-sectional view taken on the plane of the dashed line X-Xâ² in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12(A)</figref>, in a case where a signal storage capacitor of the pixel is formed by sandwiching a silicon oxide film in the same layer of the gate insulation film with an n-type polycrystalline silicon formed by doping phosphorus into the polycrystalline silicon in the same layer of the polycrystalline silicon <b>6</b> of the active layer and the common wire formed of a metallic thin film in the same layer of the gate wire, if the polycrystalline silicon in accordance with the present invention is used, the film thickness of the silicon oxide film can be made thin because the unevenness on the surface is very small and, consequently, there is no possibility of occurrence of dielectric breakdown caused by electric field concentration at a projection. Because of the distance between the electrodes, the capacitance of the signal storage capacitor is increased, and, consequently, the area of the electrode can be reduced and the opening ratio of the pixel can be increased. Therefore, low power consumption of the liquid crystal display apparatus can be attained by reducing the brightness of the back light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0089">Further, by constructing the peripheral circuit for driving the display part using the TFTs in accordance with the present invention, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13(A)</figref>, a small-frame size and low-cost liquid crystal display apparatus incorporating a peripheral circuit can be manufactured by eliminating the driver LSI. Further, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13(B)</figref>, by incorporating not only the display part driving circuit, but also a memory, a micro processing unit (MPU) and another information processing unit formed through micro-processing in the periphery of the display part, an advanced liquid crystal display apparatus can be obtained by adding a communication function and a calculating function to the liquid crystal display apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0090">Furthermore, after crystallizing an amorphous silicon in the first layer as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14(A)</figref>, an amorphous silicon film <b>3</b> in the second layer is formed without exposing the atmosphere, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14(B)</figref>, and then a part of the region of the amorphous silicon <b>3</b> in the second layer may be intentionally left in the amorphous state without irradiating laser light on that region, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14(C)</figref>. Then, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15(A)</figref>, in the polycrystalline silicon/amorphous silicon region where the amorphous silicon in the second layer has been not irradiated, a display, part is provided to form a coplanar type TFT. In the polycrystalline silicon/polycrystalline silicon region where the amorphous silicon in the second layer has been laser crystallized, a peripheral circuit part is provided to form a copalanar type TFT of CMOS structure for driving the circuit. By doing so, because the active layer of the display part TFT becomes high resistance amorphous silicon, the OFF current is reduced, and, accordingly, there is no need to form an offset structure or a lightly doped drain (LDD) structure, which is necessary when the display part TFT is constructed using the polycrystalline silicon TFT. Therefore, the number of processes for fabricating the peripheral circuit incorporating the liquid crystal display apparatus is reduced by that amount, and, consequently, the throughput of the fabrication is improved and the cost is reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0091">The same effect can be obtained in a case where the TFT structure is of an inverse stagger type because a high resistance amorphous silicon exists between the polycrystalline silicon of the active layer and the source-drain region, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15(B)</figref>. In contrast to the second embodiment, in fabricating the polycrystalline silicon TFT described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14(A)</figref> to (C) and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15(A) and 15(B)</figref>, when the source-drain region is formed, the impurity activation is performed using laser activation in order to prevent the amorphous region from being deteriorated and not using activation of thermal annealing using an electric furnace.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0092">The present invention can be also applied to the formation of a semiconductor layer in a solar cell which is composed of a p-type, n-type and intrinsic polycrystalline silicon layers, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. In accordance with the present invention, since the large grain sized and even polycrystalline semiconductor can be fabricated even if the thickness is increased, a solar cell having a high solar light converting efficiency above 15% can be fabricated. The solar cell can be fabricated with the fabricating apparatus shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(A)</figref>, <b>3</b>(B) or <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. However, in a case where the substrate is a long continuous substrate made of stainless steel or aluminum, the solar cell can be fabricated using an inline type fabricating apparatus as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. By using the inline type fabricating apparatus, the solar cell can be fabricated with a low cost. As described above, the present invention can be applied to all the semiconductor apparatuses using polycrystalline semiconductors in addition to thin film transistors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0093">According to the present invention, it is possible to fabricate a high-quality crystalline semiconductor having a film thickness above 40 nm, an average size of the crystal grains larger than 500 nm and an average roughness of the surface smaller than 5 nm on an economical glass substrate. Further, it is possible to improve the performance of the semiconductor apparatus using a semiconductor, such as a thin film transistor, a solar cell and an active matrix type liquid crystal display apparatus.</div>
