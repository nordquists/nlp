<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">The present application is based on and claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/544,626 filed Feb. 12, 2004, entitled III-NITRIDE BIDIRECTIONAL SWITCH, to which a claim of priority is hereby made and the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by this reference.</div>
<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates to power semiconductor devices and more particularly to integrated power semiconductor devices.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a known, discrete high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) may include drain pad <b>10</b>, source pad <b>12</b>, and gate pad <b>14</b>. Drain pad <b>10</b> is electrically connected to a plurality of drain runners <b>16</b>, and source pad <b>12</b> is electrically connected to a plurality of source runners <b>18</b>. Usually, drain pad <b>10</b> and source pad <b>12</b>, and runners <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> are arranged parallel to one another. In addition, in one conventional arrangement, drain runners <b>16</b> and source runners <b>18</b> are alternated in order to distribute current evenly through drain pad <b>10</b> and source pad <b>12</b>. In a device according to FIG <b>1</b>A, the area between each two opposing runners <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> is an active area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Referring next to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a portion A of an active area of the device of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is enlarged to illustrate a plurality of drain fingers <b>20</b> that are electrically connected and extend away from each drain pad <b>10</b>, and a plurality of source fingers <b>22</b> that are electrically connected to and extend away from each source pad <b>12</b>. It should be noted that drain fingers <b>20</b> and source fingers <b>22</b> alternate along drain pad <b>16</b> and source pad <b>18</b>, whereby an interdigitated configuration is attained. Gate electrode <b>24</b> meanders through the space between drain pad <b>16</b>, drain fingers <b>20</b>, source pad <b>18</b>, and source fingers <b>22</b>, and, although not shown, is connected to a gate runner which electrically connects gate electrode <b>24</b> to gate pad <b>14</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Referring next to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, a typical HEMT includes substrate <b>25</b>, which may be formed from GaN, Si, SiC, or Sapphire, first semiconductor body <b>26</b> formed from one III-nitride semiconductor such as GaN and disposed over substrate <b>25</b>, and a second semiconductor body <b>28</b> formed of another III-nitride semiconductor of a different band gap such as AlGaN disposed over first semiconductor body <b>26</b>. First semiconductor body <b>26</b> and second semiconductor body <b>28</b> form heterojunction <b>30</b>, which due to piezoelectric polarization forms a two dimensional electronic gas (2DEG) at or near heterojunction <b>30</b>. The 2DEG so formed is highly conductive and serves as a channel for conducting current between a source finger <b>20</b> and a drain finger <b>22</b>. It should be noted that in a typical device source fingers <b>22</b> and drain fingers <b>20</b> are connected to second semiconductor body <b>28</b> by a highly conductive ohmic contact layer <b>32</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">In the device shown by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, gate electrode <b>24</b> is insulated form second semiconductor body <b>28</b> by gate insulation layer <b>34</b>. In another variation, gate electrode <b>24</b> can make a schottky contact with second semiconductor body <b>28</b>, as seen, for example, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">The devices illustrated by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref> are depletion mode devices, meaning that the device is nominally on and the activation of gate electrode <b>24</b> in each device by application of an appropriate voltage interrupts the 2DEG to turn the device off. Enhancement mode HEMTs are shown in U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/544,626, filed Feb. 12, 2004, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/056,062, entitled III-Nitride Bidirectional Switch, filed in the name of Daniel M. Kinzer and Robert Beach concurrently with the present application, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference. Bidirectional devices can include one gate electrode, or two gate electrodes. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref> illustrates a bidirectional discrete device which includes two gate electrodes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">The prior art devices described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1E</figref> are discrete devices, meaning that each of these devices occupies a single, discrete semiconductor die. Due to the high breakdown voltage and current carrying capabilities III-nitride power devices occupy only a small area on a die. Thus, III-nitride-based semiconductor power devices are very small compared to silicon-based devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">As with other devices, III-nitride semiconductor power devices need to be packaged so that they may be used in an electronic application, such as a power supply application, or motor control application. In a semiconductor package containing a III-nitride-based power semiconductor device, the packaging elements are thought to contribute the most to the overall size of the package due to the small size of the III-nitride power devices. Because many power applications require more than one power semiconductor device, it is expected that packaging, not the die, will contribute the most to the amount of space that is occupied by III-nitride-based power semiconductor packages.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">According to the present invention an integrated device includes two or more III-nitride power semiconductor devices which are formed in a single common semiconductor die. As a result, in applications requiring more than one power device, an integrated device according to the present invention can be packaged in a common package, which results in space saving among other advantages.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an integrated device according to the first embodiment of the present invention includes two HEMTs formed on one die and interconnected to form a half-bridge. The term integrated as used herein means that the devices are formed in a common die. Specifically, an integrated device according to the first embodiment includes a high side HEMT <b>36</b>, which includes drain pad <b>10</b>, and gate pad <b>14</b>, and a low side HEMT <b>38</b>, which includes source pad <b>12</b> and gate pad <b>14</b>. According to the present invention high side HEMT <b>36</b> and low side HEMT <b>38</b> are formed in a single die. Thus, a device according to the first embodiment can be packaged together, thereby saving space in a power application.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">It should be noted that to form a half-bridge the drain pad of low side HEMT <b>38</b> and the source pad of high side HEMT <b>36</b> are combined into a single pad, switched node pad <b>40</b>, which serves as the output pad for the half-bridge.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">Referring next to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an integrated device according to the second embodiment may include three half-bridges formed in a single die. As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, drain pads <b>10</b> of high side HEMTs <b>36</b> are interconnected to form a single pad, bus pad <b>42</b>, and source pads <b>12</b> of low side HEMTs <b>38</b> are interconnected to form a single pad, ground pad <b>44</b>, for the three phase bridge according to the second embodiment of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">Referring next to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an integrated device according to the third embodiment includes four HEMTs formed in a single die and integrated into an H bridge configuration. In this embodiment drain pads <b>10</b> of high side HEMTs <b>36</b> are connected to one another to form bus pad <b>42</b>, source pads <b>12</b> of low side HEMTs are connected together to form ground pad <b>44</b>. The source pad of one high side HEMT <b>36</b> is common with the drain pad of one low side HEMT <b>38</b> to form a first output pad <b>40</b>A, and the source pad of the other high side HEMT <b>36</b> is common with the drain pad of the other low side HEMT <b>38</b> to form second output pad <b>40</b>B.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">Referring next to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an integrated device according to the fourth embodiment of the present invention may include two bidirectional HEMTs integrated in a half-bridge configuration. That is, one bidirectional HEMT is a high side device <b>46</b> and the other is low side device <b>48</b>. It should be noted that each bidirectional HEMT in the fourth embodiment includes two gate pads <b>14</b>A, <b>14</b>B. Also, it should be noted that due to bidirectionality, HEMTs <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> in the fourth embodiment only include power pads <b>50</b>, rather than source pads and drain pads. As seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, one power pad <b>52</b> is common to both bidirectional HEMTs, and serves as the switched output pad <b>40</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">A device according to the fourth embodiment includes first HEMT <b>54</b> and second HEMT <b>56</b> integrated to have a common drain pad <b>58</b>. Thus, according to the fourth embodiment, a device can be formed which is the integration of two integrated devices. A device according to the fourth embodiment can be used to form a bridgeless boost converter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">III-nitride semiconductor systems can also be used for forming diodes, such as schottky diodes. Referring for example to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</figref>, <b>6</b>B in which like numerals identify like numbers, a schottky diode <b>60</b> in III-nitride system does not include a gate, but rather includes anode electrode <b>62</b>, which makes a schottky contact with second semiconductor body <b>28</b>, and cathode electrode <b>64</b> which makes an ohmic contact with second semiconductor body <b>28</b>. It should be noted that similar to a HEMT, anode electrodes <b>62</b>, and cathode electrodes <b>64</b> are connected to respective runners <b>66</b> which are in turn electrically connected to anode pad <b>68</b> and cathode pad <b>70</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an integrated device according to the fifth embodiment is a schottky bridge that includes four III-nitride schottky diodes that are arranged in a full-bridge configuration. Specifically, anode pads of the first two schottky devices are integrated to form a common anode pad <b>61</b>, cathode pads of the second two schottky devices are integrated to form a common cathode pad <b>63</b>, and the cathode pad of each of the first two schottky devices is integrated with the anode pad of one of the other two second schottky devices to form a third common pad <b>65</b>, and a fourth common pad <b>67</b>, whereby a schottky bridge is realized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">It should be noted that in an integrated device according to the present invention, because two or more devices are formed in one die, there may be a need for electrically isolating the devices. To achieve isolation, all or a portion of second semiconductor body <b>28</b> may be removed to interrupt the 2DEG whenever desired in order to achieve electrical isolation. Thus, for example, when in an integrated device according to the present invention, two HEMTs <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> are found in a common die, a recess <b>104</b> can be formed in second semiconductor body <b>28</b> to a depth that will cause an interruption in the 2DEG and thus electrically isolates the two devices as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>. Recess <b>104</b> can be extended through second semiconductor body <b>28</b> to first semiconductor body <b>26</b> as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">Alternatively, as seen, for example, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, second semiconductor layer <b>28</b> may include an implanted region <b>106</b> that includes crystal damage to first and second semiconductor bodies <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> which causes an interruption in the 2DEG at selected locations between devices <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> to attain electrical isolation between the same. Once an isolated portion of the 2DEG is interrupted, the high resistivity of the first semiconductor body <b>26</b> can be relied on for isolation. Thus, two or more devices may be formed on a single die.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">It should be noted that an HEMT or a schottky device as described herein as prior art, is preferred as a building block for an integrated device according to the present invention. However, it should be understood that the present invention is not limited to the configurations disclosed herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">Furthermore, although a GaN/AlGaN heterojunction is preferred, other III-nitride combinations are within the scope of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">Although the present invention has been described in relation to particular embodiments thereof, many other variations and modifications and other uses will become apparent to those skilled in the art. It is preferred, therefore, that the present invention be limited not by the specific disclosure herein, but only by the appended claims.</div>
