<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div html="" itemprop="content"><abstract lang="EN" load-source="patent-office" mxw-id="PA62609178">
<div class="abstract" num="p-0001">An improved wafer holder design is described which has manufacturing and performance advantages over present state-of-the-art holders used in various wafer processing applications. The new wafer holder design incorporates a series of short radial grooves. The grooves extend from the base of a circular channel, which runs along the outside diameter of the substrate wafer recess, to a fixed radial location which varies based on wafer size and thickness. The grooves provide a slight overlap with the wafer to facilitate the free exchange of gases beneath the wafer necessary for wafer loading and unloading operations. The short length of the radial grooves make the wafer holder easier to manufacture and offer more robust performance compared to the present state-of-the-art holders.</div>

<heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This application is entitled to the benefit of, and claims priority to, provisional U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 60/492,063 filed Aug. 1, 2003 and entitled “SUSCEPTOR FOR SUPPORTING WAFERS DURING SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURE,” the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">1. Field of the Present Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The present invention relates generally to the manufacture of substrate wafers of the type used in producing semiconductor devices, and, in particular, to susceptors and other substrate wafer holders for use in a substrate supporting mechanism in a reaction chamber during semiconductor manufacturing processes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">2. Background</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Typical wafer holders are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,821,674 and 5,427,620. These wafer holders are typically used to support a single substrate wafer during various wafer processes during the manufacture of integrated circuits. Such process applications may include silicon application processes such as chemical vapor deposition (“CVD”) and physical vapor deposition (“PVD”), thermal process applications used for treatment of semiconductor wafer substrates such as rapid thermal processing (“RTP”) and high temperature etch processing, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">To save process time, substrate wafers must be loaded at an elevated temperature, and when the wafers are placed on a flat, smooth, unbroken surface, the heat-related convection currents affect the ability of the substrate wafer to settle uniformly. Thus, as shown in the aforementioned patents, a series of intersecting channels is typically machined or otherwise applied to the wafer contact surface of the holder, the intent of which is to provide a free flow of gases between the substrate and holder to avoid undesired movement of the substrate during loading and unloading operations. The presence of the intersecting channels alleviates the substrate settling issue by allowing the hot gases to escape from underneath the wafer. The intersecting channels also facilitate loading the wafers using the Bernoulli principle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">The above cited patents depict a wafer holder with only a limited number of intersecting channels. However, in practice, the number of channels required is very large because of the need to maintain a uniform temperature profile over the surface of the substrate wafer which the holder supports. In addition, it is difficult to maintain the uniformity of the channeled surface, which is critical to avoiding issues such as image transfer to the process wafer. Both temperature uniformity and image transfer issues must be avoided to ensure proper electrical and physical properties of the process wafer along with any deposited coatings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">U.S. Pat. No. 5,403,401 cites a number of manufacturing issues involving wafer holders made with a substrate contact face possessing a series of underlying, intersecting channels, a typical example of which is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref>. Specifically, wafer holders of this design are difficult to maintain flat during manufacture if the channels exist only on one face of the holder. After machining, these wafer holders, which are typically machined from graphite, receive a coating, such as silicon carbide (SiC), deposited by CVD at high temperatures. As the holder cools to room temperature, differential shrinkage between the holder substrate and the coating generally leads to a state of stress, wherein the coating is under compression and the substrate under tension (although this stress state may be reversed, depending upon the properties of the substrate and the coating). The amount of stress that develops is dependent in part upon the surface area. As a result, large surface area differences between the two faces of the same holder, such as those that may exist when only one face is machined, can lead to large differences in stress, which in turn cause the part to distort or warp.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">To alleviate this problem, the above-cited patent suggests that similar machining detail should be added to both faces of the wafer holder in order to avoid the differences in stress and thus ensure that the part remains flat after coating. Unfortunately, adding machining detail to both sides of the wafer holder can significantly increase its manufacturing cost. Another solution cited in the above patent is to tailor the thickness of the coating so that a controlled coating differential is maintained between the two opposite faces. In principle, this is an appropriate fix; however, in practice it can be difficult to maintain a consistent coating thickness differential between faces. There is also the problem that the amount of thickness differential required is a function of the differential in coefficient of thermal expansion (“CTE”) between the holder substrate and the surface coating. Unfortunately, certain holder substrate materials, such as graphite, have CTE's which span a range, which complicates this process. For example, the range for graphite is affected by the type of coke used in its manufacture, binder levels, particle sizing, and processing temperatures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">There is also a need to minimize the total contact area between the wafer holder and substrate wafer in order to maintain a uniform temperature profile across the surface of the wafer as well as to minimize any markings to the backside of the substrate wafer. In order to minimize total contact area, the number of channels is intentionally high, which means that the grids formed at the channel intersections are kept small. It is the tops of these individual grid areas, formed by the channels, that provide support for the wafer substrate. The problem with small grids is that they are relatively weak areas of the holder surface, and thus are prone to damage. This in turn can affect the lifetime of the wafer holder if one or more grids become damaged.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">One additional drawback of wafer holders having a high number of intersecting channels on one or more faces is that such wafer holders are more prone to developing pinholes in the surface coating. This will also cause the wafer holder to be rejected, since once the coating is breached, the substrate beneath the coating is exposed to the process environment. The higher occurrence of pinholes through the surface coating on parts machined with a high number of channels is due to coating thickness variations along with cleaning issues, which are more problematic at the base of the machining detail. (Pinhole formation occurs over a period of time during use of the holder. This is generally a surface erosion problem, which can be affected by cleanliness.)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">One final drawback to wafer holders machined with a high number of intersecting channels is that it is often desired to machine a concave-shaped profile into the face of the holder that is in contact with the substrate wafer, particularly for large diameter wafers and/or lower temperature processes which require a higher level of temperature uniformity. The presence of a high amount of surface detail greatly increases the complexity of machining such a profile, which further adds to the cost of the part.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">The wafer holder described in the present invention has a number of advantages over present state-of-the-art wafer holders. For example, it requires a smaller amount of machining and requires less complex machining, making it easier to incorporate concave surface profiles, especially for large substrate wafer diameters. This, in turn, provides improved part-to-part consistency. It is also more damage tolerant, making it easier to maintain dimensional control during manufacture, and provides improved wafer holder performance.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">Referring now to the drawings, in which like numerals represent like components throughout the several views, the preferred embodiments of the present invention are next described. The following description of the preferred embodiment(s) is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">The preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to an otherwise-conventional chemical vapor deposition (“CVD”) system <b>10</b>, because CVD is an example of a typical process for which the wafer holder of the present invention may find application. However, it should be understood that the wafer holder of the present invention may be used in a wide variety of wafer processes, including physical vapor deposition (“PVD”), rapid thermal processing (“RTP”), high temperature etch processing, and other thermal processing, and generally including any other process in which a semiconductor wafer must be lifted from a generally flat surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram of a conventional chemical vapor deposition (“CVD”) system <b>10</b>. The CVD system <b>10</b> includes a reaction chamber <b>12</b> and a support mechanism <b>14</b>. The reaction chamber <b>12</b> may be of any conventional design, including the type sometimes referred to as a horizontal flow reaction chamber such as that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,427,620, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">The support mechanism <b>14</b> is preferably rotatable and may be likewise generally similar to that disclosed in the '620 patent. Of particular relevance, the support mechanism <b>14</b> includes a wafer holder <b>16</b> disposed within the reaction chamber <b>12</b>. The wafer holder <b>16</b> may be of a type often referred to as a susceptor, which typically is heated inductively, or of other types known to those skilled in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a perspective view of the wafer holder <b>16</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, shown in isolation, in accordance with the preferred embodiments of the present invention. As illustrated therein, the wafer holder <b>16</b> primarily includes a solid body <b>18</b> in the general shape of a flattened cylinder. The body <b>18</b> may be formed from any conventional wafer holder body material, most commonly including pure graphite but alternatively composed of silicon, silicon nitride, silicon carbide, quartz, aluminum oxide or another ceramic material or metal or metal alloy. The selection of material conventionally depends on the end-user's process requirements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a top view of the wafer holder <b>16</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is a partial side cross-sectional view of the wafer holder <b>16</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, taken along line <b>4</b>B-<b>4</b>B. Of particular interest, and as perhaps best understood with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the holder body <b>18</b> includes a top surface <b>20</b> and a bottom surface <b>22</b>. Centered on the top surface <b>20</b> is a wafer recess <b>24</b> formed by a slight depression in the holder body <b>18</b>, explained below, and defined by an outer circumferential rim <b>26</b>. At the perimeter of the recess <b>24</b>, immediately inside the outer rim <b>26</b>, is arranged a continuous circular groove <b>28</b>. The wafer recess <b>24</b> is adapted to support a wafer <b>30</b> therein, and the size of the wafer recess <b>24</b>, and thus the location of the circular groove <b>28</b>, is selected in conjunction with the selection of the size of the wafer <b>30</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> is a partial side cross-sectional view of the wafer holder <b>16</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, shown with a wafer <b>30</b> positioned thereon. As shown, the wafer <b>30</b> fits comfortably within the wafer recess <b>24</b>, with the outer edge of the wafer <b>30</b> preferably positioned directly above the circular groove <b>28</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">Though not strictly necessary, the circular groove <b>28</b> helps ensure uniform gas flow under the wafer <b>30</b> during processing. By increasing the size of the groove <b>28</b>, the gas flow may be more easily controlled; however, temperature uniformity issues dictate against enlarging the groove too much. The size of the groove <b>28</b> is thus generally controlled by conventional principles, and the selection of an appropriately-sized groove may be dependent on the manufacturing process in which the wafer holder <b>16</b> is to be used. However, it is known that grooves <b>28</b> having a semicircular profile that is 0.035 in. wide and 0.035 in. deep have been used successfully as described herein below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">The top surface <b>20</b> further includes a ring of narrow, non-intersecting slots <b>32</b> which extend inward from the groove <b>28</b> a fixed distance toward the center of the wafer recess <b>24</b>. The slots <b>32</b> are preferably radial in orientation, such that each slot <b>32</b> extends directly toward the geometric center of the wafer recess <b>24</b>, but it will be apparent that the orientation or angle of the slots <b>32</b> may vary considerably while still providing a path between the circular groove <b>28</b> and the interior area of the wafer recess <b>24</b>, and that such arrangements are within the scope of the present invention. The depth of each slot is preferably at least 0.001 in., and preferably in the range of 0.004-0.008 in., though other depths may be feasible. The fixed length of the slots <b>32</b>, along with their width and number, are dependent on the diameter and thickness of the wafer <b>30</b> in order to effectively lift the wafer <b>30</b> during loading and unloading utilizing the Bernoulli principle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">It is important that the distance that the radial slots <b>32</b> extend underneath the wafer <b>30</b> (referred to herein as the amount of “slot overlap” with the substrate wafer <b>30</b>) encompass both CTE-related growth and the possible off-center loading of the substrate wafer <b>30</b> in the substrate wafer recess <b>24</b>. The amount of slot overlap must also be controlled so as not to be so great that it affects temperature uniformity of the substrate wafer <b>30</b> or contributes to backside markings on the substrate wafer <b>30</b>. It is known that extending the slots <b>32</b> all the way to the actual center of the interior area of the wafer recess <b>24</b> is problematic. However, it is further believed that successful results may be achieved with slots <b>32</b> of an inch in length, at least with wafer holders <b>16</b> designed to accommodate 6-in. diameter wafers <b>30</b>. On the other hand, the overlap must be of a minimum length so as to provide sufficient gas flow to facilitate substrate wafer loading and unloading operations using Bernoulli principle. Although neither the minimum or maximum lengths are known, it is known that slots <b>32</b> of 0.040-0.060 in. have been used successfully as described herein below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">It is also important to control the number of slots <b>32</b> in that, based on a given slot area, a minimum number of slots <b>32</b> is required in order to properly engage a substrate wafer <b>30</b> during loading and unloading operations. The minimum number is primarily dependent on the surface area of the slots <b>32</b> relative to the surface area of the wafer recess <b>24</b>, since this results in a corresponding lift force. Thus, the number of slots <b>32</b> may depend on the width and length of the slots <b>32</b> used, as well as the size of the wafer recess <b>24</b>. Wide slots <b>32</b>, however, are to be avoided as they will lead to localized thermal effects, and the length of the slots <b>32</b> should be controlled as described previously. Exact limits on the number of slots <b>32</b> and their width are unknown, but it is known that 96 slots <b>32</b>, each 0.019 in. wide, have been used successfully in wafer holders <b>16</b> designed to accommodate 6-in. diameter wafers <b>30</b> as described herein below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">It is also believed that the slots <b>32</b> must be arranged in a generally uniform pattern around the perimeter of the wafer recess <b>24</b> in order to maintain temperature uniformity and the like. Thus, the spacing between slots <b>32</b> is preferably constant around the entire perimeter, and the length, width and depth of each slot <b>32</b> is preferably constant. However, it may be possible to use uniform patterns of slots <b>32</b> having a uniformly-varying pattern of lengths, widths, or spacings without departing from the scope of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">The bottom surface <b>22</b> of the holder body <b>18</b> is of conventional design. A circular support groove <b>34</b> may be disposed in the bottom surface <b>22</b> such that the wafer holder <b>16</b> may be placed or mounted on an appropriate structure in the support mechanism <b>14</b>, such as the spider-type pedestal, typically composed of quartz, shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,427,620.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">The holder body <b>18</b> may or may not be covered with a surface coating <b>36</b> composed of one of the following: silicon carbide, silicon nitride, pyrolytic graphite, pyrolytic carbon, diamond, aluminum nitride, aluminum oxide, silicon, silicon dioxide or tantalum carbide. Conventionally, the coating <b>36</b> is applied to the entire substrate, including but not limited to the top and bottom surfaces <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">The slight depression forming the wafer recess <b>24</b> may have a slightly concave profile, perhaps best seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, that may be created by machining the top surface <b>20</b> of the holder body <b>18</b>. The depression further aids in releasing the substrate wafer <b>30</b> from the holder <b>16</b> by allowing gases to flow freely beneath the wafer <b>30</b> and preventing the wafer <b>30</b> from sticking to an otherwise flat surface. Concave surface profiles are desired for improved wafer temperature uniformity due to the tendency of wafers <b>30</b> to sag at high temperatures. The deformity caused by the sag will be a function of substrate wafer diameter as well as the end-user's process conditions. Moreover, because temperature uniformity may be optimized when the gap between the sagging wafer <b>30</b> and the top surface of the holder body <b>18</b> is relatively uniform, the profile of the wafer recess <b>24</b> preferably matches or approximates that of the sagging wafer <b>30</b>. Thus, because the profile of a wafer <b>30</b> when sagging is assumed to be roughly spherical, the concavity of the wafer recess <b>24</b> may be spherical as well. However, it will be apparent that closer analysis of the profile of a wafer <b>30</b> when sagging will likely reveal non-spherical characteristics, and thus the profile of the wafer recess <b>24</b> may be varied accordingly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">In general, larger diameter wafers <b>30</b> and lower end-use process temperature conditions favor the use of profiles that have a larger dished shape. Reasons for this include the fact that larger wafers <b>30</b> are heavier so the need to minimize adhesion between the wafer <b>30</b> and the mating face of the substrate holder <b>16</b> is more critical. In addition, larger wafers <b>30</b> will sag more at temperature than smaller wafers <b>30</b>, so a larger dished profile may help achieve improved temperature uniformity. The concavity of conventional wafer recesses used in wafer processing may range from 0.002 in. to 0.010 in., with greater concavity required for particularly sensitive processing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">Six susceptor-type wafer holders designed and manufactured according to the principles described herein were tested under standard process conditions. The wafer holder included a wafer recess sized to accommodate wafers having a diameter of 6 in. Each wafer holder included 96 radial slots, each 0.007 in. deep and 0.019 in. wide and 0.040 in. long. The wafer recess of each wafer holder was 0.017 in. deep and concave in profile by 0.002 in., and the continuous groove of each wafer holder was 0.035 in. wide and 0.035 in. deep. The six test parts worked successfully (successful release of a semiconductor wafer from the wafer holder using Bernoulli principle-based pickup) in up to 10,000 runs, which compares very favorably to the typical lifetime experienced in the industry, for conventional wafer holders such as the one illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref>, of approximately 2,000 to 4,000 runs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">In view of such success, a susceptor-type wafer holder designed and manufactured according to the principles described herein was used in a silicon epitaxy deposition process. The wafer holder included a wafer recess sized to accommodate wafers having a diameter of 6 in. The wafer holder included 96 radial slots, each 0.060 in. long, 0.005 in. deep and 0.019 in. wide. The wafer recess was 0.017 in. deep and concave in profile by 0.0025 in. The continuous groove was 0.035 in. wide and 0.035 in. deep. The wafer holder was used successfully in 178 runs before use was discontinued for an unrelated issue. General performance was equal to that of conventional wafer holders such as the wafer holder illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref>, but significantly, all wafer coatings carried out using the test wafer holder were of high quality with no indication of the temperature uniformity problems or image transfer issues described previously.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">Alternative configurations of the wafer holder of the present invention will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a top view of a multiplexed wafer holder <b>66</b>, where two wafer recesses <b>74</b> are arranged side by side in a single holder body <b>68</b>, in accordance with an alternative embodiment of the present invention. Each wafer recess <b>74</b> includes a circular groove <b>78</b> and a plurality of slots <b>82</b>, similar to the groove <b>28</b> and slots <b>32</b> provided in the wafer holder <b>24</b> previously described. Other than the inclusion of a second wafer recess <b>74</b> and the second plurality of slots <b>82</b>, the wafer holder <b>66</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is generally similar to the first wafer holder <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">Such a configuration may be useful in maximizing the number of wafers <b>30</b> produced in a particular reaction chamber <b>12</b>. For example, a particular reaction chamber <b>12</b> may be designed to accommodate the manufacture of 8-in. wafers <b>30</b>, but a manufacturer sometimes wishes to use the reaction chamber <b>12</b> in the manufacture of wafers <b>30</b> that are only 4 in. in diameter. Manufacture of either wafer size may be accomplished through the use of an appropriately-sized wafer holder <b>16</b> of the type described herein. However, the manufacture of 4-in. wafers <b>30</b> in the 8-in. reaction chamber <b>12</b> may be optimized by using a wafer holder <b>66</b> such as the one shown schematically in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. This approach may further be utilized to design wafer holders (not shown) having other numbers, sizes and arrangements of wafer recesses as will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">The teachings of the present invention may be applied to other types of wafer holders as well. For example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is a perspective view of a prior art stepped-type wafer holder <b>116</b>, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> is a partial side cross-sectional view of the wafer holder <b>116</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, taken along line <b>6</b>B-<b>6</b>B. The stepped-type wafer holder <b>116</b> includes a circumferential ledge <b>119</b> around the perimeter of a wafer recess <b>124</b> for supporting the outer edges of a wafer <b>30</b>. During processing, the wafer <b>30</b> conventionally sags into the wafer recess <b>124</b> in similar manner to that of the wafer holder <b>16</b> of the present invention. Typically, stepped-type wafer holders <b>116</b> use lift pins, disposed underneath the wafer <b>30</b> and arranged to project through openings <b>125</b> in the wafer recess <b>124</b>, to raise the wafer <b>30</b> off the top of the holder <b>116</b> from underneath, rather than using a Bernoulli-type pickup to raise the wafer <b>30</b> from above. Although not specifically illustrated, the principles of the present invention may likewise be applied to stepped-type wafer holders <b>116</b> by applying slots (not shown) to the ledge <b>119</b>. This would permit a stepped-type wafer holder <b>116</b> to use a conventional Bernoulli-type pickup during unloading operations.</div>
