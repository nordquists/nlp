<heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">The present invention relates to a heat-decaying material, a transfer sheet using the same, and a patterning method. In particular, the invention relates to a heat-decaying material that hardly deteriorates and decomposes at ordinary service temperatures but can decay within a short period of time when heated at relatively low temperature, and to its use.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">Heretofore, adhesive tapes are stuck to surfaces for temporary fixation in predetermined positions of parts to be bonded together or parts to be bonded to housings or parts to be bonded to substrates in assembly processes, or for protection of surfaces that are readily scratched during working or conveyance. However, when adhesive tapes are used for such temporary fixation or surface protection, there are some problems in that peeling them is often difficult and, when they are peeled, the objects may be scratched or paste may remain on the objects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Recently, vehicles, electric appliances for household use and building materials have become recycled, and structures bonded with adhesive are also desired to be recycled. In general, resin adhesives may readily melt or decompose when heated at 400° C. or higher, and the structures bonded with them may be thereby readily dismantled. However, when heated at such high temperatures, the structures themselves would be deteriorated and denatured, and it causes a problem in that the dismantled structures could not be recycled.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">A transfer sheet with an adhesive sheet is utilized as an efficient transfer method, since multiple parts disposed on the sheet may be transferred all at a time. In addition, the adhesive sheet acts also as a reinforcing material for the parts to be transferred, and, for example, it enables transfer of even brittle parts such as ultra-thin semiconductor wafers and semiconductor chips with no damage thereto. In this, the transfer sheet must have a high adhesive force to objects before they are transferred, and must readily release them when they are transferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">To that effect, adhesive sheets that have a high adhesive force for the necessary period of time but, on the other hand, may be readily peeled from objects when the objects are to be released from them are needed in many applications.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">As the adhesive sheets of the type, those capable of reducing their adhesive force when some stimulation is applied to the adhesive matter thereof are known, and they include, for example, heat-foaming adhesive sheets, thermosetting adhesive sheets, photocurable adhesive sheets. However, even when these adhesive sheets are used, their adhesive force that may be reduced is limited, and, in fact, some adhesive sheets could not have a sufficiently high adhesive force before transfer, or some others could not sufficiently reduce their adhesive force in transfer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">Patent Reference 1 discloses a heat-decaying adhesive sheet that may decay by at least 95% of the sheet weight when heated at 700° C. or lower for 30 minutes or shorter. When the heat-decaying adhesive sheet is used, then the sheet itself may be removed when heated. However, Patent Reference 1 says that the heat-decaying adhesive sheet is resistant to explosion-proofing treatment of Brawn tubes, and does not decay even when heated at 450 to 550° C. for a short period of time. From this, it is considered that the sheet may take ten and a few minutes before it decays at a temperature of 450° C. or lower. It is considered that the long-term heating at such high temperatures may cause deterioration and denaturation of objects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">Further, Patent Reference 2 discloses a binder for ceramic shaping, which comprises a water-soluble polyalkylene glycol, a novel combed hydrophobic diol and a polyisocyanate, and which is such that its heat generation in degreasing is slow, the amount of its heat generation is small and the degree of carbon residue from it is small. However, the binder resin disclosed in Patent Reference 2 is an urethane resin obtained through reaction of diol and isocyanate, and, therefore, its decomposition residue may be small but it is problematic in that it leaves an yellowed residue that may be an oxide derived from the urethane bond. Accordingly, clean surfaces are often difficult to obtain in some cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">Heretofore, various porous films are used for forming interlayer insulating films in semiconductor devices and multi-level wiring boards. For shortening the signal transmission delay time, it is desired that the interlayer insulating films of the type are formed of an insulating material having a low dielectric constant. To satisfy the requirement, Patent Reference 3 to be mentioned below discloses a method for producing a porous film by thermally processing a film of a uniformly-dissolved composite material that comprises a partially-hydrolyzed condensate of an alkoxysilane and a fluororesin having a carboxylic acid group in the molecule and having a fluorine-containing aliphatic cyclic structure or a fluorine-containing aliphatic structure in the backbone chain thereof, at a temperature not lower than the thermal decomposition-initiating temperature of the fluororesin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">However, according to the production method described in Patent Reference 3, a large number of pores are formed through the thermal treatment effected at a temperature not lower than the thermal decomposition-initiating temperature of the above-mentioned specific fluororesin, and the porous film is thereby produced. Accordingly, an SiO<sub>2</sub>-based porous material having such a large number of holes formed therein is obtained, and it is said that the film obtained has a low dielectric constant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">When the size of the pores in a porous film is enlarged in some degree, then the dielectric constant of the film may be further lowered. However, according to the method described in Patent Reference 3, it is difficult to form uniform pores. In addition, there is still another problem in that, when the fluororesin is thermally decomposed, it gives a residue, and therefore the dielectric constant of the film could not be fully reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">In addition, since the film has a large number of pores, its mechanical strength is significantly problematic.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">Further, regarding the formation of interlayer insulating films in semiconductor devices, they are formed after the formation of elements on semiconductor substrates, and therefore, when the semiconductor substrates with elements thereon are exposed to high temperatures for a long period of time, then the elements may be deteriorated. Accordingly, it is desired to develop interlayer insulating films capable of being formed at low temperatures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">Recent ICs and LSIs are to have much more increased degree of integration and are to be much more micropatterned, and more than these, high-density packaging techniques are greatly developing. In addition, electronic system integration techniques are much desired, which are for integrating and systemizing various functional blocks such as optical devices and high-frequency devices that comprise multiple LSIs and compound semiconductors, for example, for system-in-packages.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">Heretofore, for connecting semiconductor chips of IC or LSI on an electronic circuit boards, employed is a method of covering the semiconductor chip with a resin package and soldering the tip of the lead that runs from the resin package, on a printed board. In this method, however, all leads must be soldered one by one and the production efficiency is not good. In addition, the lead runs out from the side of the resin package, and the method is therefore unsuitable to high-density packaging. To solve these problems, a technique of BGA (ball grid array) has been developed, which comprises bonding semiconductor chips to a wiring board by conductive fine particles such as solder balls or bumps. According to this technique, chips are bonded to a substrate while the conductive fine particles bonded to the chips or the electrodes of the substrate are melted at high temperatures, and therefore electronic circuits may be constructed while satisfying both increased producibility and increased bonding reliability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">For bonding such conductive fine particles to electrodes, heretofore employed is a method of making multiple conductive fine particles sucked by a suction pad having multiple vacuum suction nozzles, and putting the conductive fine particles on multiple electrodes all at a time, and bonding them to the electrodes. In this case, in general, the electrode face of the electronic parts is previously coated with an organic acid ester. The organic acid ester is effective for removing the spontaneous oxide film formed on the electrode surface and for facilitating the capture of the conductive fine particles. However, the conductive fine particles thus put on the electrode are still problematic in that they may shift from the electrode while conveyed to the next step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">In the method of disposing conductive fine particles by the use of vacuum suction nozzles, the conductive fine particles must be sucked by all the vacuum suction nozzles, but suction failures may occur and the method is not always a sure method. In addition, since the conductive fine particles are only sucked, they may drop off if the operation speed is increased. Further, since the electrode position for electronic parts differs for every electronic part, and the method has still another problem in that vacuum suction nozzles corresponding to all electronic parts must be developed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">Different from this, another method has been proposed, which comprises disposing conductive fine particles on electrodes by the use of a conductive particles transfer sheet that has conductive fine particles previously disposed on an adhesive sheet. Concretely, the method comprises applying a conductive particles transfer sheet to electronic parts in such a manner that the position of the conductive fine particles corresponds to the position of the electrode, then melt-bonding the conductive fine particles to the electrode, and thereafter peeling the adhesive sheet. In this case, when the adhesive used in the adhesive sheet is a specific one capable of reducing its adhesive force by imparting specific energy thereto, then the adhesive sheet may be readily peeled off not breaking the connection of the conductive fine particles once melt-bonded to the electrodes. For the adhesive sheet of the type, for example, a heat-foaming adhesive sheet, a thermosetting adhesive sheet and a photocurable adhesive sheet have been proposed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">In fact, however, even when such an adhesive sheet is used, its adhesive force that may be reduced is limited, and the connection of some conductive fine particles may be broken when the adhesive sheet is peeled off, or an adhesive paste may remain on the surface of the conductive fine particles. In particular, when the peeling speed is increased so as to increase the working efficiency, then this tendency becomes remarkable. On the other hand, if the adhesive force of the adhesive sheet is made low, then this causes another problem in that the conductive fine particles may drop off.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">On the other hand, there is proposed still another method of using an adhesive sheet with conductive fine particles embedded in the position opposite to the electrodes to be bonded, and disposing the conductive fine particles on the surface of the electrodes and bonding them (for example, see Patent Reference 4). However, when kept under severe conditions, for example, when kept in high-temperature high-humidity environments or dipped in solvent, the resin to constitute the adhesive sheet may be deteriorated or deformed and, as a result, the embedded electroconductive fine particles may receive some stress that acts to separate the particles from the electrode face. Accordingly, the method of not using the adhesive sheet is better in the current situation for ensuring high bonding reliability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">In such high-density packaging techniques, the most important elementary technique is a fine bonding technique. Heretofore, one typical bonding technique for it is a bump-bonding technique. With the development of the above-mentioned packaging technique, further increase in the accuracy in the bump bonding technique is to be an important theme in the art. However, the related art has various problems as mentioned above, and a technique of fully ensuring high producibility and high bonding reliability in bump formation on electrodes of electronic parts is now greatly desired.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">With the recent development of portable information terminals and popularization of mobile computing of carrying and using portable computers, electronic appliances are further down-sized more and more. The circuit boards to be built in these electronic appliances are desired to be much more down-sized and thin-sized. In addition, with the popularization of electronic appliances that are required to satisfy high-speed operation, such as communication appliances, desired are circuit boards suitable to high-speed operation that enables accurate switching to high-frequency signals. In such circuit boards, it is desired to shorten the wiring length and to reduce the wiring width and the wiring distance for the purpose of shortening the time necessary for electric signal propagation. To that effect, circuit boards are desired to have an increased wiring density so as to attain high-density packaging thereon, in accordance with the recent tendency toward down-sized and high-speed-operable electronic appliances.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">Various production methods have heretofore been proposed for circuit boards. One method recently proposed comprises pressure-bonding an adhesive tape prepared by forming a metal foil circuit pattern on the surface thereof (circuit transfer tape) to an insulating substrate to thereby embed the circuit pattern into the insulating substrate, and thereafter peeing the adhesive tape from the circuit pattern so as to transfer the circuit pattern onto the insulating substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">The above-mentioned production method is described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. As in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref> <i>a</i>), a circuit transfer tape <b>2101</b> is prepared. The circuit transfer tape <b>2101</b> comprises an adhesive tape <b>2102</b> and a metal layer <b>2103</b> to form a circuit pattern on its surface. After this is positioned to an insulating substrate <b>2104</b>, the two are bonded to each other. The insulating substrate <b>2104</b> is a semi-cured prepreg. In this case, the two are bonded in a mode of thermal pressure bonding, for example, under a pressure of 100 kg/cm<sup>2 </sup>or so, and as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref> <i>b</i>), a part or all of the metal layer <b>2103</b> is embedded and fixed in the insulating substrate <b>2104</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">Next, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10(</figref> <i>c</i>), the adhesive tape <b>2102</b> is peeled from the insulating substrate <b>2104</b>, whereby a metal layer <b>2103</b> having a circuit pattern is transferred onto the insulating substrate <b>2104</b> to form a single-layered circuit board. Further, if desired, the insulating substrate <b>2104</b> is completely cured. A multi-layered circuit board may be formed by laminating the above-mentioned single-layered circuit boards.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">However, when the metal layer <b>2103</b> is transferred onto the insulating substrate <b>2104</b>, the adhesive component of the adhesive tape <b>2102</b> is contacted with the insulating substrate <b>2104</b> and the adhesive tape <b>2102</b> is often difficult to peel from the insulating substrate <b>2104</b>. In particular, when a fine circuit pattern is transferred and when the adhesive tape <b>2102</b> strongly adheres to the insulating substrate <b>2104</b>, then the semi-cured insulating substrate <b>2104</b> may be deformed while the adhesive tape <b>2102</b> is peeled off, whereby the wiring distance of the metal layer <b>2103</b> may be disordered and the wiring planarity may be lost, or that is, the circuit pattern may be disordered, and, in addition, the embedded metal layer <b>2103</b> may be peeled off along with the adhesive tape <b>2102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">To solve the problems as above, Patent Reference 5 discloses a method for producing a circuit board, which comprises using a circuit transfer tape with a layer of a photocrosslinkable adhesive component having high adhesiveness formed thereon, and in which the circuit transfer tape is exposed to light from the side of the circuit pattern thereof so as to lower the adhesive force of the tape on the side with no circuit pattern formed thereon, and therefore even when the adhesive component of the circuit transfer tape is contacted with an insulating substrate, it does not adhere to the insulating substrate and the circuit pattern can be thereby well transferred onto the insulating substrate with no pattern disturbance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">However, even when the photocrosslinkable adhesive is crosslinked through exposure to light as in Patent Reference 5, the reduction in the adhesive force owing to the light irradiation is limited, and when a microfine and high-density circuit pattern is transferred onto an insulating substrate, then the circuit pattern may be often broken when the transfer tape is peeled off. In addition, when a circuit pattern having an extremely narrow line width is transferred onto an insulating substrate, then the circuit transfer tape must be exposed to light from the side of the adhesive tape so as to lower the adhesive force between the metal foil and the photocrosslinkable adhesive. In this case, therefore, the light exposure step must be carried out many times repeatedly, and this is problematic in that the production efficiency (producibility) and the workability are thereby lowered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">At present, in production of semiconductor devices, a resist pattern is formed through photolithography, and various materials of conductor films, semiconductor films or insulator films for semiconductor devices are patterned through etching via the resist pattern serving as a mask (for example, see Non-Patent Reference 1). In addition, the resist pattern is used as a mask for plating, and a metal film of copper (Cu) or gold (Au) may be patterned. The patterning process through such photolithography is at present the most popular process in patterning not only for production of semiconductor devices but also for production of any other various display devices or micromachines.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">Patterning through photolithography is described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> are cross-sectional views showing a process scheme of forming a resist pattern through photolithography and forming a pattern on an insulator film by the use of the resist pattern serving as an etching mask.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">As in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref> <i>a</i>), an insulator film <b>3102</b> of silicon oxide is formed on a semiconductor substrate <b>3101</b> with various semiconductor elements (not shown) formed thereon, and a resist film <b>3103</b> is formed on the insulator film <b>3102</b> in a coating process of photolithography. In this, the resist film <b>3103</b> is formed of a photosensitive resin, and its formation is as follows: Concretely, a polymer of a photosensitive resin composition or the like is dissolved in a solvent to prepare a resist coating solution, and this is applied onto a semiconductor wafer, the insulator film <b>3102</b> formed on the semiconductor substrate <b>3101</b> in a mode of spin coating. After thus spin-coated, this is prebaked at a temperature not higher than 100° C. so as to vaporize away the unnecessary solvent. In that manner, the resist film <b>3103</b> is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">Next, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16(</figref> <i>b</i>), using a reticle <b>3106</b> that comprises a quartz glass substrate <b>3104</b> and a masking pattern <b>3105</b> formed on its surface, as a photomask for exposure in photolithography, the resist film <b>3103</b> is exposed to light <b>3107</b> in an ordinary reduction projection exposure manner for pattern exposure transfer to it. In that manner, an optical pattern transfer region <b>3103</b> <i>a </i>is formed in a predetermined region of the resist film <b>3103</b>. Next, this is heat-treatment for PEB (post exposure baking). The recent exposure light <b>3107</b> is an ArF excimer laser (wavelength: about 193 nm), and the resist film <b>3103</b> is a chemical amplification-type resist.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">Next, for development in photolithography, the semiconductor substrate <b>3101</b> that is in a semiconductor wafer condition is dipped in a developer. If desired, this may be exposed to shower of a developer. In that manner, the optical pattern transfer region <b>3103</b> <i>a </i>is removed through the development to form a resist pattern, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16(</figref> <i>c</i>). Further, this is post-baked at a temperature of 120° C. or so, thereby forming a resist mask <b>3108</b> on the insulator film <b>3102</b>. This is a case where the resist is a positive resist. The other case where the resist is a negative resist is contrary to it, in which the optical pattern transfer region <b>3103</b> <i>a </i>remains through the development and the other region is removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">Next, using the resist mask <b>3108</b> as an etching mask, the insulator film <b>3102</b> is dry-etched by the use of plasma, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. With that, an opening <b>3109</b> is formed in the insulator film <b>3102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">Next, the resist mask is stripped off. As in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17(</figref> <i>b</i>), the resist mask <b>3108</b> is ashed away in oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) plasma. In that manner, a pattern of the insulator film <b>3102</b> having the opening <b>3109</b> is formed. In this, the opening <b>3109</b> is generally to be a via-hole for wiring interconnection via the insulator film <b>3102</b> that serves as a wiring interlayer insulation film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">Recently, the pattern dimension in patterning semiconductor devices has become significantly micro-sized to a level of 100 nm or less. With the advanced micropatterning technology, semiconductor devices are therefore much more improved to have an increased degree of integration and to be multi-functional high-performance devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">However, the above-mentioned micropatterning technique in the above-mentioned photolithography technology requires the above-mentioned high-level techniques of coating, exposure, development and stripping, and it increases the production costs in the process of patterning semiconductor devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">Heretofore, the above-mentioned coating, exposure and development steps for resist mask formation through photolithography constitute the basis of photolithography, and even when the technique for these steps cold be improved individually, the basic constitution of the series of these techniques would not change. The same may apply also to the step of stripping a resist mask as above. Improving these techniques to higher-leveled ones inevitably brings about the increase in the cost for patterning. Accordingly, it is desired to develop a novel technique that basically differs from conventional techniques in that it satisfies both high-level micropatterning technology and reduced production costs.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0193">According to the method for producing a porous material of the invention, a skeleton-forming crosslinkable material and the heat-decaying material are heated in a uniformly dispersed condition of the two, and the heat-decaying material can be well decayed under heat at low temperatures. Accordingly, the resulting pores can be uniformly dispersed in the porous material produced in such a manner that the skeleton-forming crosslinkable material surrounds the pores and forms a stiff skeleton phase structure. Therefore, in a process of producing semiconductor devices, the film can be formed not having any negative influence on the other element region. If desired, in addition, the skeleton phase-constituting crosslinkable material can be selected in any desired manner, and porous materials of high reliability can be formed in accordance with the use thereof. Further, since porous materials of good film quality can be formed at low temperatures falling between 150 and 350° C., preferably between 150° C. and 200° C., the latitude in selecting the skeleton phase-constituting crosslinkable material is broad. In particular, when the porous material is used as interlayer insulating films in semiconductor devices, then it can be formed at extremely low temperatures not higher than 200° C., and this means that the films can be formed with no deterioration of elements. Regarding the film-forming methods, any of spin-coating method or screen-printing method may be suitably selected by controlling the composition for the films. Further, porous sheets are easy to form. The porous sheet may be stuck to the surface of a semiconductor substrate by the sue of an adhesive resin, and it may be used as an interlayer insulating film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0194">In the method for producing the porous material of the invention, the heating may be effected at a temperature falling between 150 and 350° C. and for a heating time of 10 minutes or less.

When the material is used in formation of interlayer insulating films in production of semiconductor devices, it does not cause elongation of diffusion layers already formed or deterioration of wiring layers, and therefore semiconductor devices of high reliability can be provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0195">In the method for producing the porous material of the invention, the skeleton-forming crosslinkable material (a) may be an alkoxysilane, and the step of crosslinking the crosslinkable material to form the skeleton phase may comprise condensing the alkoxysilane to form an inorganic silane compound phase.

Accordingly, in production of semiconductor devices, the material can be used not deteriorating element regions and wirings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0197">In the method for producing the porous material of the invention, the polyoxyalkylene resin may have a number-average molecular weight of from 5000 to 5,000,000.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0201">In the method for producing the porous material of the invention, the heating of the precursor may be effected in two stages, a first heating, and a second heating at a temperature higher than the temperature in the first heating.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0214">In the conductive particles transfer sheet, the heat-decaying adhesive resin may give a more volatile residue when decomposed under reduced pressure. In that condition, therefore, the decomposition residue may be reduced. In addition, when the adhesive resin is decayed under heat at a predetermined temperature falling between 150 and 350° C. under reduced pressure within 5 minutes, then the heating time may be shortened. Accordingly, even conductive fine particles that are readily damaged by heat can be used in the transfer sheet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0215">The method of the invention for bonding conductive fine particles to the electrode face of electronic parts comprises attaching a conductive particles transfer sheet to electronic parts where conductive fine particles are disposed on the heat-decaying adhesive sheet in such a manner that the conductive fine particles could be in contact or in no contact with the position of the electrodes of the electronic parts, then melting and bonding the conductive fine particles to the electrodes of the electronic parts, and heating the resulting structure to decay the heat-decaying adhesive sheet.

Accordingly, in the method, bonding of conductive fine particles such as solder balls to substrates may be realized at the same time with the heating operation in the reflow step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0223">The transfer sheet of the invention may be a transfer sheet for circuit formation, and this loses its solid form when the heat-decaying material or the adhesive sheet comprising a heat-decaying material-containing composition therein is decomposed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0224">Having the constitution, the adhesive sheet may be readily decomposed and decayed when heated. Therefore, the transfer sheet makes it easy to transfer a fine and high-density circuit pattern onto an insulating substrate and makes it possible to form a circuit board having fine and high-density wirings with high accuracy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0225">The solid form of the adhesive sheet changes under heat and the sheet thereby separates from the circuit pattern, the metal foil or the conductive paste layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0226">When the adhesive sheet is formed of a composite film that partly contains the heat-decaying material, then the adhesive force of the adhesive sheet may be greatly lowered by the vapor generated through heat treatment to decompose the heat-decaying material, and as a result, the adhesive sheet can readily separate from the circuit pattern. Accordingly, it is easy to transfer a fine and high-density circuit pattern, a metal foil or a conductive paste onto an insulating substrate, and circuit boards having fine and high-density wirings can be formed with high accuracy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0227">Preferably, the heat-decaying material contains a crosslinkable resin composition that may crosslink through energy stimulation thereto.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0228">Having the constitution, the adhesive sheet does not require heat treatment for suitably curing it, and the absence of heat treatment in the curing step completely prevents the heat-decaying material from being decomposed. It is possible to obtain a transfer sheet for forming high-quality circuits.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0229">The transfer sheet for circuit formation may contain a heat-decaying material resin that comprises a crosslinkable silyl group-having polyoxyalkylene resin, and the temperature for the above-mentioned heat treatment may be a relatively low temperature not higher than 200° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0230">According to the method for producing circuit boards of the invention, circuit boards having fine and high-density wirings can be produced in a simplified manner at high producibility and with high accuracy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0231">Preferably, the heat-decaying material comprises a crosslinkable silyl group-having polyoxyalkylene resin, and the heating temperature is controlled to fall between 150° C. and 170° C. Accordingly, in production of circuit boards, the circuit boards being produced are not exposed to high temperatures for a long period of time, and the materials and the properties of the circuit boards produced are not negatively influenced at all by the production process. In addition, any large-scale heating equipment is unnecessary and any simple-structured heating equipment is enough. Further, in production of electronic parts for which the acceptable limit of the heating temperature in the heating treatment is relatively low, or that is, not higher than 200° C., there occurs no change in the properties of the electronic parts produced, and the heat-decaying material of the invention is extremely effective for their production.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0232">In the transfer sheet of the invention, the transfer parts are electronic parts. Accordingly, the transfer sheet makes it possible to adhere electronic parts to a predetermined region with high positional accuracy. For example, this is extremely effective for parts positioning in a process of packaging machine parts such as racks or pinions formed through MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical systems) or NEMS (nano-electro-mechanical systems) technology, or cantilevers or air bridges. For example, when a heat-decaying adhesive resin layer is formed on a cantilever formed on a silicon wafer and when this is positioned relative to another silicon wafer with a semiconductor integrated circuit formed thereon and attached thereto, then an acceleration sensor can be formed with ease. When a heat-decaying adhesive resin layer is formed on the MEMS switch beam formed on a silicon wafer and when this is positioned relative to the GaAs wafer with a semiconductor integrated circuit and an electric machine filter formed thereon and attached thereto, then a receiver device can be formed with ease.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0233">The patterning method of the invention does not require direct patterning of a resist pattern and resist development after exposure transfer that are both indispensable in conventional patterning with a resist film. Accordingly, the patterning method of the invention is significantly simplified and the patterning costs may be lowered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0234">Further, differing from conventional photolithography, the working efficiency in the patterning method of the invention is improved and the patterning cost is thereby reduced and, in addition, the invention realizes high-accuracy patterning technology.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0235">Moreover, according to the invention, patterning of various materials for use in production of semiconductor devices can be significantly simplified, and the production costs are greatly reduced.</div>

<heading>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0253">The invention is described in detail hereinunder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0254">The heat-decaying material of the invention comprises a polyoxyalkylene resin as the principal ingredient thereof, and has an oxygen atom content of from 15 to 55% by mass, and when heated at a predetermined temperature falling between 150 and 350° C., at least 95% by weight of the material decays within 10 minutes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0255">Though not specifically defined but essentially, the heat-decaying material of the invention may have a sheet form at room temperature, or may have a paste morphology at room temperature and, when exposed to light or the like, it may crosslink into a cured product.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0256">The polyoxyalkylene resin in the heat-decaying material of the invention includes both an uncrosslinked one and a crosslinked one.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0257">Though not specifically defined, the polyoxyalkylene resin in the heat-decaying material of the invention includes polymers that contain segments of polyalkylene glycol or polyoxyalkylene.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0258">Also though not specifically defined, the polyalkylene glycol includes, for example, polyoxypropylene glycol, polyoxyethylene glycol, polyoxytetramethylene glycol. Above all, preferred for use in the invention are polyoxypropylene, polyoxyethylene, polyoxytetramethylene, as well as a mixed resin of polyoxypropylene, polyoxyethylene and/or polyoxytetramethylene. More preferably, the polyoxypropylene content of the mixed resin is at least 50% by mass. When the mixed resin of the type is used and when the blend ratio of the resins is controlled, then the decaying temperature and the decay time of the material may be controlled. A mixed resin of solid polyoxyethylene glycol and/or polyoxytetramethylene glycol is preferably used in the decaying material of the invention, since the properties of the material may be broadly varied including non-adhesive hot-melt-type resin sheets and adhesive sheets.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0259">In the copolymer that contains segments of the above-mentioned polyoxyalkylene, the polyoxyalkylene segments are meant to indicate segments each having at least two repetitive units of the following formula (1):</div>

</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0261">If the number of the repetitive unit of formula (1) for the segment is one, then the heat-decaying material of the invention could not be completely decayed under heat. Even when the segment that has at least two repetitive units of formula (1) does not have a crosslinking point and the resin is crosslinked with any other segment to be a gel resin, then it may be used in the heat-decaying material of the invention so far as the above-mentioned polyoxyalkylene segment exist between the crosslinking points. In addition, the copolymer that includes the above-mentioned polyoxyalkylene segments may be processed with a chain extender so that the segments may be chain-wise liked together.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0262">Not specifically defined, the polymer that contains the polyoxyalkylene segments includes, for example, polymethylene glycol (polyacetal), polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, polytrimethylene glycol, polytetramethylene glycol, polybutylene glycol, and combinations of different types of these segments. It further includes polyurethanes, polyesters, polyamides and polyimides that may be obtained from these. It still includes vinyl-based polymers such as (meth)acrylic polymers and polystyrenes that have these polyoxyalkylene segments as the grafts thereof. Two or more different types of these resins may be combined for use herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0263">Preferably, the number-average molecular weight of the polyoxyalkylene resin is from 500 to 5,000,000. If the number-average molecular weight is smaller than 500, then the resin will be too volatile and, if so, the decaying material of the invention may be difficult to stably handle.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0367">For example, when the material could decay in a temperature atmosphere falling between 150 and 220° C., then it may be used for temporary fixation and for other various applications since it may be decayed in a process of temporary fixation of optical parts or in a process of packaging semiconductor devices by the use of low-temperature solder.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0369">When the material could decay in a temperature atmosphere falling between 280 and 350° C., then it may be used in forming porous thin film on aluminium wiring and may be used for various applications.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0370">The heat-decaying material and its cured product of the invention hardly decompose at a temperature not higher than 100° C. and keep their solid form, but may rapidly decompose at a relatively low temperature falling between 150 and 350° C. so that most of the solid part thereof decays. Accordingly, when heated, the material may be readily removed from the objects to which it has stuck, and, in addition, the objects receive little thermal influence. The heat-decaying material of the invention can be used, for example, as a temporary fixer such as binder for temporary fixation of glass fibers, and, after used, the temporary fixation with it may be relieved by heating; or it may be used as an adhesive for fixation of interlayer film for glass laminates, plasma display heat-conductive sheets or wallpapers, for fixation of gravel on railways, for fixation of stone structures, and for fixation of gypsum boards, and when recycled, it may be recovered merely by heating with no damage to the structures; or it may be used in temperature sensors in such a manner that it is disposed between contact points or one contact point is fixed with it and it is decayed at a predetermined temperature so as to shut up the contact point; or it may be used as a fixation paste or a fixation sheet for temporarily fixing metal surface-protective sheets, rust-preventing covers or polished samples; or it may be used as an under film for reinforcing semiconductor chips or substrates, and, when desire, it may be removed by heating; or it may be used for laser ablation resist to form a resist pattern.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0371">The applications of the heat-decaying material of the invention are not limited to those mentioned above. For example, the heat-decaying material is favorably used as a masking agent in working articles for preventing the area around the worked part of the articles from being soiled. The masking agent of the type is favorably used in a masking material that covers the area to be processed, for example, in a process of etching substrates for electronic parts or chips of electronic parts through laser processing or in a process of forming through-holes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0372">Heretofore, a re-peelable adhesive tape is used for such a masking material. However, the masking material of the re-peelable adhesive tape must be peeled after working. As opposed to this, when the heat-decaying material of the invention is used as a masking material, then it can be readily removed by heating after working. In addition, when the heat-decaying material of the invention is so designed that it is transparent, and even when the masking material is applied so as to cover even the part to be worked, the covered structure could be worked with laser or the like. Accordingly, since the masking material may be applied to the region that includes the part to be worked and therearound, the working efficiency may be enhanced. Furthermore, since the heat-decaying material of the invention can be cast in the absence of solvent, it may be readily applied to the surface of the objects to be worked, as a masking material thereover.</div>

Accordingly, it is desirable that the particle size of the heat-decaying material is uniform. For lowering the dielectric constant of the porous material, the pore size must be satisfactorily large, for example, preferably falling between 0.01 μm and 100 μm or so.

In particular, since relatively large pores can be uniformly dispersed therein, the porous film of the porous material can be favorably used as interlayer insulating films in electronic structures such as semiconductor devices or multi-layered substrates.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0394">As in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref> <i>a</i>), an antioxidant layer <b>13</b> is formed of Au foil or the like on the Cu wiring layer <b>12</b> formed in a BGA package <b>11</b>, and a flux <b>14</b> is applied to the antioxidant layer <b>13</b> to cover it. Next, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref> <i>b</i>), a conductive particles transfer sheet <b>17</b> that comprises a heat-decaying adhesive sheet <b>15</b> and solder balls <b>16</b> adhered to predetermined regions of the surface thereof is laminated onto the BGA package <b>11</b> while the position of the Cu wiring layer <b>12</b> of the BGA package <b>11</b> is aligned with that of the solder ball <b>16</b>.

<heading>Embodiment 2 of Conductive Particles Transfer Sheet</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0398">Embodiment 2, a modification of Embodiment 1 of the conductive particles transfer sheet is described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In these drawings, the same parts as those in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are indicated by the same reference numerals. The difference between Embodiment 2 and Embodiment 1 is that, in Embodiment 2, the solder balls <b>16</b> are embedded into the heat-decaying adhesive sheet <b>15</b> and is adhered and positioned therein in the conductive particles transfer sheet <b>17</b> described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref> <i>b</i>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0399">First described in the conductive particles transfer sheet <b>17</b> to be used in Embodiment 2 of the conductive particles transfer sheet with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref> <i>a</i>) is a plan view of the conductive particles transfer sheet <b>17</b>; and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref> <i>b</i>) is a cross-sectional view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref> <i>a</i>) cut along X<sub>1</sub>-X<sub>2</sub>. As in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3(</figref> <i>a</i>), a large number of solder balls <b>16</b> are disposed in the heat-decaying adhesive sheet <b>15</b>. The solder balls <b>16</b> are embedded and fitted into the heat-decaying adhesive sheet <b>15</b>, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (<i>b</i>) . For fixing these into the sheet, employed is a method of forming through-holes of which the pore size is smaller than the diameter of the solder balls <b>16</b>, at predetermined positions of the heat-decaying adhesive sheet <b>15</b> by the use of laser beams or electron beams, and sucking the solder balls <b>16</b> into the holes via the sheet, as so mentioned hereinabove.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0400">Next described is the case of forming solder ball bumps of the BGA package by the use of the conductive particles transfer sheet <b>17</b> with the solder balls <b>16</b> embedded and disposed therein as in the above, with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In this description, the same matters as those described in the section of Embodiment 1 of the conductive particles transfer sheet are omitted. After the step of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref> <i>a</i>) like in Embodiment 1, the conductive particles transfer sheet <b>17</b> described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is laminated onto the BGA package <b>11</b> while the solder balls <b>16</b> are positioned to the Cu wiring layer <b>12</b> of the BGA package <b>11</b>, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In this, for example, when a pin-lamination process is employed, then it makes it possible to attain accurate positioning of the solder balls <b>16</b> to the Cu wiring layer <b>12</b>. As in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the bottom of the solder ball <b>16</b> is exposed out of the heat-decaying adhesive sheet <b>15</b> into which the ball has been embedded. Accordingly, in the above-mentioned adhesion treatment, the solder ball <b>16</b> adheres to the flux <b>14</b> at the bottom thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0401">Then, first, this is subjected to heat treatment at a solder reflow temperature falling between 160° C. and 180° C. or so in a nitrogen atmosphere, whereby the solder balls <b>16</b> are melt-bonded to the Cu wiring layer <b>12</b>. After this melt-bonding treatment, this is then heated in a nitrogen atmosphere at 200 to 250° C. whereby the heat-decaying adhesive sheet <b>15</b> of the conductive particles transfer sheet <b>17</b> is decayed. In that manner, the solder ball bumps <b>18</b> are formed on the Cu wiring layer <b>12</b> of the BGA package <b>11</b>, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (<i>c</i>) . Then, like in the above-mentioned Embodiment 1, this is mounted on another board.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0402">In Embodiment 2 of the conductive particles transfer sheet, the heat-decaying adhesive sheet <b>15</b> does not exist below the bottom of each solder ball <b>16</b> in the solder reflow treatment step, different from that in the case of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref> <i>b</i>), and therefore the melt-bonding can be attained within a shorter period of time with higher accuracy in this Embodiment 2. Naturally, the above-mentioned melt-bonding and decaying can be attained simultaneously through the same heat treatment as in the above-mentioned Embodiment 1.</div>
<heading>Embodiment 3 of Conductive Particles Transfer Sheet</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0403">Embodiment 3, still another example of the invention is described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> includes cross-sectional views of a process scheme of forming bumps on the surface of a semiconductor chip or semiconductor wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0404">As in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref> <i>a</i>), a passivation film <b>122</b> of a silicon nitride or silicon oxynitride film is formed on the surface of a 8-inchφ semiconductor wafer <b>121</b> with semiconductor elements and internal wiring (not shown) formed thereon, and an outer lead wiring <b>123</b> is formed on it. The outer lead wiring <b>123</b> is formed of aluminium (Al) metal or Cu.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0405">Then, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref> <i>b</i>), a coating solution that contains a composition of a liquid heat-decaying adhesive resin is applied onto the passivation film <b>122</b> and the outer lead wiring <b>123</b> on the surface of the semiconductor wafer <b>121</b>, in a mode of spin-coating. Then, this is baked at 80° C. or so to thereby form a heat-decaying adhesive resin layer <b>124</b> thereon. In this, the heat-decaying adhesive resin layer <b>124</b> is formed of a polyoxyalkylene resin having a thickness of 1 μm or so.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0406">Next, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref> <i>c</i>), solder particles <b>125</b> having a size of 20μ or so are disposed at the position of the outer lead wiring <b>123</b>, and these are adhered to the surface of the heat-decaying adhesive resin layer <b>124</b> above the outer lead wiring <b>123</b>. Briefly, every solder particle <b>125</b> is sucked all at a time by every nozzle of a large number of vacuum suction nozzles, and all the solder particles <b>125</b> are positioned on the outer lead wiring <b>123</b> on the semiconductor chip, and these are adhered all at a time to the thus-positioned surface of the heat-decaying adhesive resin layer <b>124</b>. This operation is carried out for all the semiconductor chips on the semiconductor wafer <b>121</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0407">Then, this is subjected to heat treatment in a nitrogen atmosphere at a temperature of 200° C. or so, whereby the solder particles <b>125</b> are melt-bonded to the outer lead wiring <b>123</b>. In that manner, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref> <i>d</i>), the solder bumps <b>126</b> are formed on the outer lead wiring <b>123</b> of the semiconductor wafer <b>121</b>. In this, the heat-decaying adhesive resin layer <b>124</b> on the outer lead wiring <b>123</b> is pyrolyzed and completely decayed simultaneously with the above-mentioned heat treatment. Heretofore, the bumps of the type are formed mainly according to a plating process. In this Embodiment 3, the operability is significantly improved, therefore enabling high producibility. This is because, in a plating process, a feeder layer for plating must be formed on the semiconductor wafer <b>121</b>, and a complicated step of forming it and removing it is needed, but in the invention, the solder bumps <b>126</b> can be formed in the simple process that comprises disposition of the solder particles <b>125</b> on the outer lead wiring <b>123</b> followed by heat treatment thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0408">Though not shown in these drawings, the semiconductor wafer with the solder bumps <b>126</b> formed thereon is diced into semiconductor chips, and the semiconductor chips are bump-bonded to resin-encapsulated semiconductor devices or wiring boards according to a flip-chip-bonding process. Alternatively, two different types of semiconductor chips may be bump-bonded according to a butt-joint bonding process, and accordingly, COC (chip-on-chip), a type of high-density MCPs (multi-chip packages) can be fabricated in a simplified manner and at high reliability. In that manner, electronic system integration according to the above-mentioned packaging technology is thereby promoted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0409">The conductive particles transfer sheet that comprises the heat-decaying material of the invention is not limited to the above-mentioned embodiments, but may be changed and modified in any desired manner within the technical idea of the heat-decaying material of the invention. In the above-mentioned embodiments, the conductive fine particles are spherical solder balls or spherical solder particles. However, not limited to these, the conductive fine particles may also be columnar solder balls or columnar solder particles. Further, the conductive fine particles may be formed of any other low-melting-point alloys than solder. For example, metals of Au, Cu and Al are employable. When the conductive fine particles are not formed of a low-melting-point alloy such as solder, then the heat-decaying adhesive resin is decayed by heating and thereafter the conductive fine particles are melt-bonded to the electrodes of electronic parts for electrical connection.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0410">As described hereinabove, the conductive particles transfer sheet that comprises the heat-decaying material of the invention has conductive fine particles disposed on a heat-decaying adhesive resin layer or sheet. In this description, the heat-decaying adhesive resin (sheet) is meant to indicate a single-layered sheet of a heat-decaying adhesive that decomposes into vapor when heated, or decomposes and vaporizes to lose its solid form, or a multi-layered sheet having an adhesive layer of such a heat-decaying adhesive. When this is a supported-type heat-decaying adhesive sheet that is constructed by forming a heat-decaying adhesive layer on one or both faces of a substrate, then the substrate may not decay so far as the heat-decaying adhesive layer may decay. Preferably, however, the entire sheet including the substrate may decay by heating.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0411">Some such heat-decaying adhesives are known, for example, polymethylenemalonic acid diesters, polybutylene, nitrocellulose, α-methylstyrene polymer, propylene carbonate polymer, polyalkyl (meth)acrylates, copolymers of carboxylic acid dihydrazides and diisocyanates, peroxides of these polymers, as well as tackified compositions of such polymers optionally containing a plasticizer such as dibutyl phthalate or dioctyl phthalate or a softener such as xylene oil, terpene oil or paraffin wax added thereto. In addition, polybutene and polylauryl methacrylate may also be used as the heat-decaying adhesive.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0412">In general, however, in a process of bonding conductive fine particles to electrodes, the surface metal layer of the conductive fine particles or the conductive fine particles themselves are generally melted and bonded to them in the solder reflow step of the process. Therefore, when an adhesive capable of decaying at the reflow temperature falling between 150 and 260° C. is used, then the heat-decaying adhesive may be decayed in the reflow step, and the process may be significantly simplified. In addition, the heat-decaying adhesive can be used even in electronic parts relatively poorly resistant to heat. Heretofore, no one knows an adhesive capable of rapidly decaying at 150 to 260° C., but we the present inventors have found, as a result of assiduous studies, that the adhesive comprising the heat-decaying material that contains a polyoxyalkylene resin of the invention is effective. In addition, we have further found that, of the heat-decaying resin of the invention, a crosslinked resin of a polyoxyalkylene resin having a crosslinkable silyl group can rapidly decay when heated at 150 to 260° C. and, in addition, it is highly adhesive to various materials of a broad range such as metals of conductive fine particles, as well as silicon materials and plastic materials, and further, when it is formed into a sheet, the sheet has a suitable sheet strength.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0413">The crosslinkable silyl group includes, for example, an oxime-silyl group, an alkenyloxysilyl group, an acetoxysilyl group, a halogenosilyl group, a vinylsilyl group, a silanol group. Above all, alkoxysilyl-terminated polyoxyalkylene resin is favorable as it gives rubber-like crosslinked resin of good elasticity. The alkoxysilyl group includes, for example, a methoxysilyl group, an ethoxysilyl group, a propyloxysilyl group, an isopropyloxysilyl group, a butoxysilyl group, a tert-butoxysilyl group, a phenoxysilyl group, a benzyloxysilyl group. In dialkoxysilyl groups or trialkoxysilyl groups, the alkoxy groups may be the same or different alkoxy groups may be combined. One or more such crosslinked silyl groups may be used herein either singly or as combined. Different types of polyoxyalkylene resins, or polyoxyalkylene resins having different types of crosslinkable silyl groups may also be combined for use herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0414">For crosslinking the crosslinkable silyl group-having polyoxyalkylene resin, preferably used is a photoreactive catalyst having a functional group of formula (2). With it, the crosslinkable silyl group-having polyoxyalkylene resin can be crosslinked and cured through exposure to light such as visible rays, UV rays or electron rays (this may be hereinafter referred to as light irradiation). Above all, carboxylic acid anhydrides, carboxylic acid imides and diacylphosphine oxides are preferred as their photoreactivity is high and as their solubility in crosslinkable silyl group-having polyoxyalkylene resins is also high. One or more such photoreactive catalyst may be used herein either singly or as combined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0415">For crosslinking the crosslinkable silyl group-having polyoxyalkylene resin, a sensitizer may be added to the crosslinkable silyl group-having polyoxyalkylene resin composition. Containing a sensitizer, the photoreactivity of the resin increases and therefore, the time for light irradiation to the resin composition may be shortened and the light irradiation energy thereto may be reduced, and the composition may be uniformly crosslinked and cured from its surface to its depth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0416">The sensitizer includes, for example, acetophenone derivative compounds such as 4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)phenyl (2-hydroxy-2-propyl) ketone, α-hydroxy-α′-dimethylacetophenone, methoxyacetophenone, 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone; benzoin ether compounds such as benzoin ethyl ether, benzoin propyl ether; ketal derivative compounds such as benzyldimethyl ketal; halogenoketones; acylphosphine oxides; acyl phosphonates; 2-methyl-1-[4-(methylthio)phenyl]-2-morpholinopropan-1-one, 2-benzyl-2-N,N-dimethylamino-1-(4-morpholinophenyl)-1-butanone; bis (2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-phenylphosphine oxide, bis(2,6-dimethoxybenzoyl)-2,4,4-trimethylpentylphosphine oxide; bis(η5-cyclopentadienyl)-bis(pentafluorophenyl)-titanium, bis(η5-cyclopentadienyl)-bis[2,6-difluoro-3-(1H-pyri-1-dyl)phenyl]-titanium; anthracene, perylene, coronene, tetracene, benzanthracene, phenothiazine, flavin, acridine, ketocoumarin, thioxanthone derivatives, benzophenone, acetophenone, 2-chlorothioxanthone, 2,4-dimethylthioxanthone, 2,4-diethylthioxanthone, 2,4-diisopropylthioxanthone, isopropylthioxanthone. One or more of these may be used herein either singly or as combined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0417">When the above-mentioned heat-decaying adhesive sheet is used in a process in which, for example, it is subjected to solder reflow treatment repeatedly a few times, then the conductive bonding material is re-melted in every reflow treatment and the electronic parts may be moved and disordered in the re-melting step. In such a case where electronic parts are temporarily fixed before they pass through multiple solder reflow steps, the heat-decaying adhesive sheet of the invention is favorably used.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0420">Embodiments of the transfer sheet for circuit formation that comprises the heat-decaying material of the invention are described hereinunder with reference to the drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0421">The transfer sheet for circuit formation that comprises the heat-decaying material of the invention has a structure as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.

The non-heat-decaying resin means an ordinary resin not decomposing under heat.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0422">As in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref> <i>a</i>), the transfer sheet <b>21</b> for circuit formation comprises an adhesive sheet <b>22</b> formed of only a heat-decaying material having a thickness of from 10 μm to 500 μm, and a circuit pattern-forming metal layer <b>23</b> formed on the surface of the sheet <b>22</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0423">As in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref> <i>b</i>), the transfer sheet <b>21</b> for circuit formation comprises an adhesive sheet <b>22</b> of a composite film formed of a resin substrate <b>22</b> <i>a </i>of a non-heat-decaying resin and a heat-decaying material layer <b>22</b> <i>b</i>, and a circuit pattern-forming metal layer <b>23</b> formed on the surface of the sheet <b>22</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref> <i>b</i>), the adhesive sheet <b>22</b> has a laminate structure of the resin substrate <b>22</b> <i>a </i>and the heat-decaying resin layer <b>22</b> <i>b</i>, and the metal layer <b>23</b> is formed on the surface of the heat-decaying resin layer <b>22</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0424">For the transfer sheet <b>21</b> for circuit formation of the invention, the composite film is not limited to the above-mentioned laminate structure. As in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref> <i>c</i>), the sheet <b>21</b> may comprise an adhesive sheet <b>22</b> <i>c </i>formed of a mixture of different types of resin material including a heat-decaying resin, and a circuit pattern-forming metal layer <b>23</b> is formed on the surface of the sheet <b>22</b> <i>c</i>. The resin mixture for the adhesive sheet <b>22</b> <i>c </i>may be a mixture of a heat-decaying resin and a non-heat-decaying resin. Regarding the mixing condition in this, a heat-decaying resin composition and a non-heat-decaying resin composition may be mixed to form a mixture condition; or a heat-decaying resin and a non-heat-decaying resin may be mixed to form separated phases. In this, the phase separation is caused by the light irradiation or the heat treatment of the solution of a heat-decaying resin composition and a non-heat-decaying resin composition in a solvent, and, as a result, the adhesive sheet may have, for example, a large number of isolated small masses of the heat-decaying resin in the matrix (phase) of the non-heat-decaying resin. Apart from it, even when a cured powdery heat-decaying resin is mixed with a non-heat-decaying resin and formed into a sheet, then the resulting adhesive sheet may also have the same structure as above. Further, the composite film may comprise a mixture of different types of heat-decaying resins that differ in point of the heat-decaying temperature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0014">(Resin to Constitute Adhesive Sheet)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0425">For rapidly decaying the above-mentioned heat-decaying resin or the heat-decaying resin layer, it must be heated generally at 250 to 400° C. However, when circuit boards are exposed to a high temperatures for a long period of time, then it may have some negative influences on the properties of the circuit boards. For it, in addition, a large-scale device is needed. On the other hand, when the layer peeling is attained by the pressure of the vapor to be generated through the decomposition of the heat-decaying resin as will be described hereinunder, it is desirable to use a heat-decaying resin capable of rapidly decaying at a possibly lower temperature. Further, as will be also described hereinunder, the acceptable heating temperature in production of electronic parts is often a relatively low temperature of 200° C. or lower.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0426">Given that situation, we the present inventors have assiduously studied various heat-decaying materials that have heretofore been known to be able to decay at relatively low temperatures and, as a result, have found that the heat-decaying resin of the invention is effective. Of the heat-decaying resin of the invention, we have further found that the resin prepared by crosslinking a crosslinkable silyl group-having polyoxyalkylene resin can rapidly decay when heated at 150 to 170° C., and, in addition, it has good adhesiveness to materials of a broad range such as metals and resins, and moreover, when it is shaped into sheets, the resulting sheets have a suitable sheet strength.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0427">The details of the resin prepared by crosslinking a crosslinkable silyl group-having polyoxyalkylene resin are the same as those described in detail hereinabove for the above-mentioned conductive particles transfer sheet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0428">When the adhesive sheet <b>22</b> comprises a mixture of a heat-decaying resin and a non-heat-decaying resin, for example, when it comprises a mixture with any of the above-mentioned heat-decaying resin, then the proportion of the heat-decaying resin to the heat-decaying resin-containing resin composition is not specifically defined, but is preferably at least 10% by weight.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0429">When the heat-decaying resin is the principal component of the adhesive sheet <b>22</b> and when it accounts for a major part of the sheet, then the adhesive sheet may be substantially decayed by heating. In addition, even when the content of the heat-decaying resin in the adhesive sheet is such that the adhesive sheet is not entirely decayed, the vapor generated through decomposition of the heat-decaying resin may act to peel at least a part of the adhesive face of the adhesive sheet from the circuit pattern to thereby lower the adhesiveness therebetween, so far as the proportion of the heat-decaying resin is at least 10% by weight, and even in this case, therefore, the adhesive sheet could be readily peeled.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0430">In order that the vapor generated through decomposition of the heat-decaying resin may act to peel at least a part of the adhesive face of the adhesive sheet from the circuit pattern to thereby lower the adhesiveness therebetween, it is desirable that the heat-decaying resin-containing resin composition further contains a crosslinkable resin composition capable of crosslinking through energy stimulation applied thereto, for example, through exposure to light, electron rays or ion beams.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0431">When some energy stimulation is applied to the adhesive sheet before the heat-decaying resin is decomposed to give a vapor and when the crosslinkable resin component is thereby crosslinked, then the adhesive sheet may be entirely cured and it may release more efficiently the vapor generated through the decomposition of the heat-decaying resin, and as a result, the adhesive sheet may be more readily peeled.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0432">The proportion of the crosslinkable resin component to be in the heat-decaying resin-containing resin composition is not specifically defined, but is preferably at least 30% by weight of the composition. If the ratio of the crosslinkable resin component is less than 30% by weight, then the entire adhesive sheet could not be sufficiently cured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0433">Not specifically defined, the crosslinkable resin component that may crosslink through energy stimulation applied thereto is, for example, a photocurable adhesive that comprises a polymerizable polymer of an alkyl acrylate and/or an alkyl methacrylate having a radical-polymerizable unsaturated bond in the molecule, and a radical-polymerizable polyfunctional oligomer or monomer, as the principal ingredients thereof, and optionally contains a photopolymerization initiator; or a thermosetting adhesive that comprises a polymerizable polymer of an alkyl acrylate and/or an alkyl methacrylate having a radical-polymerizable unsaturated bond in the molecule, and a radical-polymerizable polyfunctional oligomer or monomer, as the principal ingredients thereof, and optionally contains a thermal polymerization initiator.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0434">The post-curable adhesive such as the photocurable adhesive or thermosetting adhesive of the type may uniformly and rapidly polymerizes and cures as a whole of the adhesive through exposure to light or heat, thereby giving an integrated cured body. Accordingly, the elastic modulus of the polymerized and cured body of the adhesive extremely increases and the adhesive force thereof greatly lowers. In addition, when the heat-decaying resin is decomposed to generate a vapor in the hard cured body, then a major part of the generated vapor is let outside, and the thus-released vapor acts to peel at least a part of the adhesive face from the adhered object, thereby lowering the adhesiveness therebetween.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0435">The polymerizable polymer may be obtained, for example, by previously preparing a (meth)acrylic polymer having a functional group in the molecule (hereinunder referred to as “functional group-containing (meth)acrylic polymer”), followed by reacting it with a compound having a functional group capable of reacting with the above-mentioned functional group, and a radical-polymerizable unsaturated bond in the molecule (hereinunder referred to as “functional group-having unsaturated compound”).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0436">The functional group-containing (meth) acrylic polymer is a polymer that is adhesive at room temperature, and it may be obtained through ordinary copolymerization of a main monomer, alkyl acrylate and/or alkyl methacrylate in which the alkyl-group generally has from 2 to 18 carbon atoms, with a functional group-containing monomer and optionally with any other modifying monomer copolymerizable with them, like ordinary (meth)acrylic polymers. The functional group-containing (meth)acrylic polymer may have a weight-average molecular weight of generally from 200,000 to 2,000,000 or so.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0437">The functional group-containing monomer includes, for example, carboxyl group-having monomers such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid; hydroxyl group-having monomers such as hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate; epoxy group-having monomers such as glycidyl acrylate, glycidyl methacrylate; isocyanate group-having monomers such as isocyanatoethyl acrylate, isocyanatoethyl methacrylate; amino group-having monomers such as aminoethyl acrylate, aminoethyl methacrylate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0438">The other copolymerizable modifying monomer is, for example, various monomers used for ordinary (meth)acrylic polymers, such as vinyl acetate, acrylonitrile, styrene.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0439">The functional group-containing unsaturated compound to be reacted with the functional group-containing (meth)acrylic polymer may be selected from those mentioned hereinabove for the functional group-containing monomers in accordance with the functional group of the functional group-containing (meth) acrylic polymer. For example, when the functional group of the functional group-containing (meth)acrylic polymer is a carboxyl group, then epoxy group-having monomers and isocyanate group-having monomers may be used for it; when the functional group is a hydroxyl group, then isocyanate group-having monomers may be used; when the functional group is an epoxy group, then carboxyl group-having monomers and amido group-having monomers such as acrylamide may be used; and when the functional group is an amino group, then epoxy group-having monomers may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0440">The polyfunctional oligomer or monomer preferably has a molecular weight of at most 10,000. More preferably, it has a molecular weight of at most 5,000 and has from 2 to 20 radical-polymerizable unsaturated bonds in the molecule, for more efficient three-dimensional network formation through heating or exposure to light. Such more preferred examples of the polyfunctional oligomer or monomer are, for example, trimethylolpropane triacrylate, tetramethylolmethane tetraacrylate, pentaerythritol triacrylate, pentaerythritol tetraacrylate, dipentaerythritol monohydroxypentaacrylate, dipentaerythritol hexaacrylate, and methacrylates corresponding to these. In addition, also preferred are 1,4-butylene glycol diacrylate, 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate, polyethylene glycol diacrylate, commercially-available oligoester acrylates, and methacrylates corresponding to these. One or more of these polyfunctional oligomers and monomers may be used herein either singly or as combined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0441">The photopolymerization initiator is, for example, one capable of being activated when exposed to light having a wavelength of from 250 to 800 nm. The photopolymerization initiator of the type includes, for example, acetophenone derivative compounds such as methoxyacetophenone; benzoin ether compounds such as benzoin isopropyl ether, benzoin isobutyl ether; ketal derivative compounds such as benzyldimethyl ketal, acetophenonediethyl ketal; phosphine oxide derivative compounds; and photoradical polymerization initiators such as bis(η5-cyclopentadienyl)titanocene derivative compounds, benzophenone, Michler's ketone, chlorothioxanthone, dodecylthioxanthone, dimehtylthioxanthone, diethylthioxanthone, α-hydroxycyclohexylphenyl ketone, 2-hydroxymethylphenylpropane. One or more these photopolymerization initiators may be used herein either singly or as combined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0442">The thermal polymerization initiator is one that decomposes under heat and generates an active radical for initiating polymerization and curing. For example, it includes dicumylperoxide, di-t-butylperoxide, t-butylperoxybenzoate, t-butylhydroperoxide, benzoyl peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide, diisopropylbenzene hydroperoxide, paramenthane hydroperoxide, di-t-butyl peroxide. Of those, preferred are cumeme hydroperoxide, paramenthane hydroperoxide and di-t-butyl peroxide, as their thermal decomposition temperature is high. Some such thermal polymerization initiators are commercially available, and are usable herein with no specific limitation. For example, preferred are Perbutyl D, Perbutyl H, Perbutyl P, Permenta H (all by Nippon Yushi). One or more of these thermal polymerization initiators may be used herein either singly or as combined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0015">(Metal Layer to From Circuit Pattern)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0443">Preferably, the circuit pattern to be formed on the surface of the adhesive sheet is formed of, for example, metal foil or conductive paste layer. Not specifically defined, the metal foil may be foil of metal suitable for circuit pattern formation and is, for example, foil of high-melting-point metal such as tungsten, molybdenum; low-resistance metal such as gold, silver, copper, aluminium; or alloy containing at least one such low-resistance metal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0444">Preferably, the lowermost limit of the thickness of the metal foil is 1 μm, and the uppermost limit thereof is 100 μm. If smaller than 1 μm, then the resistivity of the circuit pattern to be formed of the metal foil may be high and the circuit boards produced may be unsuitable. If larger than 100 μm, then an insulating substrate or a ceramic-green sheet may deform greatly when the metal foil is laminated thereon in producing circuit boards that will be mentioned hereinunder, and, in addition, when the circuit pattern formed of the metal foil is transferred onto an insulating substrate or a ceramic green sheet, the buried amount of the circuit pattern may increase and the degree of deformation of the insulating substrate or the ceramic green sheet may increase. As a result, this may cause a problem in that the insulating substrate or the ceramic green sheet may be readily deformed when the resin is cured. Moreover, when the metal foil is etched to form a circuit pattern, the etching may be difficult, and this may cause another problem in that a micropatterned circuit is difficult to form with accuracy. More preferably, the lowermost limit of the thickness is 5 μm, and the uppermost limit thereof is 50 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0445">The surface of the metal foil that is to be on the side of the adhesive sheet may be roughened to have fine irregularities in order to increase the adhesiveness thereof to the adhesive sheet. For example, the surface of the metal foil may be roughened to have fine irregularities of from 0.2 to 0.7 μm or so in terms of the surface roughness Ra defined by JIS B0601. The other surface of the metal foil opposite to the adhesive sheet side may also be roughened in the same manner to have fine irregularities, whereby the bonding force between the insulating substrate or ceramic green sheet and the circuit pattern may be increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0446">The conductive paste layer is, for example, a layer of a resin paste prepared by adding conductive fine particles, such as noble metal particles of gold, silver or copper, or solder particles or metal-plated resin particles, to a binder resin, or a layer of a metal paste of cream solder or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0447">The circuit pattern-having metal layer <b>23</b> is formed according to a patterning screen-printing method of processing the metal foil adhered to the adhesive sheet <b>22</b>, or according to a plating method. The method of forming a circuit pattern by patterning the metal foil is not specifically defined, and for example, a known resist method is employed for it. The resist method comprises applying a photoresist onto the entire surface of the metal foil, exposing it to light via a mask of a predetermined pattern, developing it, and then etching it in a mode of plasma etching or chemical etching to thereby remove the metal foil in the non-pattern region (the region from which the photoresist is removed). Accordingly, the intended circuit pattern of the metal foil is formed. Another method is also employable, which comprises applying a photoresist to the surface of metal foil in a predetermined circuit pattern form according to a screen printing process or the like, then exposing it to light in the same manner as above and thereafter etching it to form the intended circuit pattern. After the etching, some resist may remain on the circuit pattern, but it may be removed with a resist remover, and the resulting circuit pattern is thereby cleaned. Accordingly, a transfer sheet for circuit formation is thus obtained, which has a circuit pattern formed on the surface of an adhesive sheet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0448">For patterning the conductive paste layer to form a circuit pattern, for example, employable is a method of baking the conductive paste layer and then processing it in the same manner as in the above-mentioned case of processing metal foil. Another method is also employable, which comprises screen-printing a conductive paste on a substrate, baking it to form a circuit pattern, and attaching the above-mentioned adhesive sheet to it to thereby form a circuit pattern of the conductive paste layer on the adhesive sheet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0449">Still another method may be employed, which comprises forming grooves corresponding to the circuit pattern on the surface of the adhesive sheet, and filling the grooves with a conductive paste by the use of a squeeze to thereby form a circuit pattern of the conductive paste on the adhesive sheet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0450">As mentioned hereinabove, the transfer sheet for circuit formation that comprises the heat-decaying material of the invention has an adhesive sheet that comprises a heat-decaying resin capable of decomposing under heat or comprises a composite film containing such a heat-decaying resin, and therefore, when this is used for circuit transfer, the adhesive sheet decays, or its adhesive force lowers owing to the vapor generated through decomposition of the heat-decaying resin that constitutes the adhesive sheet and, as a result, the intended circuit pattern can be well transferred onto an insulating resin or a ceramic green sheet with no pattern disturbance even when the adhesive sheet has a high adhesive force. In addition, even when a circuit pattern having an extremely narrow line width is transferred, it can be well transferred with high accuracy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0451">The transfer sheet for circuit formation may optionally have metal foil or conductive paste layer formed on the surface of the adhesive sheet thereof. The metal foil or the conductive paste layer is not patterned into a form of circuit pattern.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0016">(Production of Circuit Board)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0452">Using the transfer sheet for circuit formation as above, a circuit board is produced. This is described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> includes cross-sectional views of a process scheme of using the transfer sheet for circuit formation of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref> <i>a</i>); and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> includes cross-sectional views of a process scheme of using the transfer sheet for circuit formation of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref> <i>b</i>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0453">As in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref> <i>a</i>), a transfer sheet <b>21</b> that comprises an adhesive sheet <b>22</b> and a circuit pattern-forming metal layer <b>23</b> on the surface thereof is prepared in the manner as above, and this is positioned to an insulating substrate <b>24</b> which is in a semi-cured condition, and then the two are bonded to each other. In this, the insulating substrate <b>24</b> is a substrate having insulating properties as will be described hereinunder. For bonding the two, for example, a pressure of 100 kg/cm<sup>2 </sup>or so is applied to the two, whereby a part or all of the metal layer <b>23</b> is embedded and fixed in the insulating substrate <b>24</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0454">In this, the method of pressure-bonding the transfer sheet <b>1</b> for circuit formation and the insulating substrate <b>24</b> is not specifically defined. For example, herein employable is a method of bonding the two owing to the anchor effect by pressing; and a method of applying an adhesive to the insulating substrate and/or the circuit pattern of the transfer sheet for circuit formation, followed by bonding the two. In particular, when the transfer sheet is pressure-bonded to the insulating substrate of a semi-cured thermosetting resin, preferred is a method of thermally pressing the two at a suitable temperature. This is because, according to the method, a part or all of the thermosetting resin may be cured to have an increased adhesive force, and it evades troubles of circuit pattern mispositioning or transfer failure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0455">Next, this is subjected to heat treatment at a relatively low temperature falling between 150° C. and 170° C. in a nitrogen atmosphere. Through the heat treatment, the adhesive sheet <b>22</b> pyrolyzes, vaporizes and decays. Thus, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref> <i>b</i>), a single-layered circuit board is formed, which has the circuit pattern-having metal layer <b>23</b> transferred onto the insulating substrate <b>24</b>. Further, if desired, the insulating substrate <b>24</b> may be completely cured at a temperature falling between 250 and 300° C. A multi-layered circuit board may be formed by laminating these single-layered circuit boards.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0456">Similarly, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref> <i>a</i>), a transfer sheet <b>21</b> for circuit formation is prepared in the manner as above, which comprises a laminate-structured adhesive sheet <b>22</b> of a composite film comprising a resin substrate <b>22</b> <i>a </i>and a heat-decaying resin layer <b>22</b> <i>b</i>, and a metal layer <b>23</b> formed on the surface of the heat-decaying resin layer <b>22</b> <i>b</i>. Like in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the transfer sheet <b>21</b> is positioned to an insulating substrate <b>24</b> which is in a semi-cured condition, and then the two are bonded to each other under heat and pressure. In that manner, a part or all of the metal layer <b>23</b> is embedded and fixed in the insulating substrate <b>24</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0457">Next, this is subjected to heat treatment at a temperature around 250° C. or so in a nitrogen atmosphere. Through the heat treatment, the heat-decaying resin layer <b>22</b> <i>b </i>to form the adhesive sheet <b>22</b> pyrolyzes and decays. Thus, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref> <i>b</i>), the resin substrate <b>22</b> <i>a </i>is lifted off though the pyrolysis of the heat-decaying resin layer <b>22</b> <i>b</i>, and this is completely separated from the metal layer <b>23</b>. In the heat-treatment, the insulating substrate <b>24</b> completely cures at the same time. Thus, a single-layered circuit board is formed, which has the circuit pattern-having metal layer <b>23</b> transferred onto the insulating substrate <b>24</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0458">Though not shown in the drawings, when a composite film of a mixture of a heat-decaying resin and a non-heat-decaying resin is used for the adhesive sheet <b>22</b> <i>c </i>as so mentioned hereinabove, then the adhesive sheet <b>22</b> greatly shrinks and completely peels from the metal layer <b>23</b> since the heat-decaying resin in the adhesive sheet <b>22</b> pyrolyzes and decays through the heat treatment at about 250° C. In a different case, the adhesive force of the adhesive sheet <b>22</b> <i>c </i>greatly lowers owing to the vapor generated through the decomposition of the heat-decaying resin, and the sheet <b>22</b> <i>c </i>peels from the metal layer <b>23</b>. Also in this case, the circuit pattern-having metal layer <b>23</b> is transferred onto the insulating substrate <b>24</b>, and a single-layered circuit board is readily formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0459">In the production of circuit boards mentioned above, the insulating substrate <b>24</b> is formed of an ordinary thermosetting resin or a ceramic green sheet.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0464">For producing the insulating substrate, a thermosetting resin or a slurry containing a thermosetting resin and an inorganic filler is shaped into a sheet according to a doctor blade method or the like, and then it is heated to be in a semi-cured condition.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0466">The ceramic green sheet may be produced, for example, by shaping a mixture of a ceramic powder of alumina or the like, a binder resin and a plasticizer, into a sheet.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0468">For the production of circuit boards mentioned above, a first method of producing circuit boards comprises using the transfer sheet for circuit formation mentioned above. The method includes a step of pressure-bonding an insulating substrate or a ceramic green sheet onto the circuit pattern of the above-mentioned transfer sheet for circuit formation and attaching or embedding the circuit pattern into the insulating substrate of the ceramic green sheet, and a step of decomposing the heat-decaying resin by heating thereby to decay or deform the adhesive sheet and to transfer the circuit pattern onto the insulating substrate or the ceramic green sheet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0469">In the above-mentioned step, when the adhesive sheet is formed of a heat-decaying resin or the adhesive sheet is formed of a resin composition comprising the heat-decaying resin as the principal ingredient thereof, then the adhesive sheet is substantially decayed by heating. Accordingly, the process does not require a step of peeling the adhesive sheet from the circuit pattern, and its production efficiency (producibility) and workability may be thereby improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0470">On the other hand, even when the adhesive sheet does not decay by heating, the adhesive force of the adhesive sheet is reduced by the vapor generated through decomposition of the heat-decaying resin, and therefore the adhesive sheet could be readily peeled from the circuit pattern.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0471">Further, when the adhesive sheet contains a crosslinkable resin component capable of crosslinking through energy stimulation applied thereto, then it is desirable that some energy stimulation is applied to the sheet so as to crosslink the crosslinkable resin component before the sheet is heated to decompose the heat-decaying resin therein. The adhesive force of the adhesive sheet could be greatly lowered, and the adhesive sheet could be more readily peeled from the circuit pattern. When the adhesive sheet is formed of a composite film as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref> <i>c</i>), then the heat-decaying resin polymerizes owing to the crosslinkable resin component capable of crosslinking through exposure to light, and it readily undergoes phase separation in the matrix (phase) mentioned above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0472">In the above-mentioned step, when a crosslinked resin of the above-mentioned crosslinkable silyl group-having polyoxyalkylene resin is used for the heat-decaying resin, then the heat-decaying resin may be decomposed by heating at 150 to 170° C. The crosslinked resin of the above-mentioned crosslinkable silyl group-having polyoxyalkylene resin can be rapidly decomposed in an oxygen atmosphere even at a relatively low temperature. Accordingly, the decomposition time for the heat-decaying resin can be controlled by controlling the oxygen concentration in the heating atmosphere gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0473">For the production of circuit boards mentioned above, a second method of producing circuit boards comprises using the transfer sheet for circuit formation mentioned above. The method includes a step of forming a circuit pattern by patterning the metal foil or the conductive paste layer of the transfer sheet for circuit formation, a step of pressure-bonding an insulating substrate or a ceramic green sheet onto the circuit pattern and attaching or embedding the circuit pattern into the insulating substrate of the ceramic green sheet, and a step of decomposing the heat-decaying resin by heating thereby to decay or deform the adhesive sheet and to transfer the circuit pattern onto the insulating substrate or the ceramic green sheet. Accordingly, the production method includes the step of forming a circuit pattern by patterning the metal foil or the conductive paste layer of the transfer sheet for circuit formation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0474">While the circuit pattern formed of a conductive paste layer is kept pressure-bonded to the insulating substrate or the ceramic green sheet, they may be heated so as to decay or deform the adhesive sheet and to transfer the circuit pattern formed of a conductive paste layer onto the insulating substrate or the ceramic green sheet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0475">In this method of producing circuit boards, the step of pressure-bonding the insulating substrate or the like onto the circuit pattern and attaching or embedding the circuit pattern into the insulating substrate, and the step of decomposing the heat-decaying resin by heating thereby to transfer the circuit pattern onto the insulating substrate or the ceramic green sheet may be the same as those in the above-mentioned first method for producing circuit boards.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0476">According to the second method of producing circuit boards mentioned above, a transfer sheet for circuit formation that contains the above-mentioned heat-decaying resin is used, and therefore, even when the adhesive sheet has a high adhesive force, the circuit pattern can be well transferred onto the insulating resin or the like with no pattern disturbance. In addition, even when a circuit pattern having an extremely narrow line width is transferred at high density, it can be well transferred with high accuracy.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0477">In addition, the method does not require any additional step of reducing the adhesive force of the adhesive sheet, but requires only the step of heating the adhesive sheet to decay or peel the adhesive sheet. Therefore, the production efficiency (producibility) and the workability of the method may be significantly improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0017">[Pattern Formation]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0478">The heat-decaying material of the invention is effective for pattern formation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0479">Embodiments of a method of pattern formation by the use of the heat-decaying material of the invention are described below with reference to the drawings.</div>
<heading>First Embodiment of Pattern Formation</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0480">A first embodiment of pattern formation by the use of the heat-decaying material of the invention is described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> includes cross-sectional views of a process scheme that comprises patterning of an etching mask by the use of the heat-decaying resin film mentioned above, and patterning an insulator film via the mask for pattern formation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0481">In this, for forming the heat-decaying resin film, used is, for example, a decaying resin coating solution prepared by dissolving a crosslinkable silyl group-having polyoxypropylene resin and a diacylphosphine oxide compound in a solvent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0482">As in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(</figref> <i>a</i>), an insulator film <b>32</b> of silicon oxide is deposited on a semiconductor substrate <b>31</b> with various semiconductor elements (not shown) formed thereon, and the above-mentioned decaying resin coating solution is applied onto the insulator film <b>32</b> in a mode of spin coating. Then, after the spin coating, this is pre-baked at a temperature not higher than 100° C. to vaporize the unnecessary solvent. In that manner, a heat-decaying resin film <b>33</b> having a thickness of 1 μm or so is formed. In this, the coating operation may be effected under irradiation with ordinary fluorescent light. As opposed to this, the coating step in conventional photolithography requires a special working room capable of completely blocking UV light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0483">Next, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(</figref> <i>b</i>), using a carbon dioxide gas laser as a light source in a direct-patterning process, this is exposed to laser beams <b>34</b> of high energy density within a short period of time. The laser beams <b>34</b> are heat beams, and give heat energy to the heat-decaying resin film <b>33</b> whereby the irradiated region of the film is heated up to 200° C. to 250° C. or so. By the heat energy applied thereto, the irradiated region of the heat-decaying resin film <b>33</b> is pyrolyzed and decayed. In that manner, the heat-decaying resin film <b>33</b> is patterned to form an etching mask <b>35</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0484">As opposed to this, in conventional resist films, the functional group in the resist is sensitive to the light in the direct-patterning process, and the base resin of the resist is therefore changed through exposure to light. Specifically, the copolymerization of the base resin is cleaved (in positive resists) or the polymerization is promoted (in negative resists). In that manner, the base resin having changed through exposure to light is dissolved in the next developing step to attain pattern formation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0485">Accordingly, the first embodiment of the method of pattern formation by the use of the heat-decaying material of the invention does not require the development step as in conventional photolithography, and therefore enables significant cost reduction in pattern formation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0486">Next, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(</figref> <i>c</i>), this is entirely exposed to light <b>36</b>, whereby the composition that constitutes the patterned heat-decaying resin film <b>33</b> for the etching mask <b>35</b> is crosslinked and photocured to form an etching mask <b>35</b> <i>a</i>. Not specifically defined, the light source usable for the light irradiation may be any one that covers a wavelength range in which the polyoxyalkylene resin composition is sensitive to the light and begins to cure. For example, it includes low-pressure mercury lamp, middle-pressure mercury lamp, high-pressure mercury lamp, ultra-high-pressure mercury lamp, excimer laser, chemical lamp, black light lamp, microwave-excited mercury lamp, metal halide lamp, sodium lamp, halogen lamp, xenon lamp, fluorescent lamp, sunlight, electron beam radiator. One or more of these light sources may be used herein either singly or as combined. The etching mask <b>35</b> <i>a </i>thus formed from the etching mask through exposure to light may have improved dry-etching resistance that will be mentioned below, and may well function as a dry-etching mask.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0487">Next, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(</figref> <i>d</i>), the insulator film <b>32</b> is dry-etched with plasma, via the etching mask <b>35</b> <i>a</i>. Thus, an opening <b>37</b> is formed in the insulator film <b>32</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0488">Next, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(</figref> <i>e</i>), in an oxygen atmosphere or a nitrogen atmosphere, this is subjected to heat treatment at a temperature falling between 150° C. and 250° C. or so in the former or at a temperature falling between 200° C. and 250° C. or so in the latter. Through the heat treatment, the etching mask <b>35</b> <i>a </i>formed of the heat-decaying resin is pyrolyzed and is completely decayed and removed. In this, the atmosphere for the heat treatment may be dry air. In that manner, a pattern of the insulator film <b>32</b> having the opening <b>37</b> is formed on the semiconductor substrate <b>31</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0489">Regarding the device to be used for it, the removal of the etching mask <b>35</b> <i>a </i>in the first embodiment of the method of pattern formation may be attained in a simple oven, as compared with the ashing removal in plasma in the prior art, and, in addition, the removal method is extremely simple. Accordingly, since the removal of the etching mask after used is extremely simple, and the cost of pattern formation can be greatly reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0490">In addition, when the heating is effected under reduced pressure, then the removal may be effected more efficiently.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0491">In the above-mentioned embodiment, electron beams may be used in place of the laser beams for the thermal energy impartation. As the laser source, further usable herein are UV laser light source, and excimer laser light source.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0492">The heat-decaying resin to be used for the above-mentioned pattern formation includes, for example, polymethylenemalonic acid diesters, polybutylene, nitrocellulose, α-methylstyrene polymer, propylene carbonate polymer, polyalkyl (meth)acrylates, copolymers of carboxylic acid dihydrazides and diisocyanates, peroxides of these polymers, as well as tackified compositions of such polymers optionally containing a plasticizer such as dibutyl phthalate or dioctyl phthalate or a softener such as xylene oil, terpene oil or paraffin wax added thereto. In addition, polybutene and polylauryl methacrylate may also be used as the heat-decaying resin.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0493">However, it is desirable to use the heat-decaying material as defined in the invention. Further, among them, we the present inventors have found that the heat-decaying resin film prepared by crosslinking a crosslinkable silyl group-having polyoxyalkylene resin composition can be rapidly decayed when heated at 150 to 260° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0494">The heat-decaying resin prepared by crosslinking a crosslinkable silyl group-having polyoxyalkylene resin composition may be the same as those described in detail in the section of the conductive particles transfer sheet.</div>
<heading>Second Embodiment of Pattern Formation</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0495">A second embodiment of pattern formation by the use of the heat-decaying material of the invention is described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> includes cross-sectional views of a process scheme that comprises patterning of a lift-off mask by the use of the heat-decaying resin film mentioned above, and patterning of a conductor film for wiring by the use of it. In this, the same elements as those in the first embodiment are indicated by the same reference numerals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0496">Also in this embodiment, for forming the heat-decaying resin film, used is a decaying resin coating solution prepared by dissolving the above-mentioned, crosslinkable silyl group-having polyoxypropylene resin and a diacylphosphine oxide compound in a solvent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0497">Like in the first embodiment but as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12(</figref> <i>a</i>), a silicon oxide insulator film <b>32</b> is deposited on a semiconductor substrate <b>31</b>, and the above-mentioned decaying resin coating solution is applied onto the insulator film <b>32</b> in a mode of spin coating. Then, after the spin coating, this is pre-baked at a temperature of 80° C. or so to vaporize the unnecessary solvent. In that manner, a heat-decaying resin film <b>33</b> having a thickness of 1.5 μm or so is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0498">Next, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12(</figref> <i>b</i>), this is exposed to heat beams or laser beams <b>34</b> according to a direct-patterning process. In this, YAG laser is used for the light source. Heat energy is thus imparted to the heat-decaying resin film <b>33</b> and the irradiated region of the film is thereby heated at 200° C. or so. In that manner, heat may concentrate and remain in the surface of the insulator film <b>32</b> formed of silicon oxide of poor thermal conductivity, and therefore the heat-decaying resin film <b>33</b> nearer to the insulator film <b>32</b> is more readily pyrolyzed. Accordingly, a lift-off mask <b>39</b> having a lift-off opening <b>38</b> is formed as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12(</figref> <i>b</i>), in which the opening <b>38</b> has a reverse-tapered cross-sectional profile.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0499">Also in this case, the formation of the lift-off mask <b>39</b> having the lift-off opening <b>38</b> does not require at all the development step as in conventional photolithography, like in the first embodiment. Accordingly, the pattern formation in this embodiment enables significant cost reduction, as so mentioned hereinabove.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0500">Nest, like in the first embodiment but as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12(</figref> <i>c</i>), this is entirely exposed to light <b>36</b>, whereby the heat-decaying resin film <b>33</b> patterned for the lift-off mask <b>39</b> is crosslinked and photocured to form lift-off mask <b>39</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0501">Next, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12(</figref> <i>d</i>), a conductor film <b>310</b> of tungsten (W) or the like, for example, having a thickness of 0.5 μm or so is formed on the lift-off mask <b>39</b> <i>a </i>in a mode of sputtering film formation. In this, preferred is a collimate-sputtering process excellent in rectilinear deposition. In that manner, since the lift-off mask <b>39</b> <i>a </i>has a reversed taper form, the conductor film <b>310</b> deposited on the lift-off mask <b>39</b> <i>a </i>and the conductor film deposited inside the lift-off opening <b>38</b> to be a wiring <b>311</b> can be separated from each other as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12(</figref> <i>d</i>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0502">Next, in an oxygen atmosphere or a nitrogen atmosphere, this is subjected to heat treatment at a temperature of 200° C. or so in the former or at a temperature of 250° C. or so in the latter. Through the heat treatment, the lift-off mask <b>38</b> <i>a </i>formed of the heat-decaying resin is pyrolyzed and decayed, and the conductor film <b>310</b> on the lift-off mask <b>39</b> <i>a </i>can be thereby lifted off and removed. According to the lift-off process of the invention, a wiring <b>311</b> may be formed on the insulator film <b>32</b> on the semiconductor substrate <b>31</b>, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12(</figref> <i>e</i>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0503">In conventional lift-off technology, the life-off mask is formed of a resist film, and in the lift-off step, the lift-off mask formed of a resist film is dissolved in a chemical of an organic solvent and removed. Through the dissolution and removal of the lift-off mask, the conductor film deposited on the lift-off mask is lifted off and removed, and wiring is thereby formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0504">In this embodiment 2, the chemical as in the conventional lift-off step is not used, and therefore, the lift-off operation is safe and its operability is improved. In addition, the pattern formation cost is thereby reduced. When the quantity of light of YAG laser is varied, then the reversed taper could not be formed but the lift-off operation is still possible.</div>
<heading>Third Embodiment of Pattern Formation</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0505">A third embodiment of pattern formation by the use of the heat-decaying material of the invention is described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> each include cross-sectional views of a process scheme that comprises patterning of an etching mask by the use of the heat-decaying resin film mentioned above, and patterning of a semiconductor film by the use of it. In this, the same elements as those in the first embodiment are indicated by the same reference numerals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0506">Also in this embodiment, for forming the heat-decaying resin film, used is a decaying resin coating solution prepared by dissolving the above-mentioned, crosslinkable silyl group-having polyoxypropylene resin and a diacylphosphine oxide compound in a solvent, like in the first and second embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0507">As in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13(</figref> <i>a</i>), a thermal oxide film (not shown) is formed on the surface of a semiconductor substrate <b>31</b>, and a semiconductor thin film <b>312</b> of a polycrystalline silicon film or the like is deposited on the thermal oxide film, and the above-mentioned decaying resin coating solution is applied onto the semiconductor thin film <b>312</b> in a mode of spin coating. Then, after the spin coating, this is pre-baked at a temperature of 80° C. or so to vaporize the unnecessary solvent. In that manner, a heat-decaying resin film <b>33</b> having a thickness of 1 μm or so is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0508">Next, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13(</figref> <i>b</i>), this is exposed to light in the same manner as in conventional photolithography. Concretely, using a reticle <b>315</b> that comprises a quartz glass substrate <b>313</b> and a light-shielding film pattern <b>314</b> formed on its surface, as a photomask, light for exposure <b>316</b> is applied to this in a mode of ordinary reduced projection exposure and the heat-decaying resin film <b>33</b> is thereby patterned through exposure transfer. In that manner, a photocured region <b>33</b> <i>a </i>is formed in a predetermined area of the heat-decaying resin film <b>33</b>. In this, ArF excimer layer (wavelength: about 193 nm) is used for the light for exposure <b>316</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0509">Next, in an oxygen atmosphere, this is subjected to heat treatment at a temperature of 150° C. or so. Through the heat treatment, the heat-decaying resin in the region except the photocurable region <b>33</b> <i>a </i>of the heat-decaying resin <b>33</b> is pyrolyzed and completely decayed. However, the photocurable region <b>33</b> <i>a </i>of the heat-decaying resin film <b>33</b> does not pyrolyze at the above-mentioned temperature of 150° C. or so, but remains to exist as it is. In that manner, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13(</figref> <i>c</i>), the heat-decaying resin film <b>33</b> is patterned to form an etching mask <b>317</b> on the semiconductor film <b>312</b>. In this, one important matter is that the above-mentioned temperature for heat treatment is so designed as to be higher than the temperature at which the heat-decaying resin film <b>33</b> in the region not irradiated with the light <b>316</b> decomposes and decays, but lower than the temperature at which the heat-decaying resin film <b>33</b> in the region irradiated with the light <b>316</b>, or that is, the photocurable region <b>33</b> <i>a </i>thereof decomposes and decays.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0510">As opposed to this, in conventional patterning of resist films, the functional group in the resist is sensitive to light, and the base resin of the resist is therefore changed through exposure to light in the step of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16(</figref> <i>b</i>) as so mentioned hereinabove. Specifically, the copolymerization of the base resin is cleaved (in positive resists) or the polymerization is promoted (in negative resists). In that manner, the base resin having changed through exposure to light is dissolved in the next developing step to attain pattern formation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0511">Accordingly, this embodiment also does not require a development step as in conventional photolithography, and enables significant cost reduction in pattern formation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0512">Next, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14(</figref> <i>a</i>), the semiconductor thin film <b>312</b> is dry-etched with plasma, via the etching mask <b>317</b>. Thus, for example, a gate electrode <b>318</b> is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0513">Next, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14(</figref> <i>b</i>), in a nitrogen atmosphere, this is subjected to heat treatment at a temperature falling between 200° C. and 250° C. or so. Through the heat treatment, the etching mask <b>317</b> formed of the heat-decaying resin is pyrolyzed and is completely decayed and removed. In this, the atmosphere for the heat treatment may be dry air. In that manner, the gate electrode <b>318</b> is formed on the semiconductor substrate <b>31</b> through patterning of the semiconductor thin film <b>312</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0514">Also in this case, the removal of the etching mask <b>317</b> is extremely simple as compared with the ashing removal in plasma in the prior art, and this enables significant cost reduction in patterning.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0515">In this, a polypropylene glycol diacrylate-based photocurable resin may be added to the decaying resin coating solution for use herein. Accordingly, such a photo crosslinkable material is added to it, and the decay temperature T<b>1</b> in the exposed region can be selectively elevated over the decay temperature T<b>0</b> in the non-exposed region. With that, when the coating layer is heated at a temperature T (T<b>0</b>&lt;T&lt;T<b>1</b>), then the resist pattern can be more readily formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0516">After the patterning, this is heated at T (T&gt;T<b>1</b>), and the resist pattern can be removed.</div>
<heading>Fourth Embodiment of Pattern Formation</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0517">A fourth embodiment of pattern formation by the use of the heat-decaying material of the invention is described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> includes cross-sectional views of a process scheme that comprises patterning of a plating mask by the use of the heat-decaying resin film mentioned above, and patterning of a metal film for bumps by the use of it. In this, the same elements as those in the first embodiment are indicated by the same reference numerals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0518">Also in this embodiment, for forming the heat-decaying resin film, used is a decaying resin coating solution prepared by dissolving the above-mentioned, crosslinkable silyl group-having polyoxypropylene resin and a diacylphosphine oxide compound in a solvent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0519">As in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15(</figref> <i>a</i>), an insulator film <b>32</b> of silicon oxide is deposited on a semiconductor substrate with various semiconductor elements (not shown) formed thereon, and a thin Cu layer is formed on the insulator film <b>32</b> to be a feeder layer <b>319</b>, according to a sputtering process. Next, the above-mentioned, decaying resin coating solution is applied over this according to a spin-coating process, and a plating mask <b>321</b> having a plating opening <b>320</b> is formed in the same manner as that for the step of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11(</figref> <i>b</i>). Further, in the same manner as in the first embodiment, the plating mask <b>321</b> is entirely exposed to light, whereby the composition that constitutes the heat-decaying resin film to form the pattern of the plating mask <b>321</b> is crosslinked and photocured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0520">Next, this is plated in a plating bath filled with a plating solution that contains a divalent copper ion, for example, an aqueous solution of cupper sulfate having a copper ion content of from 5 to 200 g/liter or so. Through the plating treatment, a copper electrode <b>322</b> is formed to fill the plating opening <b>320</b>, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15(</figref> <i>b</i>). In this plating step, the photocured plating mask <b>321</b> does not swell in the plating bath and its pattern does not change.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0521">Next, this is subjected to heat treatment in a nitrogen atmosphere at a temperature falling between 200 and 250° C., as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15(</figref> <i>c</i>). Through the heat treatment, the plating mask <b>321</b> formed of the heat-decaying resin is pyrolyzed and completely decayed and removed. In this, the atmosphere for heat treatment may be dry air. In that manner, the metal film is patterned to give the copper electrode <b>322</b> formed on the insulator film <b>32</b> on the semiconductor substrate <b>31</b>. The thin feeder layer <b>319</b> is removed by dry etching or ion milling in the subsequent step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0522">The plating mask <b>321</b> formed of the heat-decaying resin may be applied entirely in the same manner as above also to gold (Au) plating except copper plating. Patterning the metal film in the manner as above enables formation of bumps or wirings on semiconductor chips.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0523">As described hereinabove, use of the plating mask formed of the heat-decaying material of the invention significantly reduces the patterning cost of metal films.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0524">The pattern formation by the use of the heat-decaying material of the invention is not limited to the above-mentioned embodiments, and the embodiments may be suitably changed and modified within the technical scope of the invention.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0597">A precursor containing an alkoxysilane and a heat-decaying material is a liquid composite material where the alkoxysilane has partially hydrolyzed and condensed, and the composite material is used as an SOG (spin-on-glass) coating solution to form an interlayer insulating film between wirings of a semiconductor device. This is described in detail with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes cross-sectional views of a process scheme of forming MOSFET on a semiconductor substrate to be processed, in which the porous material of the invention is applied to the interlayer insulating film in the two-layered wiring structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0598">As in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref> <i>a</i>), an element separation region <b>2</b> is selectively formed on a silicon substrate <b>1</b> according to a trench element separation process. Then, a gate insulating film <b>3</b> is formed; a gate silicon layer <b>4</b> is formed of a polycrystalline silicon containing an effective impurity such as phosphorus; and impurity diffusion layers <b>5</b> <i>a </i>and <b>5</b> <i>b </i>to be a source/drain region are formed through ion implantation followed by subsequent heat treatment. Next, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref> <i>b</i>), a spacer <b>3</b> <i>s </i>is formed of a silicon oxide film or the like, around the side wall of the gate silicon layer <b>4</b>. Next, a high-melting-point metal such as cobalt (Co) is deposited on the entire surface of the structure according to a sputtering process, then this is subjected to heat treatment to remove the unnecessary cobalt. As in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref> <i>c</i>), silicide layers <b>6</b> <i>g</i>, <b>6</b> <i>a </i>and <b>6</b> <i>b </i>are selectively formed on the gate silicon layer <b>4</b> and the impurity diffusion layers <b>5</b> <i>a </i>and <b>5</b> <i>b </i>to make a silicide structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0599">Next, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref> <i>d</i>), a first interlayer insulating film <b>7</b> is formed on the entire surface of the structure. Preferably, the first interlayer insulating film <b>7</b> is formed of a silicon oxide film through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and its surface is planarized through chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). Next, a first contact hole <b>9</b> is formed in the first interlayer insulating film <b>7</b>, and a first wiring <b>8</b> is formed of a metal such as tungsten (W). The thermal oxide film of silicon has a relative dielectric constant of 3.9, and the relative dielectric constant of the first interlayer insulating film <b>7</b> could be almost 4 or so though depending on the reaction gas used in CVD.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0600">After this, the above-mentioned SOG coating solution is applied onto the entire surface of the structure according to a spin-coating process at a rotation speed of from 1000 to 5000 rpm so that it covers the first interlayer insulating film <b>7</b> and the first wiring layer <b>8</b>. The rotation speed is determined depending on the viscosity of the SOG coating solution or the thickness of the interlayer insulating film. Next, the film thus formed through the spin coating is subjected to first heat treatment in a diffusion furnace at 150° C. to 250° C. for 10 minutes or so. In that manner, a rigid and porous second interlayer insulating film <b>10</b> having a residual organic content of about 5% is formed, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref> <i>e</i>). Thus formed, the second interlayer insulating film <b>10</b> is subjected to second heat treatment in a diffusion furnace at 400° C. for 30 minutes. As a result, the second interlayer insulating film <b>10</b> becomes a porous film having a thickness of, for example, 500 nm or so and having uniform-size pores uniformly dispersing in the film. Finally, the relative dielectric constant of the second interlayer insulating film <b>10</b> could be from 1.5 to 2.5 or so.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0601">In this, the atmosphere gas for the first and second heat treatment may be oxygen or nitrogen. When the first heat treatment is effected in an oxygen gas atmosphere, then the coating film formed by the spin coating operation could be readily porous, and even at 130° C. or so, a uniform porous layer can be formed. In the first heat treatment effected in a nitrogen gas atmosphere, the temperature for forming the intended porous structure is higher than that in the oxygen gas atmosphere. In the first heat treatment, the solvent of the SOG coating solution is removed and the sol-like coating film formed by the spin coating operation is gelled. When a readily-gelling SOG coating solution is used, then it is desirable that the first heat treatment is effected in an oxygen gas atmosphere. When a hardly-gelling SOG coating solution is used, then it is desirable that the first heat treatment is effected in a nitrogen gas atmosphere.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0602">A contact hole <b>11</b> is formed through the first interlayer insulating film <b>7</b> and the second interlayer insulating film <b>10</b>, and a second wiring layer <b>12</b> is formed of a metal such as aluminium (Al). Finally, a passivation film <b>13</b> is formed to cover the entire surface of the structure. In that manner, a two-layered wiring structure-having semiconductor device is formed, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref> <i>e</i>). Though not shown herein, many other semiconductor elements are formed on the silicon substrate <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0603">In the manner as above, an interlayer insulating film having pores of high uniformity and having a low dielectric constant can be formed stably in a semiconductor device. The interlayer insulating film has good mechanical strength and good moisture absorption resistance. In addition, just as planed, a semiconductor device capable of being driven at high speed can be produced with high accuracy, and a high-reliability semiconductor device can be provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0604">In Example 23, the same porous material as that for the second interlayer insulating film <b>10</b> may be applied also to the first interlayer insulating film <b>7</b>. In this case, since the above-mentioned SOG coating solution is applied onto the entire surface of the structure in a mode of spin coating, the surface of the first interlayer insulating film <b>7</b> is made flat and it does not require CMP. However, in this case, it is desirable that a silicon nitride film having a thickness of at most 10 nm is formed on the entire surface, and the first interlayer insulating film <b>7</b> is formed on the silicon nitride film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0605">Further, in production of multi-layered wiring structure-having semiconductor devices, it is easy like in Example 23 to use a porous material formed of the above-mentioned SOG coating solution as the low-dielectric-constant interlayer insulating film in a damascene structure or dual-damascene structure that uses copper as the wiring metal. This is because the interlayer insulating film is a low-dielectric-constant insulating film formed at low temperatures and capable of undergoing heat treatment at 400° C. or so, as so mentioned hereinabove.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0606">The embodiments mentioned hereinabove are to demonstrate the formation of a porous material by the use of a siloxane skeleton-having polycondensation compound (hydrogen or organic-containing compound with an Si—O structure as the main backbone thereof), to which, however, the invention should not be limited. Apart from these, the heat-decaying material of the invention is also applicable to production of porous materials of silicon-containing organic thin films having a main skeleton of an organic polymer. The inventors have confirmed that the organic insulating film of the type applicable to the invention include, for example, BCB films (organic film formed of divinylsiloxane-benzocyclobutene polymer) and polyallyl ether-Si bond-having organic insulating films. Further in addition to these, any other silicon-containing organic thin films having a main skeleton of organic polymer, which generally comprise organosiloxane or aromatic and/or hydrocarbon chain-containing organosiloxane, are also usable herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0607">The above-mentioned porous organic thin films may be formed in any film-forming method of a spin-on-coating method or a plasma polymerization method. When a spin-on-coating method is employed, then a main skeleton material monomer is first applied onto a substrate along with a heat-decaying material thereonto in a mode of spin-on-coating. Then, the coated substrate is annealed whereby the monomer is thermally polymerized on the substrate to form a silicon-containing organic thin film having an organic polymer as the main skeleton thereof. When a plasma polymerization is employed, then a main skeleton material monomer and a monomer to give a heat-decaying material are vaporized to produce a monomer vapor. The monomer vapor is introduced into an inert gas and is further polymerized to form a silicon-containing organic thin film having an organic polymer as the main skeleton thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0608">Regarding the siloxane skeleton-having polycondensation compounds, insulating films of silsesquioxanes, or silica films containing at least one bond of Si—H bond, Si—CH<sub>3 </sub>bond or Si—F bond may be formed. In this, the insulating films of silsesquioxanes include low-dielectric-constant films of methyl silsesquioxane, hydrogen silsesquioxane, methylated hydrogen silsesquioxane or fluorinated silsesquioxane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0609">The above-mentioned BCB film may have a silica content of about 20% and its relative dielectric constant before formed into a porous film may be 2.5 or so. A composite film of the type that comprises such an organic component and a silica component or silicon component may also be the organic insulating film. Further, a composite film that comprises the organic component and the silica component or a partly nitrided silicon component may also be the organic insulating film.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0624">This application is based on a Japanese patent application filed on Nov. 29, 2002 (Patent Application No. 2002-349192), a Japanese patent application filed on Nov. 29, 2002 (Patent Application No. 2002-349194), a Japanese patent application filed on Nov. 29, 2002 (Patent Application No. 2002-349195), a Japanese patent application filed on Feb. 3, 2003 (Patent Application No. 2003-26330), a Japanese patent application filed on Feb. 26, 2003 (Patent Application No. 2003-49842), and a Japanese patent application filed on Nov. 25, 2003 (Patent Application No. 2003-394620), the entire contents of which are incorporated hereinto by reference.</div>
<heading>INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0625">The heat-decaying material of the invention hardly deteriorates and decomposes at ordinary service temperatures, and when heated at relatively low temperatures, they may decay within a short period of time.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0626">According to the method for producing a porous material by the use of the heat-decaying material of the invention, a precursor is prepared which contains a skeleton-forming crosslinkable material (a) and the heat-decaying material (b) of the invention that comprises a polyoxyalkylene resin as the principal ingredient thereof and decomposes and evaporates when heated, and the precursor is heated at a temperature not lower than the temperature at which the heat-decaying material decays under heat, whereby the heat-decaying material is decayed to form a large number of pores, and a porous material having as the matrix thereof, a crosslinked skeleton phase of the crosslinkable material (a) can be obtained. Accordingly, a porous material can be produced in a relatively simple process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0627">Moreover, a precursor may be prepared by dispersing the heat-decaying material (b) in the skeleton-forming crosslinkable material (a), and when the heat-decaying material is merely uniformly dispersed therein, then a porous material having uniformly dispersed pores can be readily obtained. In addition, when the particle size of the dispersed particles of the heat-decaying material is controlled, then relatively large pores can be readily formed and a porous material having uniform-size pores can be readily produced. Further, since the heat-decaying material completely decays when heated, it leaves little residue and does not almost increase the dielectric constant of the structure where the heat-decaying material has been decayed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0628">Therefore, according to the production method of the invention, it is possible to readily provide a porous material having a low dielectric constant with little fluctuation of dielectric characteristics, and to readily provide electronic parts having an interlayer insulating film formed of the porous material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0629">When the heat-decaying material of the invention is used, then conductive fine particles may be disposed accurately on the electrodes of electronic parts, not being shifted or dropped away. In addition, multiple electroconductive fine particles may be surely and readily connected to the electrodes of electronic parts all at a time. To that effect, the invention provides a conductive particles transfer sheet and a method for connecting conductive fine particles to electrodes, satisfying the requirements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0630">The electronic parts are meant to include semiconductor chips, resin-encapsulated semiconductor devices, packaging substrates such as printed boards on which these electronic parts are to be mounted. However, when a CSP process is employed, conductive fine particles may be formed on a semiconductor wafer, and therefore semiconductor wafers are also within the scope of the electronic parts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0631">The conductive particles transfer sheet has conductive fine particles disposed in predetermined positions of a heat-decaying sheet. When heated, the sheet itself decays. Therefore, the transfer sheet is effective for bonding bumps or solder balls onto electronic parts such as semiconductor chips.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0632">The transfer sheet for circuit formation that comprises the heat-decaying material of the invention comprises an adhesive sheet having thereon a heat-decaying resin capable of decomposing under heat, a resin composition containing such a heat-decaying resin, or a composite film comprising such a heat-decaying resin. When the circuit pattern is transferred from the sheet, then the adhesive sheet decays or its adhesive force lowers owing to the vapor generated through decomposition of the heat-decaying resin. Therefore, even when the adhesive sheet has a high adhesive force or even when it has a circuit pattern having an extremely narrow line width and when the circuit pattern is transferred from it, the circuit pattern can be well transferred onto an insulating substrate or a ceramic green sheet with no pattern disturbance. Accordingly, the invention makes it possible to produce circuit boards having further increased wiring density and enabling higher-density packaging, with high accuracy and at high producibility.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0633">Using the transfer sheet for circuit formation of the invention, it is possible to transfer circuit patterns even onto substrates for liquid-crystal display panels, plasma display panels, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0634">According to the patterning method to be attained by the use of the heat-decaying material of the invention, pattern formation may be significantly simplified as compared with conventional photolithography. Accordingly, the invention makes it possible to further improve the accuracy in patterning technology for various materials and to further reduce the cost of patterning. As a result, the production costs of semiconductor devices can be thereby significantly reduced.</div>
