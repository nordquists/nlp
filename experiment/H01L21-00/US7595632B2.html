<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention is directed to probe stations for making highly accurate measurements of high-speed, large scale integrated circuits at the wafer level, and of other electronic devices. More particularly, the invention relates to such a probe station having an environment control enclosure for limiting the communication of the wafer-supporting chuck and probes with outside influences such as electromagnetic interference (EMI), air, and/or light.</div>
<heading>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The probe station is equipped with an integrated environment control enclosure substantially surrounding a supporting surface for holding a test device, such enclosure limiting fluid communication between the interior and exterior of the enclosure and preferably also providing EMI shielding and a dark environment. The limited communication between the interior and exterior of the enclosure is kept substantially constant despite positioning movement of either the supporting surface or probes. The positioning mechanisms for the supporting surface and probes are each located at least partially outside of the enclosure so that mechanical movement of each of the positioning mechanisms outside of the enclosure causes proportional mechanical movement of the surface or probe.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">According to another aspect of the invention, the environment control enclosure has an upper portion extending above the supporting surface and a side portion substantially surrounding the supporting surface, the supporting surface being movable laterally with respect to the top of the side portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">According to another aspect of the invention, the environment control enclosure has an opening with a closable door for substituting different test devices on the supporting surface in a manner compatible with the positioning and environment control functions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">The foregoing and other objectives, features, and advantages of the invention will be more readily understood upon consideration of the following detailed description of the invention, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<heading>General Arrangement of Probe Station</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>, an exemplary embodiment of the probe station of the present invention comprises a base <b>10</b> (shown partially) which supports a platen <b>12</b> through a number of jacks <b>14</b> <i>a</i>, <b>14</b> <i>b</i>, <b>14</b> <i>c</i>, <b>14</b> <i>d </i>which selectively raise and lower the platen vertically relative to the base by a small increment (approximately one-tenth of an inch) for purposes to be described hereafter. Also supported by the base <b>10</b> of the probe station is a motorized positioner <b>16</b> having a rectangular plunger <b>18</b> which supports a movable chuck assembly <b>20</b> for supporting a wafer or other test device. The chuck assembly <b>20</b> passes freely through a large aperture <b>22</b> in the platen <b>12</b> which permits the chuck assembly to be moved independently of the platen by the positioner <b>16</b> along X, Y and Z axes, i.e. horizontally along two mutually-perpendicular axes X and Y, and vertically along the Z axis. Likewise, the platen <b>12</b>, when moved vertically by the jacks <b>14</b>, moves independently of the chuck assembly <b>20</b> and the Positioner <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">Mounted atop the platen <b>12</b> are multiple individual probe positioners such as <b>24</b> (only one of which is shown), each having an extending member <b>26</b> to which is mounted a probe holder <b>28</b> which in turn supports a respective probe <b>30</b> for contacting wafers and other test devices mounted atop the chuck assembly <b>20</b>. The probe positioner <b>24</b> has micrometer adjustments <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> for adjusting the position of the probe holder <b>28</b>, and thus the probe <b>30</b>, along the X, Y and Z axes respectively, relative to the chuck assembly <b>20</b>. The Z axis is exemplary of what is referred to herein loosely as the “axis of approach” between the probe holder <b>28</b> and the chuck assembly <b>20</b>, although directions of approach which are neither vertical nor linear, along which the probe tip and wafer or other test device are brought into contact with each other, are also intended to be included within the meaning of the term “axis of approach.” A further micrometer adjustment <b>40</b> adjustably tilts the probe holder <b>28</b> to adjust planarity of the probe with respect to the wafer or other test device supported by the chuck assembly <b>20</b>. As many as twelve individual probe positioners <b>24</b>, each supporting a respective probe, may be arranged on the platen <b>12</b> around the chuck assembly <b>20</b> so as to converge radially toward the chuck assembly similarly to the spokes of a wheel. With such an arrangement, each individual positioner <b>24</b> can independently adjust its respective probe in the X, Y and Z directions, while the jacks <b>14</b> can be actuated to raise or lower the platen <b>12</b> and thus all of the positioners <b>24</b> and their respective probes in unison.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">An environment control enclosure is composed of an upper box portion <b>42</b> rigidly attached to the platen <b>12</b>, and a lower box portion <b>44</b> rigidly attached to the base <b>10</b>. Both portions are made of steel or other suitable electrically conductive material to provide EMI shielding. To accommodate the small vertical movement between the two box portions <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> when the jacks <b>14</b> are actuated to raise or lower the platen <b>12</b>, an electrically conductive resilient foam gasket <b>46</b>, preferably composed of silver or carbon-impregnated silicone, is interposed peripherally at their mating juncture at the front of the enclosure and between the lower portion <b>44</b> and the platen <b>12</b> so that an EMI, substantially hermetic, and light seal are all maintained despite relative vertical movement between the two box portions <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>. Even though the upper box portion <b>42</b> is rigidly attached to the platen <b>12</b>, a similar gasket <b>47</b> is preferably interposed between the portion <b>42</b> and the top of the platen to maximize sealing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, the top of the upper box portion <b>42</b> comprises an octagonal steel box <b>48</b> having eight side panels such as <b>49</b> <i>a </i>and <b>49</b> <i>b </i>through which the extending members <b>26</b> of the respective probe positioners <b>24</b> can penetrate movably. Each panel comprises a hollow housing in which a respective sheet <b>50</b> of resilient foam, which may be similar to the above-identified gasket material, is placed. Slits such as <b>52</b> are partially cut vertically in the foam in alignment with slots <b>54</b> formed in the inner and outer surfaces of each panel housing, through which a respective extending member <b>26</b> of a respective probe positioner <b>24</b> can pass movably. The slitted foam permits X, Y and Z movement of the extending members <b>26</b> of each probe positioner, while maintaining the EMI, substantially hermetic, and light seal provided by the enclosure. In four of the panels, to enable a greater range of X and Y movement, the foam sheet <b>50</b> is sandwiched between a pair of steel plates <b>55</b> having slots <b>54</b> therein, such plates being slidable transversely within the panel housing through a range of movement encompassed by larger slots <b>56</b> in the inner and outer surfaces of the panel housing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">Atop the octagonal box <b>48</b>, a circular viewing aperture <b>58</b> is provided, having a recessed circular transparent sealing window <b>60</b> therein. A bracket <b>62</b> holds an apertured sliding shutter <b>64</b> to selectively permit or prevent the passage of light through the window. A stereoscope (not shown) connected to a CRT monitor can be placed above the window to provide a magnified display of the wafer or other test device and the probe tip for proper probe placement during set-up or operation. Alternatively, the window <b>60</b> can be removed and a microscope lens (not shown) surrounded by a foam gasket can be inserted through the viewing aperture <b>58</b> with the foam providing EMI, hermetic and light sealing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">The upper box portion <b>42</b> of the environment control enclosure also includes a hinged steel door <b>68</b> which pivots outwardly about the pivot axis of a hinge <b>70</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. The hinge biases the door downwardly toward the top of the upper box portion <b>42</b> so that it forms a tight, overlapping, sliding peripheral seal <b>68</b> <i>a </i>with the top of the upper box portion. When the door is open, and the chuck assembly <b>20</b> is moved by the positioner <b>16</b> beneath the door opening as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the chuck assembly is accessible for loading and unloading.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the sealing integrity of the enclosure is likewise maintained throughout positioning movements by the motorized positioner <b>16</b> due to the provision of a series of four sealing plates <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> and <b>78</b> stacked slidably atop one another. The sizes of the plates progress increasingly from the top to the bottom one, as do the respective sizes of the central apertures <b>72</b> <i>a</i>, <b>74</b> <i>a</i>, <b>76</b> <i>a </i>and <b>78</b> <i>a </i>formed in the respective plates <b>72</b>, <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> and <b>78</b>, and the aperture <b>79</b> <i>a </i>formed in the bottom <b>44</b> <i>a </i>of the lower box portion <b>44</b>. The central aperture <b>72</b> <i>a </i>in the top plate <b>72</b> mates closely around the bearing housing <b>18</b> <i>a </i>of the vertically-movable plunger <b>18</b>. The next plate in the downward progression, plate <b>74</b>, has an upwardly-projecting peripheral margin <b>74</b> <i>b </i>which limits the extent to which the plate <b>72</b> can slide across the top of the plate <b>74</b>. The central aperture <b>74</b> <i>a </i>in the plate <b>74</b> is of a size to permit the positioner <b>16</b> to move the plunger <b>18</b> and its bearing housing <b>18</b> <i>a </i>transversely along the X and Y axes until the edge of the top plate <b>72</b> abuts against the margin <b>74</b> <i>b </i>of the plate <b>74</b>. The size of the aperture <b>74</b> <i>a </i>is, however, too small to be uncovered by the top plate <b>72</b> when such abutment occurs, and therefore a seal is maintained between the plates <b>72</b> and <b>74</b> regardless of the movement of the plunger <b>18</b> and its bearing housing along the X and Y axes. Further movement of the plunger <b>18</b> and bearing housing in the direction of abutment of the plate <b>72</b> with the margin <b>74</b> <i>b </i>results in the sliding of the plate <b>74</b> toward the peripheral margin <b>76</b> <i>b </i>of the next underlying plate <b>76</b>. Again, the central aperture <b>76</b> <i>a </i>in the plate <b>76</b> is large enough to permit abutment of the plate <b>74</b> with the margin <b>76</b> <i>b</i>, but small enough to prevent the plate <b>74</b> from uncovering the aperture <b>76</b> <i>a</i>, thereby likewise maintaining the seal between the plates <b>74</b> and <b>76</b>. Still further movement of the plunger <b>18</b> and bearing housing in the same direction causes similar sliding of the plates <b>76</b> and <b>78</b> relative to their underlying plates into abutment with the margin <b>78</b> <i>b </i>and the side of the box portion <b>44</b>, respectively, without the apertures <b>78</b> <i>a </i>and <b>79</b> <i>a </i>becoming uncovered. This combination of sliding plates and central apertures of progressively increasing size permits a full range of movement of the plunger <b>18</b> along the X and Y axes by the positioner <b>16</b>, while maintaining the enclosure in a sealed condition despite such positioning movement. The EMI sealing provided by this structure is effective even with respect to the electric motors of the positioner <b>16</b>, since they are located below the sliding plates.</div>
<heading>Chuck Assembly</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">With particular reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>, the chuck assembly <b>20</b> is of a unique modular construction usable either with or without an environment control enclosure. The plunger <b>18</b> supports an adjustment plate <b>79</b> which in turn supports first, second and third chuck assembly elements <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> and <b>83</b>, respectively, positioned at progressively greater distances from the probe(s) along the axis of approach. Element <b>83</b> is a conductive rectangular stage or shield <b>83</b> which detachably mounts conductive elements <b>80</b> and <b>81</b> of circular shape. The element <b>80</b> has a planar upwardly-facing wafer-supporting surface <b>82</b> having an array of vertical apertures <b>84</b> therein. These apertures communicate with respective chambers separated by O-rings <b>88</b>, the chambers in turn being connected separately to different vacuum lines <b>90</b> <i>a</i>, <b>90</b> <i>b</i>, <b>90</b> <i>c </i>(<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) communicating through separately-controlled vacuum valves (not shown) with a source of vacuum. The respective vacuum lines selectively connect the respective chambers and their apertures to the source of vacuum to hold the wafer, or alternatively isolate the apertures from the source of vacuum to release the wafer, in a conventional manner. The separate operability of the respective chambers and their corresponding apertures enables the chuck to hold wafers of different diameters.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">In addition to the circular elements <b>80</b> and <b>81</b>, auxiliary chucks such as <b>92</b> and <b>94</b> are detachably mounted on the corners of the element <b>83</b> by screws (not shown) independently of the elements <b>80</b> and <b>81</b> for the purpose of supporting contact substrates and calibration substrates while a wafer or other test device is simultaneously supported by the element <b>80</b>. Each auxiliary chuck <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> has its own separate upwardly-facing planar surface <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> respectively, in parallel relationship to the surface <b>82</b> of the element <b>80</b>. Vacuum apertures <b>104</b> protrude through the surfaces <b>100</b> and <b>102</b> from communication with respective chambers within the body of each auxiliary chuck. Each of these chambers in turn communicates through a separate vacuum line and a separate independently-actuated vacuum valve (not shown) with a source of vacuum, each such valve selectively connecting or isolating the respective sets of apertures <b>104</b> with respect to the source of vacuum independently of the operation of the apertures <b>84</b> of the element <b>80</b>, so as to selectively hold or release a contact substrate or calibration substrate located on the respective surfaces <b>100</b> and <b>102</b> independently of the wafer or other test device. An optional metal shield <b>106</b> may protrude upwardly from the edges of the element <b>83</b> to surround the other elements <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> and the auxiliary chucks <b>92</b>, <b>94</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">All of the chuck assembly elements <b>80</b>, <b>81</b> and <b>83</b>, as well as the additional chuck assembly element <b>79</b>, are electrically insulated from one another even though they are constructed of electrically conductive metal and interconnected detachably by metallic screws such as <b>96</b>. With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 3A</figref>, the electrical insulation results from the fact that, in addition to the resilient dielectric O-rings <b>88</b>, dielectric spacers <b>85</b> and dielectric washers <b>86</b> are provided. These, coupled with the fact that the screws <b>96</b> pass through oversized apertures in the lower one of the two elements which each screw joins together thereby preventing electrical contact between the shank of the screw and the lower element, provide the desired insulation. As is apparent in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the dielectric spacers <b>85</b> extend over only minor portions of the opposing surface areas of the interconnected chuck assembly elements, thereby leaving air gaps between the opposing surfaces over major portions of their respective areas. Such air gaps minimize the dielectric constant in the spaces between the respective chuck assembly elements, thereby correspondingly minimizing the capacitance between them and the ability for electrical current to leak from one element to another. Preferably, the spacers and washers <b>85</b> and <b>86</b>, respectively, are constructed of a material having the lowest possible dielectric constant consistent with high dimensional stability and high volume resistivity. A suitable material for the spacers and washers is glass epoxy, or acetal homopolymer marketed under the trademark Delrin by E.I. DuPont.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the chuck assembly <b>20</b> also includes a pair of detachable electrical connector assemblies designated generally as <b>108</b> and <b>110</b>, each having at least two conductive connector elements <b>108</b> <i>a</i>, <b>108</b> <i>b </i>and <b>110</b> <i>a</i>, <b>110</b> <i>b</i>, respectively, electrically insulated from each other, with the connector elements <b>108</b> <i>b </i>and <b>110</b> <i>b </i>preferably coaxially surrounding the connector elements <b>108</b> <i>a </i>and <b>110</b> <i>a </i>as guards therefor. If desired, the connector assemblies <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> can be triaxial in configuration so as to include respective outer shields <b>108</b> <i>c</i>, <b>110</b> <i>c </i>surrounding the respective connector elements <b>108</b> <i>b </i>and <b>110</b> <i>b</i>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The outer shields <b>108</b> <i>c </i>and <b>110</b> <i>c </i>may, if desired, be connected electrically through a shielding box <b>112</b> and a connector supporting bracket <b>113</b> to the chuck assembly element <b>83</b>, although such electrical connection is optional particularly in view of the surrounding EMI shielding enclosure <b>42</b>, <b>44</b>. In any case, the respective connector elements <b>108</b> <i>a </i>and <b>110</b> <i>a </i>are electrically connected in parallel to a connector plate <b>114</b> matingly and detachably connected along a curved contact surface <b>114</b> <i>a </i>by screws <b>114</b> <i>b </i>and <b>114</b> <i>c </i>to the curved edge of the chuck assembly element <b>80</b>. Conversely, the connector elements <b>108</b> <i>b </i>and <b>110</b> <i>b </i>are connected in parallel to a connector plate <b>116</b> similarly matingly connected detachably to element <b>81</b>. The connector elements pass freely through a rectangular opening <b>112</b> <i>a </i>in the box <b>112</b>, being electrically insulated from the box <b>112</b> and therefore from the element <b>83</b>, as well as being electrically insulated from each other. Set screws such as <b>118</b> detachably fasten the connector elements to the respective connector plates <b>114</b> and <b>116</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">Either coaxial or, as shown, triaxial cables <b>118</b> and <b>120</b> form portions of the respective detachable electrical connector assemblies <b>108</b> and <b>110</b>, as do their respective triaxial detachable connectors <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> which penetrate a wall of the lower portion <b>44</b> of the environment control enclosure so that the outer shields of the triaxial connectors <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> are electrically connected to the enclosure. Further triaxial cables <b>122</b> <i>a</i>, <b>124</b> <i>a </i>are detachably connectable to the connectors <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> from suitable test equipment such as a Hewlett-Packard 4142B modular DC source/monitor or a Hewlett-Packard 4284A precision LCR meter, depending upon the test application. If the cables <b>118</b> and <b>120</b> are merely coaxial cables or other types of cables having only two conductors, one conductor interconnects the inner (signal) connector element of a respective connector <b>122</b> or <b>124</b> with a respective connector element <b>108</b> <i>a </i>or <b>110</b> <i>a</i>, while the other conductor connects the intermediate (guard) connector element of a respective connector <b>122</b> or <b>124</b> with a respective connector element <b>108</b> <i>b</i>, <b>110</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">In any case, the detachable connector assemblies <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, due to their interconnections with the two connector plates <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>, provide immediately ready-to-use signal and guard connections to the chuck assembly elements <b>80</b> and <b>81</b>, respectively, as well as ready-to-use guarded Kelvin connections thereto. For applications requiring only guarding of the chuck assembly, as for example the measurement of low-current leakage from a test device through the element <b>80</b>, it is necessary only that the operator connect a single guarded cable <b>122</b> <i>a </i>from a test instrument such as a Hewlett-Packard 4142B modular DC source/monitor to the detachable connector <b>122</b> so that a signal line is provided to the chuck assembly element <b>80</b> through the connector element <b>108</b> <i>a </i>and connector plate <b>114</b>, and a guard line is provided to the element <b>81</b> through the connector element <b>108</b> <i>b </i>and connector plate <b>116</b>. Alternatively, if a Kelvin connection to the chuck assembly is desired for low-voltage measurements, such as those needed for measurements of low capacitance, the operator need merely attach a pair of cables <b>122</b> <i>a </i>and <b>124</b> <i>a </i>to the respective connectors <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> from a suitable test instrument such as a Hewlett-Packard 4284A precision LCR meter, thereby providing both source and measurement lines to the element <b>80</b> through the connector elements <b>108</b> <i>a </i>and <b>110</b> <i>a </i>and connector plate <b>114</b>, and guarding lines to the element <b>81</b> through the connector elements <b>108</b> <i>b </i>and <b>110</b> <i>b </i>and connector plate <b>116</b>.</div>
<heading>Probe Assembly</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">With reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B</figref>, <b>8</b> and <b>9</b>, respective individually movable probes <b>30</b> comprising pairs of probe elements <b>30</b> <i>a </i>are supported by respective probe holders <b>28</b> which in turn are supported by respective extending portions <b>26</b> of different probe positioners such as <b>24</b>. Atop each probe positioner <b>24</b> is a shield box <b>126</b> having a pair of triaxial connectors <b>128</b>, <b>130</b> mounted thereon with respective triaxial cables <b>132</b> entering each triaxial connector from a suitable test instrument as mentioned previously. Each triaxial connector includes a respective inner connector element <b>128</b> <i>a</i>, <b>130</b> <i>a</i>, an intermediate connector element <b>128</b> <i>b</i>, <b>130</b> <i>b</i>, and an outer connector element <b>128</b> <i>c</i>, <b>130</b> <i>c </i>in concentric arrangement. Each outer connector element <b>128</b> <i>c</i>, <b>130</b> <i>c </i>terminates by connection with the shield box <b>126</b>. Conversely, the inner connector elements <b>128</b> <i>a</i>, <b>130</b> <i>a</i>, and the intermediate connector elements <b>128</b> <i>b</i>, <b>130</b> <i>b</i>, are connected respectively to the inner and outer conductors of a pair of coaxial cables <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> which therefore are guarded cables. Each cable <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> terminates through a respective coaxial connector <b>138</b>, <b>140</b> with a respective probe element <b>30</b> <i>a </i>having a center conductor <b>142</b> surrounded by a guard <b>144</b>. In order to provide adequate shielding for the coaxial cables <b>134</b>, <b>136</b>, especially in the region outside of the octagonal box <b>48</b>, an electrically-conductive shield tube <b>146</b> is provided around the cables <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> and electrically connected through the shield box <b>126</b> with the outer connector element <b>128</b> <i>c</i>, <b>130</b> <i>c </i>of the respective triaxial connectors <b>128</b>, <b>130</b>. The shield tube <b>146</b> passes through the same slit in the foam <b>50</b> as does the underlying extending member <b>26</b> of the probe positioner <b>24</b>. Thus, each individually movable probe <b>30</b> has not only its own separate individually movable probe holder <b>28</b> but also its own individually movable shield <b>146</b> for its guarded coaxial cables, which shield is movable in unison with the probe holder independently of the movement of any other probe holder by any other positioning mechanism <b>24</b>. This feature is particularly advantageous because such individually movable probes are normally not equipped for both shielded and guarded connections, which deficiency is solved by the described structure. Accordingly, the probes <b>30</b> are capable of being used with the same guarding and Kelvin connection techniques in a ready-to-use manner as is the chuck assembly <b>20</b>, consistently with full shielding despite the individual positioning capability of each probe <b>30</b>.</div>
