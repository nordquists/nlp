<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The present invention relates to plasma processing apparatuses and, more particularly, to a plasma processing apparatus having a gas-introducing part, which introduces a reactant gas into a process chamber.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">In recent years, a plasma processing apparatus is used to perform a film deposition process, an etching process or an ashing process in a manufacturing process of semiconductor devices since the semiconductor devices have become more densified and a finer structure. For example, in a typical microwave plasma processing apparatus, a 2.45 GHz microwave is introduced into a process chamber through a slot electrode. An object to be processed such as a semiconductor wafer or an LCD substrate is placed inside the process chamber, which is maintained under a negative pressure environment by a vacuum pump. Additionally, a reactant gas is also introduced into the process chamber so that the process gas is converted into plasma by the microwave. Thus, active radicals and ions are generated, and the radicals and ions react with the object to be processed, which achieves a film deposition process or an etching process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">The reactant gas is introduced into the process chamber through gas supply nozzles provided on a sidewall of the process chamber. Alternatively, the reactant gas is introduced into the process chamber through a dielectric plate provided under a slot electrode, which is provided on a top of the process chamber. The gas supply arrangement including such a gas supply nozzle or a dielectric plate is subjected to an evacuating process by a vacuum pump, which is provided to evacuate gas inside the process chamber.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">However, there is a problem in the conventional plasma processing apparatus in that residual impurities such as a water component cannot be completely removed from inside the process chamber. A water component adhering on the inner wall of the process chamber is evaporated due to a vacuum being formed in the process chamber, and the water vapor is released to the atmosphere inside the process chamber. The water vapor is exhausted out of the process chamber by a vacuum pump. However, since the gas-introducing part provided to the process chamber has gas-introducing holes (nozzles) each having a very small diameter, a removal speed of the water component remaining inside the gas-introducing part is low. Accordingly, some amount of water component tends to remain inside the gas-introducing part of the process chamber.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">The water component remaining inside the gas-introducing part may enter and close the gas-introducing holes, which interrupts the introduction of the reactant gas into the process chamber. Thus, a yield rate of the object to be processed is deteriorated. Additionally, if some of the gas-introducing holes are closed, this may deteriorate a uniform distribution of the reactant gas in the process chamber, which may result in an uneven degree of processing of the object to be processed. Further, if the water component in the gas-introducing holes is ejected into the process chamber, the water component acts as an impurity, which deteriorates a high-quality process to be applied to the object to be processed.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">It is a general object of the present invention to provide an improved and useful plasma processing apparatus in which the above-mentioned problems are eliminated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">A more specific object of the present invention is to provide a plasma processing apparatus which can apply a high-quality process to an object to be processed by removing impurities from a gas-introducing part of a process chamber.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">In order to achieve the above-mentioned objects, there is provided according to one aspect of the present invention a plasma processing apparatus for applying a plasma process to an object to be processed, the plasma processing apparatus comprising a process chamber in which the object to be processed is subjected to the plasma process; a gas-introducing part connected to the process chamber so as to introduce a reactant gas into the process chamber; a first vacuum pump connected to the process chamber so as to evacuate gas from the process chamber so that the process chamber is maintained at a negative pressure; and a gas-evacuating arrangement connected to the gas-introducing part so as to evacuate the reactant gas from the gas-introducing part.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">According to the above-mentioned invention, the gas-evacuating arrangement is connected exclusively to the gas-introducing part so as to evacuate the reactant gas remaining in the gas-introducing part. Thus, impurities such as a water component existing in the gas-introducing part can be evacuated from the gas-introducing part together with the reactant gas being evacuated by the gas-evacuating arrangement that is exclusively provided to the gas introducing part.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">In one embodiment of the present invention, the gas-evacuating arrangement may comprise a second vacuum pump connected to the gas-introducing part. That is, the second vacuum pump, which is different from the first vacuum pump, exclusively evacuates the reactant gas remaining in the gas-introducing part, which results in a rapid and efficient evacuation of the reactant gas remaining in the gas-introducing part.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">In another embodiment of the present invention, the gas-evacuating arrangement may comprise a bypass passage, which connects the gas-introducing part to the first vacuum pump by bypassing the process chamber. Accordingly, the gas-introducing part can be directly connected to the first vacuum pump by the bypass passage by bypassing the process chamber, which results in a rapid and efficient evacuation of the reactant gas remaining in the gas-introducing part.</div>

A density of the slits may be substantially uniform in a radial direction of the slot antenna.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">According to the above-mentioned invention, a gas-evacuating arrangement can be connected to the outlet port of the gas supply ring so as to evacuate the reactant gas remaining in the gas-introducing part. Thus, impurities such as a water component existing in the gas supply ring can be evacuated from the gas supply ring together with the reactant gas being evacuated by the gas-evacuating arrangement that is exclusively provided to the gas supply ring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">Additionally, there is provided according to another aspect of the present invention a dielectric plate adapted to be attached to a process chamber of a plasma processing apparatus, the dielectric plate comprising: a plurality of nozzles through which a reactant gas is introduced into the process chamber; at least one inlet port from which the reactant gas is supplied; a gas passage connected to the inlet port so that the reactant gas supplied from the inlet port is supplied to the plurality of nozzles by flowing through the gas passage; and an outlet port provided to the gas passage so that the reactant gas is evacuated from the gas passage through the outlet port.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">According to the above-mentioned invention, a gas-evacuating arrangement can be connected to the outlet port of the dielectric plate so as to evacuate the reactant gas remaining in the gas passage formed in the dielectric plate. Thus, impurities such as a water component existing in the gas passage can be evacuated from the gas passage together with the reactant gas being evacuated by the gas-evacuating arrangement that is exclusively provided to the dielectric plate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">Additionally, there is provided according to another aspect of the present inventions a plasma processing method comprising the steps of: evacuating gas from a process chamber by a first vacuum pump connected to the process chamber; introducing a reactant gas into the process chamber through a gas-introducing part; applying a plasma process to an object placed in the process chamber by generating plasma from the reactant gas stopping the introduction of the reactant gas into the process chamber after ending the plasma process; and evacuating the reactant gas remaining in the gas-introducing part by a second vacuum pump connected to the gas-introducing part.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">Accordingly, the reactant gas remaining in the gas-introducing part can be rapidly and efficiently evacuated from the gas-introducing part by the second vacuum pump exclusive provided to the gas-introducing part.</div>

<heading>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">A description will now be given, with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, of a first embodiment of the present invention. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an illustration of a structure of a microwave plasma processing apparatus <b>100</b> according to the first embodiment of the present invention. The first embodiment of the present invention is specifically related to an evacuating arrangement to evacuate gas from a gas-introducing part provided in a process chamber of the microwave plasma processing apparatus <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">The microwave plasma processing apparatus <b>100</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> comprises: a gate valve <b>101</b> connected to a cluster tool <b>300</b>; a process chamber <b>102</b> which can accommodate a susceptor <b>104</b> on which an object to be processed such as a semiconductor wafer or an LCD substrate; a high-vacuum pump <b>106</b> connected to the process chamber; a microwave supply source <b>110</b>; an antenna member <b>120</b>; and gas supply systems <b>130</b> and <b>160</b>. It should be noted that a control system of the plasma processing apparatus <b>100</b> is not illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> for the sake of simplification.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">The process chamber <b>102</b> is made of a conductive material such as an aluminum alloy. In the present embodiment, the process chamber <b>102</b> has a generally cylindrical shape. However the shape of the process chamber <b>102</b> is not limited to the cylindrical shape, and any shape can be adopted unless the process chamber <b>102</b> is deformed by a vacuum formed in the process chamber <b>102</b>. The susceptor <b>104</b> is provided in the process chamber <b>102</b> so as to support the object W to be processed. It should be noted that an electrostatic chuck or a clamping mechanism to fix the object W on the susceptor <b>104</b> is not illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> for the sake of simplification.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">The susceptor <b>104</b> controls a temperature of the object W to be processed in the process chamber <b>102</b>. The temperature of the susceptor <b>104</b> is adjusted to a value within a predetermined temperature range by a temperature-adjusting device <b>190</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram of the temperature-adjusting device <b>190</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The temperature-adjusting device <b>190</b> comprises, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a control unit <b>191</b>, a cooling jacket <b>192</b>, a sealing member <b>194</b>, a temperature sensor <b>196</b> and a heater unit <b>198</b>. Cooling water is supplied to the temperature control device <b>190</b> from a water source <b>199</b> such as a water line. The control unit <b>191</b> controls the temperature of the object W to fall within a predetermined temperature range. In order to achieve an easy control, it is preferable that the temperature of the cooling water supplied by the water source <b>199</b> is constant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">For example, in a case in which a silicon nitride film (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) is to be formed on a silicon substrate as the object W (single layer nitride film), the control unit <b>191</b> controls the heater unit <b>198</b> so that the temperature of the silicon substrate falls within a range from about 450° C. to about 500° C. If the silicon substrate is not maintained at a temperature above 450° C., a dangling bond may occur which is not preferable since a threshold voltage may vary as described later.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">A consideration will be given of a case in which a silicon nitride film is formed on a silicon oxidation film (SiO<sub>2</sub>) after the silicon oxidation film is formed on the silicon substrate. In this case, an upper portion of the silicon oxidation film is converted into the silicon nitride film by a plasma process by introducing nitrogen into the silicon oxidation film. In such a process, the control unit <b>191</b> controls the heater unit <b>198</b> so that the temperature of the silicon substrate falls within a range from about 250° C. to about 350° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">The reason for setting the temperature of the silicon substrate below about 350° C. is explained below with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a graph showing a nitrogen distribution in a direction of a depth when a multi-layered structure is formed on an object to be processed at a high temperature (for example, about 500° C.). As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when the temperature of the silicon substrate is set to a value greater than 350° C. by controlling the heater <b>198</b>, a large amount of nitrogen is introduced into an inner portion of the silicon oxidation film as well as a surface (an upper portion) of the silicon oxidation film. It can be appreciated from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> that nitrogen reaches a position 20 Å distant from the surface of the silicon oxidation film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">In such a case, nitrogen reaches a boundary between the silicon substrate and the silicon oxidation film, and a compound of silicon, oxygen and nitrogen is formed. The formation of the compound is not preferable since the compound may deteriorate a performance of a semiconductor element formed on the silicon substrate. A rate of nitrogen reaching the boundary between the silicon oxidation film and the silicon substrate depends on the size of the semiconductor element. If a gate length is in the range of 0.18 μm to 0.3 μm as in the conventional semiconductor element, an influence of the nitrogen may be negligible. However, recent semiconductor element is reduced in its size and thus the gate length is reduced to, for example, 0.13 μm or 0.10 μm. Thus, the influence of the nitrogen will not be negligible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">On the other hand, if the temperature of the silicon substrate controlled by the heater unit <b>198</b> is set to below 350° C., the nitrogen is distributed to an inner portion of the silicon oxidation film as well as the surface (an upper portion) of the silicon oxidation film. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a graph showing a nitrogen distribution in a direction of a depth when a multi-layered structure is formed on an object to be processed at an appropriate temperature (for example, about 350° C.). It can be appreciated from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> that the depth of the nitrogen is within an allowable range (less than 10 Å), and, therefore, the above-mentioned problem can be eliminated by setting the temperature of the silicon substrate below 350° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">The reason for setting the temperature of the susceptor <b>104</b> greater than about 250° C. is explained below. A CV characteristic which indicates a relationship between a gate voltage V and a gate capacitance C is often used as an index representing an operational characteristic of the object W to be processed (semiconductor element). The CV characteristic has a hysteresis at a time when the gate voltage V is applied and released. If the hysteresis width is large, threshold voltages (voltage at which a semiconductor element turns on and off) of the gate voltage V is varied, which deteriorates reliability. Accordingly, the hysteresis width is preferably maintained within a predetermined voltage range such as less than 0.02 V. This may be applied to a layered structure. The hysteresis width becomes larger as the number of defects (dangling bond) of the silicon nitride film increases. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a graph showing a relationship between defect density of the silicon nitride film and the temperature of the susceptor <b>104</b>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a dotted line indicates an allowable defect density. In order to maintain the hysteresis width, the defect density of the silicon nitride film must be maintained as indicated by a dotted line in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The inventors found that the allowable defect density is about 250° C. as interpreted from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">The control unit <b>191</b> controls the temperature of the susceptor <b>104</b> to be about 450° C. for a CVD process and about at least 80° C. for an etching process. In any case, the object W to be processed is maintained at a temperature at which a water component does not adhere to the object W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">The cooling jacket <b>192</b> is provided for supplying a cooling water so as to cool the object W to be processed during a plasma process. The cooling jacket <b>192</b> is made of a selected material such as a stainless steel which has high heat conductivity and an easy machinability to form a water passage <b>193</b>. The water passage <b>193</b> extends in longitudinal and transverse directions of the cooling jacket <b>192</b> having a square shape, and the sealing members <b>194</b> are screwed into openings of the water passage <b>193</b>. However, the shape of the cooling jacket <b>192</b> is not limited to the square shape, and the cooling jacket <b>192</b> and the water passage can be formed with any shape. It should be noted that a coolant such as alcohol, gulden or fluorocarbon may be used instead of the cooling water. The temperature sensor <b>196</b> can be a known sensor such as a PTC thermister an infrared sensor or a thermocouple. The temperature sensor may either be connected or not connected to the water passage <b>193</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">The heater unit <b>198</b> is comprised of a heater wire wound on a water pipe connected to the water passage of the cooling jacket <b>192</b>. By controlling an electric current supplied to the heater wire, the temperature of the cooling water flowing through the water passage <b>193</b> of the cooling jacket <b>192</b> can be adjusted. Since the cooling jacket <b>192</b> has high heat conductivity, the temperature of the cooling jacket is substantially equal to the temperature of the cooling water flowing through the water passage <b>193</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">The susceptor <b>104</b> is movable in a vertical direction inside the process chamber. A vertically moving system of the susceptor <b>104</b> comprises a vertically moving member, a bellows and a vertically moving mechanism. The vertically moving system can be achieved by any known structure in this art. The susceptor <b>104</b> is moved up and down between a home position and a process position. When the plasma processing apparatus <b>100</b> is not in operation or awaiting state, the susceptor <b>104</b> is located at the home position. The object W to be processed is transferred to the susceptor <b>104</b> at the home position from the cluster tool <b>300</b> via the gate valve <b>101</b>, and vice versa. A transfer position other than the home position may be defined so as to communicate with the gate valve <b>101</b>. A vertical travel of the susceptor <b>104</b> can be controlled by a controller of the vertically moving mechanism or a control unit of the plasma processing apparatus <b>100</b>, and the susceptor can be observed through a view port (not shown in the figure) provided to the process chamber <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">The susceptor <b>104</b> is connected to a lifter pin vertically moving system (not shown in the figure). The lifer pin vertically moving system comprises a vertically moving member, a bellows and a vertically moving device. The vertically moving system can be achieved by any known structure in this art. The vertically moving member is made of aluminum, for example, and is connected to three lifer pins, which vertically extend from vertices of an equilateral triangle. The lifter pins are vertically movable by penetrating the susceptor <b>104</b> so as to vertically move the object W to be processed placed on the susceptor <b>104</b>.

The baffle plate separates a process space in which the object W to be processed is placed from an exhaust space underneath the process space. The baffle plate mainly serves to maintain a potential of the process space (that is, maintain a microwave in the process space) and maintain a predetermined degree of vacuum (for example, 50 mTorr). The baffle plate is formed of pure aluminum, and has a hollow disk-like shape. The baffle plate has a thickness of 2 mm, and has many through holes arranged at random. Each of the through holes has a diameter of about 2 mm so that an open area ratio of the baffle plate is more than 50%. It should be noted that the baffle plate could have a meshed structure. Additionally, the baffle plate may have a function to prevent a reverse flow from the exhaust space to the process space or a function to create a pressure difference between the process space and the exhaust space.</div>

Thus, the slow-wave member <b>124</b> has a function to enable the formation of many slits in the slot electrode <b>200</b>. Ceramics such as SiN or AlN can be used for the slow-wave member <b>124</b>. For example, the specific permittivity ∈<sub>t </sub>of AlN is about 9 and, thus, the wavelength reducing rate n is 0.33 (n=1/(∈<sub>t</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>=0.33). Accordingly, the transmission rate of the microwave after passing through the slow-wave member <b>124</b> becomes 0.33 times the original transmission rate, and, thus, the wavelength also becomes 0.33 times the original wavelength. Accordingly, a distance between adjacent slits <b>210</b> of the slot electrode <b>200</b> can be reduced, resulting in a larger number of slits <b>210</b> being provided in the slot electrode <b>200</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0094">For example, if the slot electrode <b>200</b> thermally deforms, the length of each slit is changed, which results in a decrease in the plasma density or localization of the plasma in the process chamber <b>102</b>. The decrease in the plasma density may slow down a plasma processing speed such as an etching rate or a film deposition rate. As a result, if the plasma processing is controlled based on a processing time, there may be a case in which a desired result of the plasma processing (such as plasma etching depth or plasma deposition thickness) cannot be obtained when the plasma processing is applied for a predetermined time period (for example, two minutes), that is, for example, if the object W is processed for a predetermined time (for example, two minutes) and thereafter removed from the process chamber <b>102</b>.

Additionally, the dielectric plate <b>230</b> prevents the slot electrode <b>200</b> from being exposed to the atmosphere inside the process chamber <b>102</b> so that the environment inside the process chamber <b>102</b> is prevented from being contaminated by copper. If necessary, the dielectric plate <b>230</b> may be formed of a dielectric material having a low heat conductivity so as to prevent the slot electrode <b>200</b> from being influenced by heat from the process chamber <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0099">In the present embodiment, the thickness of the dielectric plate <b>230</b> is greater than 0.5 times the wavelength of the microwave in the dielectric plate <b>230</b> and smaller than 0.75 times the wavelength of the microwave in the dielectric plate <b>230</b>. Preferably, the thickness is in the range of 0.6 to 0.7 times the wavelength of the microwave in the dielectric plate <b>230</b>. The 2.45 GHz microwave has a wavelength of about 122.5 mm in a vacuum. If the dielectric plate <b>230</b> is made of aluminum nitride (AlN), the wavelength reducing rate n is equal to 0.33 since the specific permittivity ∈<sub>t </sub>is about 9 as mentioned above. Accordingly, the wavelength of the microwave in the dielectric plate <b>230</b> is about 40.8 mm. Thus, if the dielectric plate <b>230</b> is formed of AN, the thickness of the dielectric plate <b>230</b> is preferably greater than about 20.4 mm and smaller than about 30.6 mm, and, more preferably within a range from about 24.5 mm to about 28.6 mm. In general, the thickness H of the dielectric plate <b>230</b> preferably satisfies a relationship 0.5λ&lt;H&lt;0.75λ, and, more preferably, 0.6λ≦H≦0.7λ. The wavelength λ of the microwave in the dielectric material <b>230</b> satisfies λ=λ<sub>0</sub>n, where λ<sub>0 </sub>is a wavelength of the microwave in the vacuum and n is a wavelength reducing rate (n=1/∈<sub>t</sub> <sup>1/2</sup>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0100">When the thickness of the dielectric plate <b>230</b> is 0.5 times the wavelength of the microwave in the dielectric plate <b>230</b>, a standing wave is generated as a resultant wave of a synthesis of a progressing wave traveling along the front surface of the dielectric plate <b>230</b> and a regressive wave reflected by the back surface of the dielectric plate <b>230</b>. Thereby, the reflection is maximized and a power of the microwave transmitted to the process chamber <b>102</b> is minimized as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, which is a graph showing a relationship between a transmission power of the microwave and the thickness of the dielectric plate. In such a case, generation of plasma is insufficient, and, thereby a desired process speed cannot be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0101">On the other hand, when thickness of the dielectric plate <b>230</b> is 0.75 times the wavelength of the microwave in the dielectric plate <b>230</b>, the transmission power of the microwave is maximized but ion energy in the plasma is also maximized. The inventors found that the dielectric material of the dielectric plate <b>230</b> isolates by a plasma ion energy applied by transmission of a microwave isolates the material of the dielectric plate <b>230</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a graph showing a relationship between the thickness of the dielectric plate <b>230</b> and an amount of isolation (sputtering rate) of the dielectric plate <b>230</b>. If the material of the dielectric plate <b>230</b> isolates, the material enters the object W to be processed as impurities, thereby deteriorating a high-quality plasma process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0102">Accordingly in the present embodiment, the thickness H of the dielectric plate <b>230</b> is set to a value ranging from 0.3λ to 0.4λ (0.3λ≦H≦0.4λ) or a value ranging from 0.6λ to 0.7λ (0.6λ≦H≦0.7λ) as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. The thickness H of the dielectric plates <b>230</b> may be set to a value ranging from 0.8λ to 0.9λ (0.8λ≦H≦0.9λ) or a value ranging from 1.1λ to 1.2λ (1.1λ≦H≦1.2λ) although the thickness H of the dielectric plates <b>230</b> is increased. In more general form, the thickness H of the dielectric plate <b>230</b> is set to a value ranging from (0.1+0.5N)λ to (0.2+0.5N)λ or a value ranging from (0.6+0.5N)λ to (0.7+0.5N)λ, where N is an integer. In other words, the thickness H of the dielectric plate <b>230</b> satisfies a relationship (0.1+0.5N)λ≦H≦(0.2+0.5N)λ or (0.6+0.5N)λ≦H≦(0.7+0.5N)λ. Considering a mechanical strength of the dielectric plate <b>230</b>, the thickness H of the dielectric plate <b>230</b> is preferably set to a value ranging from 0.6λ to 0.7λ. However, for example, if the dielectric plate <b>230</b> is made of quartz having a specific permittivity of 3.8, a value ranging from 0.3λ to 0.4λ or a value ranging from 0.1λ to 0.2λ may be used. Additionally, the above-mentioned relationship in general form is applicable to a wave used for generating plasma other than a microwave.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0117">The conveyor section <b>320</b> is provided with the conveyor arm which holds the object W and a rotating mechanism for rotating the conveyor arm.

Preferably, the cluster tool <b>300</b> comprises a rotational angle sensor, a temperature sensor, at least one control unit and a memory for storing control programs so as to control the rotation of the conveyor arm of the conveyor section <b>320</b> and control a temperature of each of the preheating section <b>340</b> and cooling section <b>360</b>. Such a sensor, a control unit and a control program are known in the art, and descriptions thereof will be omitted. Additionally, the conveyor arm of the conveyor section <b>320</b> places the object W in the process chamber <b>102</b>A or <b>102</b>B through the gate valve <b>101</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0118">A description will now be given of an operation of the microwave plasma processing apparatus <b>100</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. First, the conveyor arm of the conveyor section <b>320</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> holds the object W to be processed so as to place the object W in the process chamber <b>102</b> (in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, one of the process chambers <b>102</b>A and <b>102</b>B corresponds to the process chamber <b>102</b>). It is assumed that the object W is subjected to a CVD process in the process chamber <b>102</b>. In such as case, the control unit (not shown in the figure) of the cluster tool <b>300</b> sends an instruction to the conveyor section <b>320</b> to convey the object W to the preheating section <b>340</b> so as to heat the object W to a temperature of about 300° C. before placing the object W in the process chamber <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0119">For example, the cluster tool <b>300</b> forms a silicon oxidation film on a silicon substrate in the process chamber <b>102</b>A by applying a plasma process. Thereafter the cluster tool <b>300</b> transfers the silicon substrate to the process chamber B so as to form a silicon nitride film by plasma processing the silicon oxidation film by introducing nitrogen into the process chamber <b>102</b>B. A reactant gas introduced into the process chamber <b>102</b>A so as to form the silicon oxidation film is typically SiH<sub>4</sub>—N<sub>2</sub>O. However, instead of SiH<sub>4</sub>, TEOS (tetraethylorthosilicate), TMCTS (tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane) or DADBS (diacetoxyditertiarybutoxysilane) may be used. The reactant gas introduced into the process chamber <b>102</b>B is typically SiH<sub>4</sub>—NH<sub>3</sub>. However, instead of SiH<sub>4</sub>, SiF<sub>6</sub>, NF<sub>3 </sub>or SiF<sub>4 </sub>may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0120">Upon receiving the instruction, the conveyor section <b>320</b> moves the object W to the preheating section <b>340</b> so as to heat the object W. When the temperature sensor (not shown in the figure) of the cluster tool <b>300</b> detects that the object W to be processed is heated to a temperature of about 300° C., the control unit of the cluster tool <b>300</b> sends an instruction to the conveyor section <b>320</b> to move the object W to be processed from the preheating section <b>340</b> to the process chamber <b>102</b> through the gate valve <b>101</b>. Accordingly, the conveyor arm of the conveyor section <b>320</b> conveys the heated object W to the process chamber <b>102</b> through the gate valve <b>101</b>. When the heated object W reaches a position above the susceptor <b>104</b> in the process chamber <b>102</b>, the lifter pin vertically moving system moves the lifter pins (not shown in the figure) so as to support the object W by the three lifter pins (not shown in the figure) protruding from the upper surface of the susceptor <b>104</b>. After the object W is transferred from the conveyor arm to the lifter pins, the conveyor arm returns through the gate vale <b>101</b>. Thereafter, the conveyor arm may be moved to a home position (not shown in the figure).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0121">After the object W is transferred to the lifter pins, the vertical moving unit <b>146</b> moves the vertical moving member <b>142</b> downward so as to return the lifter pins inside the susceptor <b>104</b> and place the object W on the susceptor <b>104</b>. At this time, a susceptor moving member can be moved while maintaining the hermetic seal of the process chamber <b>102</b> by a bellows (not shown in the figure). The susceptor <b>104</b> heats the object W placed thereon to a temperature of 300° C. At this time, since the object W is preheated, it takes a short time to completely the process preparation. More specifically, the heater control unit <b>191</b> controls the heater unit <b>198</b> so as to raise the temperature of the susceptor <b>104</b> to 300° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0122">Thereafter, the high-vacuum pump <b>106</b> maintains the pressure in the process chamber <b>102</b> at 50 mTorr by being controlled by the pressure adjust valve. Additionally, the valves <b>151</b> and <b>153</b> are opened, and the vacuum pumps <b>152</b> and <b>154</b> evacuate gas form the gas supply rings <b>140</b> and <b>170</b>. As a result, a water component remaining in the gas supply rings <b>140</b> and <b>170</b> is sufficiently removed therefrom.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0123">Additionally, the susceptor vertically moving system moves the susceptor <b>104</b> and the object W to a predetermined process position from a home position. The bellows (not shown in the figure) maintains the negative pressure environment in the process chamber <b>102</b> during the vertically moving operation, and prevents an atmosphere from exiting outside the process chamber <b>102</b>. Thereafter, the valves <b>151</b> and <b>153</b> are closed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0124">Thereafter, the valves <b>132</b> and <b>162</b> are opened so as to introduce a mixture of NH3, helium, nitrogen and hydrogen into the process chamber <b>102</b> from the gas supply rings <b>140</b> and <b>170</b> via the mass flow controllers <b>134</b> and <b>164</b>. Since the valves <b>151</b> and <b>153</b> are closed, the vacuum pump <b>152</b> and <b>154</b> do not evacuate the gases in the gas supply systems <b>130</b> and <b>160</b> from being introduced into the process chamber <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0125">When the shower plate <b>250</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is used, the process chamber <b>102</b> is maintained, for example, at 50 mTorr, and a mixture of helium, nitrogen, hydrogen and NH<sub>3</sub>, for example, is supplied to the dielectric plate <b>240</b>. Thereafter, the mixture gas is introduced into the process chamber by being passed through the gap space <b>242</b>, the recessed portions <b>246</b> and the nozzle passages <b>268</b> and <b>269</b> of the eject members <b>260</b>. The mixture gas is not converted into plasma, and is introduced into the process chamber <b>102</b> with a high controllability of flow and a uniform density.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0126">The temperature of the process space of the process chamber <b>102</b> is adjusted to be 300° C. A microwave is generated by the microwave generator <b>110</b>, and is supplied to the wavelength-reducing member <b>124</b> of the antenna member <b>120</b> in a TEM mode via a square waveguide or a coaxial waveguide. The microwave passing through the wavelength-reducing member <b>124</b> is reduced in its wavelength, and enters the slot electrode <b>200</b>. The microwave is then introduced into the process chamber <b>102</b> via the slits <b>210</b> and the dielectric material plate <b>230</b>. Since a temperature of the wavelength reducing member <b>124</b> and the slot electrode <b>200</b> is controlled, there is no deformation due to thermal expansion. Accordingly, an optimum length of the slits <b>210</b> can be maintained. Thus, the microwave can be introduced into the process chamber <b>102</b> at a desired density without local concentration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0127">Thereafter, the reactant gas in the process chamber <b>102</b> is converted into plasma by the microwave, and a plasma CVD process is performed on the object W placed on the susceptor <b>104</b>. If the baffle plate <b>194</b> is used, the baffle plate maintains the potential in the process space so as to prevent the microwave from exiting the process space. Thus, a desired process speed can be maintained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0128">If a temperature of the susceptor <b>104</b> is raised higher than a predetermined upper limit temperature due to continuous use, the susceptor <b>104</b> is cooled by the temperature control unit <b>191</b>. On the other hand, if the temperature of the susceptor <b>104</b> is below a predetermined lower limit temperature at an initial stage of the operation of the apparatus or when the susceptor <b>104</b> is over cooled, the temperature control unit <b>191</b> heats the susceptor <b>104</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0129">The plasma CVD process is continued for a predetermined period of time (for example, about 2 minutes). Thereafter, the object W is taken but of the process chamber <b>102</b> through the gate valve <b>101</b> by the conveyor section <b>320</b> of the cluster tool <b>300</b> in a reversed way of the above-mentioned procedure. When the susceptor <b>104</b> is taken out, the vertically moving mechanism (not shown in the figure) returns the susceptor <b>104</b> and the object W to the home position. The predetermined process time of 2 minutes is determined by a CVD processing time generally required for forming the layered nitride film. That is, even if the temperature control unit <b>190</b> sets the temperature to about 250° C. to 350° C., a long time deposition process may cause a problem similar to when the temperature is set higher than 350° C. Additionally, if the process time is too short, there may be a case in which a semiconductor element produced from the object W cannot effectively prevent a leak current.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0130">Since the microwave is uniformly supplied to the process chamber <b>102</b> with a predetermined density, a silicon oxidation film and a silicon nitride film having a desired thickness are formed on the object W to be processed. Additionally, since the temperature of the process chamber <b>102</b> is maintained in the predetermined range so that a water component (impurities) does not enter the object W, the deposited film can be maintained at a desired quality. The object W taken out of the process chamber <b>102</b> is transferred to the cooling section <b>360</b> and the object W is cooled to a room temperature in a short time. Then, if necessary, the object W is conveyed by the conveyor section <b>320</b> to a next stage apparatus such as an ion implantation apparatus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0131">A description will now be given, with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, of a second embodiment of the present invention. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is an illustration of a structure of a microwave plasma processing apparatus <b>400</b> according to the second embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, parts that are the same as the parts shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are given the same reference numerals, and descriptions thereof will be omitted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0132">Similar to the first embodiment, the second embodiment of the present invention is specifically related to an evacuating arrangement to evacuate gas from a gas-introducing part provided in a process chamber of the microwave plasma processing apparatus <b>400</b>. In the first embodiment, the evacuating arrangement is comprised of the vacuum pump <b>151</b> or <b>153</b>, which evacuates gas remaining in the gas supply ring <b>140</b> or <b>170</b>. On the other hand, in the second embodiment, the evacuating arrangement is comprised of a bypass passage, which directly connects the gas supply ring <b>140</b> or <b>170</b> to the vacuum pump <b>106</b> by bypassing the process chamber <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0133">More specifically, in the plasma processing apparatus <b>400</b> according to the second embodiment, the outlet port of the gas supply ring <b>140</b> is connected to an end of a bypass passage <b>182</b>, and the other end of the bypass passage <b>182</b> is connected to the vacuum pump <b>106</b>, which is originally provided to the plasma processing apparatus <b>400</b> so as to evacuate gas from the process chamber <b>102</b>. Additionally, a valve <b>181</b> is provided to the bypass passage <b>182</b> so as to open or close the bypass passage <b>182</b>. Similarly, the outlet port of the gas supply ring <b>170</b> is connected to an end of a bypass passage <b>184</b>, and the other end of the bypass passage <b>184</b> is connected to the vacuum pump <b>106</b>. Additionally, a valve <b>183</b> is provided to the bypass passage <b>184</b> so as to open or close the bypass passage <b>184</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is an illustration of the evacuating arrangement of the above-mentioned gas-evacuating arrangement.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0134">In the present embodiment, each of the bypass passages <b>182</b> and <b>184</b> has a diameter of 25 mm to 40 mm, which is greater than the diameter of the gas supply nozzles <b>143</b> and <b>172</b>. Thus, the vacuum pump <b>106</b> can evacuate gas remaining in the gas supply rings <b>140</b> and <b>170</b> more efficiently and more rapidly than when the gas is evacuated through the gas supply nozzles <b>143</b> and <b>173</b>. It should be noted that although the bypass passages <b>182</b> and <b>184</b> are connected to the high-vacuum pump <b>106</b>, the bypass passages <b>182</b> and <b>184</b> may be connected to a roughing pump or other vacuum pumps originally provided to the plasma processing apparatus <b>400</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0135">In the present embodiment, the gas supply system <b>130</b> or <b>160</b> may be arranged to use the dielectric plate <b>240</b> and the shower plate <b>250</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. In such a case, the outlet port <b>244</b> of the dielectric plate is connected to the bypass passage <b>182</b> or <b>184</b> so that the gas passage <b>242</b> is connected to the vacuum pump <b>6</b> by bypassing the process chamber <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0136">It should be noted that the microwave plasma processing apparatuses <b>100</b> and <b>400</b> can utilize an electron cyclotron resonance, and therefore, an electromagnetic coil may be provided so as to generate a magnetic field in the process chamber <b>102</b>. Additionally, although the microwave plasma processing apparatus <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment performs the plasma CVD process as plasma processing, the plasma processing is not limited to the plasma CVD process. That is, for example, a plasma etching process or a plasma cleaning process may be performed by the microwave plasma processing apparatus <b>100</b>. Additionally, the present invention is not limited to the RLSA type plasma processing apparatus, and may be applied to a parallel plate plasma processing apparatus utilizing a grow discharge. Further, the object W to be processed by the microwave plasma processing apparatus <b>100</b> is not limited to the wafer for producing a semiconductor device, and the microwave plasma processing apparatus <b>100</b> may be used to process an LCD substrate or a glass substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0137">The present invention is not limited to the specifically disclosed embodiments, and variations and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.</div>
