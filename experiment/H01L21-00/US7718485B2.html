<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This invention relates to integrated circuits, and more particularly to integrated circuits that have an interlayer dielectric that is stressed to improve performance of the integrated circuits.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">One of the techniques that has been under development to improve transistor mobility is strained silicon. Typically the silicon layer is put under tensile stress to improve the N channel mobility. This has been extended to using an interlayer dielectric (ILD), a dielectric layer between conductive layers, that is under a selected stress to improve transistor performance. For N channel transistors this has meant using tensile stress, and for P channel transistors this has meant using compressive stress.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">In one aspect an integrated circuit that has both logic and a static random access memory (SRAM) array has improved performance by treating the interlayer dielectric (ILD) differently for the SRAM array than for the logic. The N channel logic and N channel SRAM transistors both have ILDs with non-compressive stress, the P channel transistor ILD has compressive stress, and the P channel SRAM transistors at least have less compressive stress than the P channel logic transistors, i.e., the P channel SRAM transistors may be compressive but with less magnitude of such compressive stress than the logic P channel transistors, may be relaxed, or may be tensile. It has been found to be advantageous for the integrated circuit for the P channel SRAM transistors to have a lower mobility than the P channel logic transistors. The P channel SRAM transistors having lower mobility results in better write performance; either better write time or write margin at lower power supply voltage. This is better understood by reference to the drawings and the following description.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">Shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a semiconductor device <b>10</b> comprising using an SOI substrate comprising a relatively thick insulating layer <b>12</b> and a semiconductor layer <b>14</b>. Semiconductor layer <b>14</b> is preferably silicon but could be another semiconductor material such as silicon germanium or silicon carbon. Insulating layer <b>12</b> is preferably oxide but could be another insulating material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">Semiconductor device <b>10</b> has built therein a logic region <b>16</b> and an SRAM array region <b>18</b>. Shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, logic portion <b>16</b> comprises an N channel transistor <b>20</b> and a P channel transistor <b>22</b>. Transistors <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> are representative of many other, typically millions, N and P channel transistors that would be present on a typical integrated circuit for the purpose of forming logic function circuits such as logic gates, registers, and processing units, as well as other logic function circuits. Similarly shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, SRAM array portion <b>18</b> comprises an N channel transistor <b>24</b> and a P channel transistor <b>26</b>. Transistors <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> are similarly representative of many other, typically millions, N and P channel transistors that would form an SRAM array. Logic transistors <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> are isolated from each other and other transistors by isolation regions <b>28</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>32</b> formed in semiconductor layer <b>14</b>. Similarly SRAM transistors <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> are separated from each other and other SRAM transistors by isolation regions <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, and <b>38</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">Shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is semiconductor device <b>10</b> after deposition of a dielectric layer <b>40</b> over logic portion <b>16</b> and SRAM array portion <b>18</b>. Dielectric layer <b>40</b> is deposited with tensile stress. An exemplary material of dielectric layer <b>40</b> is silicon nitride deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). The amount of tensile stress is selectable based on the parameters of the deposition. Dielectric layer <b>40</b> has a thickness of about half the height of the gate of transistors <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, and <b>26</b>. In this example, that would make dielectric layer <b>40</b> about 500 Angstroms in thickness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">Shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is semiconductor device <b>10</b> after selectively removing dielectric layer from transistor <b>22</b>, which is a P channel transistor, which suffers a reduction in mobility with tensile stress.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">Shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is semiconductor device <b>10</b> after deposition of a dielectric layer <b>42</b> over logic portion <b>16</b> and SRAM array portion <b>18</b>. Dielectric layer <b>42</b> is deposited with compressive stress and of substantially the same thickness as dielectric layer <b>40</b>. Dielectric layer <b>42</b> is also preferably silicon nitride deposited by PECVD but with the parameters chosen to make it compressive.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">Shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is semiconductor device <b>10</b> after selectively etching dielectric layer <b>42</b> so that dielectric layer <b>42</b> remains only over transistor <b>22</b> with a small overlap over dielectric layer <b>40</b>. The etch, although done with a mask step, does result in dielectric layer <b>40</b> being exposed to the etch after dielectric layer <b>42</b> has been etched through. Because both dielectric layers <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> are of similar composition, silicon nitride formed with different parameters, there is a small selectivity between the two layers. Thus, this is preferably a timed etch. It may be desirable to form dielectric layer <b>40</b> to a little more thickness than dielectric layer <b>42</b> to account for some over-etch into dielectric layer <b>40</b>. The result at this point is that N channel transistors <b>20</b> and <b>24</b> have an ILD that is tensile, the SRAM P channel has an ILD that is tensile, and the logic P channel has an ILD that is compressive. This provides for enhanced mobility for transistors <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, and <b>24</b> and reduced mobility for transistor <b>26</b>. Transistor <b>26</b>, as a P channel transistor in an SRAM array, is used as a pull-up transistor. Such pull-up transistor with lower mobility improves write performance. This write performance can be either in the write margin for low power supply voltage applications or for a faster write.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">Shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is semiconductor device <b>10</b> after formation of a dielectric layer <b>44</b> that completes formation of an ILD over transistors <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, and <b>26</b>. Dielectric layer <b>44</b> is preferably an oxide such as TEOS or another oxide such as doped glass or even another insulating type of material. Dielectric layer <b>44</b> is preferably of a material that can be planarized and has a stress that is or is nearly relaxed. After completion of dielectric layer <b>44</b>, metal layer formation can proceed for providing interconnect for the integrated circuit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">Shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a semiconductor device <b>45</b> that follows from semiconductor device <b>10</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> after an etch that removes dielectric layer from over transistor <b>26</b> as well as transistor <b>22</b>. Analogous features from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref> are retained for <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">Shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is semiconductor device <b>45</b> after deposition of dielectric layer <b>42</b>, which deposition is the same as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, over transistors <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, and <b>26</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">Shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is semiconductor device <b>45</b> after selectively removing layer <b>42</b> from over transistors <b>20</b>, <b>24</b>, and <b>26</b>. The partial removal of dielectric layer <b>42</b> is performed in the same as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The result in this case is that transistor <b>26</b> does not have a dielectric layer in the manner that transistors <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, and <b>24</b> have.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">Shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is semiconductor device <b>45</b> after deposition of a dielectric layer <b>46</b> over logic portion <b>16</b> and SRAM array portion <b>18</b>. This dielectric layer is also substantially the same thickness as dielectric layers <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> is also silicon nitride deposited by PECVD. In this case the deposition parameters are chosen so that dielectric layer <b>46</b> is at least less compressive than dielectric layer <b>42</b>. This means that dielectric layer <b>46</b> is one of compressive but less compressive than dielectric layer <b>42</b>, relaxed, or tensile. If tensile, this would preferably be of an amount different than that of dielectric layer <b>40</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">Shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is semiconductor device <b>45</b> after dielectric layer <b>46</b> has been selectively removed from over transistors <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, and <b>24</b>. This results in N channel transistors <b>20</b> and <b>24</b> having an ILD that is tensile, P channel transistor <b>22</b> having an ILD that is compressive, and P channel transistor <b>46</b> having an ILD that is at least less compressive than that of transistor <b>42</b>. The SRAM cells thus have a pull-up transistor that has less mobility than the P channel transistor used in the logic portion of the integrated circuit. This is beneficial for SRAM cells and results in improved write margin or write speed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">Shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is semiconductor device <b>45</b> with a completed ILD showing the formation of a dielectric layer <b>44</b>, which is planar, over transistors <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, and <b>26</b>. Metal interconnect formation can proceed over dielectric layer <b>44</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">Shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a semiconductor device <b>49</b> that follows from semiconductor device <b>45</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> after an etch that removes dielectric layer <b>42</b> from over transistors <b>20</b> and <b>24</b> so that dielectric layer <b>42</b> remains over transistors <b>22</b> and <b>26</b>. Analogous features from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-12</figref> are retained for <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. At this stage P channel transistors <b>22</b> and <b>26</b> have the same compressive stress.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">Shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is semiconductor device <b>49</b> after forming an implant mask <b>50</b> over transistors <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, and <b>24</b> and implanting with an implant <b>52</b> into dielectric layer <b>42</b> to cause it to convert to a dielectric layer <b>54</b> that at least has less compressive stress than dielectric layer <b>42</b>. Implant mask <b>50</b> is preferably photoresist but could be another appropriate material. Implant <b>52</b> is preferably xenon but could be another implant species that would have the effect of reducing the amount of compressive stress of dielectric layer <b>54</b>. This implant is particularly useful in causing dielectric layer <b>42</b> to become relaxed. The result of the implant is to have P channel pull-ups in the SRAM cells that have less mobility and thus result in improved write margin or improved write speed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">Shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a semiconductor device <b>55</b> that follows from semiconductor device <b>10</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> after formation of an implant mask <b>56</b> is formed over transistors <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, and <b>24</b>. Analogous features from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref> are retained for <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. This shows that a portion of dielectric layer <b>40</b> that is over transistor <b>26</b> is exposed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">Shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is semiconductor device <b>55</b> after performing an implant <b>58</b> that reduces the tensile stress of the exposed portion of dielectric layer <b>40</b> so that it becomes dielectric layer <b>60</b>. This approach is particularly useful when it is desired that the P channel pull-up be somewhat tensile, to reduce the mobility, but not so tensile as for the N channel transistors. If the pull-up becomes too tensile, the read static noise margin can degrade. The result of the implant is still to have P channel pull-ups in the SRAM cells that have less mobility than the logic P channels and thus result in improved write margin or improved write speed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">Various changes and modifications to the embodiments herein chosen for purposes of illustration will readily occur to those skilled in the art. For example, the order of formation of dielectric layers can be changed. Instead of forming tensile layer <b>40</b> first, compressive layer <b>42</b> could be formed first. Also these embodiments have been shown using an SOI substrate but another substrate type, such as bulk or bulk-SOI hybrid, could also be used. To the extent that such modifications and variations do not depart from the spirit of the invention, they are intended to be included within the scope thereof which is assessed only by a fair interpretation of the following claims.</div>
