<heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">The present invention relates to a semiconductor package, and in particular to a flip-chip semiconductor package.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">Recent demand for lighter and thinner high-performance electronic devices has led to electronic devices with higher density integration and higher density packaging, and the semiconductor packages used in such electronic devices are becoming ever smaller than in the past.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Because of the limited ability to reduce the size of semiconductor packages that have a configuration employing conventional lead frames, area mounted types of semiconductor packages such as ball grid arrays (BGA) and chip scale packages (CSP) comprising semiconductor elements mounted on circuit boards have recently been proposed. In these semiconductor packages, known ways to connect semiconductor elements mounted on BGA to circuit boards include wire bonding, TAB (tape automated bonding), and flip-chip (FC) methods, but an abundance of BGA or CSP structures employing flip-chip connecting methods useful for the miniaturization of semiconductor packages have recently been proposed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">The flip-chip connecting method of mounting is thought to be more advantageous than wire bonding methods because less area is needed for mounting. Flip-chip, mounting is also characterized by good electrical properties because the circuit wiring is shorter. Flip-chip mounting is an excellent connecting method for the circuits of portable devices which, due to strong demand, need to be made smaller and thinner, high frequency circuits which are highly regarded for their electrical properties, and so forth.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">In flip-chip mounting, interposers that have a core layer and a build-up layer are generally used to connect semiconductor elements. In the interposers, the need to handle even higher density packaging and to meet demand for faster operating frequencies has resulted in the proposal of a thin build-up interpose, wherein a smaller overall interposer thickness and a shorter interlayer connection length for handling higher frequencies are achieved by making a thinner core layer or by dispensing with the core layer altogether and using an interposer that is a laminate in which wiring patterns are formed in resin or the like (Patent Document 1, for example).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Vertical continuous connections in the build-up layers of the interposer, referred to as stacked via connections, are being adopted to handle ever higher frequency transmissions. Stacked vias comprise vias stacked up directly on top of each other in a plurality of stages, allowing the wiring distance to be shortened and thereby effectively reducing inductance (Patent Document 2, for example).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">In flip chip-mounted semiconductor packages, the gaps between semiconductor elements and circuit boards are usually filled with a reinforcing resin composition (underfill) to ensure the reliability of the connections between semiconductor elements, circuit boards, and metal bumps, etc. Thermosetting resins such as epoxy resins have been widely used in the past as an underfill material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">In these semiconductor devices, the functioning surfaces of silicon chips are electrically connected to circuit boards through a conductive material oriented toward the circuit board side, and the gaps between the silicon chips and circuit boards are filled with a thermosetting resin composition that is then cured. The thermosetting resin compositions also have C<sub>10 </sub>to C<sub>30 </sub>linear aliphatic hydrocarbon compounds which chemically combine with the thermosetting resin. These have high temperature cycle reliability, yet allow silicon chips to be removed at low temperature and low shear force, without damaging the silicon chips or circuit boards (Patent Document 3, for example).</div>

<heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading>Problem to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">However, there is room for the following improvements in the prior art described in the above documents.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">First, circuit boards and semiconductor elements have different coefficients of linear expansions. Circuit boards are composed of materials that contain organic resins, and have a greater coefficient of linear expansion than semiconductor elements. The thermal hysteresis of semiconductor packages with a structure comprising semiconductor elements mounted on a circuit board thus leads to warping in the circuit board due to the difference in the coefficient of linear expansion between the two.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">The problem of warping also occurs in thin build-up interposers employing a coreless structure with no core member.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">Second, the temperature cycle reliability of semiconductor packages varies tremendously depending on the inner layer circuitry structure of the circuit board that is used. Specifically, the reliability varies significantly depending on the number of through holes in the core layer or the number of stacked vias in the build-up layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">The circuit boards using interposers have stacked via connections, resulting in problems with reliability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">Third, the semiconductor element structural materials and metal bump materials for connecting semiconductors and circuit boards that are used now are different from those used in the past, and there is thus a need to design new underfill that would be suitable for such new materials. Lead-free structural materials for bumps have also entered the mainstream out of concern for the environment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">The damage noted above, such as cracking, becomes more pronounced when lead-free solder is used. The inadequate toughness of lead-free solder also tends to result in cracks at the interface between metal bumps and semiconductor elements or circuit boards.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">With the foregoing in view, it is an object of the present invention to overcome drawbacks in the prior art, and in particular to surely inhibit or reduce cracking or delamination so as to improve reliability when circuit boards with stacked vias are used as circuit boards for semiconductor packages, and to expand the potential range of the design for the inner layer circuitry of circuit boards, so as to provide a flip-chip semiconductor package, build-up layer material, and sealing resin composition allowing the connecting wiring length of the inner layer circuitry to be shortened and the inductance to be reduced.</div>

<heading>Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">It is possible to surely inhibit or reduce cracking or delamination caused by the concentration of stress around the boundary interface between semiconductor elements and sealing resin compositions by using a connecting structure for a flip-chip semiconductor package, comprising: a circuit board having a core layer and a build-up layer, a semiconductor element connected via metal bumps to the circuit board, and a sealing resin composition with which gaps between the semiconductor element and circuit board is filled, wherein a cured product of the sealing resin composition has a glass transition temperature between 60° C. and 150° C., and a coefficient of linear expansion from room temperature to the glass transition temperature being between 15 ppm/° C. and 35 ppm/° C., a cured product of the build-up layer has a glass transition temperature of at least 170° C., and a coefficient of linear expansion in the in-plane direction up to the glass transition temperature being not more than 40 ppm/° C., and stacked vias are provided in the build-up layer on at least one side of the core layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">Embodiments of the flip-chip semiconductor package structure according to the invention are illustrated in detail below with reference to drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">&lt;Structure of Semiconductor Package&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic cross section illustrating the structure of a flip-chip semiconductor package in a first embodiment of the invention. In the figure, <b>1</b> is a circuit board, and <b>2</b> is a semiconductor element arranged on the circuit board, where the thickness ranges, for example, from about 100 μm to 750 μm. The upper surface (electrode surface to be connected to the semiconductor) of the circuit board <b>1</b> and the electrode surface on the underside of the semiconductor element <b>2</b> are joined in the flip-chip manner by solder balls <b>3</b> as metal bumps. A sealing resin composition <b>4</b> is then injected between the circuit board <b>1</b> and the semiconductor element <b>2</b>. The inner layer structure of the circuit board <b>1</b> comprises a core layer <b>5</b> in the middle, with build-up layers <b>6</b> stacked above and below the core layer <b>5</b>. For interconnection in the circuit board <b>1</b>, the connection between the upper and lower parts in the core layer <b>5</b> is secured through holes <b>7</b>, and the interlayer connection in the build-up layers <b>6</b> is secured stacked vias <b>8</b>. An external connecting terminal <b>9</b> is formed on the surface opposite the surface where the chip is mounted, and the external connecting terminal <b>9</b> is connected to a mother board.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">&lt;Constituent of Sealing Resin Composition&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a resin meeting the following properties is used in one embodiment of the sealing resin composition <b>4</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">(1) A resin whose cured product has a glass transition point of 60 to 150° C., and preferably 70 to 115° C., as determined by TMA.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">(2) A resin with a coefficient of linear expansion of 15 to 35 ppm/° C., and preferably 20 to 35 ppm/° C., when cured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">The coefficient of linear expansion can be determined, for example, at a heating rate of 10° C./min using a TMA device (mfd. by TA Instruments Co., Ltd.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">The use of a sealing resin composition <b>4</b> having these properties will allow differences in the coefficient of linear expansion between the semiconductor element <b>2</b> and the sealing resin composition <b>4</b> to be reduced, thus making it possible to even more effectively inhibit or reduce cracking or delamination caused by stress concentrated around the boundary interface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">The thermosetting shrinkage percentage of the sealing resin composition <b>4</b> is greater than the thermal shrinkage percentage of the circuit board <b>1</b> or semiconductor element <b>2</b>, and warping therefore occurs due to differences between the structural components as a result of changes in the ambient temperature or the like, so that stress becomes concentrated in particular around the boundaries of the structural components and tends to result in cracking. Therefore, a sealing resin composition <b>4</b> having a low coefficient of linear expansion and glass transition temperature meeting the above conditions are used to achieve the effect of alleviating thermal stress produced by differences in the coefficient of linear expansion or the like between the sealing resin composition <b>4</b> and the circuit board <b>1</b> or semiconductor element <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the sealing resin composition <b>4</b> may be a resin including at least one epoxy resin, and also may be one that includes a curing agent, silane coupler, and inorganic filler. Such a sealing resin composition <b>4</b> will preferably have better heat resistance, dielectric properties, and the like to help improve reliability, and will preferably lower the elastic modulus or glass transition temperature of the cured product through adjustment of the cross linking density, thereby contributing to the mechanisms for lowering stress noted above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">A more detailed description of the sealing resin composition <b>4</b> will be given here. The sealing resin composition <b>4</b> is a thermoset resin composition. One embodiment of the invention is a cured product of a liquid epoxy resin composition containing (A) an epoxy resin, (B) curing agent, (C) silane coupler, and (D) inorganic filler. The sealing resin composition <b>4</b> may also include (E) other additives as needed in addition to the components (A) through (D) above. The components are described below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">The molecular weight or structure of the epoxy resin (A) used in the sealing resin composition <b>4</b> is not particularly limited as long as there are at least 2 epoxy groups per molecule. Examples include Novolak-type epoxy resins, bisphenol-type epoxy resins, aromatic glycidylamine-type epoxy resins, hydroquinone-type epoxy resins, biphenyl-type epoxy resins, stilbene-type epoxy resins, triphenol methane-type epoxy resins, triphenol propane-type epoxy resins, alkyl-modified triphenol methane-type epoxy resins, triazine nucleus-containing epoxy resins, dicyclopentadiene-modified phenol-type epoxy resin, naphthol-type epoxy resins, naphthalene-type epoxy resins, phenol aralkyl-type epoxy resins, naphthol aralkyl-type epoxy resins, and aliphatic epoxy resins.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">In this case, those comprising a glycidyl ether structure or glycidylamine structure bonded to an aromatic ring are preferred for the sake of heat resistance, mechanical properties, and moisture resistance. The amount in which aliphatic or alicyclic epoxy resins are used is preferably limited for the sake of reliability, particularly adhesiveness. These may be used singly, or in combinations of two or more. In a preferred embodiment of the sealing resin composition <b>4</b> of the invention, the epoxy resins will ultimately be in the form of a liquid at ordinary temperature (25° C.), but epoxy resins that are solids at ordinary temperature may be used as long as they can be dissolved to be turned to liquid epoxy resins at ordinary temperature and as a result they can be in a liquid state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">The molecular weight or structure of the curing agent (B) used in the sealing resin composition <b>4</b> is not particularly limited, provided that the curing agent (B) has two or more functional groups per molecule capable of forming covalent bounds with epoxy groups in the epoxy resin, but has one or more acid anhydride groups when the functional groups are acid anhydride groups. Examples of functional groups include phenolic hydroxyl groups, acid anhydride groups, and amino groups, specifically, phenol resins, acid anhydrides, and primary and secondary amines.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">The above curing agents may be used either singly or in combinations of two or more containing the same functional groups. Combinations of two or more containing different functional groups may also be used, provided that the pot life or curability of epoxy resin is not thereby compromised. In consideration of semiconductor package sealing applications, phenol resins and aromatic polyamine-type curing agents are preferred for the sake of heat resistance and electrical and mechanical properties. Aromatic polyamine-type curing agents are also preferred as they also provide adhesion and moisture resistance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">The amount in which the curing agent is blended ranges from 0.6 to 1.4, and preferably 0.7 to 1.3, in terms of the epoxy equivalent of the epoxy resin to the active hydrogen equivalent of the curing agent (epoxy equivalent/active hydrogen equivalent). The use of a curing agent having an active hydrogen equivalent outside this range is undesirable as the reactivity or the heat resistance of the composition will be significantly impaired. However, when the functional groups of the curing agent are acid anhydride groups, it can be calculated as containing 2 active hydrogens per one acid anhydride group because two carboxylic acid groups may be derived from one acid anhydride group.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">As long as the silane coupler (C) used in the sealing resin composition <b>4</b> includes, as its chemical structure, an alkoxy group-bonded silicon atom and a functional group-bonded hydrocarbon moiety per molecule, its molecular weight or structure is not particularly limited. Examples include epoxy silane coupling agents such as 3-glycidoxypropyl trimethoxysilane, 3-glycidoxypropyl triethoxysilane, 3-glycidoxypropylmethyl dimethoxysilane, 3-glycidoxypropylethyl diethoxysilane, and 2-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl) ethyl trimethoxysilane; acrylate group-bonded silane couplers such as 3-methacryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane, 3-methacryloxypropyl triethoxysilane, 3-methacryloxypropylmethyl dimethoxysilane, 3-methacryloxypropylethyl diethoxysilane, and 3-acryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane; aminosilane coupling agents such as N-aminoethylated aminopropylmethyl dialkoxysilanes, N-aminoethylated aminopropyl trialkoxysilanes, 3-aminopropyl trimethoxysilane, 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane, N-phenyl-γ-aminopropyl trimethoxysilane, N-phenyl-γ-aminopropyl triethoxysilane, N-phenyl-γ-aminobutyl trimethoxysilane, and N-phenyl-γ-aminobutyl triethoxysilane; latent aminosilane couplers in which the primary amino group of an aminosilane coupler has been protected by reaction with a ketone or aldehyde, such as N-(1,3-dimethylbutylidene)-3-(triethoxysilyl) propylamine and N-(benzylidene)-3-(triethoxysilyl)propylamine; mercapto silane couplers such as 3-mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane and 3-mercaptopropylmethyl dimethoxysilane; and silane couplers which show the same functions as mercapto silane couplers upon thermal decomposition, such as bis(3-triethoxysilylpropyl) tetrasulfide and bis(3-triethoxysilylpropyl) disulfide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">These silane couplers may also be blended after being hydrolyzed. These may be used either singly or in combinations of two or more thereof. In the present invention, epoxy silane couplers are preferred because of their relatively good adhesion onto the surface of the circuit board and semiconductor package components (solder resist on the circuit board surface, polyimides on silicon chip surfaces, sides of silicone chips). Amino silane couplers, latent amino silane couplers, and mercapto silane couplers are preferred because of their extremely good adhesion with silicon nitride surfaces and polyimides on silicon chip surfaces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">The silane coupler may be blended by any blending method such as integral blending, where the coupler is blended, dispersed, and mixed at the same time that the silica filler is mixed with other materials in the process for producing the resin composition; a master batch method, where the coupler is dispersed and dissolved beforehand in the (A) epoxy resin, (B) aromatic amine curing agent, and/or additives other than silica filler coupler, and then blended with the remaining material; methods in which the coupler chemically modifies beforehand a silica filler surface; or combinations of such methods. More preferably, a master batch method or a combination of a master batch method and a method of modification on a silica surface can provide a uniform resin composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">Examples of the (D) inorganic filler used in the sealing resin composition <b>4</b> include silicates such as talc, fired clay, unfired clay, mica, and glass, oxides such as titanium oxide, alumina, fused silica (silica in the form of fused spheres and fused crushed silica), synthetic silica, and crystalline silica or other silica powders, carbonates such as calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, and hydrotalcite, hydroxides such as aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and calcium hydroxide, sulfates or sulfites such as barium sulfate, calcium sulfate, and calcium sulfite, borates such as zinc borate, barium meta-borate, aluminum borate, calcium borate, and sodium borate, and nitrides such as aluminum nitride, boron nitride, and silicon nitride. These inorganic fillers may be used singly or in mixtures thereof. Fused silica, crystalline silica, and synthetic silica powder are preferred because the resin composition can be improved in heat resistance, moisture resistance, strength, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">The shape of the inorganic filler is not particularly limited, but the shape is preferably spherical for the sake of the filling properties. In this case, the mean particle diameter of the inorganic filler is preferably 0.1 to 20 μm, and more preferably 0.2 to 8 μm. A mean particle diameter over the aforesaid lower limit will result in a resin composition with lower viscosity and thus better filling properties, and a mean particle diameter not exceeding the aforesaid upper limit will be less likely to result in clogging by resin when the semiconductor package gaps are filled with the resin composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">The sealing resin composition <b>4</b> may include other additives (E) such as stress-lowering materials, diluents, pigments, flame retardants, surfactants, leveling agents, and defoamers as needed in addition to the above ingredients.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">The sealing resin composition <b>4</b> may be produced by dispersing and kneading the ingredients, additives, and the like in a device such as a planetary mixer, triple roll, double heat roll, or mortar, and then defoaming the material in a vacuum. To remove volatile components from the raw materials, either beforehand or during the manufacturing stage, a heat treatment may be carried out at a temperature range such as 50° C. to 200° C. which will not result in the decomposition of the ingredients or a reaction between the curing agent and epoxy resin at atmospheric pressure or reduced pressure. The material may be aged for 12 to 96 hours at a temperature of 5° C. to 35° C. during or at the final stages of the dispersion and mixing process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">&lt;Circuit Board&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the circuit board <b>1</b> is a multi-layered circuit board on which are formed a core layer and at least one build-up layer containing a resin composition, wherein the core layer has through holes, which are conducting parts, and the build-up layer has stacked vias, which are conducting parts.</div>

Here, the coefficient of linear expansion in the in-plane direction can be determined, for example, at a heating rate of 10° C./min using a TMA device (mfd. by TA Instruments Co., Ltd.).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">If the glass transition temperature of the cured product of the resin part of the build-up layer is under 170° C., significant warping may result upon the return to room temperature after heating in the manufacturing process. The coefficient of linear expansion up to the glass transition temperature is a factor that controls warping in multi-layered circuit boards. The glass transition temperature of the build-up layer is preferable at least 175° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">If the coefficient of linear expansion of the cured product of the resin part in the build-up layer is greater than 40 ppm/° C., it will be more than double the coefficient of linear expansion of the copper used in most circuits (17 to 18 ppm/° C.), and will cause significant warping. The coefficient of linear expansion up to the glass transition temperature is preferably 10 to 35 ppm ° C./, and more preferably 15 to 30 ppm ° C./.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">The elastic modulus of the cured product of the resin part in the build-up layer at room temperature is preferably at least 5 Gpa.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0070">The material used for the resin part of the core layer in the circuit board <b>1</b> is not particularly limited and any material may be used, provided that the strength will be suitable. Materials that are suitable for use include materials in the form of sheets (referred to as prepregs) obtained by impregnating a fiber base (such as a glass fiber sheet) with a resin composition of at least one or more from among epoxy resins, phenol resins, cyanate resins, triazine resins, bismaleimide resins, polyimide resins, polyamide-imide resins, and benzocyclobutene resins, for example, and then semi-curing it. Particularly suitable are materials in the form of sheets (referred to as prepregs) obtained by impregnating a fiber base (such as a glass fiber sheet) with a resin composition containing cyanate resin, phenol resin, epoxy resin, and inorganic filler and semi-curing it.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">&lt;Build-Up Layer&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0072">The material used for the resin part of the build-up layer in the build-up layer is not limited and any material may be used, provided that the strength is suitable and the above conditions for the coefficient of linear expansion and glass transition temperature for the circuit board <b>1</b> are met, although it is preferably constituted of a resin composition containing a thermosetting resin. This will allow the heat resistance of the build-up layer to be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0073">A fiber base such as a glass fiber sheet may also be impregnated with the resin composition used for the build-up layer, and the resin composition may be cured as such. The method for impregnating the fiber base with the resin composition is not particularly limited. A build-up layer with a carrier base may also be formed by forming a rein layer composed of the above resin composition on a carrier base.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0074">Examples of thermosetting resins include epoxy resins, phenol resins, cyanate resins, triazine resins, bismaleimide resins, polyimide resins, polyamide-imide resins, benzocyclobutene resins, resins with benzoxazine rings, urea resins, resins with a triazine ring such as melamine resins, unsaturated polyester resins, polyurethane resins, diallyl phthalate resins, and silicone resins.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0075">One of these resins may be used alone, two or more thereof having different weight-average molecular weights may be combined, or one or more kinds thereof may be used in combination with the pre-polymers thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0076">At least one or more of epoxy resins, phenol resins, cyanate resins, triazine resins, bismaleimide resins, polyimide resins, polyamide-imide resins, benzocyclobutene resins, and resins with benzoxazine rings are preferred.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0077">Examples of epoxy resins include bisphenol-type epoxy resins such as bisphenol-A epoxy resins, bisphenol-F epoxy resins, bisphenol E-type epoxy resins, bisphenol S-type epoxy resins, bisphenol Z-type epoxy resins, bisphenol P-type epoxy resins, and bisphenol M-type epoxy resins, Novolak-type epoxy resins such as phenol Novolak-type epoxy resins and cresol Novolak epoxy resins, and epoxy resins such as biphenyl-type epoxy resins, biphenyl aralkyl-type epoxy resins, aryl alkylene-type epoxy resins, naphthalene-type epoxy resins, anthracene-type epoxy resins, phenoxy-type epoxy resins, dicyclopentadiene-type epoxy resins, norbornene-type epoxy resins, adamantane-type epoxy resins, and fluorene-type epoxy resins.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0078">Examples of phenol resins include Novolak-type phenol resins such as phenol Novolak resin, cresol Novolak resins, and bisphenol-A Novolak resins, resole-type phenol resins such as unmodified resole phenol resins, and oil modified resole phenol resins modified, for example, with wood oil, flaxseed oil, walnut oil, and other phenol resins.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0079">Of these, cyanate resins (including pre-polymers of cyanate resins) are preferred. This will allow the coefficient of linear expansion of the build-up layer to be lowered. The build-up layer will also have better electrical properties (low dielectric constant, low dielectric tangent), mechanical strength, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0080">Cyanate resins can be obtained, for example, through a reaction between a halogenated cyanogen compound and a phenol, and pre-polymerization by heating or the like as needed. Specific examples can include bisphenol-type cyanate resins such as Novolak-type cyanate resin, bisphenol A-type cyanate resin, bisphenol E-type cyanate resin, and tetramethyl bisphenol F-type cyanate resin. Of these, Novolak-type cyanate resin is preferred. This will allow heat resistance to be improved through increased cross linking density, and the flame retardant properties of the resin composition or the like to be improved. That is because the curing reaction is followed by the formation of a triazine ring in Novolak-type cyanate resin. Novolak-type cyanate resin is also believed to have a higher proportion of benzene rings on the structure and to be more susceptible to carbonization.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0081">Novolak-type cyanate resins represented by the following Formula (1) can be used, for example.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0083">The average repeating units n of Novolak-type cyanate resins represented by Formula (1) above are not particularly limited, but are preferably 1 to 10, and more preferably 2 to 7. If the average repeating units n are under the above-mentioned lower limit, the Novolak-type cyanate resin will tend to crystallize, and will have relatively low solubility in general purpose solvents, which may make it difficult to handle. When the average repeating units n are over the above-mentioned upper limit, the melt viscosity will be too high, and may result in poor build-up layer formability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0084">The weight-average molecular weight of the above cyanate resin is not particularly limited, but is preferably 500 to 4,500, and more preferably 600 to 3,000. A weight-average molecular weight under the above-mentioned lower limit may result in a cured product of the build-up layer with poor mechanical strength, and tack may develop when the build-up layer is produced, resulting in resin transfer. A weight-average molecular weight over the above-mentioned upper limit may slow down the curing reaction, and may result in poor formability and low peel strength between the layers when used for the formation of a substrate (particularly a circuit board).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0085">The weight-average molecular weight of the cyanate resin or the like can be determined, for example, by GPC (gel permeation chromatography; standard material: calculated in terms of polystyrene).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0086">Although not particularly limited, the cyanate resins, including its derivatives, may be used either singly or in combination of two or more kinds thereof with different weight-average molecular weights, or one or more kinds thereof may be used in combination with the pre-polymers thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0087">The content of the above thermosetting resin is not particularly limited, but is preferably 5 to 50 wt %, and more preferably 10 to 40 wt %, of the total of the resin composition. A content under the above-mentioned lower limit may result in difficulties with the formation of an insulating layer, and a content over the above-mentioned upper limit may lower the strength of the build-up layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0088">When a cyanate resin (especially a Novolak-type cyanate resin) is used as the thermosetting resin, it is preferably used in combination with an epoxy resin (substantially halogen-free).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0089">Examples of the above epoxy resins include bisphenol-type epoxy resins such as bisphenol-A epoxy resins, bisphenol-F epoxy resins, bisphenol E-type epoxy resins, bisphenol S-type epoxy resins, bisphenol Z-type epoxy resins, bisphenol P-type epoxy resins, and bisphenol M-type epoxy resins, Novolak epoxy resins such as phenol Novolak-type epoxy resins and cresol Novolak epoxy resins, aryl alkylene-type epoxy resins such as biphenyl-type epoxy resins, xylylene-type epoxy resins, and biphenyl aralkyl-type epoxy resins, naphthalene-type epoxy resins, anthracene-type epoxy resins, phenoxy-type epoxy resins, dicyclopentadiene-type epoxy resins, norbornene-type epoxy resins, adamantane-type epoxy resins, and fluorene-type epoxy resins.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0090">As the epoxy resins, these can be used either singly or in combination of two or more kinds thereof with different weight-average molecular weights, or one or more kinds thereof may be used in combination with the pre-polymers thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0091">Of these epoxy resins, aryl alkylene-type epoxy resins are particularly preferred. This will allow the solder heat resistance after moisture-absorption and flame retardance to be improved.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0094">The average repeating units n of the biphenyl dimethylene-type epoxy resins represented by Formula (2) above are not particularly limited but are preferably 1 to 10, and more preferably 2 to 5. If the average repeating units n are under the above-mentioned lower limit, the biphenyl dimethylene-type epoxy resin will tend to crystallize, and will have relatively low solubility in general purpose solvents, which may make it difficult to handle.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0095">Average repeating units n over the above-mentioned upper limit may lower the fluidity of the resin and cause poor formability, etc. A number of average repeating units n within the above range can ensure that a good balance of properties will be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0096">The content of the epoxy resin is not particularly limited, but is preferably 1 to 55 wt %, and more preferably 5 to 40 wt %, of the total of the resin composition. A content under the above-mentioned lower limit may lower the reactivity of the cyanate resin or lower the moisture resistance of the resulting product, whereas a content over the above-mentioned upper limit may deteriorate the low linear expansion and heat resistance properties.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0097">The weight-average molecular weight of the epoxy resin is not particularly limited, but is preferably 500 to 20,000, and more preferably 800 to 15,000. When the weight-average molecular weight is under the above-mentioned lower limit, tack may develop on the surface of the build-up layer, and a weight-average molecular weight over the above-mentioned upper limit may lower the solder heat resistance. A weight-average molecular weight within the above range can ensure that a good balance of properties will be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0098">The weight-average molecular weight of the epoxy resin can be determined, for example, by GPC.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0099">The above resin composition will preferably contain a film-forming resin. This will allow the film formability and handleability to be further improved when build-up layers with a carrier base are produced. Examples of film-forming resins include phenoxy-type resins, bisphenol F-type resins, and olefin-type resins. Such film-forming resins, including derivatives thereof, can be used singly or in combination of two or more kinds thereof with different weight-average molecular weights thereof can be used, or one or more kinds thereof may be used with the pre-polymers thereof. Phenoxy-type resins are preferred among them. This will allow the heat resistance and flame retardance to be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0100">The above phenoxy resins are not particularly limited. Examples include phenoxy resins with a bisphenol skeleton such as phenoxy resins with a bisphenol-A skeleton, phenoxy resins with a bisphenol-F skeleton, phenoxy resins with a bisphenol-S skeleton, phenoxy resins with a bisphenol-M skeleton, phenoxy resins with a bisphenol-P skeleton, and phenoxy resins with a bisphenol-Z skeleton, etc., phenoxy resins with a Novolak skeleton, phenoxy resins with an anthracene skeleton, phenoxy resins with a fluorene skeleton, phenoxy resins with a dicyclopentadiene skeleton, phenoxy resins with a norbornene skeleton, phenoxy resins with a naphthalene skeleton, phenoxy resins with a biphenyl skeleton, and phenoxy resins with an adamantane skeleton, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0101">Structures with plural kinds of the above skeletons can be used as the phenoxy resin, and phenoxy resins with different proportions of such skeletons can be used. Several phenoxy resins with different skeletons can also be used, several kinds of phenoxy resins with different weight-average molecular weights can be used, and their pre-polymers can be combined.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0102">Of these, phenoxy resins with a biphenyl skeleton and a bisphenol-S skeleton can be used. This will allow the glass transition temperature to be increased by means of the rigidity of the biphenyl skeleton, and will allow the adhesiveness of plated metal adhesion during the production of multi-layered circuit boards to be improved by means of the bisphenol-S skeleton.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0103">Phenoxy resins with a bisphenol-A skeleton and bisphenol-F skeleton can also be used. This will allow the adhesion onto the inner layer circuit board during the production of multi-layered circuit boards to be improved. Phenoxy resins with the above biphenyl skeleton and bisphenol-S skeleton can be combined with phenoxy resins that have a bisphenol-A skeleton and bisphenol-F skeleton.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0104">The molecular weight of the above film-forming resins is not particularly limited, but is preferably 1,000 to 100,000, and even more preferably 10,000 to 60,000.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0105">A film-forming resin with a weight-average molecular weight under the above-mentioned lower limit may not be sufficiently effective to improve the film formability. A weight-average molecular weight over the above-mentioned upper limit may lower the solubility of the film-forming resin. Keeping the weight-average molecular weight of the film-forming resin within the above range can ensure that a good balance of properties will be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0106">The content of the film-forming resin is not particularly limited, but is preferably 1 to 40 wt %, and more preferably 5 to 30 wt %, of the total of the resin composition. A film-forming resin content under the above-mentioned lower limit may be ineffective in improving the film formability, and a content over the above-mentioned upper limit may lower the effect in providing a low linear expansion, due to a correspondingly lower cyanate resin content. Keeping the content of the film-forming resin within the above range can ensure that a good balance of properties will be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0107">The above thermosetting resin and film-forming resin used in the build-up layers are all preferably substantially free of halogen atoms. This will allow flame retardance to be provided without the use of a halogen compound. Here, “substantially free of halogen atoms” means, for example, that the content of halogen atoms in the epoxy resin or phenoxy resin is no more than 0.15 wt % (JPCA-ES01-2003).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0108">A curing accelerator may also be used as needed in the resin composition. Well known curing accelerators can be used. Examples include organic metal salts such as imidazole compounds, zinc naphthenate, cobalt naphthenate, tin octylate, cobalt octylate, bis(acetylacetonato)cobalt (II), and tris(acetylacetonato)cobalt (III); tertiary amines such as triethylamine, tributylamine, and diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane; phenol compounds such as phenol, bisphenol A, and nonylphenol; organic acids such as acetic acid, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, and para-toluenesulfonic acid; or mixtures thereof. One kind of such curing accelerators, including derivatives thereof, can be used alone, or two or more kinds of the curing accelerators may be combined, including derivatives thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0109">Among these curing accelerators imidazole compounds are particularly desirable. This can improve the solder heat resistance after moisture absorption. Such imidazole compounds are not particularly limited, but will preferably be miscible with the above-mentioned cyanate resin, epoxy resin, and film-forming resin components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0110">Here, “be miscible with the above-mentioned cyanate resin, epoxy resin, and film-forming resin components” means that the imidazole compound has a property of being substantially dissolved at the molecular level or being dispersed to a state close to it, when mixed with the above cyanate resin, epoxy resin, and film-forming resin components or when mixed with these components and an organic solvent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0111">Examples of imidazole compounds that may be used in the resin composition of the build-up layers include 1-benzyl-2-methylimidazole, 1-benzyl-2-phenylimidazole, 2-phenyl-4-methylimidazole, 2-ethyl-4-methylimidazole, 2,4-diamino-6-[2′-methylimidazolyl-(1′)]-ethyl-s-triazine, 2,4-diamino-6-[2′-undecylimidazolyl]-ethyl-s-triazine, 2,4-diamino-6-[2′-ethyl-4-methylimidazolyl-(1′)]-ethyl-s-triazine, 2-phenyl-4,5-dihydroxymethylimidazole, and 2-phenyl-4-methyl-5-hydroxymethylimidazole.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0112">Of these, the imidazole is preferably selected from 1-benzyl-2-methylimidazole, 1-benzyl-2-phenylimidazole, and 2-ethyl-4-methylimidazole. These imidazole compounds have particularly good miscibility, and can therefore give cured products having a high uniformity and enable the formation of fine and uniform roughened surfaces, thus allowing fine conductor circuits to be readily formed and multi-layered circuit boards with high heat resistance to be produced. Such imidazole compounds can be used to effectively accelerate the reaction of the cyanate resin or epoxy resin and to provide equivalent properties even with smaller amounts of imidazole compounds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0113">Resin compositions in which such imidazole compounds have been used can be cured in a highly uniform manner from micro-matrix units between the resin components. This can improve the insulating properties and heat resistance of the build-up layers formed on the multi-layered circuit board.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0114">The content of the imidazole compound is not particularly limited but is preferably 0.01 to 5 wt %, and preferably 0.05 to 3 wt %, relative to the total of the cyanate resin and epoxy resin. This will allow the heat resistance in particular to be improved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0115">The above resin composition will also preferably include an inorganic filler. This will provide the low linear expansion and flame retardance properties to be improved. The elastic modulus can be improved by combining the cyanate resin and/or pre-polymer thereof (especially Novolak-type cyanate resin) with the inorganic filler.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0116">Examples of inorganic fillers include silicates such as talc, fired clay, unfired clay, mica, and glass, oxides such as titanium oxide, alumina, silica, and fused silica, carbonates such as calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, and hydrotalcite, hydroxides such as aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and calcium hydroxide, sulfates or sulfites such as barium sulfate, calcium sulfate, and calcium sulfite, borates such as zinc borate, barium meta-borate, aluminum borate, calcium borate, and sodium borate, nitrides such as aluminum nitride, boron nitride, silicon nitride, and carbon nitride, and titanates such as strontium titanate and barium titanate. These can be used as the inorganic filler either singly or in combination of two or more kinds. Of these, silica is preferred, and fused silica (particularly spherical fused silica) is desirable because of its low linear expansion. The configuration may be a pulverized or spherical form and a method suitable for the intended purpose is used, such as using spherical silica to lower the melt viscosity of the resin composition so that impregnation into the fiber base is ensured.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0117">The mean particle diameter of the inorganic filler is not particularly limited, but is preferably 0.01 to 5.0 μm, and more preferably 0.1 to 2.0 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0118">An inorganic filler with a mean particle diameter over the above-mentioned lower limit may result in a higher resin varnish viscosity when the resin composition of the invention is used to prepare a resin varnish, and may thus affect workability when producing a build-up layer with a carrier base. A mean particle diameter over the above-mentioned upper limit, however, may result in precipitation or the like of the inorganic filler in the resin varnish. Keeping the mean particle diameter of the inorganic filler within the above range can ensure that a good balance of properties will be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0119">The above inorganic filler material is not particularly limited, but an inorganic filler with a mono-disperse mean particle diameter can be used, as can an inorganic filler with a poly-disperse mean particle diameter. Inorganic fillers with a mono-disperse and/or poly-disperse mean particle diameter can be used either singly or in combinations of two or more kinds thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0120">The content of the inorganic filler is not particularly limited, but is preferably 20 to 70 wt %, and more preferably 30 to 60 wt % of the entire resin composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0121">An inorganic filler content under the above-mentioned lower limit may lower the effect in providing a low linear expansion and low moisture absorption. A content over the above-mentioned upper limit may lower the fluidity of the resin composition and thus lower the formability of the build-up layers. Keeping the inorganic filler content within the above range can ensure that a good balance of properties will be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0122">The resin composition is not particularly limited, but the use of a coupler is preferred. The couplers can improve the wettability in the interface between the above-mentioned thermosetting resin and inorganic filler so as to improve the heat resistance, particularly the solder heat resistance after moisture absorption.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0123">As the above-mentioned couplers, commonly used couplers may be used. Specifically, one or more couplers selected from epoxy silane couplers, cationic silane couplers, amino silane couplers, titanate-type couplers, and silicone oil-type couplers will preferably be used. This can improve the wettability at the interface with the inorganic filler, thus increased heat resistance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0124">The coupler content is not particularly limited but is preferably 0.05 to 3.0 weight parts per 100 weight parts inorganic filler. A coupler content under the above-mentioned lower limit may not be effective in coating the inorganic filler and improving the heat resistance. A content above the above-mentioned upper limit, on the other hand, may lower the flexural strength of the build-up layers. Keeping the coupler content within the above range can ensure that a good balance of properties will be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0125">In the above resin composition, there may be used one or more kinds of thermoplastic resins such as phenoxy resins, polyimide resins, polyamide-imide resins, polyphenylene oxide resins, polyether sulfone resins, polyester resins, polyethylene resins, polystyrene resins, thermoplastic elastomers such as polystyrene thermoplastic elastomers (such as styrene-butadiene copolymers, and styrene-isoprene copolymers), polyolefin thermoplastic elastomers, polyamide elastomers, and polyester elastomers, and diene elastomers such as polybutadiene, epoxy-modified polybutadiene, acrylic-modified polybutadiene, and methacrylic-modified polybutadiene.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0126">Pigments, dyes, defoamers, leveling agents, UV absorbents, foaming agents, antioxidants, flame retardants, ion-capturing agents, and the like may be added as needed in addition to the above components to the resin composition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0127">The method for forming the resin composition on the carrier base is not particularly limited. Examples include methods in which the resin composition is dissolved and dispersed in a solvent or the like to prepare a resin varnish, which is then applied to the carrier base using any of various coating devices and then dried, and methods in which the resin varnish is sprayed onto the carrier base using a spraying device and is then dried.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0128">Methods in which the resin varnish is applied to the carrier base using a coater such as a comma coater or die coater and is then dried are preferred. This will allow a build-up layer with a carrier base having a uniform build-up layer thickness to be efficiently produced without voids.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0129">The carrier base is not particularly limited. Examples include polyester resins such as polyethylene terephthalate and polybutylene terephthalate, heat-resistant thermoplastic resin films such as fluororesins and polyimide resins, and metal foil such as copper and/or copper-based alloys, aluminum and/or aluminum-based alloys, iron and/or iron-based alloys, silver and/or silver-based alloys, gold and/or gold-based alloys, zinc and zinc-based alloys, nickel and nickel-based alloys, and tin and tin-based alloys.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0130">The thickness of the carrier base is not particularly limited, although the use of one that is 10 to 100 μm is desirable in view of the good handleability when a build-up layer with a carrier base is produced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0131">The solvent used in the aforementioned resin varnish will preferably exhibit good solubility toward the resin components of the resin composition, but solvents exhibiting poor solubility may also be used, provided that no adverse effects will result. Examples of solvents exhibiting good solubility include acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, cyclohexanone, tetrahydrofuran, dimethyl formamide, dimethyl acetamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, ethylene glycol, cellosolve-type solvent, and carbitol-type solvent.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0132">The solid content in the resin varnish is not particularly limited, but is preferably 30 to 80 wt %, and more preferably 40 to 70 wt %.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0133">The use of an oxidant such as a permanganate or bichromate for roughening treatment of the surface of a build-up layer formed from such a resin composition will allow lots of highly uniform fine concavities and convexities to be formed on the surface of the build-up layer after the roughening treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0134">Metal plating of the surface of the thus roughened build-up layer will allow fine conductor circuits to be accurately formed because of the highly smooth surface resulting from the roughened surface. The fine concavo-convex texturing can also enhance the anchoring effect and can bring about higher adhesion between the build-up layer and plating metal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0135">The thickness of the build-up layer formed from the resin composition is not particularly limited but is preferably 5 to 100 μm, and more preferably 10 to 80 μm. This will allow the concavities and convexities on the inner layer circuitry to be filled when a multi-layered circuit board is produced using these build-up layers, ensuring a suitable build-up layer thickness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0136">&lt;Production of Multi-Layered Circuit Board&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0137">Through holes <b>7</b> are formed in the material used for the core layer <b>5</b> noted above, and the surfaces are then copper plated, including the inner surfaces of the through holes, to form a conductor layer with the desired pattern, thereby producing the inner layer wiring board. The inner layer wiring board may itself serve as a multi-layered wiring board.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0138"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a structure with three build-up layers stacked on both side of the inner layer wiring board. That is, a first build-up layer <b>6</b> <i>a</i>, second build-up layer <b>6</b> <i>b</i>, and third build-up layer <b>6</b> <i>c </i>are stacked up on one surface (element mounting side) of the inner layer wiring board. The same is done on the other side of the inner layer wiring board. The number of the build-up layers <b>6</b> is not limited to this, and can be suitably designed according to the number of signal wires, wiring pattern, or the like. Another possible option is to form the build-up layers <b>6</b> on only one side of the inner layer wiring board.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0139">The above build-up layers <b>6</b> are formed by placing the build-up layers on one or both sides of the inner layer wiring board and hot forming the material. Specifically, the build-up layers <b>6</b> and the inner layer wiring board are aligned, hot press forming is brought about in a vacuum using a vacuum pressure type of laminator, and the material is heated and cured by a hot air dryer or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0140">The conditions of the hot press forming are not particularly limited, but as an example, the temperature can be 60 to 160° C. and the pressure can be 0.2 to 3 MPa. The heat curing conditions are not particularly limited, but the temperature can be 140 to 240° C., and the time can be 30 to 120 minutes. The insulating resin of the above build-up layers <b>6</b> can also be placed on the inner layer wiring board and hot-press formed using a flat press device or the like. The hot press forming conditions are not particularly limited, but as an example, the temperature can be 140 to 240° C., and the pressure can be 1 to 4 MPa.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0141">The plurality of build-up layers <b>6</b> have a wiring layer (conductor layer) <b>11</b>. The multi-layered wiring structure with the plurality of build-up layers <b>6</b> is formed by the sequential stacking of build-up layers <b>6</b> and wiring layers <b>11</b> and the electrical connections by the stacked vias <b>8</b> between the wiring layers <b>11</b>. An additive method such as a semi-additive or full additive method can be employed in the process for forming the build-up layers <b>6</b>. In the additive method, after the formation of the build-up layers <b>6</b> on both sides of the internal wiring board, via holes can be formed in the build-up layers <b>6</b> by a laser process, for example. The stacked vias <b>8</b> and wiring layers <b>11</b> can be formed on the surface of the build-up layers <b>6</b>, including the interior of the via holes, by sequential electroless copper plating and electrolytic copper plating, for example. After the electroless plating process, the adhesion between the build-up layer material and the copper can be improved by heat-treating. The process for forming the build-up layers <b>6</b> and wiring layers <b>11</b> (including the stacked vias <b>8</b>) is repeated several times according to the lamination number of layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0142">Electrode pads <b>12</b> connected to the inner wiring formed by the wiring layers <b>11</b>, stacked vias <b>8</b>, and through holes <b>7</b> are formed on the semiconductor element-mounting side of the circuit board <b>1</b> having the above build-up layers <b>6</b>. Meanwhile, external connection terminals <b>9</b> connected to the inner wiring are formed on the side of the circuit board <b>1</b> opposite the surface on which the semiconductor elements are mounted. The electrode pads <b>12</b> and the external connector terminals <b>9</b> are electrically connected through the inner wiring including the wiring layers <b>11</b>, stacked vias <b>8</b>, and through holes <b>7</b>. Metal terminals such as solder bumps or Au bumps are used for the external connector terminals <b>9</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0143">&lt;Semiconductor Package&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0144">The flip-chip semiconductor package in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> will be described next.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0145">This embodiment of the invention includes a joining step for flip chip-joining the electrode surface of the semiconductor element <b>2</b> and the electrode surface of the circuit board <b>1</b> that is connected to the semiconductor element, and a sealing step for injecting a sealing resin composition <b>4</b> between the circuit board <b>1</b> and semiconductor element <b>2</b> to form an underfill.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0146">In the sealing step, as the sealing resin composition <b>4</b> and the semiconductor package (flip chip-joined circuit board <b>1</b> and semiconductor element <b>2</b>) which is not yet filled with the sealing resin composition <b>4</b> are heated, the sealing resin composition <b>4</b> is applied to the side edge of the semiconductor element <b>2</b> and crosses over into the gaps due to the capillary phenomenon, and a method may be employed to shorten the production cycle, such as tilting the semiconductor packages or making use of the pressure differential to accelerate injection.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0147">When the sealing resin composition <b>4</b> has been injected/applied in this manner, the sealing resin composition <b>4</b> can be cured by being heated for 1 to 12 hours at a temperature ranging from 100° C. to 170° C. Here, the curing temperature profile may be varied. For example, the material may be thermally cured as the temperature is changed in stages, such as 1 hour of heating at 100° C. followed by 2 hours at 150° C. The viscosity of the sealing resin composition <b>4</b> for forming the sealing resin composition <b>4</b> is preferably no more than 50 Pa·sec (25° C.). The circuit board <b>1</b> is similarly selected from those having the properties described above in the above embodiment of the semiconductor package.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0148">The viscosity of the sealing resin composition <b>4</b> when the sealing resin composition <b>4</b> is injected will preferably be no more than 2 Pa·sec. The injection temperature is 60 to 140° C., and preferably 100 to 120° C. In the above embodiment, the properties of the sealing resin composition <b>4</b> and the properties of the circuit board <b>1</b> are adjusted to help lower the stress, but the adjustment of the properties of the sealing resin composition <b>4</b> and the properties of the circuit board <b>1</b> is arbitrarily made.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0152">Table 1 shows the measured results for the composition, glass transition temperature, coefficient of linear expansion, flexural elastic modulus, and viscosity of the sealing resin compositions. The blending amounts are in weight parts.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0153">The glass transition temperature was determined by curing the sealing resin composition for 120 minutes at 150° C., cutting the composition into test pieces measuring 5×5×10 mm, and measuring the test pieces under a compression load of 5 g at a heating rate of 10° C./minute in a temperature range of from −100° C. to 300° C. using a TMA/SS120 mfd. by Seiko Instruments Inc. The coefficient of linear expansion was determined in the same way.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0154">The flexural elastic modulus was determined by curing the sealing resin composition for 120 minutes in an oven heated at 150° C., then forming the composition to a width of 10 mm, a length of about 150 mm, and a thickness of 4 mm, then taking measurements with a Tensilon tester in 3-point bending mode in an atmosphere at 25° C. at a rate of 1 mm/min using a span of 64 mm, and calculating the elastic modulus from the initial gradient of the resulting stress-strain curve, giving the flexural elastic modulus.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0155">The viscosity at 25° C. was determined at 5 rpm with a cone mounted on a Brookfield viscometer. The viscosity at 110° C. was determined at 1 Hz using a RheoStress RS150 rheometer fitted with a PP-50 cone and plate, mfd. by HAAKE.</div>

Areas where a 5% increase in resistance from the initial resistance was found were considered defects to calculate the defect rate (=number of defect areas/number of initial evaluated areas). Table 4 shows the results of the evaluation and the length of the wiring from the pads connected to the solder bumps near the chip center to the external output terminals. The inductance was also determined in parts where the wiring length was measured. O indicates good results, and A indicates a two-fold or greater deterioration relative to the value of Example 1.</div>
