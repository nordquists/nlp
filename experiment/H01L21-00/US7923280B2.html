<heading>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/032,475, filed Feb. 15, 2008 now U.S. Pat. No. 7,754,518, which is herein incorporated by reference.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to an apparatus and method for manufacturing a semiconductor device. More particularly, the invention is directed to an apparatus and method for thermally processing a substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">The integrated circuit (IC) market is continually demanding greater memory capacity, faster switching speeds, and smaller feature sizes. One of the major steps the industry has taken to address these demands is to change from batch processing silicon substrates in large furnaces to single substrate processing in a small chamber.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">During single substrate processing, the substrate is typically heated to a high temperature to allow various chemical and physical reactions to take place in multiple IC devices defined in portions of the substrate. Of particular interest, favorable electrical performance of the IC devices requires implanted regions to be annealed. Annealing recreates a crystalline structure from regions of the substrate that were previously made amorphous, and activates dopants by incorporating their atoms into the crystalline lattice of the substrate. Thermal processes such as annealing require providing a relatively large amount of thermal energy to the substrate in a short amount of time, and then rapidly cooling the substrate to terminate the thermal process. Examples of thermal processes currently in use include Rapid Thermal Processing (RTP) and impulse (spike) annealing. Conventional RTP processes heat the entire substrate even though the IC devices reside only in the top few microns of the silicon substrate. This limits how fast one can heat and cool the substrate. Moreover, once the entire substrate is at an elevated temperature, heat can only dissipate into the surrounding space or structures. As a result, today's state of the art RTP systems struggle to achieve a 400° C./s ramp-up rate and a 150° C./s ramp-down rate. While RTP and spike annealing processes are widely used, current technology is not ideal because it ramps substrate temperature too slowly during thermal processing, exposing the substrate to elevated temperatures for an extended period of time. These thermal budget problems become more severe with increasing substrate sizes, increasing switching speeds, and/or decreasing feature sizes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">To resolve some of the problems raised in conventional RTP processes, various scanning laser anneal techniques have been used to anneal surfaces of substrates. In general, these techniques deliver a constant energy flux to a small region on the surface of a substrate while the substrate is translated, or scanned, relative to the energy delivered to the small region. Due to stringent uniformity requirements and the complexity of minimizing the overlap of scanned regions across the substrate surface, these types of processes are not effective for thermal processing contact level devices formed on the surface of the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">Dynamic surface annealing (DSA) techniques have been developed to anneal finite regions on the surface of the substrate to provide well-defined annealed and/or re-melted regions on the surface of the substrate. Generally, during such laser anneal processes, various regions on the surface of the substrate are sequentially exposed to a desired amount of energy delivered from the laser to cause the preferential heating of desired regions of the substrate. These techniques are preferred over conventional processes that sweep the laser energy across the surface of the substrate because the overlap between adjacent scanned regions is strictly limited to the unused space between die, or “kurf,” lines, resulting in more uniform annealing across the desired regions of the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">One disadvantage to DSA techniques is that annealing a portion of the surface of the substrate subjects the interface region between annealed portions and non-annealed portions to high thermal stresses during annealing due to temperature differences of up to 500° C. In most cases, these thermal stresses are relieved as heat conducts from the annealed region into the non-annealed region of the substrate. However, as the annealing process moves toward an edge of the substrate, the availability of heat-absorbing substrate domains is reduced by proximity to the edge, and thermal stresses cause physical deformation or breakage of the substrate. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an annealing process attempting to anneal a portion <b>102</b> of substrate <b>100</b> near its edge <b>104</b>. The electromagnetic energy <b>106</b> radiating from source <b>108</b> heats portion <b>102</b>, while edge portion <b>110</b> remains unheated. The interface area between annealed portion <b>102</b> and edge portion <b>110</b> develops high thermal stress due to the relatively small heat-absorbing capacity of edge portion <b>110</b>. This high thermal stress is frequently relieved by deformation or breakage in edge portion <b>110</b> near edge <b>104</b> of substrate <b>100</b>. Thus, there is a need for a thermal processing apparatus and method capable of annealing all desired regions of the substrate without damaging the substrate.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">Embodiments of the present invention provide an apparatus and method for thermal processing of a substrate. In a process chamber configured to perform thermal processes involving directing electromagnetic energy toward at least a portion of the surface of a substrate, a device is deployed to block at least a portion of the electromagnetic energy from reaching the substrate. The device is configured to allow insertion and removal of the substrate by any of several means, and is made to withstand the conditions present during processing of the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross-section view of a thermal processing chamber <b>200</b> according to one embodiment of the invention. Chamber <b>200</b> features a wall <b>202</b>, a floor <b>204</b>, and a top portion <b>206</b> cooperatively defining a processing chamber. The processing chamber contains a substrate support <b>208</b> for positioning a substrate in the chamber. The substrate support <b>208</b> includes a conduit portion <b>210</b>, which pierces floor <b>204</b>, for carrying various processing media to and from the substrate support. Conduit portion <b>210</b> may include passage <b>212</b> for carrying processing media to a surface of substrate support <b>208</b> through openings <b>214</b>. Conduit portion <b>210</b> may also include passage <b>216</b> for carrying thermal control media to channels inside substrate support <b>208</b>, enabling substrate support <b>208</b> to be heated or cooled. For illustration purposes, a substrate <b>250</b> is shown disposed on substrate support <b>208</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">A substrate may be introduced to chamber <b>200</b> through portal <b>218</b>, which may be sealed by a door (not shown) if desired. Process gases may be introduced to the process chamber through portal <b>220</b>, and may be evacuated through portal <b>222</b>, or through any other suitable conduit. In some embodiments, it may be advantageous, for example, to evacuate process gases through a conduit in substrate support <b>208</b>. In other embodiments, gases may be provided to the back side of a substrate disposed on substrate support <b>208</b> through a conduit therein (not shown). Such gases may be useful for thermal control of the substrate during processing in high vacuum. Thermal control gases are generally different from process gases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">Chamber <b>200</b> is generally juxtaposed with a source (not shown) for directing electromagnetic energy toward a substrate disposed in chamber <b>200</b>. Electromagnetic energy is admitted to the processing chamber through window <b>224</b> in top portion <b>206</b>, which may be quartz or another suitable material, for transmitting electromagnetic energy while withstanding processing conditions. Chamber <b>200</b> also includes an energy blocker <b>226</b> configured to block at least a portion of the electromagnetic energy coming from the source toward substrate support <b>208</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">Chamber <b>200</b> also includes a lift pin assembly <b>228</b> for manipulating the energy blocker and the substrate inside the apparatus. In one embodiment, lift pin assembly <b>228</b> comprises a plurality of lift pins <b>230</b> for manipulating substrate <b>250</b> and a plurality of lift pins <b>232</b> for manipulating energy blocker <b>226</b>. Lift pins may enter chamber <b>200</b> through a plurality of passages <b>234</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a detail view of portions of chamber <b>200</b>. Window <b>224</b>, energy blocker <b>226</b>, and portal <b>220</b> are visible, as is lift pin assembly <b>228</b> in greater detail. Lift pins <b>230</b> and <b>232</b> are guided by guide tubes <b>236</b>, which ensure proper alignment of lift pins <b>230</b> and <b>232</b>. In one embodiment, lift pins <b>230</b> and <b>232</b> are enclosed by shuttles <b>246</b>, which contact the inside of guide tubes <b>236</b> to maintain alignment of lift pins <b>230</b> and <b>232</b> with guide tubes <b>236</b>. Shuttles <b>246</b> may be any rigid material, but will preferably have a low-friction surface for impinging on guide tube surfaces. In one embodiment, shuttles <b>246</b> may be ferritic stainless steel with plastic bushings (not shown) for contacting guide tubes <b>236</b>. In some embodiments, lift pins <b>230</b> and <b>232</b> may be manipulated by actuator collars <b>238</b>, which are magnetically coupled to lift pins <b>230</b> and <b>232</b> by shuttles <b>246</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. Actuator collars <b>238</b> are configured to travel in a longitudinal direction relative to guide tubes <b>236</b>, extending and retracting lift pins <b>230</b> and <b>232</b> as needed. An actuator arm moves actuator collars <b>238</b> along guide tubes <b>236</b> to extend and retract lift pins. In this embodiment, a single actuator arm <b>240</b> operates both sets of lift pins <b>230</b> and <b>232</b>, but multiple actuators arms may be used if desired. Extension of lift pin <b>232</b> into chamber <b>200</b> is limited by stop <b>242</b>. A guide tube spring <b>244</b> may be provided as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> to allow actuator arm <b>240</b> to continue moving toward chamber <b>200</b> after lift pin <b>230</b> has been curtailed by stop <b>242</b>. In this way, lift pin <b>230</b> may continue moving after lift pin <b>232</b> has stopped, with a single actuator arm <b>240</b> moving both. In this embodiment, lift pin <b>232</b> is longer than lift pin <b>230</b> to allow lift pin <b>232</b> to lift energy blocker <b>226</b> before lift pin <b>230</b> lifts substrate <b>250</b> off of substrate support <b>208</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">Energy blocker <b>226</b> is configured to block a portion of the electromagnetic energy directed toward substrate <b>250</b> through window <b>224</b>. As will be seen in greater detail below, energy blocker <b>226</b> may be configured such that a portion rests on substrate support <b>208</b> while another portion extends above a portion of substrate support <b>208</b>. In some embodiments, energy blocker <b>226</b> casts a shadow over the edge of a substrate disposed on substrate support <b>208</b>. Energy blocker <b>226</b> may thus be referred to as a shadow ring or an edge ring. Lift pins may manipulate energy blocker <b>226</b> by mating with recesses.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">In operation, lift pin <b>232</b> extends into the process chamber, lifting energy blocker <b>226</b> above substrate support <b>208</b> a sufficient distance to allow manipulation of substrate <b>250</b> disposed on substrate support <b>208</b> without contacting energy blocker <b>226</b>. Lift pin <b>230</b> extends into the process chamber to lift substrate <b>250</b> above substrate support <b>208</b>, allowing a substrate handling mechanism (not shown) to enter the process chamber through portal <b>218</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and access the substrate. As actuator <b>240</b> moves both lift pins upward, actuator collar <b>238</b>A impinges stop <b>242</b>. Actuator arm <b>240</b> continues moving, compressing guide tube spring <b>244</b> against actuator collar <b>238</b>A, while actuator collar <b>238</b>B continues moving lift pin <b>230</b> upward. With a substrate handling mechanism extended into the process chamber, actuator arm <b>240</b> retracts lift pin <b>230</b> until guide tube spring <b>244</b> is fully extended, and then retracts both lift pins <b>230</b> and <b>232</b> until substrate <b>250</b> and energy blocker <b>226</b> rests on substrate support <b>208</b>. In this embodiment, with a single actuator <b>240</b>, lift pins <b>230</b> and <b>232</b> extend and retract together. In embodiments with multiple actuators, lift pin <b>232</b> may remain extended when no substrate is disposed on substrate support <b>208</b>. When a substrate is provided to the processing chamber by a handling mechanism, lift pin <b>230</b> may then extend to lift the substrate above the handling mechanism, allowing the handling mechanism to retract from the processing chamber through portal <b>218</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Lift pin <b>230</b> may then retract to dispose the substrate on substrate support <b>208</b>. Lift pin <b>232</b> may then retract to dispose energy blocker <b>226</b> in a processing position.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">To remove a substrate from the chamber, lift pins <b>230</b> and <b>232</b> operate in reverse. In a single-actuator embodiment, both lift pins extend into the process chamber. Lift pin <b>232</b> engages energy blocker <b>226</b> first, elevating it above substrate support <b>208</b>. Lift pin <b>230</b> engages substrate <b>250</b> a short time later, and both ascend above substrate support <b>208</b> by operation of the lift pins <b>230</b> and <b>232</b>. When actuator collar <b>238</b>A reaches stop <b>242</b>, lift pin <b>232</b> stops ascending, and guide tube spring <b>244</b> compresses as actuator arm <b>240</b> continues moving upward. As actuator arm <b>240</b> continues moving upward, lift pin <b>230</b> continues to move, while lift pin <b>232</b> remains stationary. Thus, substrate <b>250</b>, supported by lift pins <b>232</b>, approaches energy blocker <b>226</b>. When collar <b>238</b>B reaches the upper extremity of guide tube <b>236</b>, actuator arm <b>240</b> and lift pin <b>230</b> stop moving. A substrate handling apparatus may then extend into the process chamber. The actuator arm may then descend, lowering substrate <b>250</b> onto the substrate handling apparatus for withdrawal from the chamber. In multiple-actuator embodiments, lift pin <b>232</b> may remain fully extended while substrate <b>250</b> is manipulated from substrate support <b>208</b> to substrate handling apparatus, and while a new substrate is manipulated onto substrate support <b>208</b>, if desired.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a top view of an apparatus according to one embodiment of the invention. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates one embodiment of an energy blocker <b>300</b> as described above. In some embodiments, the energy blocker <b>300</b> is a radiation blocker. In this embodiment, energy blocker <b>300</b> is a ring, annular in shape and formed as a single article, configured to block some energy being directed toward substrate support <b>208</b>. In some embodiments, energy blocker <b>300</b> may be opaque, while in other embodiments energy blocker <b>300</b> may be partially transparent to some frequencies of electromagnetic energy used to anneal the substrate while blocking other frequencies. In this embodiment, substrate support <b>208</b> features openings <b>302</b> to allow lift pins <b>230</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 2A</figref>) to deploy from beneath substrate support <b>208</b> to manipulate a substrate disposed thereon. In this embodiment, energy blocker <b>300</b> features tabs <b>304</b> for mating with lift pins <b>232</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 2A</figref>). The lift pins move energy blocker <b>300</b> to allow for translation of a substrate inside the process chamber. Energy blocker <b>300</b> also features alignment points <b>306</b> for aligning energy blocker <b>300</b> with substrate support <b>208</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is a detail view of a portion of the apparatus of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. A section of the energy blocker <b>300</b> is shown, in which the lift pin tab <b>304</b> and alignment point <b>306</b> are visible. Also visible is the substrate support <b>208</b> and opening <b>302</b> therein, with lift pin <b>230</b> shown in its extended position. Lift pin <b>232</b> is also shown in its extended position, mating with tab <b>304</b>. In this embodiment, lift pin <b>232</b> mates with tab <b>304</b> by virtue of recess <b>310</b>. In this embodiment, the lift pins and recesses have a circular cross-sectional shape, but in other embodiments they may have any shape, such as square, rectangular, triangular, oval, and the like. Additionally, although the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> features three tabs for three lift pins, any convenient number of lift pins may be used, so long as an energy blocker can be adequately manipulated. In this embodiment, alignment point <b>306</b> is a tapered pin projecting downward from energy blocker <b>300</b> and mating with notch <b>312</b>. From the top of energy blocker <b>300</b>, alignment point <b>306</b> appears as a recess in the upper surface of energy blocker <b>300</b>. Any arrangement and number of alignment points <b>306</b> designed to ensure alignment of energy blocker <b>300</b> with substrate support <b>208</b> may be used. For example, alignment pins may be disposed on substrate support <b>208</b> pointing upward into recesses formed in energy blocker <b>300</b>. Alignment of energy blocker <b>300</b> with substrate support <b>208</b> ensures that the desired portions of a substrate disposed on substrate support <b>208</b> are shielded from electromagnetic radiation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">In the embodiment illustrated by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, notch <b>312</b> is aligned with indentation <b>314</b> to allow lift pin <b>232</b> to travel freely past substrate support <b>208</b> and engage with recess <b>310</b> in tab <b>304</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows an alternate embodiment in which alignment point <b>306</b> is displaced from indentation <b>314</b>. In both embodiments illustrated by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, energy blocker <b>300</b> has a rounded or beveled edge <b>316</b>. Alignment point <b>306</b> also has a rounded or beveled edge <b>318</b> on the upper surface of energy blocker <b>300</b>. In these two embodiments, edge <b>318</b> of alignment point <b>306</b> is shown substantially tangent to the inner extremity of rounded or beveled edge <b>316</b> of energy blocker <b>300</b>. Alternate embodiments may, however, include alignment features located at any convenient point. For the two illustrated embodiments, alignment points <b>306</b> may be located a distance approximately halfway between the inner and outer edge of energy blocker <b>300</b>, or substantially tangent to the inner edge.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a cross-section view of an apparatus according to one embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, energy blocker <b>300</b> is shown in a spaced-apart configuration relative to substrate support <b>208</b>. Lift pin <b>232</b> is visible mating with recess <b>310</b> in tab <b>304</b>, as described above. Alignment point <b>306</b> is illustrated in this embodiment as a frustroconical pin <b>406</b> projecting downward from energy blocker <b>300</b> for mating with notch <b>312</b>, with no corresponding recess in the upper surface of energy blocker <b>300</b>. In operation, the energy blocker of this embodiment is configured to rest on substrate <b>208</b> during processing. Energy blocker <b>300</b> features cutaway portion <b>408</b> designed to remain spaced apart from substrate support <b>208</b> when energy blocker <b>300</b> rests on substrate support <b>208</b>. Cutaway portion <b>408</b> is sized such that extension <b>410</b> extends over a portion of a substrate disposed on substrate support <b>208</b> during processing. Extension <b>410</b> thus creates a shadow over a portion of a substrate resting on substrate support <b>208</b>, preventing electromagnetic energy from impinging the substrate too close to its edge. In this way, energy blocker <b>300</b> with extension <b>410</b> protects the edge of a substrate disposed on substrate support <b>208</b> from deformation or damage due to extreme thermal stresses during processing. Energy blocker <b>300</b> is thus sometimes referred to as a shadow ring or an edge ring. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> illustrates an alternate embodiment, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, wherein notch <b>312</b> is not aligned with indentation <b>314</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">In the embodiment of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, energy blocker <b>300</b> may be up to about 5 millimeters (mm) thick at its thickest point. Cutaway portion <b>408</b> may reduce thickness by up to about 80%, resulting in thickness of extension <b>410</b> less than about 3 mm. Extension <b>410</b> may create a shadow on the substrate up to about 3 mm from an edge of the substrate. Clearance between extension portion <b>410</b> and a substrate resting on substrate support <b>208</b> may be less than about 2 mm during processing. Energy blocker <b>300</b> may be made of any material capable of withstanding processing conditions, but is preferably made of alumina (aluminum oxide, Al<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub>, where the ratio of y/x is from about 1.3 to about 1.7), aluminum nitride (AlN), quartz (silicon dioxide, SiO<sub>2</sub>), or silicon carbide (SiC), most preferably from alumina. These materials may be used to make an energy blocker that is opaque or that transmits some or all electromagnetic energy incident thereon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment of the invention. A lower portion <b>500</b> of a processing chamber is visible. An energy blocker <b>502</b> is shown disposed above a substrate support surface <b>504</b>. Substrate support surface <b>504</b> features holes <b>516</b> for delivering processing media to portions of a substrate disposed on support surface <b>504</b>. Energy blocker <b>502</b> features a plurality of tabs <b>506</b> extending from an outer edge of energy blocker <b>502</b>. In this embodiment, energy blocker <b>502</b> is a ring, annular in shape and formed as a single article, configured to block electromagnetic energy from reaching at least a portion of a substrate disposed on support surface <b>504</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">Other embodiments of the invention are contemplated, although not illustrated in figures. An annular energy blocker such as those described above may be formed from two or more detachable parts, which may be coupled and uncoupled at convenient times during processing cycles. For example, two or more ring parts may be coupled to form a radiation blocker for a process chamber. During processing, the ring parts may rest on a substrate support to block electromagnetic energy from reaching at least a portion of a substrate disposed on the support. When a substrate is inserted or withdrawn from the process chamber, the ring parts may retract vertically or laterally to allow access to the substrate. For example, three ring parts may each be coupled to a retractor designed to move each ring part a set distance laterally to allow clearance for a substrate to be lifted above the substrate support.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates another embodiment of the invention. A substrate support <b>600</b> is visible, with an energy blocker <b>602</b>. A support ring <b>604</b> is provided in this embodiment for restraining energy blocker <b>602</b> when it is not in contact with substrate support <b>600</b>. When the two are in contact, energy blocker <b>602</b> rests on substrate support <b>600</b>. Alignment is achieved by virtue of pins <b>606</b> on substrate support <b>600</b>, which are configured to mate with recesses <b>608</b> in energy blocker <b>602</b>. In this embodiment, pins <b>606</b> are shown as frustroconical extensions protruding from substrate support <b>600</b>, and configured to insert into recesses <b>608</b> with similar shape. In alternate embodiments, however, pins <b>606</b> and recesses <b>608</b> may have any convenient shape, such as rounded, square, triangular, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">In operation, the apparatus of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> functions to passively dispose energy blocker <b>602</b> on substrate support <b>600</b> during processing. Substrate support <b>600</b> will generally be movable in this embodiment, raising and lowering inside the process chamber to facilitate insertion and withdrawal of substrates. When a substrate is disposed on substrate support <b>600</b>, it raises into a processing position. As substrate support <b>600</b> rises, pins <b>606</b> contact and mate with recesses <b>608</b>, lifting energy block <b>602</b> from support ring <b>604</b>. Extension <b>610</b> of energy blocker <b>602</b> extends above a portion of the substrate disposed on support <b>600</b> by virtue of cutaway portion <b>612</b>, and blocks a portion of electromagnetic energy being directed toward the substrate. In some embodiments, energy blocker <b>602</b> may be a shadow ring or an edge ring. After processing, substrate support <b>600</b> lowers into a substrate transfer position. Energy blocker <b>602</b> rests on support ring <b>604</b> and disengages from support <b>600</b>, creating space for withdrawal of the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">Energy blockers as described herein may also be useful as a method of shielding measurement devices from unwanted radiation inside a process chamber. Devices are commonly deployed inside a process chamber to measure various parameters during processing. In many cases, these devices are sensitive to electromagnetic radiation, and may suffer inaccuracy or damage from energy directly incident from the energy source. An energy blocker as described herein may be used to prevent energy from the source directly impinging measurement devices. For example, in some embodiments, temperature measurement devices, such as pyrometers, may be disposed inside a processing chamber for measuring the temperature of a substrate by sensing electromagnetic energy radiated by the substrate. Such instruments would be inaccurate if energy directly from the source were to impinge on them. A radiation blocker such as that described herein may block at least a portion of electromagnetic energy that might otherwise impinge directly on the device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">While the foregoing is directed to embodiments of the present invention, other and further embodiments of the invention may be devised without departing from the basic scope thereof, and the scope thereof is determined by the claims that follow.</div>
