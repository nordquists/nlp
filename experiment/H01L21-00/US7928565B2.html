<heading>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device with higher thermal dissipation efficiency and to a method for fabricating the same.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">In order to meet the demand for higher clock frequencies of future computers, the integration density of current semiconductor devices as, for example, chips and multi-chip modules (MCM), in which a number of semiconductor chips are mounted on a common substrate generally in the face-down state, is continuously being increased. As a consequence, there arises the problem of increased heat dissipation due to the increase in power density.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Common cooling approaches include air cooling, as for example disclosed in the U.S. Pat. No. 5,471,366, which describes a multi-chip module and a fabrication process thereof. The multi-chip module comprises a plurality of semiconductor chips mounted on a common substrate and a plurality of thermally conductive blocks attached to the semiconductor chips. A resin package body encapsulates the semiconductor chips and the thermally conductive blocks together with the substrate. The resin package body furthermore has an upper surface flushing with the upper surfaces of the thermally conductive blocks. A heat sink carrying heat radiation fins is mounted onto the upper surface of the resin package body in such a way that a thermally contact is established between the heat sink and the upper surfaces of the thermally conductive blocks. Thus, heat dissipated from the semiconductor chips is transferred to the heat sink via the thermally conductive blocks and is radiated to the surrounding air from the heat radiation fins.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">One disadvantage of this multi-chip module is that the heat transferred from the semiconductor chips to the air has to pass three boundary layers, so that the heat dissipation efficiency is reduced. Besides, the re-workability in case of defects or insufficient thermal connections is restricted due to the encapsulation of the thermally conductive blocks, the semiconductor chips and the substrate with the resin package body.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">Furthermore, in general air cooling approaches are quickly reaching their limits. As a consequence, alternative cooling concepts have to be pursued.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">Other known cooling techniques include liquid coolants, which will be crucial for future midsize and portable computers in particular. The disadvantage of these cooling methods consists in the connection of liquid coolers to the surfaces of the semiconductor chips. In order to level out roughness and warp, a thick thermally interface between the chips and the liquid coolers is required which causes a higher thermally resistance that deteriorates the cooling performance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">One of the currently used cooling methods is the so-called jet impingement cooling. The idea behind this cooling method is to spray a cooling fluid through nozzles directly onto the backside surface of the semiconductor chips in order to create a film of fluid thereon. Consequently, heat transfer to the cooling fluid is rendered easier. However, the cooling efficiency of jet impingement coolers is generally low due to the unstructured only flat impingement surface of the semiconductor chips.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">Moreover, it is known to etch trenches into the backside of a silicon wafer which serve as microscopic fluid channels in the future semiconductor chips. This concept of micro-channel heat sinks is based on very short thermally conduction paths and a high surface enlargement factor and utilizes the good thermally conductivity of silicon. It has been shown that the highest cooling efficiencies are possible with channels having a width of 30 to 50 μm an and a depth of 200 to 300 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">A drawback of this method is that surface enlargement of processor chips by deep trench etching of wafers causes yield reduction, either due to the deep trench etch process stability or due to mechanical fracture of the patterned surface. Therefore, the method is cost ineffective. Moreover, deep trench backside etching of wafers can cause process compatibility issue problems, does not allow a re-working of this process in case of defects and makes the semiconductor chips more fragile to breaking. As a consequence, such etching processes are not accepted in chip manufacturing.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">It is an object of the present invention to provide a novel semiconductor device having a higher thermal dissipation efficiency and a good mechanical stability, which is compatible to the existing semiconductor process technology and which provides the possibility of re-working in case of defects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for fabricating a semiconductor device having a higher thermal dissipation efficiency with minimal induction of stress to the semiconductor device (well below fracture strength of the device), even if different materials are used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">According to one aspect of the present invention, a semiconductor device comprising a thermally conducting structure attached to a surface of the semiconductor device via soldering is provided. The thermally conducting structure is essentially formed of a thermally conducting material and comprises an array of freestanding fins, studs or frames, or a grid of connected fins.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">Due to the thermally conducting structure, the surface of the semiconductor device is enlarged. Since the solder can be made relatively thin, for example less than 1 μm, the solder does not limit the thermally conduction from the semiconductor device to the thermally conducting structure. Consequently, the semiconductor device provides a higher thermal dissipation efficiency. Moreover, the semiconductor device has a good mechanical stability due to the absence of etched areas on the surface. In addition, the semiconductor device allows for re-working in case of defects by re-melting of the solder, removing the thermally conducting structure or a portion thereof and attaching a new thermally conducting structure or a portion thereof to the surface of the semiconductor device via soldering.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the semiconductor device further comprises a manifold layer attached to the thermally conducting structure. By using a manifold layer, it is possible to supply a cooling liquid or water to the structural elements of the thermally conducting structure. Thereby, a very higher cooling efficiency of the semiconductor device can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the semiconductor device is integrated into a device for jet impingement cooling. Due to the fact that the surface of the semiconductor device is enlarged by the thermally conducting structure, a good cooling performance of the semiconductor device can be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">According to another aspect of the present invention, a method for fabricating a semiconductor device is provided. In a first step, a carrier having a seed layer is provided. A patterned mask layer is provided on the seed layer of the carrier afterwards, wherein the patterned mask layer has a recess structure. A thermally conducting material is deposited on the patterned mask layer to fill up the recess structure of the patterned mask layer, thus forming a thermally conducting structure. Subsequently, a solder is deposited on the thermally conducting structure. After that, the patterned mask layer and the seed layer between the structural elements of the thermally conducting structure are removed and the thermally conducting structure formed on the carrier is attached to a surface of a semiconductor device via soldering. After joining the thermally conducting structure gets released.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">As described above, the thermally conducting structure allows for an enlargement of the surface of the semiconductor device and the solder can be rendered thinner that the thermally conduction from the semiconductor device to the thermally conducting structure is improved. Consequently, the method makes it possible to produce a semiconductor device with a higher thermal dissipation efficiency by forming, attaching and transferring a thermally conducting structure, e.g. an island or a high-aspect ratio structure such as an array of freestanding studs, to the semiconductor device. Due to the fact that the thermally conducting structure is formed on the carrier and thus separately from the semiconductor device, the used process steps do not have to be compatible with the manufacturing of the semiconductor device. Moreover, the method provides the re-workability in case of defects merely by removing the thermally conducting structure or a portion thereof from the surface of the semiconductor device via re-melting of the solder and attaching a thermally conducting structure or a portion thereof formed on another carrier to the surface of the semiconductor device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the further step of planarizing the patterned mask layer and the thermally conducting structure after said step of depositing the thermally conducting material is introduced in order to achieve a planar surface of the patterned mask layer and the thermally conducting structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, a further step of coating the surface of the semiconductor device with an adhesion layer prior to said step of attaching the thermally conducting structure formed on the carrier to the surface of the semiconductor device is introduced. As a result, a bigger variety of possible solder materials is available in order to attach the thermally conducting structure to the semiconductor device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the carrier is a manifold layer. Consequently, the semiconductor device can be provided with a liquid coolant, thus achieving a higher cooling efficiency of the semiconductor device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the method includes the step of providing the carrier as a transparent substrate coated with a polyimide layer, wherein the seed layer is being formed on top of the polyimide layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">In this connection, it is preferred to remove the carrier after said step of attaching the thermally conducting structure formed on the carrier to the surface of the semiconductor device and to integrate the semiconductor device with the thermally conducting structure attached to the same into a device for jet impingement cooling. Since the surface of the semiconductor device is enlarged by the thermally conducting structure, a good cooling performance of the semiconductor device can be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">The present invention can in particular be used to fabricate a multi-chip module having a higher thermal dissipation efficiency. Accordingly, in yet another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the semiconductor device comprises at least two semiconductor chips attached to a common substrate. Thereby, the method includes the step of attaching the thermally conducting structure to the surfaces of the semiconductor chips.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">Concerning the term “surface” of the semiconductor device, the backside of the semiconductor device, that is defined as the side that comprises no device components, is preferred because the processing steps are less likely to harm the components and influence their functionality.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">While the invention as claimed can be modified into alternative forms, specific embodiments thereof are shown by way of example in the drawings and will herein be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that the drawings and detailed description thereto are not intended to limit the invention to the particular form disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents and alternatives falling within the scope of the present invention.</div>
<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a multi-chip module <b>1</b>, according to a first embodiment of the present invention in a cross-sectional view, which is integrated into a device for jet impingement cooling <b>13</b>. The multi-chip module <b>1</b> comprises a common substrate <b>3</b> carrying a multilayer interconnection structure thereon and two semiconductor chips <b>2</b> attached to the surface of the substrate <b>3</b> in a face-down state via solder balls <b>4</b>. The semiconductor chips <b>2</b> are mounted onto the surface of the substrate <b>3</b> by a flip chip process such as the common C4 technology process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">Each of the semiconductor chips <b>2</b> comprises an adhesion layer <b>5</b> coating the backsides of the semiconductor chips <b>2</b>. The adhesion layers <b>5</b> consist for example of nickel and gold. The multi-chip module <b>1</b> further comprises a thermally conducting structure comprising an array of free-standing studs <b>7</b> attached to the adhesion layers <b>5</b> of the semiconductor chips <b>2</b> via solder bonds <b>6</b>. The studs <b>7</b> are essentially formed of a thermally conducting material such as copper and preferably have a height of about or more than 100 μm. By means of the studs <b>7</b>, the surface of the backsides of the semiconductor chips <b>2</b> is enlarged.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">The solder bonds <b>6</b> have a thickness of about or less than 1 μm. The adhesion layer <b>5</b> has a thickness of about 1 μm. As a consequence, a thermally conduction from the backsides of the chips <b>2</b> to the studs <b>7</b> is improved. The device for jet impingement cooling <b>13</b> comprises nozzles <b>14</b> in order to spray a cooling fluid <b>16</b> onto the backsides of the semiconductor chips <b>2</b>. Due to the fact that the backside surface of each chip <b>2</b> is enlarged by the array of studs <b>7</b>, a higher cooling performance is obtained. The fraction of cooling fluid <b>16</b> that evaporates or gets heated up and stays liquid during the cooling process exhausts through an outlet <b>15</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts a plan view of a semiconductor chip <b>2</b> of the multi-chip module <b>1</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. From this view, the array of free-standing studs <b>7</b> joined with the backside of the chip <b>2</b> can be seen. In an alternative embodiment, the semiconductor chip <b>2</b> may also comprise a thermally conducting structure with a different shape which consists for example of an array of free-standing fins attached to the backside thereon (not shown). Next, the fabrication process of the semiconductor chip <b>2</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> will be described with references to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3F</figref>. In a first step, a carrier <b>8</b> is provided having a seed layer <b>11</b>, as indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. The carrier <b>8</b> comprises a transparent substrate <b>9</b> of e.g. glass which is coated with a polyimide layer <b>10</b>. The seed layer <b>11</b> that comprises an electro-conductive material is being formed on top of the polyimide layer <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">Thereafter, a mask layer <b>12</b>, e.g. photoresist, is deposited on the seed layer <b>11</b> and patterned, thus forming a recess structure in the mask layer <b>12</b>. Further, a thermally conducting material such as copper is deposited on the patterned mask layer <b>12</b> in order to fill up the recess structure of the patterned mask layer <b>12</b>. The depositing of the thermally conducting material is e.g. done by electroplating. As a result, a thermally conducting structure <b>7</b> comprising an array of studs <b>7</b> is formed by the thermally conducting material in the recess structure of the patterned mask layer <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">Afterwards, the patterned mask layer <b>12</b> and the thermally conducting structure <b>7</b> are planarized to achieve a planar surface of the patterned mask layer <b>12</b> and the thermally conducting structure <b>7</b>, as indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>. This step is e.g. carried out by chemical and mechanical polishing (CMP). Thereafter, a solder <b>6</b> is deposited on the studs of the thermally conducting structure <b>7</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>. This can be achieved by electroplating, sputtering or evaporation. In the case of sputtering and evaporation, an additional patterned mask layer (not shown) is provided on the patterned mask layer <b>12</b> and removed after the solder depositing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">After that, the patterned mask layer <b>12</b> and the seed layer <b>11</b> are removed between the studs <b>7</b> of the thermally conducting structure, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>. This is e.g. performed by an etching process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">Afterwards, the studs <b>7</b> formed on the carrier <b>8</b> are solder-bonded and transferred to the backside of the semiconductor chip <b>2</b> which has been coated with an adhesion layer <b>5</b>. At the end, the carrier <b>8</b> is removed by e.g. laser ablating of the polyimide layer <b>10</b>, so that the semiconductor chip <b>2</b> with an array of free-standing studs <b>7</b> attached to the backside of the chip <b>2</b> is obtained, as indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref>. Thereby each stud <b>7</b> is covered by the seed layer <b>11</b>. For reasons of simplicity, the seed layer <b>11</b> covering the studs <b>7</b> has been left out in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">As the studs <b>7</b> are formed on the carrier <b>8</b> separately from the semiconductor chip <b>2</b> and the thermally conducting structure area is small, the described fabrication process is characterized by no or little mechanical stress induction to the semiconductor chip <b>2</b>, thus allowing an enlargement of the backside surface of the chip <b>2</b> without great changes in chip backend processing, even by using different materials with even better properties than silicon. Furthermore, the semiconductor chip <b>2</b> with the studs <b>7</b> can be re-worked in case of defects by simply re-melting of the solder bonds <b>6</b>, removing the studs <b>7</b> or a portion thereof from the backside of the semiconductor chip <b>2</b> and attaching newly formed studs <b>7</b> with a carrier <b>8</b> to the same via soldering.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">In order to obtain the multi-chip module <b>1</b> as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, two semiconductor chips <b>2</b> are processed according to the fabrication process shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3F</figref> and are subsequently mounted onto the surface of a common substrate <b>3</b> by, for example, a standard C4 technology process. Afterwards, the multi-chip module <b>1</b> is integrated into a device for jet impingement cooling <b>13</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">Alternatively, the semiconductor chips <b>2</b> can be attached to the substrate <b>3</b> at first, and afterwards studs <b>7</b> formed on separate carriers <b>8</b> or one common carrier are transferred and bonded to the backsides of the semiconductor chips <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">In contrast to the multi-chip module <b>1</b> depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and the semiconductor chip <b>2</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref>, respectively, the studs <b>7</b> can also be attached to the backside of the semiconductor chip <b>2</b> which is not coated with an adhesion layer <b>5</b>. In such embodiments a reactive solder material is used as the solder <b>6</b> which directly joins with the backside of the semiconductor chip <b>2</b>. However, the application of an adhesion layer <b>5</b> allows a bigger variety of solder materials which can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">Instead of integrating a multi-chip module <b>1</b> into a device for jet impingement cooling <b>13</b>, the multi-chip module <b>1</b> and the semiconductor chips, respectively, can also be provided with micro channel or duct cooling. In this regard, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates, in a cross-sectional view, a multi-chip module <b>20</b> according to a second embodiment of the present invention. This multi-chip module <b>20</b> also comprises two semiconductor chips <b>2</b> attached to the upper surface of a common substrate <b>3</b> in the face-down state via solder balls <b>4</b>. The backsides of the semiconductor chips <b>2</b> are again each covered with an adhesion layer <b>5</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">Instead of free-standing studs, the multi-chip module <b>20</b> further comprises two grids <b>21</b> of connected fins attached to each of the backsides of the semiconductor chips <b>2</b> for surface enlargement. These grids <b>21</b>, which comprise a thermally conducting material such as copper, are bonded to the adhesion layers <b>5</b> coating the backsides of the chips <b>2</b> via solder bonds <b>6</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">For this, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts a plan view of a semiconductor chip <b>2</b> of the multi-chip module <b>20</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> with a grid <b>21</b> of connected fins. The grid <b>21</b> comprises a plurality of recesses <b>23</b> exposing the backside surface of the semiconductor chip <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">As can be seen from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the multi-chip module <b>20</b> further comprises a manifold layer <b>30</b> attached to the grids <b>21</b> of the semiconductor chips <b>2</b> via a sealing <b>36</b>. The manifold layer <b>30</b> comprises an inlet <b>31</b> which can be connected to a liquid or water source (not shown) and an outlet <b>33</b>. As can be deduced from the plan view of the manifold layer <b>30</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the manifold layer <b>30</b> further comprises an inlet channel <b>32</b>, an outlet channel <b>34</b> and a number of channels <b>35</b> extending from the inlet channel <b>32</b> and the outlet channel <b>34</b> towards the recesses <b>23</b> of the grids <b>21</b>. The inlet <b>31</b> is connected thereby with the inlet channel <b>32</b> and the outlet <b>33</b> with the outlet channel <b>34</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">In order to cool the backsides of the semiconductor chips <b>2</b>, the inlet <b>31</b> of the manifold layer <b>30</b> is connected to a water or liquid source (not shown). Thus, a cooling liquid <b>24</b> flows towards the recesses <b>23</b> of the grids <b>21</b> via the inlet <b>31</b>, the inlet channel <b>32</b> and respective ones of the channels <b>35</b> of the manifold layer <b>30</b>, which can be seen from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>. The cooling liquid <b>24</b> then flows down into the recesses <b>23</b> of the grids <b>21</b>, is warmed up and flows up as warmed cooling liquid <b>24</b> <i>a</i>, as can be seen from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Subsequently, the warmed cooling liquid <b>24</b> <i>a </i>flows through respective ones of the channels <b>35</b>, the outlet channel <b>34</b> and the outlet <b>33</b> of the manifold layer <b>30</b>, which can be seen from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">The recesses <b>23</b> of the grids <b>21</b> preferably have a width of about 50 μm and a depth of about between 100 to 500 μm. Thus, the backside surface of the semiconductor chips is enlarged. In addition, the solder bonds <b>6</b> and the adhesion layers <b>5</b> of the multi-chip module <b>20</b> have thicknesses of less or about 1 μm, so that the thermally conduction from the backsides of the semiconductor chips <b>2</b> to the grids <b>21</b> of connected fins is improved. As a consequence, a higher cooling performance of the liquid or water-cooled multi-chip module <b>20</b> is realized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">The manifold layer <b>30</b> can comprise a rigid material like e.g. glass ceramics. In order to reduce stress induction to the multi-chip module <b>20</b> due to different thermal expansions of the manifold layer <b>30</b> and the semiconductor chips <b>2</b>, it is preferred that the manifold layer <b>30</b> comprises the same material as the semiconductor chips <b>2</b>, i.e. silicon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">In order to accommodate geometrical imperfections between the semiconductor chips <b>2</b> and to enhance the structural flexibility of the multi-chip module <b>20</b>, the manifold layer <b>30</b> comprises a thinning <b>37</b> between the semiconductor chips <b>2</b> and between the inlet and outlet channels <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, as indicated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>. These imperfections are additionally compensated by the flexible sealing <b>36</b>, which consists e.g. of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The sealing <b>36</b> may also comprise an adhesive.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">Alternatively, the manifold layer <b>30</b> can also comprise a flexible material having a low Young's modulus like PDMS.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067">Since each of the grids <b>21</b> is attached to the whole backside surface of a respective one of the semiconductor chips <b>2</b>, mechanical stress due to different thermal expansions of the grids <b>21</b> and the semiconductor chips <b>2</b> can occur. In order to reduce this problem, the backsides of the semiconductor chips <b>2</b> of the multi-chip module <b>20</b> can alternatively be provided with an array of free-standing frames <b>22</b>, as indicated in the plan view of a semiconductor chip <b>2</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The frames <b>22</b>, which also comprise recesses <b>23</b> for receiving the cooling liquid <b>24</b>, form a structure similar to the grid <b>21</b>. Thereby, the manifold layer <b>30</b> can also be attached to the frames <b>22</b> via the sealing <b>36</b>. Between the frames <b>22</b>, stress release gaps <b>25</b> are provided which allow a reduction of mechanical stress induction caused by different thermal expansions of a semiconductor chip <b>2</b> and the frames <b>22</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068">Alternatively, the backsides of the semiconductor chips <b>2</b> of the multi-chip module <b>20</b> can also be provided with an array of free-standing studs or fins (not shown), whereas the manifold layer <b>30</b> can be attached to the studs or fins via a sealing. In such an embodiment, the cooling performance achieved by liquid or water cooling is possibly better due to a spreading and mixing of cooling liquid between the studs or fins as well. The delivery rate of the liquid or water source connected to the inlet <b>32</b> of the manifold layer <b>30</b> is possibly higher, however, due to an increased pressure drop between the studs or fins.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">In order to produce a multi-chip module with a manifold layer, such as the multi-chip module <b>20</b> depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the fabrication process described above with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3F</figref> can be utilized. After the steps of removing the carrier and mounting the semiconductor chips <b>2</b> onto a common substrate <b>3</b>, a manifold layer is attached to the thermally conducting structure, i.e. a grid of connected fins or an array of frames, studs or fins, which is attached to the backsides of the semiconductor chips <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0070">Instead of fabricating a multi-chip module by using a carrier comprising a transparent substrate and a polyimide layer, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3F</figref>, a manifold layer can be used as carrier, as well. For this, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A to 8H</figref> illustrate the fabrication process of a multi-chip module <b>40</b> according to a third embodiment of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">In a first step, a manifold structure or manifold layer <b>41</b> having an electro-conductive seed layer <b>11</b> is provided, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0072">After that, a patterned mask layer <b>12</b>, e.g. photoresist having a recess structure is provided on the seed layer <b>11</b>. Subsequently, a thermally conducting material such as copper is deposited on the patterned mask layer <b>12</b> to fill up the recess structure of the patterned mask layer <b>12</b>. This step is e.g. performed by electroplating. Thus, a thermally conducting structure <b>21</b> is formed by the thermally conducting material in the recess structure of the patterned mask layer <b>12</b> as can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>. The thermally conducting structure <b>21</b> exhibits the geometrical shape of the grid <b>21</b> of connected fins, for instance, which is depicted in the plan view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0073">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</figref>, the patterned mask layer <b>12</b> and the thermally conducting structure <b>21</b> are planarized by e.g. chemical and mechanical polishing to achieve a planar surface of the patterned mask layer <b>12</b> and the grid <b>21</b>. Afterwards, a solder <b>6</b> is deposited on the grid <b>21</b> of connected fins, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8E</figref>. This step is for example carried out by electroplating.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0074">In a next step, depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8F</figref>, the patterned mask layer <b>12</b> and the seed layer <b>11</b> between the fins of the grid <b>21</b> are removed by, for example, etching and the grid <b>21</b> of connected fins is transferred and solder-bonded to the backside of a semiconductor chip <b>2</b>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8F</figref>, the backside of the semiconductor chip <b>2</b> is again coated with an adhesion layer <b>5</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0075">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8G</figref>, the front side of the semiconductor chip <b>2</b> is provided with solder balls <b>4</b>, which can be performed by a standard C4 technology process.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0076">Similar to the fabrication process described above with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3F</figref>, the fabrication process illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A to 8H</figref> allows an enlargement of the backside surfaces of the semiconductor chips <b>2</b> with no or only little stress induction and without many changes in chip backend processing. The multi-chip module <b>40</b> or the semiconductor chips <b>2</b> can also be re-worked if required by re-melting of the solder bonds <b>6</b>, removing a manifold layer <b>41</b> with a grid <b>21</b> and attaching another manifold layer <b>41</b> with a grid <b>21</b> to the backside of a semiconductor chip <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0077">In an alternative embodiment, the fabrication process described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A to 8H</figref> can also be carried out with a bigger manifold layer, which extends over both of the semiconductor chips <b>2</b> when attached to the same (not shown).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0078">In contrast to the multi-chip module <b>20</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the multi-chip module <b>40</b> depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8H</figref> comprises two separate manifold layers <b>31</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0082">Concerning the cooling process, a cooling liquid <b>24</b> such as water flows towards the recesses <b>23</b> of the grids <b>21</b> via the inlet <b>51</b> and the inlet channel <b>52</b> of the connection layer <b>50</b>, the inlet channels <b>44</b> and respective ones of the channels <b>46</b> of the manifold layers <b>41</b>, and warmed cooling liquid <b>24</b> <i>a </i>flows away from the recesses <b>23</b> of the grids <b>21</b> towards the outlet <b>53</b> of the connection layer <b>50</b> via respective ones of the channels <b>46</b>, the outlet channels <b>45</b> and the outlet channel <b>54</b>, which can be seen from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref>, <b>10</b> and <b>11</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0083">The connection layer <b>50</b> can also comprise either a rigid or a flexible material having a relatively low Young's modulus.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0084"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A to 12G</figref> illustrate another fabrication process to provide the multi-chip module <b>40</b> as an alternative to the fabrication process described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A to 8H</figref>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0085">In contrast to the previously described fabrication process with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A to 8H</figref>, semiconductor chips <b>2</b> are mounted onto the upper surface of a common substrate <b>3</b> separately from the manifold layers <b>41</b>, which can be seen from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12G</figref>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0087">Next, another aspect of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0088"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> depicts a schematic cross-sectional view of a part of a manifold layer <b>41</b> attached to a structural element of a thermally conducting structure, which is a stud <b>7</b>, for instance, via a spring element <b>47</b> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> depicts a plan view of the same. By using spring elements <b>47</b> connecting the manifold layer <b>41</b> to the structural elements of a thermally conducting structure, the manifold layer <b>41</b> is mechanically decoupled from the thermally conducting structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0089">The spring elements <b>47</b> can also be introduced between the manifold layers <b>41</b> and the grids <b>21</b> of the multi-chip module <b>40</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8H</figref> and between the manifold layer <b>30</b> and the grids <b>21</b> of the multi-chip module <b>20</b> depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, respectively. As a consequence, geometrical imperfections and different thermal expansions of e.g. a manifold layer and a thermally conducting structure can be at least partially compensated so that mechanical stress induction to semiconductor chips and multi-chip modules, respectively, is further reduced. This allows the use of hybrid material systems with improved thermally capabilities such as solders for enhanced thermally transfer and reliability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0090">In order to fabricate a semiconductor chip or a multi-chip module with such spring elements connecting a manifold layer to a thermally conducting structure, a carrier comprising a manifold layer having a structured seed layer is provided in a first step. The structured seed layer provides spring elements formed out of partitions of the seed layer. As an example, the seed layer <b>11</b> of the manifold layer <b>41</b> depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 12A</figref> can be partially formed in such a way as to provide spring elements. The subsequent processing steps are carried out similar to the fabrication processes described above with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A to 8H</figref> and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A to 12G</figref>, respectively, and in such a way that the structural elements of the thermally conducting structure, e.g. the fins of a grid <b>21</b>, are attached to these spring elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0091">The thermally conducting structures depicted in the preceding figures all have structural elements with essentially vertical side walls. Furthermore semiconductor devices comprising thermally conducting structures with different geometrical shapes are imaginable. Such thermally conducting structures can also be formed and attached to a semiconductor device by utilizing one of the fabrication methods described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0092">As an example, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> depicts, in a cross-sectional view, a semiconductor chip <b>2</b> with a thermally conducting structure comprising T-shaped fins <b>60</b> attached to the backside of the semiconductor chip <b>2</b> via solder bonds <b>6</b>. The T-shaped fins <b>60</b> are essentially formed of a thermally conducting material like e.g. copper. The backside of the semiconductor chip <b>2</b> is again coated with an adhesion layer <b>5</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0093">The T-shaped fins <b>60</b> build reentrant cavities acting as vapor traps, which are known to reduce the superheat by a factor of ten for two phase heat transfer systems. As a consequence, the semiconductor chip <b>2</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> or a multi-chip module comprising such semiconductor chips <b>2</b> can be integrated into a device for two phase heat transfer, thus improving the thermally performance and the critical heat flux.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0094">While the present invention has been described in terms of specific embodiments, it is evident in view of the foregoing description that various variations and modifications may be carried out without departing from the scope of the invention. As an example, the illustrated and described multi-chip modules and the respective fabrication processes are not limited to multi-chip modules having only two semiconductor chips.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0095">Additionally, the fabrication methods described above are not limited to only semiconductor chips and multi-chip modules, respectively. The fabrication processes can also be carried out to transfer and attach thermally conducting structures formed on respective carriers to the backside surface of a semiconductor wafer, which is subsequently diced into semiconductor chips.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0096">Moreover, the fabrication methods described above may also be used to manufacture other functional components on a carrier and to transfer and attach these components to the backside of a semiconductor device. Such functional components can e.g. comprise micro-electromechanical (MEMS) devices such as valves or pumps.
