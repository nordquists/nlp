<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This patent application is a U.S. national stage application of PCT international application PCT/JP2008/063020 filed on Jul. 18, 2008 which claims priority of Japanese patent document 2007-190372 filed on Jul. 23, 2007 in Japan.</div>
<heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates to a manufacturing method of a semiconductor device. Further specifically, the present invention relates to a manufacturing method of a semiconductor device capable to continuously perform the mounting process which utilize a Dicing Before Grinding (DBG) process and a flip chip bonding process, and also the present invention relates to a manufacturing method of semiconductor device capable to contribute to simplify the manufacturing process and to improve the product quality.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">For mounting multipin LSI packages to prepare MPUs, gate arrays or the like onto printed wiring boards, a flip chip mounting method has hitherto been adopted in which conductive projections (bumps) made of eutectic solder, high-temperature solder, gold or the like are formed on a connection pad part at a circuit surface side of a semiconductor chip (hereinafter referred as a chip or chips) and are confronted with and are brought into contact with corresponding terminal parts on a chip mounting substrate by so-called “facedown method” for melt/diffusion bonding. However, in this method, when exposed to a periodical temperature fluctuation, there is a possibility that the joint may brake due to the difference of a thermal expansion coefficient between the semiconductor chip and the chip mounting substrate. Thus, a method is proposed which comprises injecting a heat curable liquid resin (an underfill material) into a gap between the whole circuit face area of the semiconductor chip connected in a facedown state provided with the bump electrode and a chip mounting board opposing thereto; and then curing the heat curable liquid resin to bond the whole face of the bump joint portion to the chip mounting substrate. Thereby the thermal stress focused on the bump electrodes is dispersed to prevent the breaking. However, the gap between the semiconductor and the chip mounting substrate in the flip chip mounting, is as small as 40 to 200 μm. This causes to take considerable amount of time during the step of filling the underfill material without forming any voids; and viscosity control between the lots of the underfill material is complicated. Also, the amount of the underfill material to be filled is inconsistent which causes the quality of the product to vary.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">In order to overcome these problems, for example, Patent document 1 (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. H09-213741), Patent document 2 (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. H10-242208), Patent document 3 (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. H10-270497), and Patent document 4 (Japan Laid-Open No. 2002-118147) propose a technique in which a sheet-like heat curable resin or a thermoplastic resin are sandwiched between a semiconductor chip and chip mounting substrate, then performing thermocompression bonding. These sheet-like underfill materials are provided between the chip circuit face and chip mounting substrate, and are cured by predetermined means such as thermocompression or so to strongly adhere the chip circuit face and the chip mounting substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Recently, so-called stud bumps with sharp tips are adopted as a form of the above bumps. When placing the sheet-like underfill material between the chip circuit face and the chip mounting substrate, the underfill material may break since the sheet-like underfill material is stretched due to the bump tips formed on the chip circuit face. When the underfill material is broken, it may cause the voids in the underfill material. Also, when adhering the sheet-like underfill material to the circuit face, air bubbles may be taken into the root part of the bumps depending on the form of the bumps thereby causing the voids. Further, when die-bonding via the sheet-like underfill material on the chip mounting substrate, the air bubbles may be taken in between the chip mounting substrate and the underfill material. Particularly, in recent years, patterned indents are formed sometimes by the wiring pattern on the chip mounting substrate surface which easily cause the voids. Also, although it depends on the type of the underfill materials, the voids may be formed due to the gas generated from the underfill materials during the curing step of the underfill materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">If these voids remain within the underfill materials, it may become a starting point of the package crack. Hence, it is necessary to optimize the die-bonding condition to prevent the production of the voids. However, there are various package designs of the semiconductor device; further, the form, height and density of the bumps, and the surface form of the chip mounting substrate varies in a wide range, thus it is difficult to optimize the die-bonding condition.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">In recent years, the IC cards have been widely used and further reduction of thickness thereof is demanded. Accordingly, it is now required that the thickness of the semiconductor chip, which has been about 350 μm, to be reduced to 20 to 100 μm or further less than this.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">As a method to further reduce the thickness of the chip, patent document 5 (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. H05-335411) discloses a process for producing the semiconductor chip wherein a groove of a predetermined depth is formed from a surface side of the wafer and, thereafter, the wafer is ground from a back face side. Such process is called “Dicing Before Grinding (DBG) process”. According to such DBG process, the production of the bump chip having extremely thin thickness is possible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">However, even when mounting such chip having the bumps, the above described problem of the voids production cannot be solved. Thus, a technique which removes the void upon its production is in demand.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">Also, in addition to above described each steps, the present invention preferably comprises the step of cutting the adhesive film <b>3</b> to roughly the same shape as the chip <b>10</b> which is being picked up, at any point between (S<b>1</b>) step and (S<b>3</b>) step (refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 11</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">Following will explain the each steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0009">(S<b>1</b>) Step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">In (S<b>1</b>) step, the surface protective sheet <b>7</b> is laminated to the circuit surface side of the wafer <b>1</b> formed with grooves <b>6</b> which divides into each circuits wherein the adhesive film <b>3</b> is adhered to the circuit surface of the wafer <b>1</b> (refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">As for the wafer <b>1</b>, conventionally used semiconductor wafer such as a silicon semiconductor wafer and gallium-arsenide semiconductor wafer may be used, however it is not limited to these; and various semiconductor wafers may be used. The circuit on the wafer surface may be formed by various methods including the etching method and the lift-off method which are widely used conventionally. During the formation step of circuit on the wafer, a predetermined circuit is formed. Also, conductive projections (bumps) <b>2</b>, which are used to conduct with the chip mounting substrate <b>11</b>, are preferably formed on the circuit face. The height and the diameter of the bumps <b>2</b> varies depending on the design of the semiconductor device, however, generally the height is 10 to 100 μm or so and the diameter is 20 to 100 μm or so. Such bumps <b>2</b> are formed, in many cases, by metal such as gold, copper, or solder or so. The shape of the bumps <b>2</b> is not particularly limited, yet, even when the stud bumps having sharp tips as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> which easily take in the air bubbles upon stacking the adhesive film <b>3</b> are used, the manufacturing method according to the present invention can remove the void. Therefore, the method according to the present invention can be applied particularly preferably to the wafer having the stud bumps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">In the manufacturing method of the semiconductor device according to the present invention, the adhesive film <b>3</b> is provided on the chip circuit face being picked up, and has a function as a sealing resin against the circuit face. Also, the adhesive film <b>3</b> is used to hold/fix the wafer upon back face grinding. Upon mounting the chip, it is used to fill the space between the chip mounting substrate and for adhering each other.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">As the resin used for such adhesive film <b>3</b>, the resin, which show some what of fluidity due to the heat and pressure force, follows the indents of the circuit face and expresses the adhesiveness by the heat during the step of laminating the circuit wafer to the adhesive film <b>3</b>, are used. As such resin, for example, B-stage resin, hardenable pressure sensitive adhesive, or thermoplastic resin may be mentioned.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">As B-stage resin used for the adhesive film <b>3</b>, for example, a semi-cured epoxy resin may be mentioned.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">The hardenable pressure sensitive adhesive used for the adhesive film <b>3</b> of the present invention show a tackiness and fluidity at normal temperature, and cured by heating to become non-flowable, along with firmly adhering with the adherend. As the hardenable pressure sensitive adhesive, for example, a mixture of a binder resin having pressure-sensitive adhesion at normal temperature and a thermo-setting resin may be mentioned.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">Binder resins which have pressure-sensitivity adhesion at normal temperatures include, for example, acrylic resins, polyester resins, polyvinyl ether, urethane resins, and polyamides or so. As thermo-setting resins, for example, epoxy resins, acrylic resins, polyimide resins, phenol resins, urea resins, melamine resins, resolcinol resins or so may be used, and preferably epoxy resins are used. Also, it is preferable to incorporate energy ray (ultraviolet or so) curable resins such as urethane acrylate oligomers in the adhesives in order to regulate the releasing property from the surface protective sheet <b>7</b> described later. When the energy ray curable resins are incorporated, the surface protective sheet <b>7</b> adheres firmly to the hardenable pressure sensitive adhesive layer before applying the energy ray, and it becomes easy to peel off after applying the energy ray.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">The hardenable pressure sensitive adhesives comprising such components described in above are; capable to adhere at normal temperatures, express appropriate fluidity by heating and pressure force, and have energy ray curability and heat curability. Thus, it follows the indents of the circuit face and allow to form resin layers without the void, contribute to fix the wafer by adhering to the surface protective sheet <b>7</b> during back face grinding; and can be used as the adhesive which adheres the chip and the chip mounting substrate upon mounting. Thereby, at the end it provides a highly impact resistant hardened product after heat curing. Further, it has good balance between the shear strength and the peel strength and can maintain satisfactory adhesive properties even under the high temperature and humidity conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">The thermoplastic resins used in the adhesive films <b>3</b> are resins which exhibits the adhesiveness by plasticizing due to the heat. As for such thermoplastic resins, for example, resins having a chemical and physical heat resistance such as polyimide are preferable, as it improves the reliability of the semiconductor device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">The thickness (T<sub>A</sub>) of the adhesive film <b>3</b> comprising above described components is generally 3 to 100 μm, preferably 3 to 95 μm, more preferably 5 to 85 μm or so. Note that, in case the bumps are formed on the wafer surface, the adhesive film <b>3</b> covers the circuits face without voids, and the bumps pierce there through. Thus the ratio (H<sub>B</sub>/T<sub>A</sub>) between the average height (H<sub>B</sub>) of the bumps and the thickness of the adhesive film <b>3</b> (T<sub>A</sub>) is within the range of 1.0/0.3 to 1.0/0.95, preferably 1.0/0.5 to 1.0/0.9, more preferably 1.0/0.6 to 1.0/0.85, and most preferably 1.0/0.7 to 1.0/0.8. The average height of the bumps (H<sub>B</sub>) is the height from the chip surface (circuit face excluding the bumps) to the top of the bumps. When plurality of the bump is present, the average height is calculated by an arithmetic mean thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">When the height of the bumps is excessively higher relative to the thickness of the adhesive film <b>3</b>, the chip surface (circuit face excluding bumps) and the chip mounting substrate <b>11</b> forms a space therebetween, and causes voids formation. On the other hand, when the adhesive film <b>3</b> is excessively thicker, the bumps cannot pierce through the adhesive film <b>3</b>, thereby causes loose conductivity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">Note that, as long as the operativity is not damaged, the adhesive film <b>3</b> may be single layer. However, as can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, normally it is stacked on the supporting film <b>4</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">As for the supporting sheet <b>4</b>, for example, polyethylene films, polypropylene films, polybutene films, polybutadiene films, polymethylpentene films, polyvinyl chloride films, vinyl chloride copolymer films, polyurethane films, ethylene-vinyl acetate films, ionomer resin films, ethylene (meth) acrylic acid copolymer films, ethylene (meth) acrylic ester copolymer films, and fluororesin films or so may be used. Crosslinked films of these materials may also be used. Further, laminated films of these materials are also possible. These films may be any of the transparent films, colored films or opaque films. Note that, when the supporting film <b>4</b> is too hard, the top of the bumps may be crushed. Therefore, films having an appropriate elasticity are preferably used. The adhesive film <b>3</b> on the supporting film <b>4</b> is transferred on to the circuit face of a chip (a wafer). The supporting film <b>4</b> and the adhesive film <b>3</b> are stacked releasably from each other, so that the adhesive film <b>3</b> on the supporting film <b>4</b> can be transferred on to the circuit face of a chip (a wafer). Accordingly the surface tension of the supporting film <b>4</b> on its surface in contact with the adhesive film <b>3</b> is preferably not more than 40 mN/m, and more preferably not more than 37 mN/m, and particularly not more than 35 mN/m. The film having such a low surface tension can be obtained by properly selecting the material. Alternatively, the film can also be obtained by applying a release agent to a film, that is, by coating a release agent such as a silicone resin or an alkyd resin onto the surface film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">The film thickness of the supporting film <b>4</b> is generally, 10 to 500 μm, preferably 15 to 300 μm, and particularly preferably 20 to 250 μm or so.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">This supporting film <b>4</b> may be released after laminating the adhesive film <b>3</b> to the wafer circuit face; or it may be released from the adhesive film <b>3</b> at the pick up step (S<b>3</b>) of the chip. Following will explain the embodiment in which the supporting film <b>4</b> is peeled off right after laminating the adhesive film <b>3</b> to the wafer circuit face, however the supporting film <b>4</b> may be released at (S<b>3</b>) step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">In (S<b>1</b>) step, a status wherein the adhesive film <b>3</b> is adhered to the circuit surface of wafer <b>1</b> formed with the grooves <b>6</b> which sections each circuit is established (refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</figref>). During said status, the surface protective sheet <b>7</b> is laminated to the circuit surface side of the wafer <b>1</b> (that is on the adhesive film <b>3</b> side).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">The formation of the grooves <b>6</b> is generally performed by half cut dicing which uses dicing blades or so. Also, it may be a half cut using a laser beam. The grooves <b>6</b> are formed so that it sections each circuit formed on the wafer <b>1</b>. The depth of the grooves in the wafer <b>1</b> is not particularly limited as long as it is larger than the thickness of the final chip form, and does not damage the handling property of the wafer <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">Also, the adhesive film may be cut (FC step) simultaneously with the formation of the grooves <b>6</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">That is, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the adhesive film <b>3</b> temporarily provided on the supporting film <b>4</b> is stacked on the circuit face side of the wafer <b>1</b>, then the adhesive film <b>3</b> is cut from the adhesive film <b>3</b> side to form the grooves <b>6</b> such that the wafer <b>1</b> is partially cut. In case the supporting film <b>4</b> is staked on the adhesive film <b>3</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the grooves <b>6</b> are formed from the supporting film <b>4</b> side, hence the supporting film <b>4</b> is completely cut.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">Then, by peeling the supporting film <b>4</b>, the adhesive film <b>3</b> is adhered to the circuit surface of the wafer <b>1</b> formed with the grooves <b>6</b> (refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">Alternatively, the grooves <b>6</b> may be formed independently from the adhesive film cutting (FC step).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">That is, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, first the grooves <b>6</b> are formed only on the circuit surface of the wafer <b>1</b>, and the adhesive film <b>3</b> temporarily provided on the supporting film <b>4</b> is staked on the circuit face side of the wafer <b>1</b>. Then, the adhesive film <b>3</b> is adhered to the circuit surface of the wafer <b>1</b> formed with the grooves <b>6</b>, by peeling off the supporting film <b>4</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067">In this case, the cutting of the adhesive film <b>3</b> (FC step) is performed at any point before (S<b>3</b>) which are described in the followings. Specifically, the adhesive film <b>3</b> is adhered to the circuit face of the wafer <b>1</b> formed with the grooves <b>6</b> (refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), then while in this stage, the adhesive film <b>3</b> may be completely cut along the grooves <b>6</b> using the dicing blades or the laser beam. In case the supporting film <b>4</b> is stacked on the adhesive film <b>3</b>, the supporting film <b>4</b> will also be cut completely.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068">Also, in case the step of making the space between each chip <b>10</b> by expanding the surface protective sheet is included before the (S<b>3</b>) step, which is described in the followings, the adhesive film <b>3</b> may be cut by the stretching stress during the expansion as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>. In such case, the adhesive film <b>3</b> adhered to the chip <b>10</b> does not stretch since the deformation is restrained by the chip; however, since the deformation of the adhesive film positioned between the chips are not restrained, it is cut roughly the same shape as the chip by stretching.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">As described in above, after establishing the status in which the adhesive film <b>3</b> is adhered to the circuit surface of the wafer <b>1</b> formed with the grooves <b>6</b>, the surface protective sheet <b>7</b> is laminated on the circuit surface side of the wafer <b>1</b> (that is on the adhesive film <b>3</b> surface) (refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0070">The surface protective sheet <b>7</b> is laminated in order to hold the wafer <b>1</b> and to protect the circuit face during the back face grinding step (S<b>2</b>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">As the surface protective sheet <b>7</b>, various pressure-sensitive adhesive sheets used for this type of purpose are used without any particular limitation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0072">Note that, when said supporting film <b>4</b> is released and the surface protective sheet <b>7</b> is laminated on the adhesive film <b>3</b> during the pick up step (S<b>3</b>), which is described in the following, the releasing is performed at the boundary between the adhesive film <b>3</b> and the surface protective sheet <b>7</b>. Thus, the adhesive film <b>3</b> and the surface protective sheet <b>7</b> are staked removably.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0073">When the adhesive film <b>3</b> has pressure-sensitive property, the surface protective sheet <b>7</b> does not necessary need to have a adhesiveness, and it may be resin films. As for such resin films; polyethylene films, polypropylene films, polybutene films, polybutadiene films, polymethylpentene films, polyvinyl chloride films, vinyl chloride copolymer films, polyethyleneterephthalate films, polyethylenenaphthalate films, polybutylenetelephthalate films, polyurethane films, ethylene-vinyl acetate films, ionomer resin films, ethylene (meth) acrylic acid copolymer films, ethylene (meth) acrylic ester copolymer films, polystyrene films, polycarbonate films, and polyimide films or so may be used. Also, crosslinked films of these may also be used. Further, it may be laminated films of these.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0074">In case the adhesive film <b>3</b> does not have the pressure-sensitive property, the surface protective sheet <b>7</b> may be resin films having tackiness by itself. Also, the surface protective sheet <b>7</b> may be a weak adhesive sheet comprising a removable pressure-sensitive adhesive layer to the resin films surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0075">Also, in case the adhesive film <b>3</b> does not have the energy ray curability, then the energy ray curable pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet may be used as the surface protective sheet <b>7</b>. The energy ray curable pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet is also called as UV tape or UV sheet. The pressure-sensitive adhesive layer thereof has a property that it cures by the energy ray such as ultraviolet beam, and has a property that it looses the adhesion. Therefore, after laminating the energy ray curable adhesive sheet to the face of adhesive film <b>3</b>, and after the back face grinding step (S<b>2</b>), the adhesion is lost by applying the energy ray to the adhesive layer; thus it becomes easy to peel at the boundary between the adhesive film <b>3</b> and the surface protective sheet <b>7</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0076">The form of above described surface protective sheet <b>7</b> has roughly the same shape as the wafer <b>1</b>. In this case the surface protective sheet <b>7</b> can be cut into the shape of the wafer <b>1</b> in advance, or it may be cut along the outer peripheral of the wafer <b>1</b> after laminated on the wafer <b>1</b>. The thickness of the surface protective sheet <b>7</b> is generally 20 to 1000 μm, and preferably 50 to 250 μm. In case the surface protective sheet <b>7</b> comprises the adhesive layer, the thickness of the adhesive layer among the above described thickness is 5 to 500 μm, and preferably 10 to 100 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0077">Note that, in case the cut of the adhesive film <b>3</b> (FC step) is performed simultaneously with the expansion of the surface protective sheet <b>7</b>; the surface protective sheet <b>7</b> having an expansion property is used.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0078">In step (S<b>2</b>), the thickness of the wafer <b>1</b> is made thin by back face grinding of above described wafer <b>1</b>, and finally dividing into each individual chips <b>10</b> (refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0079">The back face grinding of the wafer <b>1</b> is performed as same as the usual DBG process using the grinder or so. By grinding from the back face, the wafer <b>1</b> becomes thinner, and the back face of the wafer reaches to the grooves <b>6</b>, thereby the wafer <b>1</b> is divided into each individual chip <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0011">(S<b>3</b>) Step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0080">In (S<b>3</b>) step, each individual chip <b>10</b> is picked up together with the adhesive film <b>3</b> (not illustrated). The pick up of the chip having the adhesive film may be performed directly from the surface protective sheet <b>7</b>. Alternatively, it may be performed after transferring the chip having the adhesive layer from the surface protective sheet <b>7</b> to other adhesive sheets, and pick up the chip having the adhesive film from said other adhesive sheet. As such other adhesive sheet, the adhesive sheet having appropriate pressure-sensitive adhesive property and removable property is used, and particularly, the ultraviolet curable adhesive sheet, which is conventionally used as the dicing sheet, is preferably used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0081">Note that, as described in above, in case the step of making the space between each chip <b>10</b> by expanding the surface protective sheet is included before the (S<b>3</b>) step, the adhesive film <b>3</b> may be cut by the stretching force during the expansion as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>. The surface protective sheet <b>7</b> has roughly the same shape as the wafer; hence it cannot be set to the expanding device. Thus, the pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet having a high stretch property is laminated to the back face of the surface protective sheet <b>7</b> and is set to the expanding device via said adhesive sheet to expand the adhesive sheet. Thereby, the surface protective sheet <b>7</b> is expanded. Also, in case each individual chip <b>10</b> and the adhesive film <b>3</b> are transferred to other adhesive sheet, the adhesive film <b>3</b> can be cut by expanding the other adhesive sheet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0082">The adhesive film <b>3</b> and the surface protective sheet <b>7</b> are stacked so that it can be removed. Therefore, if the chip <b>10</b> is picked up, the adhesive film <b>3</b> and the surface protective sheet <b>7</b> is peeled off at the boundary therebetween. Hence, the chip <b>10</b> is picked up, while the adhesive film <b>3</b> which is cut into the same shape as the chip <b>10</b> is adhered to the circuit face side of the chip <b>10</b>. Also, it is easy to transfer the chip with the adhesive film to other adhesive sheet.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0083">Also, in case the supporting film <b>4</b> is left on the adhesive film <b>3</b>, the adhesive film <b>3</b> and the supporting film <b>4</b> are stacked removably. Therefore, when the chip <b>10</b> is picked up, the peeling occurs at the boundary between the adhesive film <b>3</b> and the supporting film <b>4</b>. Hence, the chip <b>10</b> is picked up while the adhesive film <b>3</b>, which is cut into the same shape as the chip <b>10</b>, is adhered to the circuit face side of the chip <b>10</b>. On the other hand, the supporting film <b>4</b> is left to the surface protective sheet <b>7</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0084">The chip <b>10</b> can be picked up by known means such as suction collet or so. Also, the chip may be lifted from the back side of the surface protective sheet <b>7</b> or other adhesive sheet using thrust pins, depending on the needs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0085">The chip which has been picked up may proceed directly to the next step or after the flipping step of the chip.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0086">In (S<b>4</b>) step, individual chip <b>10</b> is placed on the predetermined position of electrode portions <b>12</b> or so of the chip mounting substrate <b>11</b> via the adhesive film <b>3</b> (refer to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0087">Specifically, the chip <b>10</b> having the adhesive film <b>3</b> on the circuit face side is placed on the predetermined chip mounting substrate <b>11</b> by facedown method.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0013">(S<b>5</b>) Step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0088">In (S<b>5</b>) step, the die-bonded chip <b>10</b> having adhesive film is heated and the chip is fixed to the chip mounting substrate <b>11</b> (not illustrated).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0089">The adhesive film <b>3</b> is formed by; the B-stage resin, the hardenable pressure sensitive adhesive or the thermoplastic resins or so which exhibits the adhesiveness due by heat as described in above. By heating these under the predetermined conditions, in case of B-stage resin, it will exhibit the adhesiveness due to the curing of the resin; and in case of the hardenable pressure sensitive adhesives, it will exhibit the adhesiveness due to the curing of the thermo-setting resins included therein. Also, in case of the thermoplastic resins, it will exhibit the adhesiveness due to the heat sealing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0014">(IP) Step</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0090">The manufacturing method of the semiconductor device of the present invention includes one or more times of the pressure applying step by applying the static pressure larger than a ambient pressure by 0.05 MPa or more to the stacked body including adhesive film <b>3</b>, at any point after above described (S<b>1</b>) step and before (S<b>5</b>) step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0091">In the above described (S<b>1</b>) step, the air bubbles may be trapped in the space between the wafer circuit face and the adhesive film when adhering the adhesive film <b>3</b> to the circuit face of the wafer <b>1</b>. Also, during (S<b>4</b>) step, the air bubbles may be trapped in the space between the chip mounting substrate surface <b>11</b> and the adhesive film <b>3</b>. Particularly, recently, in many cases the indents due to the wiring pattern are formed on the surface of the chip mounting substrate <b>11</b>, thus the voids are easily produced. During (S<b>5</b>) step, although it depends on the type of the adhesive film <b>3</b>, the gas is produced from the adhesive film <b>3</b> when curing the adhesive film <b>3</b>, thus the voids may be produced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0092">The present invention removes these voids or prevents the production thereof by applying the static pressure to the stacked body including the adhesive film <b>3</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0093">The step of applying the static pressure is a step to apply the pressure evenly from every directions (static pressure) of the stacked body including the adhesive film <b>3</b> before the adhesive film <b>3</b> completely cures. The condition for applying the static pressure is; larger than 0.05 MPa with respect to the ambient pressure, and preferably +0.1 to +1.0 MPa with respect to the ambient pressure. That is a pressure larger than by 0.05 MPa or more, preferably by 0.1 to 1.0 MPa the ambient pressure is applied. The time for applying the pressure is 1 to 180 minutes, and more preferably 5 to 120 minutes. The temperature at that time is usually 30 to 140° C. or so. The pressure and the temperature may be applied gradually. Also, the static pressure may be applied under air atmosphere, or under the inactive gas atmosphere of Nitrogen or argon or so.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0094">The condition for applying the static pressure varies depending on the compositions of the adhesive film <b>3</b>; however it is applied under the condition such that the resin component constituting the adhesive film can flow due to the pressure. For example, incase the adhesive film <b>3</b> is the B-stage resin, the pressure is applied at the temperature in which the semi-cured resin can re-flow and at the temperature lower than the curing temperature of the resin. Also, in case the adhesive film <b>3</b> is the hardenable pressure sensitive adhesive, the static pressure is applied at the temperature lower than the temperature in which the thermosetting resin included in the adhesive layer completely cures and at the temperature in which the binder resin can flow. Also, in case the adhesive film <b>3</b> is the thermoplastic resin, the static pressure is applied at the temperature in which the thermoplastic resin can melt and flow.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0095">When single direction compression is applied under the above described temperature condition, the resin component constituting the adhesive film <b>3</b> leaks out from the edge face of the wafer or the chip; and roll up towards the back face of the wafer or the chip. However, by applying the static pressure, the pressure is applied evenly to the whole body, hence the role up of the adhesive does not occur. Also, due to such application of the static pressure, the voids produced in the adhesive film are removed. Thus, according to the manufacturing method of the present invention including the step of applying the static pressure, highly reliable semiconductor device without the voids in the underfill material can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0096">Said step of applying the static pressure is performed at any point from the above described (S<b>1</b>) step to (S<b>5</b>) step; and it may be performed multiple times. Specifically, by applying the static pressure (IP) after the (S<b>1</b>) step, the air bubbles produced upon adhering the adhesive film <b>3</b> for the underfill to the wafer circuit face are removed. Also, by applying the static pressure (IP) after (S<b>4</b>) step, the air bubbles, which was taken in between the chip mounting substrate <b>11</b> surface and the adhesive film <b>3</b> upon die-bonding the chip <b>10</b> on the chip mounting substrate <b>10</b> via the adhesive film <b>3</b>, can be removed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0097">Alternatively, the static pressure application (IP) may be performed simultaneously with (S<b>5</b>) step. (S<b>5</b>) step is a step of fixing the chip <b>10</b> to the chip mounting substrate <b>11</b> via the adhesive film <b>3</b> by heating the chip. By applying the static pressure simultaneously with the heating, the static pressure is applied at the heating step while the adhesive film <b>3</b> is somewhat flowable; hence the air bubbles produced at (S<b>1</b>) step or (S<b>4</b>) steps are removed. Also the production of the voids due to the gas production upon curing the adhesive film can be also suppressed. Furthermore, the static pressure is applied while heating, hence the chip <b>10</b> can be firmly adhered to the chip mounting substrate <b>11</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0098">As the device for applying the static pressure, it is not particularly limited as far as the static pressure can be applied to the stacked body including the adhesive film <b>3</b> during (S<b>1</b>) to (S<b>5</b>) steps; however preferably autoclave (pressure resistant container with the compressor) or so are used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0099">After die-bonding (flip chip bonding) as such, the semiconductor device can be obtained via the ordinary step such as the resin sealing or so.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0100">According to the manufacturing method of the present invention, an appropriate amount of underfill resin layer can be easily provided to the circuit surface of the chip by using the so-called DBG process. Thus, the DBG process can be combined with the mounting technique which mounts the circuit face side to the chip mounting substrate thereby the continuous process becomes possible. Also, even if the voids are produced in the underfill material during the mounting step, the voids are removed by applying the static pressure; thereby highly reliable semiconductor device can be obtained. Thus, according to the present invention, it is possible to continuously perform the mounting process which uses the so-called DBG process and flip chip bonding; and the manufacturing method of the semiconductor device contributing to simplify the manufacturing process and to improve the product quality can be provided.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0101">Hereinabove, the manufacturing method of the present invention has been explained according to the drawings. However, the present invention is not to be limited to the above described embodiments and can be applied to the manufacturing method of semiconductor device having various constitutions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0102">For example, the manufacturing method of the present invention may be applied to the manufacturing method of semiconductor device of multi-stack type. That is, the method of the present invention can be applied to the die-bonding step wherein the chip relatively constituting the upper portion and the chip relatively constituting the lower portion are stacked via the adhesive film <b>3</b>. In this case, the back side of the chip relatively constituting the lower portion (the opposite face of the circuit formed face) corresponds to the chip mounting substrate <b>11</b> in the above. The semiconductor device obtained in here can be a same size stack type semiconductor device wherein the upper portion and the lower portion have the same size. Alternatively, it may be a multi stack type semiconductor device having a different size in a step form.</div>
