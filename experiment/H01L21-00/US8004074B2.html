<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from Japanese patent application No. 2007-105852, filed on Apr. 13, 2007, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device for realizing a package for stacked package SiP that is thinner and less prone to warp, and to a method of fabricating such a semiconductor device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">SiP (System in Package) is receiving attention as a technology for achieving smaller electronic apparatuses having higher functionality. Within SiP, stacked-package SiP (PoP, Package on Package) provides an easy solution to the problem of ensuring that products are defect-free. In addition, stacked-package SiP allows a high degree of freedom in combining chips. As a result, orders for stacked-package SiP are increasing, particularly for portable telephones.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">However, stacked-package SiP have the problem of higher assembly height than stacked-semiconductor element SiP in which a plurality of semiconductor elements are stacked in one package. Stacked-package SiP further have the problems of greater package warp and swelling due to the thinning of the interposer substrate and partial molding in which only sites for mounting semiconductor elements are molded.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a sectional view showing a typical configuration of a lower package in stacked-package SiP. This package uses built-up circuit board <b>11</b> having core layer <b>12</b> as an interposer substrate. In this package, moreover, semiconductor element <b>10</b>, which is a chip, is connected by wire bonding to built-up circuit board <b>11</b> by bonding wires <b>26</b>. This package has a partially molded structure in which only the mounting site of semiconductor element <b>10</b> is sealed by sealing layer <b>14</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">Various techniques have been proposed as countermeasures for the height of attachment and package warp.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">For example, JP-A-2003-133521 describes a technique for lowering the profile of the assembly. More specifically, JP-A-2003-133521 describes a technique in which a package is fabricated by, rather than mounting a chip on a substrate, providing an opening in the substrate, mounting a chip face-up on a support tape on the bottom of the opening, connecting the chip by wire bonding, implementing partial molding of the chip site, and finally, mounting balls.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">Alternatively, JP-A-2005-45251 discloses a technique for fabricating a package by mounting a chip on a substrate, mounting solder balls as external electrodes, molding the entire surface, and then grinding a portion of the solder balls and chip reverse surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">As a countermeasure for warp of the package, JP-A-2007-42762 discloses a technique of varying the heights of electrodes that are formed on a lower package and that are the connectors with an upper package in order to ensure connection reliability when warp occurs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">Although both lower profile of the assembly height and reduced warp of the package are sought in stacked-package SiP, these two objects are difficult to achieve simultaneously in stacked-package SiP.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">In the technique disclosed in JP-A-2003-133521, the thickness of a package is reduced by providing openings in the substrate and mounting semiconductor elements in these openings. However, such a package adopts a partially molded construction only for semiconductor elements, and as a result, warp is difficult to suppress at the ends of the package that are not sealed by molding.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">In the technique disclosed in JP-A-2005-45251, a construction in which the entire surface is sealed by molding is realized by mounting a semiconductor element and solder balls on a substrate and then molding the entire surface. However, the reverse surface of the semiconductor element is exposed by grinding, and although the thickness of the package can be reduced, warp in the region of the semiconductor element is difficult to suppress.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">In the technique disclosed in JP-A-2007-42762, the problem of connection defects resulting from warp when stacking an upper and lower package is solved by adjusting the height of electrodes on the lower package. However, when reducing the thickness of a substrate to achieve assembly height of a lower profile, warp of the package is difficult to absorb by merely adjusting the height of electrodes. Lower profile of the assembly height and reduced warp are therefore difficult to achieve simultaneously.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">An exemplary object of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor device that can simultaneously achieve a lower profile of assembly height and reduced warp and a method of fabricating such a semiconductor device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">A semiconductor device according to an exemplary aspect of the invention is a semiconductor device, in which a semiconductor element is mounted on one side of a circuit board that is made up from an insulating layer and a wiring layer, and which includes metal posts provided on the side of the circuit board on which the semiconductor element is mounted; and a sealing layer provided on the side of the circuit board on which the semiconductor element is mounted such that the semiconductor element is covered and such that only portions of the metal posts are exposed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">A method according to an exemplary aspect of the invention is a method of fabricating a semiconductor device which includes forming a circuit board composed of an insulating layer and a wiring layer on a metal body; forming a mask on a surface of the metal body that is opposite a surface of the metal body that contacts the circuit board; forming metal posts by removing a portion of the metal body using the mask; mounting a semiconductor element on the circuit board on which the metal posts have been formed; embedding the semiconductor element and the metal posts in a sealing layer; and exposing surfaces of the metal posts that are opposite surfaces that contact the circuit board by removing a portion of the sealing layer.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">The exemplary embodiments of the present invention are next described specifically with reference to the accompanying figures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0005">Semiconductor Device</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a sectional view showing an example of the construction of the semiconductor device according to the first exemplary embodiment of the present invention and a partial enlarged view of this semiconductor device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">Semiconductor device <b>40</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes circuit board <b>17</b>. In circuit board <b>17</b>, lower-layer wiring <b>18</b> is electrically connected to upper layer wiring <b>20</b> by way of vias <b>19</b>. A plurality of metal posts <b>24</b>, semiconductor element <b>10</b>, and sealing layer <b>14</b> are provided on the lower-layer wiring <b>18</b> side of circuit board <b>17</b>. Semiconductor element <b>10</b> is covered by sealing layer <b>14</b>. Sealing layer <b>14</b> is also provided between the plurality of metal posts <b>24</b>. The surfaces of metal posts <b>24</b>, which are opposite the surfaces that contact circuit board <b>17</b> (only portions of metal posts <b>24</b>), are exposed. Sealing layer <b>14</b> is formed from an organic material that includes reinforcement material <b>27</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067">Metal posts <b>24</b> are made up of, for example, any of copper, nickel, aluminum, gold, silver, palladium, platinum, iron, stainless steel, zinc, magnesium, titanium, 42-alloy, chromium, vanadium, rhodium, molybdenum, and cobalt, or a material of a plurality of these elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068">According to the purposes of lower cost and ease of processing, copper is particularly suited as metal posts <b>24</b>. In the first exemplary embodiment, copper is used as metal posts <b>24</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">Regarding the shape of metal posts <b>24</b>, of the surfaces of metal posts <b>24</b> in the first exemplary embodiment, the area of the surfaces that contact circuit board <b>17</b> is greater than the area of the opposite surfaces, and the degree of contact between metal posts <b>24</b> and circuit board <b>17</b> is therefore high. As a result, sealing layer <b>14</b> can be easily processed even when sealing layer <b>14</b> is deposited in liquid or film form on metal posts <b>24</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0070">In the first exemplary embodiment, the shape of metal posts <b>24</b> is not limited to the shape shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In addition, at least one of a plurality of metal posts <b>24</b> is connected to lower-layer wiring <b>18</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">Semiconductor element <b>10</b> is electrically connected by way of solder balls <b>15</b> to circuit board <b>17</b> (more specifically, to lower-layer wiring <b>18</b>). This connection is realized as a flip-chip connection. The space between semiconductor element <b>10</b> and circuit board <b>17</b> is filled with underfill resin <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0072">Solder balls <b>15</b> are balls composed of a solder material. Solder balls <b>15</b> are attached on circuit board <b>17</b> by means of a plating method, ball transfer method, and printing method. Solder balls <b>15</b> are composed of lead-tin eutectic solder or lead-free solder.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0073">Underfill resin <b>16</b> is made up from a material obtained by adding silica filler to an epoxy material. Underfill resin <b>16</b> decreases the difference between the thermal expansion coefficients of semiconductor element <b>10</b> and solder ball <b>15</b>, and underfill resin <b>16</b> therefore prevents damage to solder balls <b>15</b>. If solder balls <b>15</b> have sufficient rigidity to enable maintenance of high reliability, underfill resin <b>16</b> is unnecessary.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0074">Regarding the bonding of circuit board <b>17</b> and semiconductor element <b>10</b>, a conductive paste or copper bumps may be used in place of solder balls <b>15</b>. In the first exemplary embodiment, solder balls <b>15</b> are used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0075">The method of connecting semiconductor element <b>10</b> and circuit board <b>17</b> is not limited to the method described above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0076">For example, semiconductor element <b>10</b> may be adhered to circuit board <b>17</b> by adhesive <b>25</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, or, of the surfaces of semiconductor element <b>10</b>, the surface opposite the surface adhered to circuit board <b>17</b> may be connected to circuit board <b>17</b> (more specifically, lower-layer wiring <b>18</b>) by bonding wires <b>26</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0077">An organic material or silver paste may be used as adhesive <b>25</b>. Bonding wires <b>26</b> are composed of a material chiefly composed of gold and electrically connect the electrodes of both semiconductor element <b>10</b> and circuit board <b>17</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0078">Circuit board <b>17</b> is made up from, for example, at least one wiring layer and insulating layer, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0079">In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, insulating layer <b>21</b> is of one layer while the wiring layers are the two layers: upper-layer wiring <b>20</b> and lower-layer wiring <b>18</b>, but the insulating layer and the wiring layers are not limited to this form, and the insulating layer and the wiring layers may be of a configuration made up from a required number of layers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0080">Insulating layer <b>21</b> of circuit board <b>17</b> is formed of, for example, an organic material that is photosensitive or non-photosensitive. A material such as epoxy resin, epoxy-acrylate resin, urethane acrylate resin, polyester resin, phenol resin, polyimide resin, BCB (benzocyclobutene), PBO (polybenzoxazole), or polynorbornane resin may be used as the organic material. Alternatively, a material obtained by impregnating a woven fabric or a non-woven fabric formed from glass cloth or aramid fibers with epoxy resin, epoxy acrylate resin, urethane acrylate resin, polyester resin, phenol resin, polyimide resin, BCB (benzocyclobutene), PBO (polybenzoxazole) or polynorbornane resin may be used as the organic material. In the first exemplary embodiment, a glass cloth impregnated with epoxy resin is used as the organic material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0081">At least one metal selected from the group composed of copper, silver, gold, nickel, aluminum, and palladium or an alloy that takes these metals as a chief component is used as lower-layer wiring <b>18</b>, upper-layer wiring <b>20</b>, and vias <b>19</b> that are included in circuit board <b>17</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0082">According to the standpoints of electrical resistance and cost, lower-layer wiring <b>18</b>, upper-layer wiring <b>20</b>, and vias <b>19</b> are preferably formed from copper.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0083">In the first exemplary embodiment, lower-layer wiring <b>18</b>, upper-layer wiring, <b>20</b>, and vias <b>19</b> are formed from copper. A solder resist may be formed on insulating layer <b>21</b> such that a portion of upper-layer wiring <b>20</b> is exposed and the remaining portion of upper-layer wiring <b>20</b> is covered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0084">A portion of lower-layer wiring <b>18</b> in circuit board <b>17</b> having a surface on which metal posts <b>24</b> are provided may be level with insulating layer <b>21</b> or may be depressed with respect to insulating layer <b>21</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0085">When the surfaces are even, electrode pads (not shown) that are made up from lower-layer wiring <b>18</b> can be applied to narrow pitches in the wire bonding connection between circuit board <b>17</b> and semiconductor element <b>10</b>. In addition, the elimination of interference between the bonding wire tool and insulating layer <b>21</b> improves yield when making connections.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0086">When the portion of lower-layer wiring <b>18</b> is depressed (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), insulating layer <b>21</b> functions as a resist in the flip-chip connection of semiconductor element <b>10</b>. As a result, solder balls can be formed in only the depressed portions, thereby eliminating the need to separately provide a resist pattern for forming solder balls.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0087">In addition, a capacitor may be provided in a desired position of circuit board <b>17</b> in order to serve as a noise filter of the circuit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0088">A metal oxide material such as titanium oxide, tantalum oxide, aluminum oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), silicon dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>), zirconium oxide (ZrO<sub>2</sub>), hafnium oxide (HfO<sub>2</sub>), or niobium pentoxide (Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) is preferably used as the dielectric material that makes up the capacitor. Alternatively, a perovskite material such as BST (barium strontium titanate) (Ba<sub>x</sub>Sr<sub>1-x</sub>TiO<sub>3</sub>), PZT (lead zirconate titanate) (PbZr<sub>x</sub>Ti<sub>1-x</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), or PLZT (Pb<sub>1-y</sub>La<sub>y</sub>Zr<sub>x</sub>Ti<sub>1-x</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), or a Bi-series layered compound such as SrBi<sub>2</sub>Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>9 </sub>may be used as the dielectric material. Here, the values “x” and “y” satisfy the relations 0≦x≦1 and 0&lt;y&lt;1.
