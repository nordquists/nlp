<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">As electronic products are directed towards slimness, light weight and compactness, the semiconductor structure using through silicon via (TSV) technology has become a mainstream trend. Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A˜1G</figref>, perspectives of a method for manufacturing a semiconductor structure <b>900</b> using through silicon via technology are shown. The manufacturing method includes the following steps. Firstly, referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a silicon wafer <b>910</b> having a first surface <b>910</b> <i>a </i>and a second surface <b>910</b> <i>b </i>is provided. Next, referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, an indent <b>910</b> <i>c </i>is formed on the first surface <b>910</b> <i>a </i>by dry etching. Then, referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, an insulating layer <b>920</b> made from silicon nitride material for example is formed by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technology to cover the first surface <b>910</b> <i>a </i>and the inner wall of the indent <b>910</b> <i>c</i>. After that, referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, a copper material <b>940</b> is electroplated in the indent <b>910</b> <i>c</i>. Then, referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>, a conductive pad <b>950</b> is formed on the first surface <b>910</b> <i>a </i>and covers the indent <b>910</b> <i>c</i>. Afterwards, referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref>, the second surface <b>910</b> <i>b </i>is polished until the copper material <b>940</b> filled in the indent <b>910</b> <i>c </i>is exposed.
