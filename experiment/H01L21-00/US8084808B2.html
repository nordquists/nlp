<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This application is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 11/117,121 filed Apr. 28, 2005, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,390,756 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">This application relates generally to semiconductor devices and device fabrication.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The semiconductor device industry has a market driven need to reduce the size of devices such as transistors. To reduce transistor size, the thickness of the silicon dioxide, SiO<sub>2</sub>, gate dielectric is reduced in proportion to the shrinkage of the gate length. A goal is to fabricate increasingly smaller and more reliable integrated circuits (ICs) for use in products such as processor chips, mobile telephones, and memory devices such as dynamic random access memories (DRAMs).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Currently, the semiconductor industry relies on the ability to reduce or scale the dimensions of its basic devices, primarily, the silicon based metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET). This device scaling includes scaling the gate dielectric, which has primarily been fabricated using silicon dioxide. A thermally grown amorphous SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer provides an electrically and thermodynamically stable material, where the interface of the SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer with underlying silicon provides a high quality interface as well as superior electrical isolation properties. However, increased scaling and other requirements in microelectronic devices have created the need to use other dielectric materials as gate dielectrics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">An embodiment for a method of forming an electronic device includes forming a dielectric layer containing a zirconium silicon oxide film in an integrated circuit. The zirconium silicon oxide film may be formed by atomic layer deposition. Embodiments include structures for capacitors, transistors, memory devices, and electronic systems with dielectric layers containing an atomic layer deposited zirconium silicon oxide film, and methods for forming such structures.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings that show, by way of illustration, specific aspects and embodiments in which the present invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the present invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and structural, logical, and electrical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The various embodiments disclosed herein are not necessarily mutually exclusive, as some disclosed embodiments can be combined with one or more other disclosed embodiments to form new embodiments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">The terms wafer and substrate used in the following description include any structure having an exposed surface with which to form an integrated circuit (IC) structure. The term substrate is understood to include semiconductor wafers. The term substrate is also used to refer to semiconductor structures during processing, and may include other layers that have been fabricated thereupon. Both wafer and substrate include doped and undoped semiconductors, epitaxial semiconductor layers supported by a base semiconductor or insulator, as well as other semiconductor structures well known to one skilled in the art. The term conductor is understood to generally include n-type and p-type semiconductors, and the term insulator or dielectric is defined generally to include any material that is less electrically conductive than the materials referred to as conductors. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">A gate dielectric in a transistor has both a physical gate dielectric thickness and an equivalent oxide thickness (t<sub>eq</sub>). The equivalent oxide thickness quantifies the electrical properties, such as capacitance, of the gate dielectric in terms of a representative physical thickness. t<sub>eq </sub>is defined as the thickness of a theoretical SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer that would be required to have the same capacitance density as a given dielectric, ignoring leakage current and reliability considerations.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">A SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer of thickness, t, deposited on a Si surface as a gate dielectric will have a t<sub>eq </sub>larger than its thickness, t. This t<sub>eq </sub>results from the capacitance in the surface channel on which the SiO<sub>2 </sub>is deposited due to the formation of a depletion/inversion region. This depletion/inversion region can result in t<sub>eq </sub>being from 3 to 6 Angstroms (Å) larger than the SiO<sub>2 </sub>thickness, t. Thus, with the semiconductor industry driving to someday scale the gate dielectric equivalent oxide thickness to under 10 Å, the physical thickness for a SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer used for a gate dielectric would be need to be approximately 4 to 7 Å.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">Additional requirements on a SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer would depend on the gate electrode used in conjunction with the SiO<sub>2 </sub>gate dielectric. Using a conventional polysilicon gate would result in an additional increase in t<sub>eq </sub>for the SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer. This additional thickness may be eliminated by using a metal gate electrode. Thus, future devices would be designed towards a physical SiO<sub>2 </sub>gate dielectric layer of about 5 Å or less. Such a small thickness for a SiO<sub>2 </sub>oxide layer creates additional problems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">Silicon dioxide is used as a gate dielectric, in part, due to its electrical isolation properties in a SiO<sub>2</sub>—Si based structure. This electrical isolation is due to the relatively large band gap of SiO<sub>2 </sub>(8.9 eV), making it a good insulator from electrical conduction. Significant reductions in its band gap would eliminate it as a material for a gate dielectric. As the thickness of a SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer decreases, the number of atomic layers, or monolayers of the material in the thickness decreases. At a certain thickness, the number of monolayers will be sufficiently small that the SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer will not have a complete arrangement of atoms as in a larger or bulk layer. As a result of incomplete formation relative to a bulk structure, a thin SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer of only one or two monolayers will not form a full band gap. The lack of a full band gap in a SiO<sub>2 </sub>gate dielectric would cause an effective short between an underlying Si channel and an overlying polysilicon gate. This undesirable property sets a limit on the physical thickness to which a SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer can be scaled. The minimum thickness due to this monolayer effect is thought to be about 7-8 Å. Therefore, for future devices to have a t<sub>eq </sub>less than about 10 Å, dielectrics other than SiO<sub>2 </sub>need to be considered for use as a gate dielectric.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">For a typical dielectric layer used as a gate dielectric, the capacitance is determined as one for a parallel plate capacitance: C=κ∈<sub>0</sub>A/t, where κ is the dielectric constant, ∈<sub>0 </sub>is the permittivity of free space, A is the area of the capacitor, and t is the thickness of the dielectric. The thickness, t, of a material is related to its t<sub>eq </sub>for a given capacitance, with SiO<sub>2 </sub>having a dielectric constant κ<sub>ox</sub>=3.9, as
<br/>
<i>t</i>=(κ/κ<sub>ox</sub>)<i>t</i> <sub>eq</sub>=(κ/3.9)<i>t</i> <sub>eq</sub>.
<br/>
Thus, materials with a dielectric constant greater than that of SiO<sub>2</sub>, 3.9, will have a physical thickness that can be considerably larger than a desired t<sub>eq</sub>, while providing the desired equivalent oxide thickness. For example, an alternate dielectric material with a dielectric constant of 10 could have a thickness of about 25.6 Å to provide a t<sub>eq </sub>of 10 Å, not including any depletion/inversion layer effects. Thus, a reduced equivalent oxide thickness for transistors can be realized by using dielectric materials with higher dielectric constants than SiO<sub>2</sub>.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">The thinner equivalent oxide thickness required for lower transistor operating voltages and smaller transistor dimensions may be realized by a significant number of materials, but additional fabricating requirements makes determining a suitable replacement for SiO<sub>2 </sub>difficult. The current view for the microelectronics industry is still for Si based devices. This requires that the gate dielectric employed be grown on a silicon substrate or silicon layer, which places significant constraints on the substitute dielectric material. During the formation of the dielectric on the silicon layer, there exists the possibility that a small layer of SiO<sub>2 </sub>could be formed in addition to the desired dielectric. The result would effectively be a dielectric layer consisting of two sublayers in parallel with each other and the silicon layer on which the dielectric is formed. In such a case, the resulting capacitance would be that of two dielectrics in series. As a result, the t<sub>eq </sub>of the dielectric layer would be the sum of the SiO<sub>2 </sub>thickness and a multiplicative factor of the thickness, t, of the dielectric being formed, written as
<br/>
<i>t</i> <sub>eq</sub> <i>=t</i> <sub>SiO2</sub>+(κ<sub>ox</sub>/κ)<i>t. </i>
<br/>
Thus, if a SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer is formed in the process, the t<sub>eq </sub>is again limited by a SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer. In the event that a barrier layer is formed between the silicon layer and the desired dielectric in which the barrier layer prevents the formation of a SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer, the t<sub>eq </sub>would be limited by the layer with the lowest dielectric constant. However, whether a single dielectric layer with a high dielectric constant or a barrier layer with a higher dielectric constant than SiO<sub>2 </sub>is employed, the layer interfacing with the silicon layer must provide a high quality interface to maintain a high channel carrier mobility.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">One of the advantages of using SiO<sub>2 </sub>as a gate dielectric has been that the formation of the SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer results in an amorphous gate dielectric. Having an amorphous structure for a gate dielectric provides for reducing problems of leakage current associated with grain boundaries in polycrystalline gate dielectrics that provide high leakage paths. Additionally, grain size and orientation changes throughout a polycrystalline gate dielectric can cause variations in the film's dielectric constant, along with uniformity and surface topography problems. Typically, materials having the advantage of a high dielectric constant relative to SiO<sub>2 </sub>also have the disadvantage of a crystalline form, at least in a bulk configuration. The best candidates for replacing SiO<sub>2 </sub>as a gate dielectric are those that can be fabricated as a thin layer with an amorphous form and that have high dielectric constants.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">High-κ materials include materials having a dielectric constant greater than silicon dioxide, for example, dielectric materials having a dielectric constant greater than about twice the dielectric constant of silicon dioxide. Examples of such high-κ materials include HfO<sub>2</sub>, ZrO<sub>2</sub>, Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Other materials that provide dielectric constants higher than silicon dioxide include metal silicates, though the dielectric constants of metal silicates tend to be lower than the corresponding metal oxides. One such silicate is zirconium silicate, ZrSi<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y </sub>or (ZrO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>x</sub>(SiO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>1-x</sub>, which has a dielectric constant that depends on the zirconium concentration. For example, one zirconium silicate is zircon, ZrSiO<sub>4</sub>, having a dielectric constant in the 12.5 range. In addition, since zirconium oxide tends to be thermally stable in contact with a silicon substrate, zirconium silicate may provide a good interface with the silicon substrate. With low zirconium content, a zirconium silicate has a lattice compatible with silicon dioxide. With increasing zirconium content, the zirconium silicate may have significant lattice changes relative to silicon dioxide. However, as the zirconium content in a zirconium silicate film increases, its dielectric constant also increases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">Dielectric layers of zirconium silicon oxide offer a material that can provide a relatively high dielectric constant with respect to silicon oxide. A zirconium silicon oxide film may include a zirconium silicate and/or a mixture of zirconium oxide and silicon oxide, written as ZrO<sub>x</sub>/SiO<sub>y</sub>. Engineering a zirconium silicon oxide film can provide dielectric layers for electronic devices with dielectric constants that may range in value from about 3.9 for SiO<sub>2 </sub>to about 25 for ZrO<sub>2</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">Other characteristics for choosing a silicon oxide replacement include using materials that provide a sharp interface with silicon, which may provide a low density of interface states, a large energy barrier from the conduction band to the Fermi level of the gate electrode to maintain leakage current at acceptable levels, and structural stability with contact electrodes and substrate material during device processing steps performed after providing the dielectric layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">Various embodiments for forming a zirconium silicon oxide film by atomic layer deposition provide a film having a zirconium silicate, a zirconium oxide/silicon oxide mixture, or a combination of a zirconium silicate and a zirconium oxide/silicon oxide mixture. Furthermore, the zirconium silicon oxide film may be a specific stoichiometric zirconium silicon oxide and/or a non-stoichiometric zirconium silicon oxide. The expression ZrSi<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y </sub>is used herein to represent a stoichiometric and/or a non-stoichiometric zirconium silicate, the expression ZrO<sub>x </sub>is used herein to represent a stoichiometric and/or a non-stoichiometric zirconium oxide, and the expression SiO<sub>y </sub>is used herein to represent a stoichiometric and/or a non-stoichiometric silicon oxide. In various embodiments, both a silicon oxide and a zirconium oxide may be doped with other elements. Embodiments of dielectric layers containing an atomic layer deposited zirconium silicon oxide layer have a larger dielectric constant than silicon dioxide. Such dielectric layers provide a significantly thinner equivalent oxide thickness compared with a silicon oxide layer having the same physical thickness. Alternatively, such dielectric layers provide a significantly thicker physical thickness than a silicon oxide layer having the same equivalent oxide thickness. This increased physical thickness aids in reducing leakage current.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">Another consideration for selecting the material and method for forming a dielectric layer for use in electronic devices and systems concerns the roughness of a dielectric layer on a substrate. Surface roughness of the dielectric layer has a significant effect on the electrical properties of the gate oxide, and the resulting operating characteristics of the transistor. The leakage current through a physical 1.0 nm gate oxide increases by a factor of 10 for every 0.1 increase in the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">During a conventional sputtering deposition process stage, particles of the material to be deposited bombard the surface at a high energy. When a particle hits the surface, some particles adhere, and other particles cause damage. High energy impacts remove body region particles, creating pits. The surface of such a deposited layer can have a rough contour due to the rough interface at the body region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">In an embodiment, a zirconium silicon oxide dielectric layer having a substantially smooth surface relative to other processing techniques is formed using atomic layer deposition (ALD). Further, forming such a dielectric layer using atomic layer deposition may control transitions between material layers. Thus, atomic layer deposited zirconium silicon oxide dielectric layers can have an engineered transition with a substrate surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">ALD, also known as atomic layer epitaxy (ALE), is a modification of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and is also called “alternatively pulsed-CVD.” In ALD, gaseous precursors are introduced one at a time to the substrate surface mounted within a reaction chamber (or reactor). This introduction of the gaseous precursors takes the form of pulses of each gaseous precursor. In a pulse of a precursor gas, the precursor gas is made to flow into a specific area or region for a short period of time. Between the pulses, the reaction chamber is purged with a gas and/or evacuated, where in many cases the purging gas is an inert gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">In a chemisorption-saturated ALD (CS-ALD) process, during the first pulsing phase, reaction with the substrate occurs with the precursor saturatively chemisorbed at the substrate surface. Subsequent pulsing with a purging gas removes precursor excess from the reaction chamber.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">The second pulsing phase introduces another precursor on the substrate where the growth reaction of the desired film takes place. Subsequent to the film growth reaction, reaction byproducts and precursor excess are purged from the reaction chamber. With favourable precursor chemistry where the precursors adsorb and react with each other aggressively on the substrate, one ALD cycle can be performed in less than one second in properly designed flow type reaction chambers. Typically, precursor pulse times range from about 0.5 sec to about 2 to 3 seconds.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">In ALD, the saturation of all the reaction and purging phases makes the growth self-limiting. This self-limiting growth results in large area uniformity and conformality, which has important applications for such cases as planar substrates, deep trenches, and in the processing of porous silicon and high surface area silica and alumina powders. Significantly, ALD provides for controlling film thickness in a straightforward manner by controlling the number of growth cycles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">The precursors used in an ALD process may be gaseous, liquid or solid. However, liquid or solid precursors should be volatile. The vapor pressure should be high enough for effective mass transportation. Also, solid and some liquid precursors may need to be heated inside the reaction chamber and introduced through heated tubes to the substrates. The necessary vapor pressure should be reached at a temperature below the substrate temperature to avoid the condensation of the precursors on the substrate. Due to the self-limiting growth mechanisms of ALD, relatively low vapor pressure solid precursors can be used, though evaporation rates may vary somewhat during the process because of changes in their surface area.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">There are several other characteristics for precursors used in ALD. The precursors should be thermally stable at the substrate temperature, because their decomposition may destroy the surface control and accordingly the advantages of the ALD method that relies on the reaction of the precursor at the substrate surface. A slight decomposition, if slow compared to the ALD growth, may be tolerated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">The precursors should chemisorb on or react with the surface, though the interaction between the precursor and the surface as well as the mechanism for the adsorption is different for different precursors. The molecules at the substrate surface should react aggressively with the second precursor to form the desired solid film. Additionally, precursors should not react with the film to cause etching, and precursors should not dissolve in the film. Using highly reactive precursors in ALD contrasts with the selection of precursors for conventional CVD.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">The by-products in the reaction should be gaseous in order to allow their easy removal from the reaction chamber. Further, the by-products should not react or adsorb on the surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">In a reaction sequence ALD (RS-ALD) process, the self-limiting process sequence involves sequential surface chemical reactions. RS-ALD relies on chemistry between a reactive surface and a reactive molecular precursor. In an RS-ALD process, molecular precursors are pulsed into the ALD reaction chamber separately. A metal precursor reaction at the substrate is typically followed by an inert gas pulse to remove excess precursor and by-products from the reaction chamber prior to pulsing the next precursor of the fabrication sequence.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">By RS-ALD, films can be layered in equal metered sequences that are all identical in chemical kinetics, deposition per cycle, composition, and thickness. RS-ALD sequences generally deposit less than a full layer per cycle. Typically, a deposition or growth rate of about 0.25 to about 2.00 Å per RS-ALD cycle can be realized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">The advantages of RS-ALD include continuity at an interface avoiding poorly defined nucleating regions that are typical for chemical vapor deposition (&lt;20 Å) and physical vapor deposition (&lt;50 Å), conformality over a variety of substrate topologies due to its layer-by-layer deposition technique, use of low temperature and mildly oxidizing processes, lack of dependence on the reaction chamber, growth thickness dependent solely on the number of cycles performed, and ability to engineer multilayer laminate films with resolution of one to two monolayers. RS-ALD processes allow for deposition control on the order of monolayers and the ability to deposit monolayers of amorphous films.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">Herein, a sequence refers to the ALD material formation based on an ALD reaction of a precursor with its reactant precursor. For example, forming zirconium oxide from a ZrI<sub>4 </sub>precursor and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, as its reactant precursor, forms an embodiment of a zirconium/oxygen sequence, which can also be referred to as a zirconium sequence. In various ALD processes that form an oxide or a compound that contains oxygen, a reactant precursor that contains oxygen is used to supply oxygen. Herein, a precursor that contains oxygen and that supplies oxygen to be incorporated in the ALD compound formed, which may be used in an ALD process with precursors supplying the other elements in the ALD compound, is referred to as an oxygen reactant precursor. In the above example, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>is an oxygen reactant precursor. A cycle of a sequence may include pulsing a precursor, pulsing a purging gas for the precursor, pulsing a reactant precursor, and pulsing the reactant precursor's purging gas. Further, in forming a layer of a metal species, an ALD sequence may deal with reacting a precursor containing the metal species with a substrate surface. A cycle for such a metal forming sequence may include pulsing a purging gas after pulsing the precursor containing the metal species. Additionally, deposition of a semiconductor material may be realized in a manner similar to forming a layer of a metal, given the appropriate precursors for the semiconductor material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">In an ALD formation of a compound having more than two elements, a cycle includes a number of sequences to provide the elements of the compound. For example, a cycle for an ALD formation of an ABO<sub>x </sub>compound may include sequentially pulsing a first precursor/a purging gas for the first precursor/a first reactant precursor/the first reactant precursor's purging gas/a second precursor/a purging gas for the second precursor/a second reactant precursor/the second reactant precursor's purging gas, which may be viewed as a cycle having two sequences. There may be cases in which ALD formation of an ABO<sub>x </sub>compound uses one precursor that contains the elements A and B, such that pulsing the A/B containing precursor followed by its reactant precursor onto a substrate includes a reaction that deposits ABO<sub>x </sub>on the substrate to provide an A/B/oxygen sequence. A cycle of an AB/oxygen sequence may include pulsing a precursor containing A and B, pulsing a purging gas for the precursor, pulsing a reactant precursor to the A/B precursor, and pulsing a purging gas for the reactant precursor. A cycle may be repeated a number of times to provide a desired thickness of the compound. In an embodiment, a layer of zirconium silicon oxide is formed on a substrate mounted in a reaction chamber using ALD in repetitive zirconium and silicon sequences using precursor gases individually pulsed into the reaction chamber. Alternatively, solid or liquid precursors can be used in an appropriately designed reaction chamber.</div>

Alternatively, coverage of a specific device area may be attained with partial coverage during a particular processing of a sequence. A number of precursors containing zirconium may be used to deposit the zirconium, and a number of precursors containing oxygen may be used. In an embodiment, a dichlorobis[bis(trimethylsilyl)amido]zirconium precursor, ZrCl<sub>2</sub>[N(SiMe<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sub>2</sub>, is used for a zirconium sequence. Me is an abbreviation referring to a methyl-group having the formula, CH<sub>3</sub>. An oxidant reactant precursor to the ZrCl<sub>2</sub>[N(SiMe<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sub>2 </sub>precursor may include, but is not limited to, one or more of water, atomic oxygen, molecular oxygen, ozone, or hydrogen peroxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">A zirconium sequence using ZrCl<sub>2</sub>[N(SiMe<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sub>2 </sub>and an oxidant precursor, such as H<sub>2</sub>O, results in the deposition of an amount of silicon in a ZrO<sub>x </sub>layer. In an embodiment, the silicon may be distributed uniformly throughout the ZrO<sub>x </sub>layer. The amount of silicon deposited is dependent at least on the deposition temperature. As the deposition temperature increases, the amount of silicon increases. For example, in a deposition temperature range of about 150° C. to about 350° C., the amount of incorporated silicon may vary from approximately 1% to almost 5.5%. The application of the ZrCl<sub>2</sub>[N(SiMe<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sub>2 </sub>precursor and H<sub>2</sub>O provides a zirconium silicon oxide film with a low silicon content (zirconium-rich). Other precursors for the zirconium sequence may include zirconium halides and oxygen precursors such as tetra-n-butyl orthosilicate (TBOS), water, atomic oxygen, molecular oxygen, ozone, or hydrogen peroxide.</div>

Pulsing the silicon precursor may be used to control the silicon content in the zirconium silicon oxide film. In an embodiment, a layer of silicon oxide is formed on the substrate by atomic layer deposition. The silicon oxide and the zirconium oxide are deposited to form a zirconium silicon oxide film. In an embodiment, a silicon sequence is performed to control the silicon content in the zirconium silicon oxide film to adjust or compensate for silicon deposited in the zirconium sequence using a precursor such as ZrCl<sub>2</sub>[N(SiMe<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sub>2</sub>. In an embodiment, zirconium oxide is deposited before silicon oxide. In an embodiment, silicon oxide is deposited before zirconium oxide. Alternatively, zirconium and silicon may be jointly deposited using precursors that substantially do not react with each other, but react at the substrate surface. The zirconium silicon oxide film may be formed as an integral component of an electronic device in an integrated circuit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">A zirconium silicon oxide layer may be formed using a number of cycles having various permutations of zirconium/oxide sequences and silicon/oxide sequences. In an embodiment, the zirconium sequences and the silicon sequences are controlled to form the zirconium silicon oxide film with a predetermined amount of silicon with respect to the total amount of silicon and zirconium in the zirconium silicon oxide film. By controlling the content of the silicon and the zirconium in the zirconium silicon oxide film, a film may be engineered with predetermined electrical characteristics. With a high silicon content relative to zirconium, the dielectric constant of the film approaches that of silicon oxide with a low leakage current density at a given electric field strength. With a low silicon content relative to zirconium, the dielectric constant of the film approaches that of zirconium oxide but with a higher leakage current density at the same electric field strength. The silicon content may be adjusted to provide a zirconium silicon oxide film having a dielectric constant in the 8-20 range, while maintaining an acceptable range of leakage current density.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">Either before or after forming the zirconium silicon film, other dielectric layers such as nitride layers and/or insulating metal oxide layers may be formed as part of the dielectric layer or dielectric stack.

Though the existence of an interface layer may effectively reduce the dielectric constant associated with the dielectric layer and its substrate, the interface layer, such as a silicon oxide interface layer or other composition interface layer, may improve the interface density, fixed charge density, and channel mobility of a device having this interface layer.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">Atomic layer deposition of the individual components of the zirconium silicon oxide layer allows for individual control of each precursor pulsed into the reaction chamber. Thus, each precursor is pulsed into the reaction chamber for a predetermined period, where the predetermined period can be set separately for each precursor. In an embodiment, an ALD silicon sequence may be used to control the overall silicon content of the zirconium silicon oxide film to adjust for silicon deposited in a zirconium sequence. Additionally, for various embodiments for ALD formation of a zirconium silicon oxide layer, each precursor can be pulsed into the reaction under separate environmental conditions. The substrate can be maintained at a selected temperature and the reaction chamber maintained at a selected pressure independently for pulsing each precursor. Appropriate temperatures and pressures may be maintained, whether the precursor is a single precursor or a mixture of precursors. During atomic layer deposition, the pulsing of the precursor gases is separated by purging the reaction chamber with a purging gas following each pulsing of a precursor. In an embodiment, nitrogen gas is used as the purging gas following the pulsing of each precursor used in a cycle to form a film of zirconium silicon oxide.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0092">Memory <b>925</b> may be realized as a memory device containing a dielectric layer including a zirconium silicon oxide film formed according to various embodiments. In an embodiment, such a dielectric layer is formed substantially as a zirconium silicon oxide film. It will be understood that embodiments are equally applicable to any size and type of memory circuit and are not intended to be limited to a particular type of memory device. Memory types include a DRAM, SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) or Flash memories. Additionally, the DRAM could be a synchronous DRAM commonly referred to as SGRAM (Synchronous Graphics Random Access Memory), SDRAM (Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory), SDRAM II, and DDR SDRAM (Double Data Rate SDRAM), as well as Synchlink or Rambus DRAMs and other emerging DRAM technologies.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0093">Formation of dielectric layers containing a zirconium silicon oxide film formed by atomic layer deposition, processed in relatively low temperatures, may be amorphous and possess smooth surfaces. Such zirconium silicon oxide films can provide enhanced electrical properties due to their smoother surface, resulting in reduced leakage current. Additionally, such dielectric layers provide a significantly thicker physical thickness than a silicon oxide layer having the same equivalent oxide thickness, where the increased thickness would also reduce leakage current. These properties of embodiments of dielectric layers allow for application as dielectric layers in numerous electronic devices and systems.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0094">Capacitors, transistors, higher level ICs or devices including memory devices, and electronic systems are constructed utilizing the novel process for forming a dielectric film having an ultra thin equivalent oxide thickness, t<sub>eq</sub>. Gate dielectric layers or films including an atomic layer deposited zirconium silicon oxide film may be formed having a dielectric constant (κ) substantially higher than that of silicon oxide. These dielectric films are capable of a t<sub>eq </sub>thinner than SiO<sub>2 </sub>gate dielectrics of the same physical thickness. Alternatively, the high dielectric constant relative to silicon dioxide allows the use of much larger physical thickness of these high-κdielectric materials for the same t<sub>eq </sub>of SiO<sub>2</sub>. Forming the relatively larger thickness aids in processing gate dielectrics and other dielectric layers in electronic devices and systems.</div>
