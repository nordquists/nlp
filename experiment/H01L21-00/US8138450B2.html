<heading>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading>Problem to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Laser processing methods such as the one mentioned above are techniques which are particularly effective when objects to be processed are thick. This is because, even when thick, an object to be processed can accurately be cut along a line to cut if the number of rows of modified regions along the line to cut is increased. It has been desired for such a technique to shorten the processing time while keeping the cutting quality.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">In view of such circumstances, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method of cutting an object to be processed, by which an object to be processed comprising a substrate and a multilayer part provided on the front face of the substrate while having a plurality of functional devices can accurately be cut into the functional devices in a short time along the line to cut even when the substrate is thick.</div>
<heading>Means for Solving Problem</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">For achieving the above-mentioned object, the method of cutting an object to be processed in accordance with the present invention is a method of cutting an object to be processed comprising a substrate and a multilayer part provided on a front face of the substrate while having a plurality of functional devices into the functional devices along a line to cut, the method including the steps of irradiating the substrate with laser light from the multilayer part side while locating a converging point within the substrate, so as to form a first modified region shifted from a center position in a thickness direction of the substrate to the rear face side of the substrate within the substrate along the line to cut; irradiating the substrate with the laser light from the multilayer part side while locating the converging point within the substrate, so as to form a second modified region shifted from the center position in the thickness direction of the substrate to the front face side of the substrate within the substrate along the line to cut and generate a fracture from the second modified region to the front face of the substrate; and generating a stress in the object such as to open the fracture while in a state where an expandable member attached to the rear face of the substrate is expanded after forming the first and second modified regions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">In this object cutting method, the first modified region shifted from the center position in the thickness direction of the substrate to the rear face side of the substrate and the second modified region shifted from the center position in the thickness direction of the substrate to the front face side of the substrate are formed within the substrate along the line to cut, and a fracture is generated from the second modified region to the front face of the substrate. Since a stress is generated in the object in this state such as to open the fracture, the fracture extends toward the multilayer part and first modified region, whereby the object is accurately cut along the line to cut. Since the expandable member attached to the rear face of the substrate is expanded here, cut sections opposing each other will be separated from each other immediately after cutting the object, whereby chipping and cracking due to the opposing cut sections coming into contact with each other are prevented from occurring. This can shorten the processing time while keeping the cutting quality, for example, as compared with the technique cutting the object along a line to cut by increasing the number of rows of modified regions along the line to cut when the substrate is thick. Therefore, this object cutting method makes it possible to accurately cut an object to be processed comprising a substrate and a multilayer part provided on the front face of the substrate while having a plurality of functional devices into the functional devices along a line to cut in a short time even when the substrate is thick.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">Here, the functional devices refer to semiconductor operating layers formed by crystal growth, light-receiving devices such as photodiodes, light-emitting devices such as laser diodes, and circuit devices formed as circuits, for example. The “first modified region shifted from the center position in the thickness direction of the substrate to the rear face side of the substrate” means that the whole part of the first modified region is positioned on the rear face side of the substrate with respect to the center position in the thickness direction of the substrate. On the other hand, the “second modified region shifted from the center position in the thickness direction of the substrate to the front face side of the substrate” means that the whole part of the second modified region is positioned on the front face side of the substrate with respect to the center position in the thickness direction of the substrate. The first and second modified regions are formed by generating multiphoton absorption or other optical absorptions within the substrate by irradiating the substrate with laser light while locating the converging point within the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">Preferably, in a part extending along the line to cut in the substrate, the second modified region forming density in a portion on the front face side of the substrate with respect to the center position in the thickness direction of the substrate is higher than the first modified region forming density in a portion on the rear face side of the substrate with respect to the center position in the thickness direction of the substrate. Preferably, in a part extending along the line to cut in the substrate, the number of rows of the second modified region is greater than the number of rows of the first modified region. These make it possible to more accurately cut the object comprising a substrate and a multilayer part provided on the front face of the substrate while having a plurality of functional devices into the functional devices along a line to cut even when the substrate is thick.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">Here, the first modified region forming density in a portion on the rear face side of the substrate with respect to the center position in the thickness direction of the substrate refers to the ratio occupied by the first modified region with respect to this portion. Similarly, the second modified region forming density in a portion on the front face side of the substrate with respect to the center position in the thickness direction of the substrate refers to the ratio occupied by the first modified region with respect to this portion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">Preferably, after forming the first modified region within the substrate, the second modified region is formed within the substrate, and the fracture is generated from the second modified region to the front face of the substrate. When forming each modified region in this case, none of modified regions and fractures exists between the front face of the substrate where the laser light is incident and the converging point of the laser light, whereby no laser light is scattered, absorbed, and so forth by modified regions and the like which have already been formed. Therefore, each modified region can be formed reliably.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">Preferably, a pressing member is pressed against the rear face of the substrate with the expandable member interposed therebetween, so as to generate such a stress in the object as to open the fracture. This can easily and reliably generate such a stress as to open the fracture in the object.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">There is a case where the substrate is a semiconductor substrate, while the first and second modified regions include a molten processed region. When the substrate is a semiconductor substrate, there is a case where a modified region including a molten processed region is formed as the first and second modified regions.</div>
<heading>Effect of the Invention</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">The present invention can cut an object to be processed comprising a substrate and a multilayer part provided on the front face of the substrate while having a plurality of functional devices into the functional devices along a line to cut in a short time even when the substrate is thick.</div>

<heading>BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">In the following, a preferred embodiment of the present invention will be explained in detail with reference to the drawings. In the laser processing method in accordance with the embodiment, a phenomenon known as multiphoton absorption is used for forming a modified region within an object to be processed. Therefore, to begin with, a laser processing method for forming a modified region by the multiphoton absorption will be explained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">A material becomes transparent when its absorption bandgap E<sub>G </sub>is greater than photon energy hν. Consequently, a condition under which absorption occurs in the material is hν&gt;E<sub>G</sub>. However, even when optically transparent, the material generates absorption under a condition of nhν&gt;E<sub>G </sub>(where n=2, 3, 4, . . . ) if the intensity of laser light becomes very high. This phenomenon is known as multiphoton absorption. In the case of pulsed waves, the intensity of laser light is determined by the peak power density (W/cm<sup>2</sup>) of laser light at its converging point. The multiphoton absorption occurs under a condition where the peak power density is 1×10<sup>8 </sup>(W/cm<sup>2</sup>) or greater, for example. The peak power density is determined by (energy of laser light at the converging point per pulse)/(beam spot cross-sectional area of laser light×pulse width). In the case of continuous waves, the intensity of laser light is determined by the field intensity (W/cm<sup>2</sup>) of laser light at the converging point.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">The principle of the laser processing method in accordance with the embodiment using such multiphoton absorption will be explained with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 6</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, on a front face <b>3</b> of a planar object to be processed <b>1</b>, a line to cut <b>5</b> for cutting the object <b>1</b> exists. The line to cut <b>5</b> is a virtual line extending straight. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the laser processing method in accordance with this embodiment irradiates the object <b>1</b> with laser light L while locating a converging point P therewithin under a condition generating multiphoton absorption, so as to form a modified region <b>7</b>. The converging point P is a position at which the laser light L is converged. The line to cut <b>5</b> may be curved instead of being straight, and may be a line actually drawn on the object <b>1</b> without being restricted to the virtual line.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">Then, the laser light L is relatively moved along the line to cut <b>5</b> (i.e., in the direction of arrow A in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), so as to shift the converging point P along the line to cut <b>5</b>. Consequently, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 5</figref>, the modified region <b>7</b> is formed along the line to cut <b>5</b> within the object <b>1</b>, and becomes a starting point region for cutting <b>8</b>. The starting point region for cutting <b>8</b> refers to a region which becomes a start point for cutting (fracturing) when the object <b>1</b> is cut. The starting point region for cutting <b>8</b> may be made by forming the modified region <b>7</b> either continuously or intermittently.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">In the laser processing method in accordance with this embodiment, the modified region <b>7</b> is not formed by the heat generated from the object <b>1</b> absorbing the laser light L. The laser light L is transmitted through the object <b>1</b>, so as to generate multiphoton absorption therewithin, thereby forming the modified region <b>7</b>. Therefore, the front face <b>3</b> of the object <b>1</b> hardly absorbs the laser light L and does not melt.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">Forming the starting point region for cutting <b>8</b> within the object <b>1</b> makes it easier to generate fractures from the starting point region for cutting <b>8</b> acting as a start point, whereby the object <b>1</b> can be cut with a relatively small force as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Therefore, the object <b>1</b> can be cut with a high precision without generating unnecessary fractures on the front face <b>3</b> of the object <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">There seem to be the following two ways of cutting the object <b>1</b> from the starting point region for cutting <b>8</b> acting as a start point. One is where an artificial force is applied to the object <b>1</b> after the starting point region for cutting <b>8</b> is formed, so that the object <b>1</b> fractures from the starting point region for cutting <b>8</b> acting as a start point, whereby the object <b>1</b> is cut. This is the cutting in the case where the object <b>1</b> has a large thickness, for example. Applying an artificial force refers to exerting a bending stress or shear stress on the object <b>1</b> along the starting point region for cutting <b>8</b>, or generating a thermal stress by applying a temperature difference to the object <b>1</b>, for example. The other is where the forming of the starting point region for cutting <b>8</b> causes the object <b>1</b> to fracture naturally in its cross-sectional direction (thickness direction) from the starting point region for cutting <b>8</b> acting as a start point, thereby cutting the object <b>1</b>. This becomes possible if the starting point region for cutting <b>8</b> is formed by one row of the modified region <b>7</b> when the object <b>1</b> has a small thickness, or if the starting point region for cutting <b>8</b> is formed by a plurality of rows of the modified region <b>7</b> in the thickness direction when the object <b>1</b> has a large thickness. Even in this naturally fracturing case, fractures do not extend onto the front face <b>3</b> at a portion corresponding to an area not formed with the starting point region for cutting <b>8</b> in the part to cut, so that only the portion corresponding to the area formed with the starting point region for cutting <b>8</b> can be cleaved, whereby cleavage can be controlled well. Such a cleaving method with a favorable controllability is very effective, since the object <b>1</b> such as silicon wafer has recently been apt to decrease its thickness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">The modified region formed by multiphoton absorption in the laser processing method in accordance with this embodiment encompasses the following cases (1) to (4):</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">(1) Case where the Modified Region is a Crack Region Including One Crack or a Plurality of Cracks</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">An object to be processed (e.g., glass or a piezoelectric material made of LiTaO<sub>3</sub>) is irradiated with laser light while locating a converging point therewithin under a condition with a field intensity of at least 1×10<sup>8 </sup>(W/cm<sup>2</sup>) at the converging point and a pulse width of 1 μs or less. This magnitude of pulse width is a condition under which a crack region can be formed only within the object while generating multiphoton absorption without causing unnecessary damages on the front face of the object. This generates a phenomenon of optical damage by multiphoton absorption within the object. This optical damage induces a thermal distortion within the object, thereby forming a crack region therewithin. The upper limit of field intensity is 1×10<sup>12 </sup>(W/cm<sup>2</sup>), for example. The pulse width is preferably 1 ns to 200 ns, for example. The forming of a crack region by multiphoton absorption is disclosed, for example, in “Internal Marking of Glass Substrate with Solid-state Laser”, Proceedings of the 45th Laser Materials Processing Conference (December, 1998), pp. 23-28.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a graph showing the results of the above-mentioned experiment. The abscissa indicates the peak power density. Since the laser light is pulsed laser light, the field intensity is represented by the peak power density.

The crack spot size is the size of a part yielding the maximum length among forms of crack spots. Data represented by black circles in the graph refer to a case where the condenser lens (C) has a magnification of ×100 and a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.80. On the other hand, data represented by whitened circles in the graph refer to a case where the condenser lens (C) has a magnification of ×50 and a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.55.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">A mechanism by which the object to be processed is cut by forming a crack region will now be explained with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 11</figref>. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the object <b>1</b> is irradiated with laser light L while the converging point P is located within the object <b>1</b> under a condition where multiphoton absorption occurs, so as to form a crack region <b>9</b> therewithin along a line to cut. The crack region <b>9</b> is a region containing one crack or a plurality of cracks. Thus formed crack region <b>9</b> becomes a starting point region for cutting. A crack further grows from the crack region <b>9</b> acting as a start point (i.e., from the starting point region for cutting acting as a start point) as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, and reaches the front face <b>3</b> and rear face <b>21</b> of the object <b>1</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, whereby the object <b>1</b> fractures and is consequently cut as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The crack reaching the front face <b>3</b> and rear face <b>21</b> of the object <b>1</b> may grow naturally or as a force is applied to the object <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">(2) Case where the Modified Region is a Molten Processed Region</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">An object to be processed (e.g., semiconductor material such as silicon) is irradiated with laser light while locating a converging point within the object under a condition with a field intensity of at least 1×10<sup>8 </sup>(W/cm<sup>2</sup>) at the converging point and a pulse width of 1 μs or less. As a consequence, the inside of the object is locally heated by multiphoton absorption. This heating forms a molten processed region within the object. The molten processed region encompasses regions once molten and then re-solidified, regions just in a molten state, and regions in the process of being re-solidified from the molten state, and can also be referred to as a region whose phase has changed or a region whose crystal structure has changed. The molten processed region may also be referred to as a region in which a certain structure changes to another structure among monocrystal, amorphous, and polycrystal structures. For example, it means a region having changed from the monocrystal structure to the amorphous structure, a region having changed from the monocrystal structure to the polycrystal structure, or a region having changed from the monocrystal structure to a structure containing amorphous and polycrystal structures. When the object to be processed is of a silicon monocrystal structure, the molten processed region is an amorphous silicon structure, for example. The upper limit of field intensity is 1×10<sup>12 </sup>(W/cm<sup>2</sup>), for example. The pulse width is preferably 1 ns to 200 ns, for example.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a view showing a photograph of a cross section of a part of a silicon wafer cut by laser processing under the conditions mentioned above. A molten processed region <b>13</b> is formed within the silicon wafer <b>11</b>. The molten processed region <b>13</b> formed under the above-mentioned conditions has a size of about 100 μm in the thickness direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">The fact that the molten processed region <b>13</b> is formed by multiphoton absorption will now be explained. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a graph showing relationships between the laser light wavelength and the transmittance within the silicon substrate. Here, the respective reflected components on the front and rear face sides of the silicon substrate are eliminated, so as to show the internal transmittance alone. The respective relationships are shown in the cases where the thickness t of the silicon substrate is 50 μm, 100 μm, 200 μm, 500 μm, and 1000 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0070">For example, at the Nd:YAG laser wavelength of 1064 nm, the laser light appears to be transmitted through the silicon substrate by at least 80% when the silicon substrate has a thickness of 500 μm or less. Since the silicon wafer <b>11</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> has a thickness of 350 μm, the molten processed region <b>13</b> caused by multiphoton absorption is formed near the center of the silicon wafer <b>11</b>, i.e., at a part distanced from the front face by 175 μm. The transmittance in this case is 90% or more with reference to a silicon wafer having a thickness of 200 μm, whereby the laser light is absorbed only slightly within the silicon wafer <b>11</b> but is substantially transmitted therethrough. This means that the molten processed region <b>13</b> is formed within the silicon wafer <b>11</b> not by laser light absorption within the silicon wafer <b>11</b> (i.e., not by usual heating with the laser light) but by multiphoton absorption. The forming of a molten processed region by multiphoton absorption is disclosed, for example, in “Silicon Processing Characteristic Evaluation by Picosecond Pulse Laser”, Preprints of the National Meetings of Japan Welding Society, Vol. 66 (April, 2000), pp. 72-73.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">A fracture is generated in a silicon wafer from a starting point region for cutting formed by a molten processed region, acting as a start point, in a cross-sectional direction, and reaches the front and rear faces of the silicon wafer, whereby the silicon wafer is cut. The fracture reaching the front and rear faces of the silicon wafer may grow naturally or as a force is applied to the silicon wafer. The fracture naturally growing from the starting point region for cutting to the front and rear faces of the silicon wafer encompasses a case where the fracture grows from a state where the molten processed region forming the starting point region for cutting is molten and a case where the fracture grows when the molten processed region forming the starting point region for cutting is re-solidified from the molten state. In either case, the molten processed region is formed only within the silicon wafer, and thus is present only within the cut section after cutting as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. When a starting point region for cutting is thus formed within the object by a molten processed region, unnecessary fractures deviating from a starting point region for cutting line are harder to occur at the time of cleaving, whereby cleavage control becomes easier.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0073">An object to be processed (e.g., semiconductor material such as silicon) is irradiated with laser light while locating a converging point within the object under a condition with a field intensity of at least 1×10<sup>8 </sup>(W/cm<sup>2</sup>) at the converging point and a pulse width of 1 μs or less. This may form a molten processed region and a microcavity within the object. The upper limit of field intensity is 1×10<sup>12 </sup>(W/cm<sup>2</sup>), for example. The pulse width is preferably 1 ns to 200 ns, for example.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0074">When laser light L is incident on a silicon wafer <b>11</b> from its front face <b>3</b> side as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, a microcavity <b>14</b> is formed on the rear face <b>21</b> side of the molten processed region <b>13</b>. The molten processed region <b>13</b> and the microcavity <b>14</b> are separated from each other in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, but may be formed continuously as well. Namely, when the molten processed region <b>13</b> and the microcavity <b>14</b> are formed as a pair by multiphoton absorption, the microcavity <b>14</b> is formed on the opposite side of the molten processed region <b>13</b> from the laser light entrance surface in the silicon wafer <b>11</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0075">It is not completely clear by what principle the microcavity <b>14</b> is thus formed so as to correspond to each molten processed region <b>13</b> formed by generating multiphoton absorption within the silicon wafer <b>11</b> by transmitting the laser light L therethrough. Two hypotheses assumed by the inventors concerning the principle by which the molten processed region <b>13</b> and the microcavity <b>14</b> are formed as a pair will now be explained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0076">The first hypothesis assumed by the inventors is as follows. Namely, when the silicon wafer <b>11</b> is irradiated with the laser light L focused at a converging point P within the silicon wafer <b>11</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the molten processed region <b>13</b> is formed near the converging point P. Conventionally, light components in the center part of the laser light L emitted from a laser light source (light components corresponding to L<b>4</b> and L<b>5</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) have been used as the laser light L. This aims at using the center part of a Gaussian distribution of the laser light L.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0077">The inventors have tried to expand the laser light L in order to restrain the laser light L from affecting the front face <b>3</b> of the silicon wafer <b>11</b>. In one technique therefor, the laser light L emitted from the laser light source is expanded by a predetermined optical system, so as to widen the skirt of the Gaussian distribution, thereby relatively raising the laser intensity of light components in a peripheral part of the laser light L (those corresponding to L<b>1</b> to L<b>3</b> and L<b>6</b> to L<b>8</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>). When thus expanded laser light L is transmitted through the silicon wafer <b>11</b>, the molten processed region <b>13</b> is formed near the converging point P, and the microcavity <b>14</b> is formed at a part corresponding to the molten processed region <b>13</b> as explained above. Namely, the molten processed region <b>13</b> and the microcavity <b>14</b> are formed at respective positions on the optical axis (dash-dot line in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) of the laser light L. The position at which the microcavity <b>14</b> is formed corresponds to a part where light components in the peripheral part of the laser light L (those corresponding to L<b>1</b> to L<b>3</b> and L<b>6</b> to L<b>8</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) are theoretically converged.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0078">The spherical aberration of a lens converging the laser light L seems to cause light components in the center part of the laser light L (those corresponding to L<b>4</b> and L<b>5</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) and light components in the peripheral part of the laser light L (those corresponding to L<b>1</b> to L<b>3</b> and L<b>6</b> to L<b>8</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) to converge at respective parts different from each other in the thickness direction of the silicon wafer <b>11</b> as in the foregoing. The first hypothesis assumed by the inventors lies in that the difference in converging positions may have some effects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0079">The second hypothesis assumed by the inventors lies in that, since the part where light components in the peripheral part of the laser light L (those corresponding to L<b>1</b> to L<b>3</b> and L<b>6</b> to L<b>8</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) are converged is a theoretical laser-converging point, the light intensity is so high in this part that minute structural changes occur, thereby forming the microcavity <b>14</b> whose periphery does not substantially change its crystal structure, whereas the part formed with the molten processed region <b>13</b> is thermally affected so much that it is simply molten and re-solidified.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0080">Here, the molten processed region <b>13</b> is as stated in (2) mentioned above, whereas the microcavity <b>14</b> is one whose periphery does not substantially change its crystal structure.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0081">By an experiment, the inventors verified that the molten processed region <b>13</b> and microcavity <b>14</b> were formed within the silicon wafer <b>11</b>. The following are conditions of the experiment.</div>

As depicted, within the silicon wafer <b>11</b>, pairs of molten processed regions <b>13</b> and microcavities <b>14</b>, each pair being formed by irradiation with one pulse of laser light L, are positioned at a predetermined pitch along the cross section (i.e., along a line to cut).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0088">(4) Case where the Modified Region is a Refractive Index Changed Region</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0089">An object to be processed (e.g., glass) is irradiated with laser light while locating a converging point within the object under a condition with a field intensity of at least 1×10<sup>8 </sup>(W/cm<sup>2</sup>) at the converging point and a pulse width of 1 ns or less. When multiphoton absorption is generated within the object with a very short pulse width, the energy caused by multiphoton absorption is not converted into thermal energy, whereby an eternal structure change such as ion valence change, crystallization, or orientation polarization is induced within the object, thus forming a refractive index change region. The upper limit of field intensity is 1×10<sup>12 </sup>(W/cm<sup>2</sup>), for example. The pulse width is preferably 1 ns or less, for example, more preferably 1 ps or less. The forming of a refractive index change region by multiphoton absorption is disclosed, for example, in “Forming of Photoinduced Structure within Glass by Femtosecond Laser Irradiation”, Proceedings of the 42nd Laser Materials Processing Conference (November, 1997), pp. 105-111.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0090">The cases (1) to (4) are explained in the foregoing as a modified region formed by multiphoton absorption. A starting point region for cutting may be formed as follows while taking account of the crystal structure of a wafer-like object to be processed, its cleavage characteristic, and the like, whereby the object can be cut with a favorable precision by a smaller force from the starting point region for cutting acting as a start point.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0091">Namely, in the case of a substrate made of a monocrystal semiconductor having a diamond structure such as silicon, it will be preferred if a starting point region for cutting is formed in a direction extending along a (111) plane (first cleavage plane) or a (110) plane (second cleavage plane). In the case of a substrate made of a group III-V compound semiconductor of sphalerite structure such as GaAs, it will be preferred if a starting point region for cutting is formed in a direction extending along a (110) plane. In the case of a substrate having a crystal structure of hexagonal system such as sapphire (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), it will be preferred if a starting point region for cutting is formed in a direction extending along a (1120) plane (A plane) or a (1100) plane (M plane) while using a (0001) plane (C plane) as a principal plane.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0092">When the substrate is formed with an orientation flat in a direction to be formed with the above-mentioned starting point region for cutting (e.g., a direction extending along a (111) plane in a monocrystal silicon substrate) or a direction orthogonal to the direction to be formed therewith, the starting point region for cutting extending in the direction to be formed with the starting point region for cutting can be formed easily and accurately with reference to the orientation flat.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0096">While a number of functional devices <b>15</b> are formed like a matrix in directions parallel and perpendicular to an orientation flat <b>6</b> of the substrate <b>4</b>, the interlayer insulating films <b>17</b> <i>a</i>, <b>17</b> <i>b </i>are formed between the functional devices <b>15</b>, <b>15</b> adjacent to each other so as to cover the front face <b>3</b> of the substrate <b>4</b> as a whole.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0097">Thus configured object <b>1</b> is cut into the functional devices <b>15</b> as follows. First, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19(</figref> <i>a</i>), an expandable tape (expandable member) <b>23</b> is attached to the rear face <b>21</b> of the substrate <b>4</b>. Subsequently, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19(</figref> <i>b</i>), the object <b>1</b> is fixed onto a mount table (not depicted) of a laser processing apparatus such that the multilayer part <b>16</b> faces up.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0098">Then, lines to cut <b>5</b> are set like grids (see broken lines in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>) with respect to the object <b>1</b> so as to pass between the functional devices <b>15</b>, <b>15</b> adjacent to each other. Subsequently, while the substrate <b>4</b> is irradiated with laser light L under a condition generating multiphoton absorption with a converging point P located within the substrate <b>4</b>, the mount table is moved, so as to scan the converging point P along the lines to cut <b>5</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0099">The scanning of the converging point P along the lines to cut <b>5</b> is performed three times for each line to cut <b>5</b> with respective different distances from the front face <b>3</b> of the substrate <b>4</b> to the converging point P, so that one row of first modified region <b>71</b> shifted from the center position CL in the thickness direction of the substrate <b>4</b> to the rear face <b>21</b> side of the substrate <b>4</b> and two rows of second modified regions <b>72</b> shifted from the center position L to the front face <b>3</b> side of the substrate <b>4</b> are formed row by row along the line to cut <b>5</b> within the substrate <b>4</b> successively from the rear face <b>21</b> side of the substrate <b>4</b>. The forming of the two rows of second modified regions <b>72</b> generates fractures <b>24</b> along the line to cut <b>5</b> from the second modified regions <b>72</b> to the front face <b>3</b> of the substrate <b>4</b>. Since the substrate <b>4</b> is a semiconductor substrate made of silicon, each of the modified regions <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> is a molten processed region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0100">Since the modified regions <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> are thus formed row by row successively from the side remote from the front face <b>3</b> of the substrate <b>4</b>, none of the modified regions <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> and fractures <b>24</b> exists between the front face <b>3</b> where the laser light L is incident and the converging point P of the laser light L when forming each of the modified regions <b>71</b>, <b>72</b>, so that no laser light L is scattered, absorbed, and so forth by the already formed modified regions <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> and the like. Therefore, each of the modified regions <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> can reliably be formed along the line to cut <b>5</b> within the substrate <b>4</b>. Irradiating the substrate <b>4</b> with the laser light L from the multilayer part <b>16</b> side while locating the converging point P within the substrate <b>4</b> can reliably generate the fractures <b>24</b> from the second modified regions <b>72</b> to the front face <b>3</b> of the substrate <b>4</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0101">After forming the modified regions <b>71</b>, <b>72</b>, the expandable tape <b>23</b> is expanded as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20(</figref> <i>a</i>). In this state, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20(</figref> <i>b</i>), a knife edge (pressing member) <b>41</b> is pressed against the rear face <b>21</b> of the substrate <b>4</b> with the expandable tape <b>23</b> interposed therebetween and is moved in the direction of arrow B. This generates such a stress in the object <b>1</b> as to open the fractures <b>24</b>, so that the fractures <b>24</b> extend toward the multilayer part <b>16</b> and first modified region <b>71</b>, whereby the object <b>1</b> is cut along the line to cut <b>5</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0102">Since the expandable tape <b>23</b> attached to the rear face <b>21</b> of the substrate <b>4</b> is in an expanded state here, semiconductor chips <b>25</b> obtained by cutting will be separated from each other immediately after cutting the object <b>1</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>.</div>

In this state, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the expander member <b>44</b> rises, so that the object <b>1</b> is pushed up together with the expandable tape <b>23</b>. This places the expandable tape <b>23</b> into an expanded state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0109">Subsequently, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the knife edge <b>41</b> rises, so as to be pressed against the object <b>1</b> with the expandable tape <b>23</b> interposed therebetween. Then, the knife edge <b>41</b> moves in the y-axis direction while in a state where its width direction aligns with the x-axis direction. This generates such a stress in the object <b>1</b> as to open the fractures <b>24</b>, whereby the object <b>1</b> is cut into strips along the lines to cut <b>5</b> extending in the x-axis direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0110">Next, the knife edge <b>41</b> descends and revolves by 90° about the z axis. Thereafter, the knife edge <b>41</b> rises again, so as to be pressed against the object <b>1</b> with the expandable tape <b>23</b> interposed therebetween. Then, the knife edge <b>41</b> moves in the x-axis direction while in a state where its width direction aligns with the y-axis direction. This generates such a stress in the object <b>1</b> as to open the fractures <b>24</b>, whereby the object <b>1</b> is cut into strips along the lines to cut <b>5</b> extending in the y-axis direction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0111">In the object cutting method in accordance with this embodiment, as explained in the foregoing, the first modified region <b>71</b> shifted from the center position CL to the rear face <b>21</b> side of the substrate <b>4</b> and the second modified regions <b>72</b> shifted from the center position CL to the front face <b>3</b> side of the substrate <b>4</b> are formed within the substrate <b>4</b> along the lines to cut <b>5</b>, and the fractures <b>24</b> are generated from the second modified regions <b>72</b> to the front face <b>3</b> of the substrate <b>4</b>. Then, a stress is generated in the object <b>1</b> such as to open the fractures <b>24</b> in this state, so that the fractures <b>24</b> extend toward the multilayer part <b>16</b> and first modified region <b>71</b>, whereby the object <b>1</b> is accurately cut along the lines to cut <b>5</b>. Since the expandable tape <b>23</b> attached to the rear face <b>21</b> of the substrate <b>4</b> is expanded here, opposing cut sections <b>25</b> <i>a</i>, <b>25</b> <i>a </i>of the semiconductor chips <b>25</b>, <b>25</b> adjacent to each other will be separated from each other immediately after cutting the object <b>1</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>), whereby chipping and cracking due to the opposing cut sections <b>25</b> <i>a</i>, <b>25</b> <i>a </i>coming into contact with each other are prevented from occurring.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0112">This can shorten the processing time while keeping the cutting quality, for example, as compared with the technique cutting the object <b>1</b> along the lines to cut <b>5</b> by increasing the number of rows of modified regions <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> along the lines to cut <b>5</b> when the substrate <b>4</b> is thick. Therefore, the object cutting method in accordance with this embodiment makes it possible to accurately cut the object <b>1</b> comprising the substrate <b>4</b> and the multilayer part <b>16</b> formed on the front face <b>3</b> of the substrate <b>4</b> while having a plurality of functional devices <b>15</b> into the functional devices <b>15</b> along the lines to cut <b>5</b> in a short time even when the substrate <b>4</b> is thick.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0113">As an example, a case of cutting an object to be processed <b>1</b> equipped with a substrate <b>4</b> made of silicon having a thickness of 300 μm and an outer diameter of 8 inches into chips each having a size of 5 mm×5 mm will be explained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0114">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, a first modified region <b>71</b> having a width of about 45 μm in the thickness direction of the substrate <b>4</b> was formed at a position where the distance between the front face <b>3</b> of the substrate <b>4</b> and the front-side end part <b>71</b> <i>a </i>of the first modified region <b>71</b> was about 245 μm. Further, a second modified region <b>72</b> having a width of about 27 μm in the thickness direction of the substrate <b>4</b> was formed at a position where the distance between the front face <b>3</b> of the substrate <b>4</b> and the front-side end part <b>72</b> <i>a </i>of the second modified region <b>72</b> was about 82 μm, a second modified region <b>72</b> having a width of about 24 μm in the thickness direction of the substrate <b>4</b> was formed at a position where the distance between the front face <b>3</b> of the substrate <b>4</b> and the front-side end part <b>72</b> <i>a </i>of the second modified region <b>72</b> was about 39 μm, and fractures <b>24</b> were generated from the second modified regions <b>72</b> to the front face <b>3</b> of the substrate <b>4</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0115">In this state, a stress was generated in the object <b>1</b> such as to open the fractures <b>24</b>, whereby the object <b>1</b> was completely cut along lines to cut <b>5</b> which were set like grids. The meanderings along the lines to cut <b>5</b> were suppressed to 4 μm or less, and the irregularities of the cut sections <b>25</b> <i>a </i>were kept to 5 μm or less. The time required for forming the first and second modified regions <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> was suppressed to 4 minutes or less (whereas it takes 6 minutes or more to form 5 rows of modified regions with respect to 1 line to cut, for example).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0116">As in the foregoing example, it will be preferred in the part extending along the lines to cut <b>5</b> in the substrate <b>4</b> if the density of forming the second modified regions <b>72</b> in a portion <b>4</b> <i>a </i>of the substrate <b>4</b> on the front face <b>3</b> side with respect to the center position CL is made higher than the forming density of the first modified region <b>71</b> in a portion <b>4</b> <i>b </i>of the substrate <b>4</b> on the rear face <b>21</b> side with respect to the center position CL or the number of rows of second modified regions <b>72</b> is made greater than the number of rows of first modified region <b>71</b>. These make it possible to more accurately cut the object <b>1</b> along the lines to cut <b>5</b> even when the substrate <b>4</b> is thick, e.g., 300 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0117">The present invention is not limited to the above-mentioned embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0118">For example, though the first and second modified regions <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> are formed within the substrate <b>4</b> after attaching the expandable tape <b>23</b> to the rear face <b>21</b> of the substrate <b>4</b> in the above-mentioned embodiment, the expandable tape <b>23</b> may be attached to the rear face <b>21</b> of the substrate <b>4</b> after forming the first and second modified regions <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> within the substrate <b>4</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0119">A roller may be used as a pressing member for generating such a stress in the object <b>1</b> as to open the fractures <b>24</b>. As with the knife edge <b>41</b>, the roller can easily and reliably generate such a stress in the object <b>1</b> as to open the fractures <b>24</b>. When used as the pressing member, the knife edge <b>41</b> may repeatedly be pushed up with respect to the object <b>1</b> along the lines to cut <b>5</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0120">The number of rows of first modified region <b>71</b> is not limited to <b>1</b> as long as they are shifted from the center position CL in the thickness direction of the substrate <b>4</b> to the rear face <b>21</b> side of the substrate <b>4</b>. Similarly, the number of rows of second modified regions <b>72</b> is not limited to 2 as long as they are shifted from the center position CL in the thickness direction of the substrate <b>4</b> to the front face <b>3</b> side of the substrate <b>4</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0121">Though the laser light L is converged through the insulating films (interlayer insulating films <b>17</b> <i>a</i>, <b>17</b> <i>b</i>) on the lines to cut <b>5</b> in the above-mentioned embodiment, the laser light L can be converged into the substrate <b>4</b> without attenuating the laser light intensity if the insulating films on the laser light incident surface of the substrate <b>4</b> are eliminated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0010">Industrial Applicability</div>
