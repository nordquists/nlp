<heading>TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">The present invention relates to a plasma cleaning method for cleaning the interior of a process container of a plasma CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) apparatus that is used for depositing a silicon nitride film on the surface of a target substrate, and also relates to a plasma CVD method.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">Silicon nitride films are used as insulating films, protection films, and so forth in various semiconductor device. It is known that a silicon nitride film of this kind can be formed by plasma CVD or the like using a silicon-containing compound gas, such as silane (SiH<sub>4</sub>), as a source gas and a nitrogen-containing compound gas, such as nitrogen or ammonia.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">In a plasma CVD apparatus for performing plasma CVD as described above, as the film formation is repeated on target substrates, silicon nitride is deposited on portions inside the chamber other than the target substrates. If extraneous deposits thus formed on portions inside the chamber exceed a certain film thickness, the film formation performed in the plasma CVD apparatus is adversely affected. For example, the extraneous deposits formed on portions inside the chamber affect gas flows and/or thermal distribution inside the chamber, and may deteriorate the film formation rate and/or film formation uniformity. Further, particles may be generated from the extraneous deposits and deposited on the target substrate. In light of the problems described above, it is necessary to periodically perform cleaning inside the chamber to remove the extraneous deposits formed on portions inside the chamber. For this purpose, there has been proposed a plasma cleaning method for etching the interior of the chamber by use of plasma of a reactive gas containing a fluorine compound, such as NF<sub>3</sub>, (for example, Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 7-201738).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">As disclosed in Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 7-201738, plasma cleaning is typically arranged to use a cleaning gas (such as NF<sub>3</sub>) of the type having an etching effect relative to extraneous deposits on portions inside the chamber and to dry-etch the extraneous deposits by plasma of the cleaning gas. However, where a fluorine-containing gas, such as NF<sub>3 </sub>gas, is used for cleaning, it is necessary to remove residual fluorine inside the chamber because the residual fluorine adversely affects a film formation process subsequently performed. Accordingly, this patent document 1 describes such that a process using a gas containing NF<sub>3 </sub>is followed by a stage of removing fluorine inside the chamber by use of plasma of a reducing gas containing NH<sub>3</sub>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">The technique disclosed in Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 7-201738 described above is arranged to use a stage of removing residual fluorine inside the chamber after NF<sub>3 </sub>cleaning, but cannot be said to involve sufficient studies concerning conditions for performing the cleaning process at high throughput to swiftly remove residual fluorine while attaining a cleaning effect practically sufficient.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Further, where a cleaning process includes a plurality of stages, as in the technique described above, it is difficult to find the endpoints of the respective stages. If the cleaning is excessively performed due to erroneous determination of the endpoints, plasma of a cleaning gas etches members inside the chamber, such as a worktable (susceptor) for placing a target substrate thereon and a cover ring for guiding the target substrate, and causes plasma damage thereon, which shortens the service life of the members. Particularly, if the cleaning is performed for a longer time to enhance the cleaning effect, the plasma damage becomes larger and thereby deteriorates the throughput. In reverse, if conditions are set to suppress the plasma damage and thereby increase the throughput, cleaning becomes insufficient, thereby generates particles, and adversely affects the film formation.</div>

<heading>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">An embodiment of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a sectional view schematically showing an example of a plasma processing apparatus suitable for performing a plasma cleaning method and a plasma CVD method according to the present invention. This plasma processing apparatus <b>100</b> is arranged as a processing apparatus of the RLSA (Radial Line Slot Antenna) microwave plasma type, in which microwaves are supplied from a planar antenna having a plurality of slots into a process chamber to generate plasma. In this case, microwave excitation plasma is generated with a high density and a low electron temperature, such as a plasma density of 1×10<sup>10 </sup>to 5×10<sup>12</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>and a low electron temperature of 0.7 to 2 eV, and so a process can be performed with very little damage to the film. Accordingly, apparatuses of this type are preferably utilized for processes, such as formation of a silicon nitride film by plasma CVD, in manufacturing various semiconductor devices.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">This plasma processing apparatus <b>100</b> includes an essentially cylindrical chamber <b>1</b>, which is airtight and grounded. The chamber <b>1</b> may have a rectangular shape. The bottom wall <b>1</b> <i>a </i>of the chamber <b>1</b> has a circular opening <b>10</b> formed essentially at the center, and is provided with an exhaust chamber <b>11</b> communicating with the opening <b>10</b> and extending downward. The exhaust chamber <b>11</b> is connected to an exhaust unit <b>24</b> through an exhaust line <b>23</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">The chamber <b>1</b> is provided with a worktable <b>2</b> disposed therein and made of a ceramic with a high thermal conductivity, such as AlN, for supporting a target substrate, such as a silicon wafer (which will be simply referred to as “wafer”, hereinafter) W, in a horizontal state. The worktable <b>2</b> is supported by a cylindrical support member <b>3</b> made of a ceramic, such as AlN, and extending upward from the center of the bottom of the exhaust chamber <b>11</b>. The worktable <b>2</b> is provided with a cover ring <b>4</b> covering the outer edge of the worktable <b>2</b> and configured to guide the wafer W. The cover ring <b>4</b> is made of a dielectric material, such as quartz, AlN, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, or SiN.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">The worktable <b>2</b> is provided with a heater <b>5</b> of the resistance heating type embedded therein. The heater <b>5</b> is supplied with a power from a heater power supply <b>5</b> <i>a </i>to heat the worktable <b>2</b>, thereby uniformly heating the target substrate or wafer W. Further, a thermocouple <b>6</b> is connected to the worktable <b>2</b>, so that heating temperature for the wafer W can be controlled within a range of, e.g., from room temperature to 900° C. The worktable <b>2</b> is provided with wafer support pins (not shown) that can project and retreat relative to the surface of the worktable <b>2</b> to support the wafer W and move it up and down.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">The inner wall of the chamber <b>1</b> is covered with a cylindrical quartz liner <b>7</b> to prevent metal contamination due to the construction material of the chamber. An annular baffle plate <b>8</b> having a number of holes <b>8</b> <i>a </i>is disposed around the worktable <b>2</b> to uniformly exhaust gas from inside the chamber <b>1</b>. The baffle plate <b>8</b> is supported by a plurality of support rods <b>9</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">Gas feed parts <b>15</b> <i>a </i>and <b>15</b> <i>b</i>, each of which has an annular structure, are attached to an upper plate <b>27</b> described later and the sidewall of the chamber <b>1</b> on upper and lower sides, respectively. The gas feed parts <b>15</b> <i>a </i>and <b>15</b> <i>b </i>are connected to a gas supply system <b>16</b> for supplying a film formation source gas, a plasma excitation gas, and a cleaning gas. Each of the gas feed parts <b>15</b> <i>a </i>and <b>15</b> <i>b </i>may have a nozzle or shower structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">For example, the gas supply system <b>16</b> includes a nitrogen-containing gas supply source <b>17</b> <i>a</i>, an inactive gas supply source <b>17</b> <i>b</i>, an Si-containing gas supply source <b>17</b> <i>c</i>, an inactive gas supply source <b>17</b> <i>d</i>, an NF<sub>3 </sub>gas supply source <b>17</b> <i>e</i>, and hydrogen gas supply source <b>17</b> <i>f</i>. The nitrogen-containing gas supply source <b>17</b> <i>a </i>and inactive gas supply source <b>17</b> <i>b </i>are connected to the upper gas feed part <b>15</b> <i>a</i>. The Si-containing gas supply source <b>17</b> <i>c</i>, inactive gas supply source <b>17</b> <i>d</i>, NF<sub>3 </sub>gas supply source <b>17</b> <i>e</i>, and hydrogen gas supply source <b>17</b> <i>f </i>are connected to the lower gas feed part <b>15</b> <i>b</i>. The NF<sub>3 </sub>gas may be connected and supplied to the upper gas feed part <b>15</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">The Si-containing gas used as a film formation source gas is silane (SiH<sub>4</sub>), disilane (Si<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>), or TSA (trisilylamine), for example, and particularly preferably disilane (Si<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>). The nitrogen-containing gas used as another film formation source gas is N<sub>2</sub>, ammonia, or a hydrazine derivative, such as MMH (monomethylhydrazine), for example. The inactive gas is N<sub>2 </sub>gas or rare gas, for example. The rare gas used as a plasma excitation gas is Ar gas, Kr gas, Xe gas, or He gas, for example, and particularly preferably Ar gas in light of economical efficiency and plasma stability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">The NF<sub>3 </sub>gas and hydrogen gas are used along with the rare gas to serve as a cleaning gas for cleaning the interior of the chamber <b>1</b> of the plasma processing apparatus <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">The nitrogen-containing gas and inactive gas are supplied from the nitrogen-containing gas supply source <b>17</b> <i>a </i>and inactive gas supply source <b>17</b> <i>b </i>through respective gas lines <b>20</b> to the gas feed part <b>15</b> <i>a</i>, and are delivered from the gas feed part <b>15</b> <i>a </i>into the chamber <b>1</b>. On the other hand, the Si-containing gas, inactive gas, NF<sub>3 </sub>gas, and hydrogen gas are supplied through respective gas lines <b>20</b> to the gas feed part <b>15</b> <i>b</i>, and are delivered from the gas feed part <b>15</b> <i>b </i>into the chamber <b>1</b>. Each of the gas lines <b>20</b> <i>a </i>and <b>20</b> <i>b </i>connected to the respective gas supply sources is provided with a mass-flow controller <b>21</b> and two switching valves <b>22</b> one on either side of the controller <b>21</b> to switch gases to be supplied and to control the flow rate of each gas.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">The sidewall of the exhaust chamber <b>11</b> is connected to the exhaust unit <b>24</b> including a high speed vacuum pump through an exhaust line <b>23</b>. The exhaust unit <b>24</b> can be operated to uniformly exhaust gas from inside the chamber <b>1</b> through the baffle plate <b>8</b> into the space <b>11</b> <i>a </i>of the exhaust chamber <b>11</b>, and then out of the exhaust chamber <b>11</b> through the exhaust line <b>23</b>. Consequently, the inner pressure of the chamber <b>1</b> can be decreased at a high speed to a predetermined vacuum level, such as 0.133 Pa.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">The chamber <b>1</b> has a transfer port <b>25</b> formed in the sidewall and provided with a gate valve <b>26</b> for opening/closing the transfer port <b>25</b>. The wafer W is transferred between the plasma processing apparatus <b>100</b> and an adjacent transfer chamber (not shown) through the transfer port <b>25</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">The top of the chamber <b>1</b> is opened and connected to the annular upper plate <b>27</b> formed along the opening. The lower side of the inner periphery of the upper plate <b>27</b> projects inward into the space inside the chamber and forms an annular support portion <b>27</b> <i>a</i>. A microwave transmission plate <b>28</b> is airtightly mounted on the support portion <b>27</b> <i>a </i>through a seal member <b>29</b>. The microwave transmission plate <b>28</b> is made of a dielectric material, such as quartz or a ceramic, e.g., Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>or AlN, to transmit microwaves. The interior of the chamber <b>1</b> is thus held airtight.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">A circular planar antenna plate <b>31</b> is disposed above the microwave transmission plate <b>28</b> to face the worktable <b>2</b>. The planar antenna plate <b>31</b> may be formed of a rectangular plate in place of the circular plate. The planar antenna plate <b>31</b> is fixed to the top of the sidewall of the chamber <b>1</b>. The planar antenna plate <b>31</b> is formed of, e.g., a copper plate or aluminum plate with the surface plated with gold or silver. The planar antenna plate <b>31</b> has a number of slot-like microwave radiation holes <b>32</b> for radiating microwaves, formed therethrough and arrayed in a predetermined pattern.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">For example, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the microwave radiation holes <b>32</b> have a long narrow shape and are arranged to form a number of pairs of holes <b>32</b>, wherein the microwave radiation holes <b>32</b> are typically arranged such that the pairs of holes <b>32</b> form T-shapes and are arrayed on a plurality of concentric circles. The length and array intervals of the microwave radiation holes <b>32</b> are determined in accordance with the wavelength (λg) of microwaves. For example, the intervals of the microwave radiation holes <b>32</b> are set to be λg/4, λg/2, or λg. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the interval between adjacent microwave radiation holes <b>32</b> respectively on two concentric circles is expressed with Δr. The microwave radiation holes <b>32</b> may have another shape, such as a circular shape or arc shape. The array pattern of the microwave radiation holes <b>32</b> is not limited to a specific one, and, for example, it may be spiral or radial other than concentric.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">A wave-retardation body <b>33</b> having a dielectric constant larger than that of vacuum is disposed on the top of the planar antenna plate <b>31</b>. The wave-retardation body <b>33</b> shortens the wavelength of microwaves to adjust plasma, because the wavelength of microwaves becomes longer in a vacuum condition. The planar antenna plate <b>31</b> may be set in contact with or separated from the microwave transmission plate <b>28</b>. Similarly, the wave-retardation body <b>33</b> may be set in contact with or separated from the planar antenna plate <b>31</b>. However, these members are preferably set in contact with the adjacent one.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">The planar antenna plate <b>31</b> and wave-retardation body <b>33</b> are covered with a shield cover <b>34</b> located at the top of the chamber <b>1</b> and made of a metal material, such as aluminum or stainless steel, and serving as a waveguide tube. A seal member <b>35</b> is interposed between the top of the chamber <b>1</b> and the shield cover <b>34</b> to seal this portion. The shield cover <b>34</b> is provided with a plurality of cooling water passages <b>34</b> <i>a </i>formed therein. Cooling water is supplied to flow through the cooling water passages and thereby cool the shield cover <b>34</b>, wave-retardation body <b>33</b>, planar antenna plate <b>31</b>, and transmission plate <b>28</b>. The shield cover <b>34</b> is grounded.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">The shield cover <b>34</b> has an opening <b>36</b> formed at the center of the upper wall and connected to a waveguide tube <b>37</b>. The waveguide tube <b>37</b> is connected to a microwave generation unit <b>39</b> for generating microwaves at one end through a matching circuit <b>38</b>. The microwave generation unit <b>39</b> generates microwaves with a frequency of, e.g., 2.45 GHz, which are transmitted through the waveguide tube <b>37</b> to the planar antenna plate <b>31</b>. The microwaves may have a frequency of 8.35 GHz or 1.98 GHz.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">The waveguide tube <b>37</b> includes a coaxial waveguide tube <b>37</b> <i>a </i>having a circular cross-section and extending upward from the opening <b>36</b> of the shield cover <b>34</b>, and a rectangular waveguide tube <b>37</b> <i>b </i>connected to the upper end of the coaxial waveguide tube <b>37</b> <i>a </i>through a mode transducer <b>40</b> and extending in a horizontal direction. Microwaves are propagated in a TE mode through the rectangular waveguide tube <b>37</b> <i>b</i>, and are then turned into a TEM mode by the mode transducer <b>40</b> interposed between the rectangular waveguide tube <b>37</b> <i>b </i>and coaxial waveguide tube <b>37</b> <i>a</i>. The coaxial waveguide tube <b>37</b> <i>a </i>includes an inner conductive body <b>41</b> extending at the center, which is connected and fixed to the center of the planar antenna plate <b>31</b> at the lower end. Consequently, microwaves are efficiently and uniformly propagated from the inner conductive body <b>41</b> of the coaxial waveguide tube <b>37</b> <i>a </i>in the radial direction to the planar antenna plate <b>31</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">Further, the plasma processing apparatus <b>100</b> is provided with a detecting unit <b>60</b> on the sidewall of the chamber <b>1</b> to detect light emission of plasma inside the chamber <b>1</b>. The detecting unit <b>60</b> includes a light-receiving portion and a spectroscopic measuring portion, such as a monochromator, (they are not shown), so that the light emission of a predetermined wavelength from plasma generated inside the chamber <b>1</b> can be monitored through a window <b>61</b> formed in the sidewall of the chamber <b>1</b>. Although the cylindrical quartz liner <b>7</b> is disposed inside the chamber <b>1</b>, the light emission intensity of radicals in the plasma can be measured through the window <b>61</b> and liner <b>7</b>. The location of the detecting unit <b>60</b> is not limited to a specific one, but can be set anywhere as long as the measurement can be stably performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">The respective components of the plasma processing apparatus <b>100</b> are connected to and controlled by a process controller <b>50</b> comprising a microprocessor (computer). The process controller <b>50</b> is connected to a user interface <b>51</b> including, e.g. a keyboard and a display, wherein the keyboard is used for an operator to input commands for operating the plasma processing apparatus <b>100</b>, and the display is used for showing visualized images of the operational status of the plasma processing apparatus <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">Further, the process controller <b>50</b> is connected to a storage section <b>52</b> that stores recipes containing control programs (software), process condition data, and so forth recorded therein, for the process controller <b>50</b> to control the plasma processing apparatus <b>100</b> so as to perform various processes.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0096">After the cleaning for the first time is finished, for example, the plasma CVD process is performed again on the second wafer W, and then the cleaning process is performed again. In this way, the plasma CVD process and in-situ cleaning process are alternately performed, so that extraneous deposits on portions inside the chamber <b>1</b> can be reliably removed before they peel off and generate particles. Consequently, film formation process can be stably continued while particle generation is suppressed to the minimum.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0127">As shown in the timing chart of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the extraneous deposit removing stage using NF<sub>3 </sub>plasma was formed of steps B to E, the fluorine removing stage using H<sub>2 </sub>plasma was formed of steps G to K, and the hydrogen removing stage using Ar plasma was formed of steps M to Q. Before and after the respective stages, vacuum-exhaust was performed (step A, step F, step L, and step R). Further, in each of the stages, the step B, step H, or step N of plasma ignition (tuned on the microwave power) was arranged to set the pressure inside the chamber at 126.6 Pa higher than the pressure used in the cleaning conditions, so that plasma was easily generated. Then, in the step C, step I, or step O, the process pressure was lowered to the pressure used in the cleaning conditions, so that the gas flow rates were stabilized. Then, in the subsequent step D, step J, or step P, plasma was turned on to perform plasma cleaning.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0128">In the extraneous deposit removing stage, the light emission intensity of SiN in plasma at a wavelength of 440.7 nm was monitored by the detecting unit <b>60</b> to perform endpoint detection. In the fluorine removing stage, the light emission intensity of hydrogen in plasma at a wavelength of 656.3 nm was monitored by the detecting unit <b>60</b> to perform endpoint detection. In the hydrogen removing stage, the light emission intensity of hydrogen in plasma at a wavelength of 656.3 nm was monitored by the detecting unit <b>60</b> to perform endpoint detection. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A to 8C</figref> show emission spectrums obtained in the respective stages (the vertical axis denotes the normalized light emission intensity).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0129">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, with the elapse of the time of the process using Ar/NF<sub>3 </sub>gas plasma, the light emission intensity of SiN in plasma was decreased and then stabilized. Accordingly, the extraneous deposit removing stage was judged as arriving at the endpoint when the light emission intensity of SiN in plasma became less than or equal to a preset reference value. According to visual observation, almost all extraneous deposits (SiN) on portions inside the chamber <b>1</b> were removed when the light emission intensity becomes, e.g., less than or equal to 1,000. The extraneous deposit removing stage may be judged as arriving at the endpoint when the light emission intensity of SiN in plasma is stabilized at a value less than or equal to the reference value (for example, the inclination of the tangent line relative to the emission spectrum becomes less than or equal to a predetermined value). Further, the extraneous deposit removing stage may be judged as arriving at the endpoint by visual observation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0130">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, with the elapse of the time of the process using Ar/H<sub>2 </sub>gas plasma, the light emission intensity of atomic hydrogen in plasma was increased. This represents that hydrogen was increased in reverse proportion to a decrease in fluorine inside the chamber <b>1</b> because hydrogen was consumed by a reaction with fluorine (HF generation). Accordingly, the fluorine removing stage was judged as arriving at the endpoint when the light emission intensity of atomic hydrogen in plasma became more than or equal to a preset reference value (for example, more than or equal to 6,000). The fluorine removing stage may be judged as arriving at the endpoint when the light emission intensity of atomic hydrogen in plasma is stabilized at a value more than or equal to the reference value (for example, the inclination of the tangent line relative to the emission spectrum becomes less than or equal to a predetermined value).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0131">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, with the elapse of the time of the process using Ar gas plasma, the light emission intensity of atomic hydrogen in plasma was decreased and then stabilized at an almost constant level after repetitions of the cycle. This represents that hydrogen was decreased inside the chamber <b>1</b> because hydrogen inside the chamber was dissociated by sputtering of Ar gas plasma and exhausted out of the chamber <b>1</b>. Accordingly, the hydrogen removing stage was judged as arriving at the endpoint when the light emission intensity of atomic hydrogen in plasma became less than or equal to a preset reference value (for example, less than or equal to 250). The hydrogen removing stage may be judged as arriving at the endpoint when the light emission intensity of atomic hydrogen in plasma is stabilized at a value less than or equal to the reference value (for example, the inclination of the tangent line relative to the emission spectrum becomes less than or equal to a predetermined value). This hydrogen removing stage is preferably repeated at least twice.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0132">As shown in the results described above, it has been found that, where the interior of the chamber <b>1</b> of the plasma processing apparatus <b>100</b> is first processed by use of Ar/NF<sub>3 </sub>gas plasma, the extraneous deposits are efficiency removed. Further, it has been found that, where the interior of the chamber <b>1</b>, from which the extraneous deposits have been removed, is processed by use of Ar/H<sub>2 </sub>gas plasma, the residual fluorine is efficiency removed. Further, it has been found that, where the interior of the chamber <b>1</b> is thereafter processed by Ar gas plasma, the residual hydrogen is effectively removed. Consequently, the plasma cleaning process according to this embodiment makes it possible to efficiently clean the interior of the chamber <b>1</b> of the plasma processing apparatus <b>100</b> used for plasma CVD.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0133">The present invention is not limited to the embodiment described above, and it may be modified in various manners.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0134">For example, the plasma processing apparatus <b>100</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is used such that a plasma CVD process is performed inside chamber <b>1</b> and then plasma of a cleaning gas is excited in situ. Alternatively, for example, a cleaning process may be performed by use of a remote plasma system such that plasma of a cleaning gas is excited outside the chamber <b>1</b> of the plasma processing apparatus <b>100</b> and is supplied into the chamber <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0135">Further, in the embodiment described above, the plasma processing apparatus <b>100</b> is exemplified by the RLSA type, but a cleaning method according to the present invention may be applied to a plasma processing apparatus of another type, such as the remote plasma type, ICP plasma type, ECR plasma type, surface reflection wave plasma type, and magnetron plasma type.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0136">Further, the cleaning is applied to a case where a film formation process of a silicon nitride film (SiN film) is performed in the plasma processing apparatus <b>100</b>. Alternatively, the cleaning may be applied to a case where another film is formed, such as silicon oxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) film, poly-silicon film, tungsten (W) film, tungsten silicide (WSi) film, titanium (Ti) film, titanium nitride (TiN) film, tantalum (Ta) film, or tantalum nitride (TaN) film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0137">In the plasma cleaning method according to the embodiment described above, the extraneous deposit removing stage is arranged to use NF<sub>3 </sub>gas. Alternatively, plasma cleaning may be performed such that extraneous deposits on portions inside the chamber are removed by use of another halogen-containing gas, such as Cl<sub>2</sub>, HCl, or ClF<sub>3</sub>. Also in this case, a halogen removing stage using H<sub>2 </sub>is performed thereafter and is followed by a hydrogen removing stage using a rare gas, such as Ar, as need.</div>
