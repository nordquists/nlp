<heading>DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">However, when hydrogen or water, which forms an electron donor, is included into the oxide semiconductor in a process for manufacturing a device, the electrical conductivity of an oxide semiconductor may change. Such a phenomenon causes variation in the electrical characteristics of a transistor using the oxide semiconductor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">In view of such a problem, an object of an embodiment of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor device including an oxide semiconductor, which has stable electrical characteristics and high reliability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">In a process for manufacturing a transistor including an oxide semiconductor film, dehydration or dehydrogenation treatment is performed by heat treatment and oxygen doping treatment is performed. In the process for manufacturing a transistor including an oxide semiconductor film, at least oxygen doping treatment is performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">An embodiment of the disclosed invention is a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device, which includes the steps of forming a first insulating film; forming a source electrode, a drain electrode, and an oxide semiconductor film electrically connected to the source electrode and the drain electrode, over the first insulating film; performing heat treatment on the oxide semiconductor film to remove a hydrogen atom in the oxide semiconductor film; forming a second insulating film over the oxide semiconductor film; performing oxygen doping treatment on the second insulating film to supply an oxygen atom to the second insulating film; and forming a gate electrode in a region overlapping with the oxide semiconductor film, over the second insulating film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">An embodiment of the disclosed invention is a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device, which includes the steps of: forming a first insulating film containing an oxygen atom as its component; forming a source electrode, a drain electrode, and an oxide semiconductor film electrically connected to the source electrode and the drain electrode, over the first insulating film; performing heat treatment on the oxide semiconductor film to remove a hydrogen atom in the oxide semiconductor film; performing oxygen doping treatment on the oxide semiconductor film to supply an oxygen atom in the oxide semiconductor film; forming a second insulating film containing an oxygen atom as its component over the oxide semiconductor film; performing oxygen doping treatment on the second insulating film to supply an oxygen atom to the second insulating film; and forming a gate electrode in a region overlapping with the oxide semiconductor film, over the second insulating film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">In the above method, the oxygen doping treatments may also be performed on the oxide semiconductor film and the second insulating film so that the oxide semiconductor film contains an oxygen atom at a proportion greater than a stoichimetric proportion of the oxide semiconductor film and less than double of the stoichimetric proportion. The oxygen doping treatment may be performed on the second insulating film so that the second insulating film contains an oxygen atom at a proportion greater than a stoichimetric proportion of the second insulating film and less than double of the stoichimetric proportion. An insulating film containing a constituent element of the oxide semiconductor film may be formed as the first insulating film or the second insulating film. As the first insulating film or the second insulating film, a stacked film of a third insulating film containing a constituent element of an oxide semiconductor film and being in contact with the oxide semiconductor film, and a fourth insulating film containing a different element from the constituent element of the third insulating film may be formed. At this time, the third insulating film is formed so as to be sandwiched between the oxide semiconductor film and the fourth insulating film. As the first insulating film or the second insulating film, an insulating film containing gallium oxide may be formed. As the first insulating film or the second insulating film, a stacked film of a third insulating film containing gallium oxide and being in contact with the oxide semiconductor film, and a fourth insulating film containing a different material from gallium oxide may be formed. At this time, the third insulating film is formed so as to be sandwiched between the oxide semiconductor film and the fourth insulating film. An insulating film containing nitrogen may be formed to cover the gate electrode. Note that in this specification, the term “gallium oxide” means that oxygen and gallium are included as components and is not limited to a state as gallium oxide unless otherwise specified. For example, “an insulating film containing gallium oxide” can be regarded as “an insulating film containing oxygen and gallium.”</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">Further, in the above structure, an insulating film containing nitrogen may be formed to cover the gate electrode. In the case where an insulating film includes silicon nitride or the like which does not contain hydrogen or contains an extremely small amount of hydrogen is used, oxygen which is added can be prevented from being released to the outside, and further, hydrogen or water from the outside can be prevented from being mixed. For this reason, the insulating film is important.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">Note that the above-described “oxygen doping” means that oxygen (which includes at least one of an oxygen radical, an oxygen atom, and an oxygen ion) is added to a bulk. Note that the term “bulk” is used in order to clarify that oxygen is added not only to a surface of a thin film but also to the inside of the thin film In addition, “oxygen doping” includes “oxygen plasma doping” in which oxygen which is made to be plasma is added to a bulk.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">By the oxygen doping treatment, oxygen exists in at least one of the oxide semiconductor film (a bulk thereof), the insulating film (a bulk thereof), and an interface between the oxide semiconductor film and the insulating film at an amount which is greater than a stoichiometric proportion. The amount of oxygen is preferably greater than the stoichiometric proportion and less than four times of the stoichiometric proportion, more preferably greater than the stoichiometric proportion and less than double of the stoichiometric proportion. Here, an oxide including excessive oxygen whose amount is greater than the stoichiometric proportion refers to, for example, an oxide which satisfies 2g&gt;3a+3b+2c+4d+3e+2f, where the oxide is represented as In<sub>a</sub>Ga<sub>b</sub>Zn<sub>c</sub>Si<sub>d</sub>Al<sub>e</sub>Mg<sub>f</sub>O<sub>g </sub>(a, b, c, d, e, f, g≧0). Note that oxygen which is added by the oxygen doping treatment may exist between lattices of the oxide semiconductor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">In addition, oxygen is added so that the amount of the added oxygen is larger than at least the amount of hydrogen in the dehydrated or dehydrogenated oxide semiconductor. When the amount of the added oxygen is larger than that of hydrogen, the oxygen is diffused and reacts with hydrogen which causes instability, so that hydrogen can be fixed (made to be an immovable ion). In other words, reduction in reliability can be prevented. In addition, with excessive oxygen, variation in a threshold voltage Vth caused by oxygen deficiency can be reduced and the amount of shift ΔVth of the threshold voltage can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">Note that oxygen whose amount is equal to the above-described amount preferably exists in two or more of the oxide semiconductor film (the bulk), the insulating film (the bulk), and the interface between the oxide semiconductor film and the insulating film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">Note that in the case where an oxide semiconductor has no oxygen defect (oxygen deficiency), the amount of oxygen included in the oxide semiconductor may be equal to the stoichiometric proportion. However, in order to secure reliability, for example, to suppress variation in the threshold voltage of a transistor, an oxide semiconductor preferably includes oxygen whose amount is greater than the stoichiometric proportion. Similarly, in the case where an oxide semiconductor has no defect (oxygen deficiency), the base film is not necessarily an insulating film containing excessive oxygen. However, in order to secure reliability, for example, to suppress variation in the threshold voltage of a transistor, the base film is preferably the insulating film containing excessive oxygen, considering that oxygen deficiency may occur in the oxide semiconductor film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">Here, a state in which oxygen is added to the bulk by the above-described “oxygen plasma doping” treatment is described. Note that when oxygen doping treatment is performed on an oxide semiconductor film containing oxygen as one component, it is generally difficult to check an increase or a decrease of the oxygen concentration. Therefore, here, an effect of oxygen doping treatment was confirmed with the use of a silicon wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">Oxygen doping treatment was performed with the use of an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) method. Conditions thereof are as follows: the ICP power was 800 W; the RF bias power was 300 W or 0 W; the pressure was 1.5 Pa; the gas flow rate of oxygen gas was 75 sccm; and the substrate temperature was 70° C. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows an oxygen concentration profile in the depth direction of the silicon wafer measured by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the vertical axis represents an oxygen concentration; the horizontal axis represents a depth from a surface of the silicon wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">It can be confirmed from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> that oxygen is added in either of cases where the RF bias power is 0 W or the RF bias power is 300 W. In addition, in the case where the RF bias power is 300 W, oxygen is added more deeply as compared to the case of the RF bias power of 0 W.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">Next, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref> show results of observation of a cross section of the silicon wafer before and after the oxygen doping treatment by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref> is a STEM image of the silicon wafer which was not subjected to the oxygen doping treatment. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref> is a STEM image of the silicon wafer which was subjected to the oxygen doping treatment at the RF bias voltage of 300 W. As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref>, it can be found that an oxygen-highly-doped region is formed in the silicon wafer by the oxygen doping.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">As described above, it is shown that oxygen is added to the silicon wafer by performing oxygen doping on the silicon wafer. From this result, it is natural that oxygen can be added to an oxide semiconductor film by performing oxygen doping on the oxide semiconductor film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">The effect of the above structure which is an embodiment of the disclosed invention can be easily understood as follows. Note that the below description is just one consideration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">When a positive voltage is applied to the gate electrode, an electric field is generated from a gate electrode side of the oxide semiconductor film to a back channel side (the opposite side to the gate insulating film). Therefore, hydrogen ions having positive charge which exist in the oxide semiconductor film are transported to the back channel side, and accumulated in a region close to an interface with the insulating film. The positive charge is transported from the accumulated hydrogen ion to a charge trapping center (such as a hydrogen atom, water, or contamination) in the insulating film, whereby negative charge is accumulated in the back channel side of the oxide semiconductor film. In other words, a parasitic channel is generated in the back channel side of the transistor, and the threshold voltage is shifted to the negative side, so that the transistor tends to be normally-on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">In this manner, the charge trapping center such as hydrogen or water in the insulating film traps the positive charge and the positive charge is transported into the insulating film, whereby electrical characteristics of the transistor vary. Accordingly, in order to suppress variation of the electrical characteristics of the transistor, it is important that there is no charge trapping center or the number of the charge trapping centers is small in the insulating film Therefore, when an insulating film is deposited, a sputtering method which causes less hydrogen contained in the deposited insulating film is preferably used. In an insulating film deposited by a sputtering method, there is no charge trapping center or a small number of charge trapping centers, and the transport of positive charge does not easily occur as compared to that in the case of using a CVD method or the like. Therefore, the shift of the threshold voltage of the transistor can be suppressed, and the transistor can be normally off.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">Note that in a top-gate transistor, when an oxide semiconductor film is formed over an insulating film serving as a base film and then heat treatment is performed thereon, not only water or hydrogen contained in the oxide semiconductor film but also water or hydrogen contained in the insulating film can be removed. Accordingly, in the insulating film, there is a small number of charge trapping centers for trapping positive charge transported through the oxide semiconductor film. In this manner, the heat treatment for dehydration or dehydrogenation is also performed on the insulating film located below the oxide semiconductor film, in addition to the oxide semiconductor film. Therefore, in the top-gate transistor, the insulating film serving as a base film may be deposited by a CVD method such as a plasma CVD method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">In addition, when a negative voltage is applied to the gate electrode, an electric field is generated from the back channel side to the gate electrode side. Thus, hydrogen ions which exist in the oxide semiconductor film are transported to the gate insulating film side and accumulated in a region close to the interface with the gate insulating film. As a result, the threshold voltage of the transistor is shifted to the negative side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">Note that when a voltage is kept at 0 V, the positive charge is released from the charge trapping center, so that the threshold voltage of the transistor is shifted to the positive side, thereby returning to the initial state, or the threshold voltage is shifted to the positive side beyond the initial state in some cases. These phenomena indicate the existence of easy-to-transport ions in the oxide semiconductor film. It can be considered that an ion which is transported most easily is a hydrogen ion which is obtained by ionization of hydrogen that is the smallest atom.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">In addition, when the oxide semiconductor film absorbs light, a bond (also referred to as an M-H bond) of a metal element (M) and a hydrogen atom (H) in the oxide semiconductor film is broken by photoenergy. Note that the photoenergy having a wavelength of approximately 400 nm equals or substantially equals to the bond energy of a metal element and a hydrogen atom. When a negative gate bias is applied to a transistor in which a bond of a metal element and a hydrogen atom in the oxide semiconductor film is broken, a hydrogen ion eliminated from a metal element is attracted to a gate electrode side, so that distribution of charge is changed, the threshold voltage of the transistor is shifted to the negative side, and the transistor tends to be normally on.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">Note that the hydrogen ions which are transported to the interface with the gate insulating film by light irradiation and application of a negative gate bias to the transistor are returned to the initial state by stopping application of voltage. This can be regarded as a typical example of the ion transport in the oxide semiconductor film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">In order to prevent such a change of the electrical characteristics by voltage application (BT degradation) or a change of the electrical characteristics by light irradiation (light degradation), it is most important to remove a hydrogen atom or an impurity containing a hydrogen atom such as water thoroughly from the oxide semiconductor film to highly purify the oxide semiconductor film. The charge density as small as 10<sup>15 </sup>cm<sup>−3</sup>, or the charge per unit area which is as small as 10<sup>10 </sup>cm<sup>−2 </sup>does not affect the transistor characteristics or very slightly affects them. Therefore, it is preferable that the charge density be less than or equal to 10<sup>15 </sup>cm<sup>−3</sup>. Assuming that 10% of hydrogen contained in the oxide semiconductor film is transported within the oxide semiconductor film, it is preferable that the hydrogen concentration in the oxide semiconductor film is less than or equal to 10<sup>16 </sup>cm<sup>−3</sup>. Further, in order to prevent entrance of hydrogen from the outside after a device is completed, it is preferable that a silicon nitride film formed by a sputtering method be used as a passivation film to cover the transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">Hydrogen or water can also be removed from the oxide semiconductor film when an excessive amount of oxygen is added as compared to hydrogen to the oxide semiconductor film (such that (the number of hydrogen atoms)&lt;&lt;(the number of oxygen radicals) or (the number of oxygen ions)). Specifically, oxygen is made to be plasma by a radio-frequency wave (RF), the bias of the substrate is increased, and an oxygen radical and/or an oxygen ion are/is doped or added into the oxide semiconductor film over the substrate such that the amount of oxygen is greater than that of hydrogen in the oxide semiconductor film The electronegativity of oxygen is 3.0 which is larger than about 2.0, the electronegativity of a metal (Zn, Ga, In) in the oxide semiconductor film, and thus, excessive oxygen contained as compared to hydrogen abstracts hydrogen from the M-H group so that an OH group is formed. This OH group may form an M-O—H group with a bond to M.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">It is preferable that the amount of oxygen contained in the oxide semiconductor film be greater than the stoichiometric proportion. For example, in the case where an In—Ga—Zn—O-based oxide semiconductor film is used as the oxide semiconductor film, it is far preferable that the proportion of oxygen be made to greater than the stoichiometric proportion and less than double of the stoichiometric proportion by oxygen doping or the like. For example, when the stoichiometric proportion of a single crystal of an In—Ga—Zn—O-based oxide semiconductor is such that In:Ga:Zn:O=1:1:1:4, in an oxide semiconductor thin film whose composition is represented by InGaZnO<sub>x</sub>, x is preferably greater than 4 and less than 8. Accordingly, the amount of oxygen is greater than that of hydrogen in the oxide semiconductor film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">Photoenergy or BT stress abstracts hydrogen from the M-H group, which causes degradation; however, in the case where an excessive amount of oxygen is contained as compared to the hydrogen contained in the oxide semiconductor film, the oxygen in the oxide semiconductor film is bonded with a hydrogen ion, so that an OH group is formed. The OH group does not discharge a hydrogen ion even by light irradiation or application of BT stress on the transistor because of its high bond energy, and is not easily transported in the oxide semiconductor film because of its greater mass than the mass of a hydrogen ion. Accordingly, an OH group formed does not cause degradation of the transistor or can suppress the degradation.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">In addition, it has been confirmed that as the thickness of the oxide semiconductor film is increased, the variation in the threshold voltage of a transistor tends to increase. It is considered that an oxygen defect in the oxide semiconductor film is one cause of the change of the threshold voltage and increases as the thickness of the oxide semiconductor film is increased. It is effective not only for removal of hydrogen or water from the oxide semiconductor film but also for compensation of an oxygen defect in the film to add an excessive amount of oxygen as compared to the hydrogen contained in an oxide semiconductor film in a transistor according to one embodiment of the present invention. Accordingly, the variation in the threshold voltage can also be suppressed in the transistor according to one embodiment of the present invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">Metal oxide films each containing a component which is the same as a component of the oxide semiconductor film may be provided with the oxide semiconductor film provided therebetween, which is also effective for prevention of change of the electrical characteristics. As the metal oxide film containing a component which is the same as a component of the oxide semiconductor film, specifically, a film containing at least one selected from the constituent elements of the oxide semiconductor film is preferably used. Such a material is suitable for the oxide semiconductor film, and therefore, provision of the metal oxide films with the oxide semiconductor film provided therebetween enables an interface between the metal oxide film and the oxide semiconductor film to be kept in an appropriate state. That is, by providing the metal oxide film using the above-described material as an insulating film which is in contact with the oxide semiconductor film, accumulation of hydrogen ions in the interface of the between the metal oxide film and the oxide semiconductor film and in the vicinity thereof can be suppressed or prevented. Accordingly, as compared to the case where insulating films each containing a different component from that of the oxide semiconductor film, such as silicon oxide films, are provided with the oxide semiconductor film provided therebetween, the hydrogen concentration in the interface with the oxide semiconductor film, which affects the threshold voltage of the transistor, can be sufficiently decreased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">A gallium oxide film is preferably used as the metal oxide film. Since gallium oxide has a wide bandgap (Eg), by providing gallium oxide films with the oxide semiconductor film provided therebetween, an energy barrier is formed in the interface between the oxide semiconductor film and the metal oxide film to prevent carrier transport in the interface. Consequently, carriers are not transported from the oxide semiconductor to the metal oxide, but are transported within the oxide semiconductor film. On the other hand, a hydrogen ion passes through the interface between the oxide semiconductor and the metal oxide and is accumulated in the vicinity of an interface between the metal oxide and the insulating film. Even when the hydrogen ion is accumulated in the vicinity of the interface with the insulating film, a parasitic channel through which carriers can flow is not formed in the metal oxide film such as a gallium oxide film, which results in no affect or a very slight affect on the threshold voltage of the transistor. The energy barrier in the case where gallium oxide is in contact with a In—Ga—Zn—O-based material is about 0.8 eV on the conduction band side and is about 0.9 eV on the valence band side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">As described above, one technological idea of a transistor according to an embodiment of the present invention is to increase the amount of oxygen contained in at least one of an insulating film in contact with an oxide semiconductor film, the oxide semiconductor film, and the vicinity of an interface between them by oxygen doping treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">In the case where an oxide semiconductor material which contains indium whose bonding strength with oxygen is relatively weak is used for the oxide semiconductor film, when the insulating film in contact with the oxide semiconductor film contains a material which has a stronger bonding strength with oxygen, such as silicon, oxygen in the oxide semiconductor film may be abstracted by heat treatment, which may cause formation of oxygen deficiency in the vicinity of the interface of the oxide semiconductor film. However, in a transistor according to an embodiment of the disclosed invention, the formation of oxygen deficiency in the vicinity of the interface of the oxide semiconductor film can be suppressed by supplying excessive oxygen to the insulating film in contact with the oxide semiconductor film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">Here, after the oxygen doping treatment is performed in the manufacturing process of a transistor, the amount of oxygen which is greater than the stoichimetric proportion and is contained in the oxide semiconductor film or the insulating film in contact with the oxide semiconductor film may be different between layers. It can be considered that chemical potential of oxygen is different between the layers where the amount of excessive oxygen is different between them, and the difference in the chemical potential comes to an equilibrium or a substantial equilibrium by heat treatment or the like in the manufacturing process of the transistor. Therefore, after the oxygen doping treatment on the insulating film, heat treatment is preferably performed. By the heat treatment after the oxygen doping treatment, oxygen which is excessively supplied to the insulating film can be diffused and a sufficient amount of oxygen can be supplied to the oxide semiconductor film Distribution of oxygen in the equilibrium state is discussed below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">The equilibrium state at a temperature T at a pressure P refers to the state in which a Gibbs free energy of the whole of the systems, G is the minimum, which is represented by the following formula (1).</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">The differential of the number of particles of the Gibbs free energy corresponds to the chemical potential, and thus the chemical potentials of particles are uniform in the layers in the equilibrium state.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">In other words, when the amount of oxygen contained in the insulating film in contact with the oxide semiconductor film is excessive as compared to the oxide semiconductor film, the chemical potential of oxygen is relatively small in the oxide semiconductor film and is relatively large in the insulating film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">When the temperature of the whole of the systems (e.g., the oxide semiconductor film and the insulating film in contact with the oxide semiconductor film, here) becomes high enough to cause atom diffusion in the layer and between the layers by heat treatment in the manufacturing process of the transistor, oxygen is transported so as to make the chemical potentials uniform. That is, oxygen in the insulating film is transported to the oxide semiconductor film, whereby the chemical potential of the insulating film is decreased and the chemical potential of the oxide semiconductor film is increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">In this manner, oxygen supplied excessively to the insulating film by the oxygen doping treatment is diffused to be supplied to the oxide semiconductor film by the following heat treatment to make the chemical potential of the systems to be in the equilibrium state. As described above, the oxygen supplied to the oxide semiconductor film is bonded with a hydrogen ion to be an OH group, which does not cause degradation of the transistor or can suppress the degradation. In addition, supply of oxygen to the oxide semiconductor film is effective at repairing an oxygen defect in the film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">In a transistor including a gate insulating film which is subjected to dehydration or dehydrogenation treatment by heat treatment and oxygen doping treatment, the amount of change in the threshold voltage of the transistor from before to after a bias-temperature (BT) test is small, so that the highly-reliable transistor having stable electrical characteristics can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">According to an embodiment of the disclosed invention, a variety of semiconductor devices including highly-reliable transistors having stable electrical characteristic can be manufactured.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0010">&lt;Structural Example of Semiconductor Device&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0074"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref> illustrate a structural example of a transistor <b>120</b>. Here, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a plan view, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a cross-sectional view along A-B of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, and <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> is a cross-sectional view along C-D of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. Note that some of components of the transistor <b>120</b> (e.g., a gate insulating film <b>110</b>) are omitted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> for brevity.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0075">The transistor <b>120</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref> includes, over a substrate <b>100</b>, an insulating film <b>102</b>, a source electrode <b>104</b> <i>a</i>, a drain electrode <b>104</b> <i>b</i>, an oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b>, the gate insulating film <b>110</b>, and a gate electrode <b>112</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0076">In the transistor <b>120</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref>, the gate insulating film <b>110</b> has been subjected to oxygen doping treatment and includes an oxygen excessive region. When the gate insulating film <b>110</b> includes the oxygen excessive region, oxygen can be prevented from being transferred from the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> to the gate insulating film <b>110</b>. In addition, oxygen can be supplied from the gate insulating film <b>110</b> to the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b>. Accordingly, by performing oxygen doping treatment on the gate insulating film <b>110</b>, an excessive amount of oxygen can be contained in the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> as compared to hydrogen, so that the transistor <b>120</b> with improved reliability can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0011">&lt;Example of Manufacturing Process of Semiconductor Device&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0077">An example of a manufacturing process of the semiconductor device in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref> will be described below with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2G</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0078">First, the insulating film <b>102</b> is formed over the substrate <b>100</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0079">There is no particular limitation on a material of the substrate <b>100</b> as long as the material has at least heat resistance high enough to withstand heat treatment performed later. For example, a glass substrate, a ceramic substrate, a quartz substrate, or a sapphire substrate can be used as the substrate <b>100</b>. Alternatively, a single crystal semiconductor substrate or a polycrystalline semiconductor substrate made of silicon, silicon carbide, or the like, a compound semiconductor substrate made of silicon germanium or the like, an SOI substrate, or the like may be used as the substrate <b>100</b>. Still alternatively, any of these substrates further provided with a semiconductor element may be used as the substrate <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0080">A flexible substrate may alternatively be used as the substrate <b>100</b>. When a transistor is provided over the flexible substrate, the transistor may be directly formed over the flexible substrate, or the transistor may be formed over a different substrate and then separated to be transferred to the flexible substrate. In order to separate the transistor and transfer it to the flexible substrate, a separation layer is preferably formed between the different substrate and the transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0081">The insulating film <b>102</b> serves as a base. Specifically, the insulating film <b>102</b> may be formed using silicon oxide, silicon nitride, aluminum oxide, aluminum nitride, gallium oxide, a mixed material thereof, or the like. The insulating film <b>102</b> may be formed with a single-layer structure or a layered structure using an insulating film including any of the above materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0082">There is no particular limitation on the method for forming the insulating film <b>102</b>. For example, the insulating film <b>102</b> can be formed by a deposition method such as a plasma CVD method or a sputtering method. A sputtering method is preferable in terms of low possibility of entry of hydrogen, water, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0083">Note that it is particularly preferable to form the insulating film <b>102</b> with the use of an insulating material containing a component which is the same as a component of an oxide semiconductor film formed later. Such a material is suitable for an oxide semiconductor film; thus, when it is used for the insulating film <b>102</b>, the state of the interface with the oxide semiconductor film can be kept favorably. Here, containing “a component which is the same as a component of an oxide semiconductor film” means containing one or more of elements selected from constituent elements of the oxide semiconductor film. For example, in the case where the oxide semiconductor film is formed using an In—Ga—Zn—O-based oxide semiconductor material, a gallium oxide or the like is given as such an insulating material containing a component which is the same as a component of the oxide semiconductor film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0084">In the case where the insulating film <b>102</b> has a layered structure, it is further preferable to employ a layered structure of a film formed using an insulating material containing a component which is the same as a component of the oxide semiconductor film (hereinafter referred to as a film a) and a film containing a material different from a constituent material of the film a (hereinafter referred to as a film b). The reason is as follows. When the insulating film <b>102</b> has such a structure in which the film a and the film b are sequentially stacked from the oxide semiconductor film side, charge is trapped preferentially in a charge trapping center at the interface between the film a and the film b (compared with the interface between the oxide semiconductor film and the film a) Thus, trapping of charge at the interface of the oxide semiconductor film can be sufficiently suppressed, resulting in higher reliability of the semiconductor device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0085">Note that as such a layered structure, a layered structure of a gallium oxide film and a silicon oxide film, a layered structure of a gallium oxide film and a silicon nitride film, or the like can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0086">Next, a conductive film for forming the source electrode and the drain electrode (including a wiring formed in the same layer as the source electrode and the drain electrode) is formed over the insulating film <b>102</b> and processed to form the source electrode <b>104</b> <i>a </i>and the drain electrode <b>104</b> <i>b </i>(see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>). Note that the channel length L of the transistor is determined by the distance between the edges of the source electrode <b>104</b> <i>a </i>and the drain electrode <b>104</b> <i>b </i>which are formed here.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0087">As the conductive film used for the source electrode <b>104</b> <i>a </i>and the drain electrode <b>104</b> <i>b</i>, a metal film containing an element selected from Al, Cr, Cu, Ta, Ti, Mo, and W, a metal nitride film containing any of the above elements as its component (e.g., a titanium nitride film, a molybdenum nitride film, or a tungsten nitride film), or the like may be used. Alternatively, a conductive film may be used in which a high-melting-point metal film of Ti, Mo, W, or the like or a metal nitride film of any of these elements (a titanium nitride film, a molybdenum nitride film, or a tungsten nitride film) may be stacked on one of or both a bottom side and a top side of a metal film of Al, Cu, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0088">Alternatively, the conductive film used for the source electrode <b>104</b> <i>a </i>and the drain electrode <b>104</b> <i>b </i>may be formed using a conductive metal oxide. As the conductive metal oxide, indium oxide, tin oxide, zinc oxide, an indium oxide-tin oxide mixed oxide (abbreviated to ITO), an indium oxide-zinc oxide mixed oxide, or any of these metal oxide materials containing silicon oxide may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0089">The conductive film may be processed by etching with the use of a resist mask. Ultraviolet, a KrF laser light, an ArF laser light, or the like is preferably used for light exposure for forming a resist mask for the etching.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0090">In the case where the channel length L is less than 25 nm, the light exposure at the time of forming the resist mask is preferably performed using, for example, extreme ultraviolet having an extremely short wavelength of several nanometers to several tens of nanometers. In the light exposure using extreme ultraviolet, the resolution is high and the focus depth is large. Thus, the channel length L of the transistor formed later can be reduced, whereby the operation speed of a circuit can be increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0091">An etching step may be performed with the use of a resist mask formed using a so-called multi-tone mask. A resist mask formed using a multi-tone mask has a plurality of thicknesses and can be further changed in shape by ashing; thus, such a resist mask can be used in a plurality of etching steps for different patterns. Therefore, a resist mask for at least two kinds of patterns can be formed using a multi-tone mask, resulting in simplification of the process</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0092">Next, an oxide semiconductor film in contact with the source electrode <b>104</b> <i>a </i>and the drain electrode <b>104</b> <i>b </i>is formed over the insulating film <b>102</b> and then the oxide semiconductor film is processed to form an island-shaped oxide semiconductor film <b>106</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0093">The oxide semiconductor film is preferably formed by a method by which hydrogen, water, and the like do not easily enter the film, such as a sputtering method. The thickness of the oxide semiconductor film is preferably greater than or equal to 3 nm and less than or equal to 30 nm. This is because the transistor might possibly be normally on when the oxide semiconductor film is too thick (e.g., the thickness is 50 nm or more).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0094">As a material of the oxide semiconductor film, for example, an oxide semiconductor material containing indium or an oxide semiconductor material containing indium and gallium may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0095">As a material of the oxide semiconductor film, any of the following materials can be used: a four-component metal oxide such as an In—Sn—Ga—Zn—O-based material; three-component metal oxides such as an In—Ga—Zn—O-based material, an In—Sn—Zn—O-based material, an In—Al—Zn—O-based material, a Sn—Ga—Zn—O-based material, an Al—Ga—Zn—O-based material, and a Sn—Al—Zn—O-based material; two-component metal oxides such as an In—Zn—O-based material, a Sn—Zn—O-based material, an Al—Zn—O-based material, a Zn—Mg—O-based material, a Sn—Mg—O-based material, an In—Mg—O-based material, and an In—Ga—O-based material; and single-component metal oxides such as an In—O-based material, a Sn—O-based material, and a Zn—O-based material. In addition, the above materials may contain silicon oxide. Here, for example, an In—Ga—Zn—O-based material means an oxide film containing indium (In), gallium (Ga), and zinc (Zn), and there is no particular limitation on the composition ratio thereof Further, the In—Ga—Zn—O-based material may contain another element in addition to In, Ga, and Zn.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0096">The oxide semiconductor film may be a thin film formed using a material represented by the chemical formula, InMO<sub>3</sub>(ZnO)<sub>m </sub>(m&gt;0). Here, M represents one or more metal elements selected from Ga, Al, Mn, and Co. For example, M may be Ga, Ga and Al, Ga and Mn, Ga and Co, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0097">In this embodiment, the oxide semiconductor film is formed by a sputtering method using an In—Ga—Zn—O-based oxide semiconductor deposition target.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0098">As the In—Ga—Zn—O-based oxide semiconductor deposition target, for example, an oxide semiconductor deposition target with a composition ratio of In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:ZnO=1:1:1 [molar ratio] may be used. Note that it is not necessary to limit the material and the composition ratio of the target to the above. For example, an oxide semiconductor deposition target with a composition ratio of In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:ZnO=1:1:2 [molar ratio] may alternatively be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0099">In the case where an In—Zn—O-based material is used for the oxide semiconductor, a target with the following composition ratio is used: the composition ratio of In:Zn is 50:1 to 1:2 in an atomic ratio (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:ZnO=25:1 to 1:4 in a molar ratio), preferably 20:1 to 1:1 in an atomic ratio (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:ZnO=10:1 to 1:2 in a molar ratio), further preferably 15:1 to 1.5:1 in an atomic ratio (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:ZnO=15:2 to 3:4 in a molar ratio). For example, a target used for the formation of an In—Zn—O-based oxide semiconductor has the following atomic ratio: In:Zn:O is X:Y:Z, where Z&gt;1.5X+Y.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0100">The fill rate of the oxide semiconductor deposition target is higher than or equal to 90% and lower than or equal to 100%, preferably, higher than or equal to 95% and lower than or equal to 99.9%. With the use of the oxide semiconductor deposition target with high fill rate, a dense oxide semiconductor film can be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0101">The deposition atmosphere may be a rare gas (typically argon) atmosphere, an oxygen atmosphere, or a mixed atmosphere containing a rare gas and oxygen. Moreover, it is preferable that an atmosphere using a high-purity gas in which impurities containing hydrogen atoms, such as hydrogen, water, a compound having a hydroxyl group, and a hydride, are removed be used because entry of hydrogen, water, a compound having a hydroxyl group, and a hydride into the oxide semiconductor film can be prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0102">More specifically, for example, the oxide semiconductor film can be formed as follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0103">First, the substrate <b>100</b> is placed in a deposition chamber kept under reduced pressure, and the substrate temperature is set to a temperature higher than or equal to 100° C. and lower than or equal to 600° C., preferably higher than or equal to 200° C. and lower than or equal to 400° C. This is because the concentration of an impurity contained in the oxide semiconductor film can be reduced when deposition is performed while the substrate <b>100</b> is heated. This is also because damage due to sputtering can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0104">Then, a high-purity gas in which impurities containing hydrogen atoms, such as hydrogen and moisture, are sufficiently removed is introduced into the deposition chamber from which remaining moisture is being removed, and the oxide semiconductor film is formed over the substrate <b>100</b> with the use of the target. To remove moisture remaining in the deposition chamber, an entrapment vacuum pump such as a cryopump, an ion pump, or a titanium sublimation pump is preferably used as an evacuation unit. Further, an evacuation means may be a turbo molecular pump provided with a cold trap. In the deposition chamber which is evacuated with the cryopump, a hydrogen molecule, a compound containing a hydrogen atom, such as water (H<sub>2</sub>O), (further preferably, also a compound, containing a carbon atom), and the like are removed, whereby the concentration of an impurity in the oxide semiconductor film formed in the deposition chamber can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0105">An example of the deposition conditions is as follows: the distance between the substrate and the target is 100 mm, the pressure is 0.6 Pa, the direct-current (DC) power is 0.5 kW, and the deposition atmosphere is an oxygen atmosphere (the flow rate of the oxygen is 100%). Note that a pulse direct current power source is preferable because generation of powdery substances (also referred to as particles or dust) in deposition can be suppressed and thickness distribution can be uniform.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0106">The oxide semiconductor film can be processed in such a manner that a mask having a desired shape is formed over the oxide semiconductor film and then the oxide semiconductor film is etched. The mask may be formed by a method such as photolithography or an ink-jet method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0107">For the etching of the oxide semiconductor film, either wet etching or dry etching may be employed. Needless to say, both of them may be employed in combination.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0108">After that, heat treatment is performed on the oxide semiconductor film <b>106</b>, so that the highly-purified oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> is formed (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>). Hydrogen (including water and a hydroxyl group) in the oxide semiconductor film <b>106</b> is removed through the heat treatment and the structure of the oxide semiconductor film is rearranged, so that defect levels in an energy gap can be reduced. The heat treatment is performed at a temperature higher than or equal to 250° C. and lower than or equal to 650° C., preferably higher than or equal to 450° C. and lower than or equal to 600° C., or lower than the strain point of the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0109">The heat treatment may be performed, for example, in such a manner that an object to be processed is introduced into an electric furnace in which a resistance heating element or the like is used and heated in a nitrogen atmosphere at 450° C. for an hour. During the heat treatment, the oxide semiconductor film <b>106</b> is not exposed to the air to prevent the entry of water and hydrogen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0110">A heat treatment apparatus is not limited to an electric furnace and may be an apparatus for heating an object by thermal radiation or thermal conduction from a medium such as a heated gas. For example, an RTA (rapid thermal anneal) apparatus such as a GRTA (gas rapid thermal anneal) apparatus or an LRTA (lamp rapid thermal anneal) apparatus can be used. A GRTA apparatus is an apparatus for performing heat treatment using a high-temperature gas. As the gas, an inert gas which does not react with an object to be processed by heat treatment, such as nitrogen or a rare gas such as argon is used. An LRTA apparatus is an apparatus for heating an object to be processed by radiation of light (an electromagnetic wave) emitted from a lamp such as a halogen lamp, a metal halide lamp, a xenon arc lamp, a carbon arc lamp, a high pressure sodium lamp, or a high pressure mercury lamp.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0111">For example, as the heat treatment, GRTA treatment may be performed as follows. The object is put in an inert gas atmosphere that has been heated, heated for several minutes, and then taken out of the inert gas atmosphere. GRTA treatment enables high-temperature heat treatment in a short time. Moreover, GRTA treatment can be employed even when the temperature exceeds the upper temperature limit of the object. Note that the inert gas may be switched to a gas containing oxygen during the treatment. This is because the number of defect levels in an energy gap due to oxygen deficiency can be reduced by performing the heat treatment in an atmosphere containing oxygen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0112">Note that as the inert gas atmosphere, an atmosphere that contains nitrogen or a rare gas (e.g., helium, neon, or argon) as its main component and does not contain water, hydrogen, or the like is preferably used. For example, the purity of nitrogen or a rare gas such as helium, neon, or argon introduced into a heat treatment apparatus is greater than or equal to 6N (99.9999%), preferably greater than or equal to 7N (99.99999%) (that is, the concentration of the impurities is less than or equal to 1 ppm, preferably less than or equal to 0.1 ppm).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0113">In any case, the i-type (intrinsic) or substantially i-type oxide semiconductor film in which impurities are reduced by the heat treatment is formed, whereby a transistor having extremely excellent characteristics can be realized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0114">The above heat treatment can be referred to as dehydration treatment, dehydrogenation treatment, or the like because of its advantageous effect of removing hydrogen, water, and the like. The dehydration treatment or dehydrogenation treatment may be performed at the timing, for example, before the oxide semiconductor film is processed to have an island shape. Such dehydration treatment or dehydrogenation treatment may be conducted once or plural times.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0115">Then, the gate insulating film <b>110</b> is formed in contact with the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> so as to cover the source electrode <b>104</b> <i>a </i>and the drain electrode <b>104</b> <i>b </i>(see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0116">The gate insulating film <b>110</b> can be faulted in a manner similar to that of the insulating film <b>102</b>. That is, the gate insulating film <b>110</b> may be formed using silicon oxide, silicon nitride, aluminum oxide, aluminum nitride, gallium oxide, a mixed material thereof, or the like. Note that a material having a high dielectric constant, such as hafnium oxide, tantalum oxide, yttrium oxide, hafnium silicate (HfSi<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y </sub>(x&gt;0, y&gt;0), hafnium silicate (HfSi<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y </sub>(x&gt;0, y&gt;0) to which nitrogen is added, or hafnium aluminate (HfAl<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y </sub>(x&gt;0, y&gt;0) to which nitrogen is added may be used for the gate insulating film <b>110</b> considering the function of the gate insulating film of the transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0117">Note that in a similar manner to the insulating film <b>102</b>, it is preferable that an insulating material containing a component similar to a component of the oxide semiconductor film formed later be used in the gate insulating film <b>110</b>. Such a material is suitable for the oxide semiconductor film; thus, when it is used as the gate insulating film <b>110</b>, the state of the interface with the oxide semiconductor film can be kept favorably. Here, the “component which is the same as a component of the oxide semiconductor film” means containing one or more of elements selected from constituent elements of the oxide semiconductor film. For example, in the case where the oxide semiconductor film is formed using an In—Ga—Zn—O-based oxide semiconductor material, gallium oxide or the like is given as the insulating material containing a component which is the same as a component of the oxide semiconductor film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0118">As in the case of the insulating film <b>102</b>, a layered structure may be employed. In that case, it is preferable to employ a layered structure of a film formed using an insulating material containing a component which is the same as a component of the oxide semiconductor film (hereinafter referred to as a film a) and a film containing a material different from that of a constituent material of the film a (hereinafter referred to as a film b). The reason is as follows. When the gate insulating film <b>110</b> has such a structure in which the film a and the film b are sequentially stacked from the oxide semiconductor film side, charge is trapped preferentially in a charge trapping center at the interface between the film a and the film b (compared with the interface between the oxide semiconductor film and the film a). Thus, trapping of charge at the interface of the oxide semiconductor film can be sufficiently suppressed, resulting in higher reliability of the semiconductor device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0119">Note that as such a layered structure, a layered structure of a gallium oxide film and a silicon oxide film, a layered structure of a gallium oxide film and a silicon nitride film, or the like may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0120">Heat treatment is preferably performed after formation of the gate insulating film <b>110</b>. The heat treatment is performed at a temperature of higher than or equal to 250° C. and lower than or equal to 700° C., preferably higher than or equal to 450° C. and lower than or equal to 600° C. or lower than the strain point of the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0121">The heat treatment may be performed in an atmosphere of nitrogen, oxygen, ultra-dry air (air in which a water content is 20 ppm or less, preferably 1 ppm or less, further preferably 10 ppb or less), or a rare gas (argon, helium, or the like). Note that it is preferable that water, hydrogen, and the like be not contained in the atmosphere of nitrogen, oxygen, ultra-dry air, or a rare gas. Further, the purity of nitrogen, oxygen, or a rare gas introduced into a heat treatment apparatus is preferably 6N (99.9999%) or higher (that is, the impurity concentration is 1 ppm or lower), further preferably 7N (99.99999%) or higher (that is, the impurity concentration is 0.1 ppm or lower).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0122">The heat treatment in this embodiment is performed while the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> and the gate insulating film <b>110</b> are in contact with each other. Thus, oxygen, which may be reduced due to the dehydration (or dehydrogenation) treatment, can be supplied to the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b>. In this sense, the heat treatment can also be referred to as supply of oxygen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0123">Note that there is no particular limitation on the timing of the heat treatment for supply of oxygen as long as it is after formation of the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b>. For example, the heat treatment for supply of oxygen may be performed after performing oxygen doping treatment on the gate insulating film <b>110</b> or after forming the gate electrode. The heat treatment for supply of oxygen may be performed following to heat treatment for dehydration or the like; heat treatment for dehydration or the like may also serve as the heat treatment for supplying oxygen; the heat treatment for supply of oxygen may also serve as heat treatment for dehydration or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0124">As described above, the heat treatment for dehydration or the like and oxygen doping treatment or the heat treatment for supply of oxygen are applied, whereby the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> can be highly purified so as to contain impurities as little as possible. The highly-purified oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> contains extremely few (close to zero) carriers derived from a donor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0125">Next, the gate insulating film <b>110</b> is subjected to treatment using oxygen <b>180</b> (also referred to as oxygen doping treatment or oxygen plasma doping treatment) (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>). Here, the oxygen <b>180</b> contains at least any of an oxygen radical, an oxygen atom, and an oxygen ion. By performing oxygen doping treatment on the gate insulating film <b>110</b>, oxygen can be contained in the gate insulating film <b>110</b> or in the vicinity of the interface between the gate insulating film <b>110</b> and the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b>. In that case, the amount of oxygen contained in the gate insulating film <b>110</b> is greater than the stoichiometric proportion of the gate insulating film <b>110</b>, or is preferably greater than the stoichiometric proportion and less than four times of the stoichiometric proportion, more preferably greater than the stoichiometric proportion and less than double of the stoichiometric proportion. Alternatively, the amount of oxygen in the gate insulating film <b>110</b> can be greater than Y, or can be preferably greater than Y and less than 4Y, where the amount of oxygen in the case where the material of the gate insulating film <b>110</b> is a single crystal is Y. Still alternatively, the amount of oxygen contained in the gate insulating film <b>110</b> can be greater than Z, and can be preferably greater than Z or less than 4Z based on the amount of oxygen Z in the insulating film in the case where oxygen doping treatment is not performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0126">For example, in the case where gallium oxide whose composition is represented by GaO<sub>x</sub>(x&gt;0) is used, since a single crystal of gallium oxide is Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, x can be greater than 1.5 and less than 6 (i.e., the amount of O is greater than 1.5 times of that of Ga and less than 6 times of that of Ga). Alternatively, for example, in the case where silicon oxide whose composition is represented by SiO<sub>x </sub>(x&gt;0) is used, when SiO<sub>2 </sub>(i.e., the amount of O is double of that of Si) is employed, x is greater than 2 and less than 8 (i.e., the amount of O is greater than double of that of Si and less than 8 times of that of Si). Note that such an oxygen excessive region may exist in part of the insulating film (including its interface).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0127">As described above, when the oxygen excessive region is formed in the gate insulating film <b>110</b> or the vicinity of the interface between the gate insulating film <b>110</b> and the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b>, oxygen can be prevented from being transferred from the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> to the gate insulating film <b>110</b>. Accordingly, when oxygen doping treatment is performed on the gate insulating film <b>110</b>, an excessive amount of oxygen can be contained in the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> as compared to hydrogen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0128">Further, in the oxygen doping treatment, oxygen can be supplied into the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b>, the vicinity of the interface between the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> and the insulating film <b>102</b>, or the insulating film <b>102</b>. In particular, oxygen is easily supplied into the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b>, the vicinity of the interface between the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> and the insulating film <b>102</b>, or the insulating film <b>102</b> in the case where the thickness of the gate insulating film <b>110</b> or the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> is sufficiently small, in the case where an electrical bias applied to the substrate is sufficiently large, or in the case where heat treatment is performed after oxygen doping treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0129">In that case, the amount of oxygen contained in the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> is greater than the stoichiometric proportion of the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b>, preferably greater than the stoichiometric proportion and less than double of the stoichiometric proportion. Alternatively, the amount of oxygen may be greater than Y, preferably greater than Y and less than 2Y, where the amount of oxygen in the case where the material of the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> is a single crystal is Y. Still alternatively, the amount of oxygen may be greater than Z, preferably greater than Z and less than 2Z based on the amount of oxygen Z in the insulating film in the case where oxygen doping is not performed. The reason of the presence of the upper limit in the above preferable range is that the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> might take hydrogen like a hydrogen storing alloy (hydrogen storage alloy) when the amount of oxygen is too large. Note that in the oxide semiconductor film, the amount of oxygen is larger than the amount of hydrogen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0130">In the case of a material whose crystalline structure is represented by InGaO<sub>3</sub>(ZnO)<sub>m </sub>(m&gt;0), x in InGaZnO<sub>x </sub>can be greater than 4 and less than 8 when the crystalline structure where in is 1 (InGaZnO<sub>4</sub>) is used as the reference, and x in InGaZn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>x </sub>can be greater than 5 and less than 10 when the crystalline structure where m is 2 (InGaZn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) is used as the reference. Such an oxygen excessive region may exist in part of the oxide semiconductor (including the interface).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0131">In the oxide semiconductor film, oxygen is one of the main constituent materials. Thus, it is difficult to accurately estimate the oxygen concentration of the oxide semiconductor film by a method such as secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). In other words, it can be said that it is hard to determine whether oxygen is intentionally added to the oxide semiconductor film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0132">Isotopes such as <sup>17</sup>O or <sup>18</sup>O exist in oxygen, and it is know that the existence proportions of them in nature are about 0.037% and about 0.204% of all the oxygen atoms. That is to say, it is possible to measure the concentrations of these isotopes in the oxide semiconductor film by a method such as SIMS; therefore, the oxygen concentration of the oxide semiconductor film may be able to be estimated more accurately by measuring the concentrations of these isotopes. Thus, the concentrations of these isotopes may be measured to determine whether oxygen is intentionally added to the oxide semiconductor film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0133">For example, when the concentration of <sup>18</sup>O is used as the reference, D<b>1</b> (<sup>18</sup>O)&gt;D<b>2</b> (<sup>18</sup>O) is satisfied where D<b>1</b> (<sup>18</sup>O) is the concentration of an isotope of oxygen in a region of the oxygen-doped oxide semiconductor film, and D<b>2</b> (<sup>18</sup>O) is the concentration of an isotope of oxygen in a region of the oxide semiconductor film which is not doped with oxygen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0134">It is preferable that at least part of the oxygen <b>180</b> added to the gate insulating film <b>110</b> have dangling bonds in the oxide semiconductor film after being added to the semiconductor. This is because such dangling bonds are bonded with hydrogen remaining in the film so that hydrogen can be fixed (made to be immovable ions).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0135">As described above, by performing oxygen doping treatment on the gate insulating film <b>110</b>, the oxygen excessive region is formed in the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> and an excessive amount of oxygen can be contained in the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> as compared to hydrogen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0136">Further, when the oxygen excessive region is formed in the insulating film <b>102</b> or in the vicinity of the interface between the insulating film <b>102</b> and the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b>, oxygen can be prevented from being transferred from the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> to the insulating film <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0137">The oxygen <b>180</b> described above can be generated by a plasma generating apparatus or an ozone generating apparatus. More specifically, for example, an apparatus capable of etching of a semiconductor device, an apparatus capable of aching of a resist mask, or the like can be used to generate the oxygen <b>180</b>, and process the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0138">Note that it is preferable to apply an electrical bias to the substrate in order to perform oxygen doping more favorably.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0139">Note that after the oxygen doping treatment, heat treatment is preferably performed. By the heat treatment, an excessive amount of oxygen can be supplied to the oxide semiconductor film as compared to hydrogen. In addition, the heat treatment may also serve as the above heat treatment for supply of oxygen. There is no limitation on the timing of heat treatment for achieving the effect as long as it is after the oxygen doping treatment. Further, the oxygen doping treatment and the heat treatment may be repeated. By repeatedly performing the oxygen doping treatment and the heat treatment, the transistor can have higher reliability. Note that the number of repetitions can be set appropriately.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0140">Then, the gate electrode <b>112</b> is formed (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2G</figref>). The gate electrode <b>112</b> can be formed using a metal material such as molybdenum, titanium, tantalum, tungsten, aluminum, copper, neodymium, or scandium or an alloy material which contains any of these materials as its main component. Note that the gate electrode <b>112</b> may have a single-layer structure or a layered structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0141">Note that an insulating film may be formed after formation of the gate electrode <b>112</b>. The insulating film may be formed using silicon oxide, silicon nitride, aluminum oxide, aluminum nitride, gallium oxide, a mixed material of thereof, or the like. In particular, a silicon nitride film is preferable as the insulating film because added oxygen can be prevented from being released to the outside and hydrogen or the like from the outside can be effectively prevented from entering the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b>. A wiring connected to the source electrode <b>104</b> <i>a</i>, the drain electrode <b>104</b> <i>b</i>, the gate electrode <b>112</b>, or the like may be formed.</div>

In order to separate the transistor to transfer it to the flexible substrate, a separation layer is preferably formed between the different substrate and the transistor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0164">The insulating film <b>102</b> serves as a base. Specifically, the insulating film <b>102</b> may be formed using silicon oxide, silicon nitride, aluminum oxide, aluminum nitride, gallium oxide, a mixed material of any of them, or the like. The insulating film <b>102</b> may have a single-layer structure or a layered structure using an insulating film including any of the above materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0165">There is no particular limitation on the method for forming the insulating film <b>102</b>. For example, the insulating film <b>102</b> may be formed by a deposition method such as a plasma CVD method or a sputtering method. A sputtering method is preferable in terms of low possibility of entry of hydrogen, water, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0166">Note that it is particularly preferable to form the insulating film <b>102</b> with the use of an insulating material containing a component which is the same as a component of an oxide semiconductor film formed later. Such a material is suitable for an oxide semiconductor film; thus, when it is used for the insulating film <b>102</b>, the state of the interface with the oxide semiconductor film can be kept favorably. Here, containing “a component which is the same as that of an oxide semiconductor film” means containing one or more of elements selected from constituent elements of the oxide semiconductor film. For example, in the case where the oxide semiconductor film is formed using an In—Ga—Zn—O-based oxide semiconductor material, gallium oxide or the like is given as such an insulating material containing a component which is the same as a component of the oxide semiconductor film.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0167">In the case where the insulating film <b>102</b> has a layered structure, it is further preferable to employ a layered structure of a film formed using an insulating material containing a component which is the same as a component of the oxide semiconductor film (hereinafter referred to as a film a) and a film containing a material different from a constituent material of the film a (hereinafter referred to as a film b). The reason is as follows. When the insulating film <b>102</b> has such a structure in which the film a and the film b are sequentially stacked from the oxide semiconductor film side, charge is trapped preferentially in a charge trapping center at the interface between the film a and the film b (compared with the interface between the oxide semiconductor film and the film a). Thus, trapping of charge at the interface of the oxide semiconductor film can be sufficiently suppressed, resulting in higher reliability of the semiconductor device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0168">Note that as such a layered structure, a stack of a gallium oxide film and a silicon oxide film, a stack of a gallium oxide film and a silicon nitride film, or the like may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0169">Next, the insulating film <b>102</b> is subjected to treatment with oxygen <b>180</b> <i>a </i>(also referred to as oxygen doping or oxygen plasma doping) (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). The oxygen <b>180</b> <i>a </i>contains at least any of an oxygen radical, an oxygen atom, and an oxygen ion. By performing oxygen doping on the insulating film <b>102</b>, oxygen can be contained in the insulating film <b>102</b> and either or both in the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> formed later or/and in the vicinity of the interface of the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b>. In that case, the amount of oxygen contained in the insulating film <b>102</b> is greater than the stoichiometric proportion of the insulating film <b>102</b>, or is preferably greater than the stoichiometric proportion and less than four times of the stoichiometric proportion, more preferably greater than the stoichiometric proportion and less than double of the stoichiometric proportion. Alternatively, the amount of oxygen contained in the insulating film <b>102</b> can be greater than Y, or can be preferably greater than Y and less than 4Y, where the amount of oxygen in the case where the material of the insulating film <b>102</b> is a single crystal is Y. Still alternatively, the amount of oxygen contained in the insulating film <b>102</b> can be greater than Z, and can be preferably greater than Z or less than 4Z based on the amount of oxygen Z in the insulating film in the case where oxygen doping treatment is not performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0170">For example, in the case where gallium oxide whose composition is represented by GaO<sub>x</sub>(x&gt;0) is used, since a single crystal of gallium oxide is Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, x can be greater than 1.5 and less than 6 (i.e., the amount of O is greater than 1.5 times of that of Ga and less than 6 times of that of Ga). Alternatively, for example, in the case where silicon oxide whose composition is represented by SiO<sub>x</sub>(x&gt;0) is used, when SiO<sub>2 </sub>(i.e., the amount of O is double of that of Si) is employed, x is greater than 2 and less than 8 (i.e., the amount of O is greater than double of that of Si and less than 8 times of that of Si). Note that such an oxygen excessive region may exist in part of the insulating film (including its interface).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0171">As described above, when the oxygen excessive region is formed in the insulating film <b>102</b> or the vicinity of the interface between the insulating film <b>102</b> and the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> formed later, oxygen can be prevented from being transferred from the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> to the insulating film <b>102</b>. Accordingly, when oxygen doping treatment is performed on the insulating film <b>102</b>, an excessive amount of oxygen can be contained in the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> as compared to hydrogen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0172">In addition, at least part of the oxygen <b>180</b> <i>a </i>added to the insulating film preferably has a dangling bond in the oxide semiconductor film after being supplied to the oxide semiconductor. This is because, with the dangling bond, the oxygen <b>180</b> <i>a </i>can be bonded with hydrogen which remains in the film, so that the hydrogen can be fixed (made to be an immovable ion).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0173">The oxygen <b>180</b> <i>a </i>can be generated by a plasma generating apparatus or an ozone generating apparatus. More specifically, for example, an apparatus for etching of a semiconductor device, an apparatus for ashing of a resist mask, or the like can be used to generate the oxygen <b>180</b> <i>a</i>, and the insulating film <b>102</b> can be processed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0174">Note that it is preferable to apply an electrical bias to the substrate in order to perform oxygen doping more favorably.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0175">Next, a conductive film for forming the source electrode and the drain electrode (including a wiring formed in the same layer as the source electrode and the drain electrode) is formed over the insulating film <b>102</b> and the conductive film is processed to form the source electrode <b>104</b> <i>a </i>and the drain electrode <b>104</b> <i>b </i>(see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>). Note that the channel length L of the transistor is determined by the distance between the edges of the source electrode <b>104</b> <i>a </i>and the drain electrode <b>104</b> <i>b </i>which are formed here.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0176">Examples of the conductive film used for the source electrode <b>104</b> <i>a </i>and the drain electrode <b>104</b> <i>b </i>are a metal film containing an element selected from Al, Cr, Cu, Ta, Ti, Mo, and W, and a metal nitride film containing any of the above elements as its component (e.g., a titanium nitride film, a molybdenum nitride film, and a tungsten nitride film). Alternatively, a conductive film may be used in which a high-melting-point metal film of Ti, Mo, W, or the like or a metal nitride film of any of these elements (a titanium nitride film, a molybdenum nitride film, or a tungsten nitride film) may be stacked on one of or both a bottom side and a top side of a metal film of Al, Cu, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0177">Alternatively, the conductive film used for the source electrode <b>104</b> <i>a </i>and the drain electrode <b>104</b> <i>b </i>may be formed using a conductive metal oxide. As the conductive metal oxide, indium oxide, tin oxide, zinc oxide, an indium oxide-tin oxide mixed oxide (abbreviated to ITO), an indium oxide-zinc oxide mixed oxide, or any of these metal oxide materials containing silicon oxide may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0178">The conductive film may be processed by etching with the use of a resist mask. Ultraviolet, a KrF laser light, an ArF laser light, or the like is preferably used for light exposure for forming a resist mask for the etching.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0179">In the case where the channel length L is less than 25 nm, the light exposure at the time of forming the resist mask is preferably performed using, for example, extreme ultraviolet having an extremely short wavelength of several nanometers to several tens of nanometers. In the light exposure using extreme ultraviolet, the resolution is high and the focus depth is large. Thus, the channel length L of the transistor formed later can be reduced, whereby the operation speed of a circuit can be increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0180">An etching step may be performed with the use of a resist mask formed using a so-called multi-tone mask. A resist mask formed using a multi-tone mask has a plurality of thicknesses and can be further changed in shape by ashing; thus, such a resist mask can be used in a plurality of etching steps for different patterns. Therefore, a resist mask for at least two kinds of patterns can be formed using a multi-tone mask, resulting in simplification of the process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0181">Next, an oxide semiconductor film in contact with the source electrode <b>104</b> <i>a </i>and the drain electrode <b>104</b> <i>b </i>is formed over the insulating film <b>102</b> and then the oxide semiconductor film is processed to form an oxide semiconductor film <b>106</b> having an island shape (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0182">The oxide semiconductor film is preferably formed by a method by which hydrogen, water, and the like do not easily enter the film, such as a sputtering method. The thickness of the oxide semiconductor film is preferably greater than or equal to 3 nm and less than or equal to 30 nm. This is because the transistor might possibly be normally on when the oxide semiconductor film is too thick (e.g., the thickness is 50 nm or more).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0183">As a material of the oxide semiconductor film, any of the following materials can be used: a four-component metal oxide such as an In—Sn—Ga—Zn—O-based material; three-component metal oxides such as an In—Ga—Zn—O-based material, an In—Sn—Zn—O-based material, an In—Al—Zn—O-based material, a Sn—Ga—Zn—O-based material, an Al—Ga—Zn—O-based material, and a Sn—Al—Zn—O-based material; two-component metal oxides such as an In—Zn—O-based material, a Sn—Zn—O-based material, an Al—Zn—O-based material, a Zn—Mg—O-based material, a Sn—Mg—O-based material, an In—Mg—O-based material, and an In—Ga—O-based material; and single-component metal oxides such as an In—O-based material, a Sn—O-based material, and a Zn—O-based material. In addition, the above materials may contain silicon oxide. Here, for example, an In—Ga—Zn—O-based material means an oxide film containing indium (In), gallium (Ga), and zinc (Zn), and there is no particular limitation on the composition ratio thereof. Further, the In—Ga—Zn—O-based material may contain another element in addition to In, Ga, and Zn.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0184">The oxide semiconductor film may be a thin film formed using a material represented by the chemical formula, InMO<sub>3</sub>(ZnO)<sub>m </sub>(m&gt;0). Here, M represents one or more metal elements selected from Ga, Al, Mn, and Co. For example, M may be Ga, Ga and Al, Ga and Mn, Ga and Co, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0185">In this embodiment, the oxide semiconductor film is formed by a sputtering method using an In—Ga—Zn—O-based oxide semiconductor deposition target.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0186">As the In—Ga—Zn—O-based oxide semiconductor deposition target, for example, an oxide semiconductor deposition target with a composition ratio of In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:ZnO=1:1:1 [molar ratio] may be used. Note that it is not necessary to limit the material and the composition ratio of the target to the above. For example, an oxide semiconductor deposition target with a composition ratio of In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:ZnO=1:1:2 [molar ratio] may alternatively be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0187">In the case where an In—Zn—O-based material is used for the oxide semiconductor, a target with the following composition ratio is used: the composition ratio of In:Zn is 50:1 to 1:2 in an atomic ratio (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:ZnO=25:1 to 1:4 in a molar ratio), preferably 20:1 to 1:1 in an atomic ratio (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:ZnO=10:1 to 1:2 in a molar ratio), further preferably 15:1 to 1.5:1 in an atomic ratio (In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>:ZnO=15:2 to 3:4 in a molar ratio). For example, a target used for the formation of an In—Zn—O-based oxide semiconductor has the following atomic ratio: In:Zn:O is X:Y:Z, where Z&gt;1.5X+Y.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0188">The fill rate of the oxide semiconductor deposition target is higher than or equal to 90% and lower than or equal to 100%, preferably, higher than or equal to 95% and lower than or equal to 99.9%. With the use of the oxide semiconductor deposition target with high fill rate, a dense oxide semiconductor film can be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0189">The deposition atmosphere may be a rare gas (typically argon) atmosphere, an oxygen atmosphere, or a mixed atmosphere containing a rare gas and oxygen. Moreover, it is preferable that an atmosphere using a high-purity gas in which impurities containing hydrogen atoms, such as hydrogen, water, a compound having a hydroxyl group, and a hydride, are removed be used because entry of hydrogen, water, a compound having a hydroxyl group, and a hydride into the oxide semiconductor film can be prevented.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0190">In forming the oxide semiconductor film, oxygen in the insulating film <b>102</b> is supplied to the oxide semiconductor film in some cases. When oxygen is added to the insulating film <b>102</b> in this manner, it is possible to form the oxide semiconductor film to which oxygen is sufficiently added.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0191">More specifically, for example, the oxide semiconductor film can be formed as follows.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0192">First, the substrate <b>100</b> is placed in a deposition chamber kept under reduced pressure, and the substrate temperature is set to a temperature higher than or equal to 100° C. and lower than or equal to 600° C., preferably higher than or equal to 200° C. and lower than or equal to 400° C. This is because the concentration of an impurity contained in the oxide semiconductor film can be reduced when deposition is performed while the substrate <b>100</b> is heated. This is also because damage due to sputtering can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0193">Then, a high-purity gas in which impurities containing hydrogen atoms, such as hydrogen and moisture, are sufficiently removed is introduced into the deposition chamber from which remaining moisture is being removed, and the oxide semiconductor film is formed over the substrate <b>100</b> with the use of the target. To remove moisture remaining in the deposition chamber, an entrapment vacuum pump such as a cryopump, an ion pump, or a titanium sublimation pump is preferably used as an evacuation unit. Further, an evacuation means may be a turbo molecular pump provided with a cold trap. In the deposition chamber which is evacuated with the cryopump, a hydrogen molecule, a compound containing a hydrogen atom, such as water (H<sub>2</sub>O), (further preferably, also a compound containing a carbon atom), and the like are removed, whereby the concentration of an impurity in the oxide semiconductor film formed in the deposition chamber can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0194">An example of the deposition conditions is as follows: the distance between the substrate and the target is 100 mm, the pressure is 0.6 Pa, the direct-current (DC) power is 0.5 kW, and the deposition atmosphere is an oxygen atmosphere (the flow rate of the oxygen is 100%). Note that a pulse direct current power source is preferable because generation of powdery substances (also referred to as particles or dust) in deposition can be prevented and thickness distribution can be uniform.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0195">The oxide semiconductor film can be processed in such a manner that a mask having a desired shape is formed over the oxide semiconductor film and then the oxide semiconductor film is etched. The mask may be formed by a method such as photolithography or an ink-jet method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0196">For the etching of the oxide semiconductor film, either wet etching or dry etching may be employed. Needless to say, both of them may be employed in combination.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0197">After that, heat treatment is performed on the oxide semiconductor film <b>106</b> so that the highly-purified oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> is formed (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref>). Excessive hydrogen (including water and a hydroxyl group) in the oxide semiconductor film <b>106</b> is removed through the heat treatment and the structure of the oxide semiconductor film is modified, so that defect levels in an energy gap can be reduced. Further, through this heat treatment, oxygen in the insulating film <b>102</b> is supplied to the oxide semiconductor film in some cases. The heat treatment is performed at a temperature of higher than or equal to 250° C. and lower than or equal to 650° C., preferably higher than or equal to 450° C. and lower than or equal to 600° C. or lower than the strain point of the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0198">The heat treatment may be performed, for example, in such a manner that an object to be processed is introduced into an electric furnace in which a resistance heating element or the like is used and heated in a nitrogen atmosphere at 450° C. for an hour. During the heat treatment, the oxide semiconductor film <b>106</b> is not exposed to the air to prevent the entry of water and hydrogen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0199">Note that a heat treatment apparatus is not limited to an electric furnace, and may include a device for heating an object to be processed by heat conduction or heat radiation from a medium such as a heated gas. For example, an RTA (rapid thermal anneal) apparatus such as a GRTA (gas rapid thermal anneal) apparatus or an LRTA (lamp rapid thermal anneal) apparatus can be used. A GRTA apparatus is an apparatus for performing heat treatment using a high-temperature gas. As the gas, an inert gas which does not react with an object to be processed by heat treatment, such as nitrogen or a rare gas such as argon is used. An LRTA apparatus is an apparatus for heating an object to be processed by radiation of light (an electromagnetic wave) emitted from a lamp such as a halogen lamp, a metal halide lamp, a xenon arc lamp, a carbon arc lamp, a high pressure sodium lamp, or a high pressure mercury lamp.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0200">For example, as the heat treatment, GRTA treatment may be performed as follows. The object is put in an inert gas atmosphere that has been heated, heated for several minutes, and then taken out of the inert gas atmosphere. GRTA treatment enables high-temperature heat treatment in a short time. Moreover, GRTA treatment can be employed even when the temperature exceeds the upper temperature limit of the object. Note that the inert gas may be switched to a gas including oxygen during the process. This is because defect levels in an energy gap due to oxygen vacancy can be reduced by performing the heat treatment in an atmosphere containing oxygen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0201">Note that as the inert gas atmosphere, an atmosphere that contains nitrogen or a rare gas (e.g., helium, neon, or argon) as its main component and does not contain water, hydrogen, or the like is preferably used. For example, the purity of nitrogen or a rare gas such as helium, neon, or argon introduced into a heat treatment apparatus is greater than or equal to 6 N (99.9999%), preferably greater than or equal to 7 N (99.99999%) (that is, the concentration of the impurities is less than or equal to 1 ppm, preferably less than or equal to 0.1 ppm).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0202">In any case, the i-type (intrinsic) or substantially i-type oxide semiconductor film in which impurities are reduced by the heat treatment is formed, whereby a transistor having extremely excellent characteristics can be realized.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0203">The above heat treatment can be referred to as dehydration treatment, dehydrogenation treatment, or the like because of its advantageous effect of removing hydrogen, water, and the like. The dehydration treatment or dehydrogenation treatment may be performed at the timing, for example, before the oxide semiconductor film is processed to have an island shape. Such dehydration treatment or dehydrogenation treatment may be conducted once or plural times.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0219">As described above, the heat treatment for dehydration or the like and oxygen doping treatment or the heat treatment for supply of oxygen are applied, whereby the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> can be highly purified so as to contain impurities as little as possible. The highly-purified oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> contains extremely few (close to zero) carriers derived from a donor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0220">Next, the gate insulating film <b>110</b> is subjected to treatment using oxygen <b>180</b> <i>c </i>(also referred to as oxygen doping treatment or oxygen plasma doping treatment) (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>). Here, the oxygen <b>180</b> <i>c </i>contains at least any of an oxygen radical, an oxygen atom, and an oxygen ion. By performing oxygen doping treatment on the gate insulating film <b>110</b>, oxygen can be contained in the gate insulating film <b>110</b> or in the vicinity of the interface between the gate insulating film <b>110</b> and the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b>. In that case, the amount of oxygen contained in the gate insulating film <b>110</b> is greater than the stoichiometric proportion of the gate insulating film <b>110</b>, or is preferably greater than the stoichiometric proportion and less than four times of the stoichiometric proportion, more preferably greater than the stoichiometric proportion and less than double of the stoichiometric proportion. Alternatively, the amount of oxygen contained in the gate insulating film <b>110</b> can be greater than Y, or can be preferably greater than Y and less than 4Y, where the amount of oxygen in the case where the material of the gate insulating film <b>110</b> is a single crystal is Y. Still alternatively, the amount of oxygen contained in the gate insulating film <b>110</b> can be greater than Z, and can be preferably greater than Z or less than 4Z based on the amount of oxygen Z in the insulating film in the case where oxygen doping treatment is not performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0221">For example, in the case where gallium oxide whose composition is represented by GaO<sub>x</sub>(x&gt;0) is used, since a single crystal of gallium oxide is Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, x can be greater than 1.5 and less than 6 (i.e., the amount of O is greater than 1.5 times of that of Ga and less than 6 times of that of Ga). Alternatively, for example, in the case where silicon oxide whose composition is represented by SiO<sub>x </sub>(x&gt;0) is used, when SiO<sub>2 </sub>(i.e., the amount of O is double of that of Si) is employed, x is greater than 2 and less than 8 (i.e., the amount of O is greater than double of that of Si and less than 8 times of that of Si). Note that such an oxygen excessive region may exist in part of the insulating film (including its interface).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0222">As described above, when the oxygen excessive region is formed in the gate insulating film <b>110</b> or the vicinity of the interface between the gate insulating film <b>110</b> and the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b>, oxygen can be prevented from being transferred from the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> to the gate insulating film <b>110</b>. Accordingly, when oxygen doping treatment is performed on the gate insulating film <b>110</b>, an excessive amount of oxygen can be contained in the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> as compared to hydrogen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0223">Further, in the oxygen doping treatment described above, oxygen can be supplied into the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b>, the vicinity of the interface between the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> and the insulating film <b>102</b>, or the insulating film <b>102</b>. In particular, oxygen is easily supplied into the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b>, the vicinity of the interface between the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> and the insulating film <b>102</b>, or the insulating film <b>102</b> in the case where the thickness of the gate insulating film <b>110</b> or the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> is sufficiently small, in the case where an electrical bias applied to the substrate is sufficiently large, or in the case where heat treatment is performed after oxygen doping treatment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0224">In addition, at least part of the oxygen <b>180</b> <i>c </i>added to the gate insulating film <b>110</b> preferably has a dangling bond in the oxide semiconductor film after being supplied to the oxide semiconductor. This is because, with the dangling bond, the oxygen <b>180</b> <i>c </i>can be bonded with hydrogen which remains in the film, so that the hydrogen can be fixed (made to be an immovable ion).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0225">The oxygen <b>180</b> <i>c </i>described above can be generated by a plasma generating apparatus or an ozone generating apparatus. More specifically, for example, an apparatus for etching of a semiconductor device, an apparatus for ashing of a resist mask, or the like can be used to generate the oxygen <b>180</b> <i>c</i>, and the gate insulating film <b>110</b> is processed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0226">Note that it is preferable to apply an electrical bias to the substrate in order to perform oxygen doping more favorably.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0227">Note that after the oxygen doping treatment, heat treatment is preferably performed. By the heat treatment, an excessive amount of oxygen can be supplied to the oxide semiconductor film as compared to hydrogen. In addition, the heat treatment may also serve as the above heat treatment for supply of oxygen. There is no limitation on the timing of heat treatment for achieving the effect as long as it is after the oxygen doping treatment. Further, the oxygen doping treatment and the heat treatment may be repeated. By repeatedly performing the oxygen doping treatment and the heat treatment, the transistor can have higher reliability. Note that the number of repetitions can be set appropriately.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0228">Then, the gate electrode <b>112</b> is formed (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>). The gate electrode <b>112</b> can be formed using a metal material such as molybdenum, titanium, tantalum, tungsten, aluminum, copper, neodymium, or scandium or an alloy material which contains any of these materials as its main component. Note that the gate electrode <b>112</b> may have a single-layer structure or a layered structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0229">Note that an insulating film may be formed after formation of the gate electrode <b>112</b>. The insulating film may be formed using silicon oxide, silicon nitride, aluminum oxide, aluminum nitride, gallium oxide, a mixed material of thereof, or the like. In particular, a silicon nitride film is preferable as the insulating film because added oxygen can be prevented from being released to the outside and hydrogen or the like from the outside can be effectively prevented from being entered into the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b>. A wiring connected to the source electrode <b>104</b> <i>a</i>, the drain electrode <b>104</b> <i>b</i>, the gate electrode <b>112</b>, or the like may be formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0230">Through the above process, the transistor <b>120</b> is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0231">In that case, the amount of oxygen contained in the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> is greater than the stoichiometric proportion of the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b>, preferably greater than the stoichiometric proportion and less than double of the stoichiometric proportion. Alternatively, the amount of oxygen may be greater than Y, preferably greater than Y and less than 2Y, where the amount of oxygen in the case where the material of the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> is a single crystal is Y. Still alternatively, the amount of oxygen may be greater than Z, preferably greater than Z and less than 2Z based on the amount of oxygen Z in the oxide semiconductor film in the case where oxygen doping is not performed. The reason of the presence of the upper limit in the above preferable range is that the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> might take hydrogen like a hydrogen storing alloy (a hydrogen storage alloy) when the amount of oxygen is too large</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0232">In the case of a material whose crystalline structure is represented by InGaO<sub>3</sub>(ZnO)<sub>m </sub>(m&gt;0), x in InGaZnO<sub>x </sub>can be greater than 4 and less than 8 when the crystalline structure where m is 1 (InGaZnO<sub>4</sub>) is used as the reference, and x in InGaZn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>x </sub>can be greater than 5 and less than 10 when the crystalline structure where in is 2 (InGaZn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) is used as the reference. Such an oxygen excessive region may exist in part of the oxide semiconductor (including the interface).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0233">As described above, the oxygen excessive region is formed in the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> and an excessive amount of oxygen can be contained in the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> as compared to hydrogen.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0234">Note that the above description gives the example in which oxygen doping treatment is performed on all of the insulating film <b>102</b>, the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b>, and the gate insulating film <b>110</b>; however, an embodiment of the disclosed invention is not limited thereto. For example, the oxygen doping treatment may be performed on the insulating film <b>102</b> and the gate insulating film <b>110</b>, or on the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> and the gate insulating film <b>110</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0235">The transistor according to this embodiment includes a highly-purified and i-type (intrinsic) oxide semiconductor film which is obtained in such a manner that an impurity including a hydrogen atom, such as hydrogen, water, a hydroxyl group, and hydride (also referred to as a hydrogen compound), is removed from an oxide semiconductor by heat treatment, and oxygen, which might be reduced in a step for removing an impurity, is supplied so that an excessive amount of oxygen is contained in the oxide semiconductor as compared to hydrogen. The transistor including the oxide semiconductor film which is highly purified in the above manner has suppressed variation in the electrical characteristics such as a threshold voltage and is electrically stable.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0236">Since the bonding strength between indium and oxygen is relatively weak, when an oxide semiconductor material containing indium is used as the oxide semiconductor film and the insulating film in contact with the oxide semiconductor film includes a material, such as silicon, whose bonding strength with oxygen is stronger, there is a possibility that oxygen in the oxide semiconductor film is abstracted by heat treatment so that oxygen deficiency is formed in the vicinity of the interface of the oxide semiconductor film.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0017">&lt;Structural Example of Semiconductor Device&gt;</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0241">The structure of a semiconductor device manufactured in accordance with a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device of this embodiment is the same as that of the transistor <b>120</b> of the above embodiment. In other words, the semiconductor device includes, over the substrate <b>100</b>, the insulating film <b>102</b>, the source electrode <b>104</b> <i>a</i>, the drain electrode <b>104</b> <i>b</i>, the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b>, the gate insulating film <b>110</b>, and the gate electrode <b>112</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 1C</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0242">As described in the above embodiment, the gate insulating film <b>110</b> in the transistor <b>120</b> is an insulating film subjected to oxygen doping treatment and includes an oxygen excessive region. When the gate insulating film <b>110</b> includes the oxygen excessive region, oxygen can be prevented from being transferred from the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> to the gate insulating film <b>110</b>. In addition, oxygen can be supplied from the gate insulating film <b>110</b> to the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b>. Further, in this embodiment, oxygen doping treatment can be directly performed on the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b>, and oxygen doping treatment can also be performed on the insulating film <b>102</b>. By such oxygen doping treatment, an excessive amount of oxygen can be contained in the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> as compared to hydrogen. Accordingly, the transistor <b>120</b> which further increases its reliability can be obtained. In addition, the oxygen doping treatment performed on the insulating film <b>102</b> in this embodiment also serves as a step for removing a mask <b>103</b> <i>a </i>and a mask <b>103</b> <i>b </i>used for foaming the source electrode <b>104</b> <i>a </i>and the drain electrode <b>104</b> <i>b</i>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0244">First, the insulating film <b>102</b> is formed over the substrate <b>100</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>). The description of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> can be referred to for the details thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0245">Next, a conductive film for forming the source electrode and the drain electrode (including a wiring formed in the same layer as the source electrode and the drain electrode) is formed over the insulating film <b>102</b> and the conductive film is processed with the use of the mask <b>103</b> <i>a </i>and the mask <b>103</b> <i>b</i>, thereby forming the source electrode <b>104</b> <i>a </i>and the drain electrode <b>104</b> <i>b</i>. Then, treatment using oxygen <b>180</b> <i>a </i>(also referred to as oxygen doping treatment or oxygen plasma doping treatment) is performed on the insulating film <b>102</b> (see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>).

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0246">The oxygen <b>180</b> <i>a </i>contains at least any of an oxygen radical, an oxygen atom, and an oxygen ion. By performing oxygen doping treatment on the insulating film <b>102</b>, oxygen can be contained in the insulating film <b>102</b> and either or both in the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> formed later or/and in the vicinity of the interface of the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b>. In that case, the amount of oxygen contained in the insulating film <b>102</b> is greater than the stoichiometric proportion of the insulating film <b>102</b>, or is preferably greater than the stoichiometric proportion and less than four times of the stoichiometric proportion, more preferably greater than the stoichiometric proportion and less than double of the stoichiometric proportion.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0251">By the oxygen doping treatment, the mask <b>103</b> <i>a </i>and the mask <b>103</b> <i>b </i>are removed.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0252">In addition, by the oxygen doping treatment, a region containing oxygen at high concentration and a region containing oxygen at low concentration are formed in the insulating film <b>102</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0279">In this embodiment, as an example of a semiconductor device, a memory medium (a memory element) will be described.

In the semiconductor device illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>, a transistor <b>240</b> including a first semiconductor material is provided in a lower portion, and the transistor <b>120</b> described in Embodiment 1 is provided in an upper portion. Note that the transistor <b>120</b> includes an oxide semiconductor as a second semiconductor material. In this embodiment, the first semiconductor material is a semiconductor material other than an oxide semiconductor. As the semiconductor material other than an oxide semiconductor, for example, silicon, germanium, silicon germanium, silicon carbide, gallium arsenide, or the like can be used, and a single crystal semiconductor is preferably used. Alternatively, an organic semiconductor material or the like may be used. A transistor including such a semiconductor material other than an oxide semiconductor can easily achieve high-speed operation. On the other hand, a transistor including an oxide semiconductor can hold charge for a long time owing to its characteristics.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0281">Note that in this embodiment, an example in which the memory medium is formed using the transistor <b>120</b> is described; however, needless to say, any of the transistor <b>130</b>, the transistor <b>140</b>, the transistor <b>150</b>, the transistor <b>160</b>, and the like described in Embodiment 1 or 2 can be used instead of the transistor <b>120</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0282">The transistor <b>240</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A to 7C</figref> includes a channel formation region <b>216</b> provided in a substrate <b>200</b> including a semiconductor material (e.g., silicon), impurity regions <b>220</b> between which the channel formation region <b>216</b> is provided, metal compound regions <b>224</b> in contact with the impurity regions <b>220</b>, a gate insulating film <b>208</b> provided over the channel formation region <b>216</b>, and the gate electrode <b>210</b> provided over the gate insulating film <b>208</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0283">As the substrate <b>200</b> including a semiconductor material, a single crystal semiconductor substrate or a polycrystalline semiconductor substrate of silicon, silicon carbide, or the like; a compound semiconductor substrate of silicon germanium or the like; an SOI substrate; or the like can be used. Note that although the term “SOI substrate” generally means a substrate in which a silicon semiconductor film is provided over an insulating surface, the term “SOI substrate” in this specification and the like also includes a substrate in which a semiconductor film including a material other than silicon is provided over an insulating surface. In other words, a semiconductor film included in the “SOI substrate” is not limited to a silicon semiconductor film. Moreover, the SOI substrate can be a substrate having a structure in which a semiconductor film is provided over an insulating substrate such as a glass substrate with an insulating film provided therebetween.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0284">An element isolation insulating film <b>206</b> is provided over the substrate <b>200</b> so as to surround the transistor <b>240</b>, and an insulating film <b>228</b> and an insulating film <b>230</b> are provided to cover the transistor <b>240</b>. Note that for high integration, it is preferable that, as in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the transistor <b>240</b> does not have a sidewall insulating film On the other hand, in the case where the characteristics of the transistor <b>240</b> have priority, sidewall insulating films may be provided on side surfaces of the gate electrode <b>210</b>, and the impurity regions <b>220</b> may each include a region with a different impurity concentration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0285">The transistor <b>240</b> can be manufactured using silicon, germanium, silicon germanium, silicon carbide, gallium arsenide, or the like. Such a transistor <b>240</b> is capable of high speed operation. Thus, when the transistor is used as a reading transistor, data can be read out at high speed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0286">After the transistor <b>240</b> is formed, as treatment prior to the formation of the transistor <b>120</b> and a capacitor <b>164</b>, the insulating film <b>228</b> and the insulating film <b>230</b> are subjected to CMP treatment so that a top surface of the gate electrode <b>210</b> is exposed. As treatment for exposing the top surface of the gate electrode <b>210</b>, etching treatment or the like can also be employed instead of CMP treatment; in order to improve characteristics of the transistor <b>120</b>, surfaces of the insulating film <b>228</b> and the insulating film <b>230</b> are preferably made as flat as possible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0287">Next, a conductive film is formed over the gate electrode <b>210</b>, the insulating film <b>228</b>, the insulating film <b>230</b>, and the like and the conductive film is selectively etched, so that a source electrode <b>104</b> <i>a </i>and a drain electrode <b>104</b> <i>b </i>are formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0288">The conductive film can be formed by a PVD method such as a sputtering method or a CVD method such as a plasma CVD method. As the material of the conductive film, an element selected from Al, Cr, Cu, Ta, Ti, Mo, and W, an alloy including any of the above elements as its component, or the like can be used. Any of Mn, Mg, Zr, Be, Nd, and Sc, or a material including any of these in combination may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0289">The conductive film may have either a single-layer structure or a layered structure of two or more layers. For example, the conductive film can have a single-layer structure of a titanium film or a titanium nitride film, a single-layer structure of an aluminum film containing silicon, a two-layer structure in which a titanium film is stacked over an aluminum film, a two-layer structure in which a titanium film is stacked over a titanium nitride film, or a three-layer structure in which a titanium film, an aluminum film, and a titanium film are stacked in this order. Note that in the case where the conductive film has a single-layer structure of a titanium film or a titanium nitride film, there is an advantage that the source electrode <b>104</b> <i>a </i>and the drain electrode <b>104</b> <i>b </i>can be easily processed to be tapered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0290">A channel length (L) of the transistor <b>120</b> in the upper portion is determined by a distance between a lower end portion of the source electrode <b>104</b> <i>a </i>and a lower end portion of the drain electrode <b>104</b> <i>b</i>. Note that for light exposure for forming a mask used in the case where a transistor with a channel length (L) of less than 25 nm is formed, it is preferable to use extreme ultraviolet rays whose wavelength is as short as several nanometers to several tens of nanometers.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0291">Next, an oxide semiconductor film is formed to cover the source electrode <b>104</b> <i>a </i>and the drain electrode <b>104</b> <i>b</i>, and the oxide semiconductor film is selectively etched, so that the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> is formed. The oxide semiconductor film is formed using the material and the formation process described in Embodiment 1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0292">Then, a gate insulating film <b>110</b> in contact with the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> is formed. The gate insulating film <b>110</b> is formed using the material and the formation process described in Embodiment 1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0293">Next, over the gate insulating film <b>110</b>, a gate electrode <b>112</b> <i>a </i>is formed in a region overlapping with the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> and an electrode <b>112</b> <i>b </i>is formed in a region overlapping with the source electrode <b>104</b> <i>a. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0294">After the gate insulating film <b>110</b> is formed, heat treatment (also referred to as supply of oxygen) is preferably performed in an inert gas atmosphere or an oxygen atmosphere. The temperature of the heat treatment is higher than or equal to 200° C. and lower than or equal to 450° C., preferably higher than or equal to 250° C. and lower than or equal to 350° C. For example, the heat treatment may be performed at 250° C. for one hour in a nitrogen atmosphere. By performing the heat treatment, variation in electrical characteristics of the transistor can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0295">Note that the timing of the heat treatment for supplying oxygen is not limited thereto. For example, the heat treatment for supplying oxygen may be performed after the gate electrode is formed. Alternatively, heat treatment for supply of oxygen may be performed following heat treatment for dehydration or the like; heat treatment for dehydration or the like may also serve as heat treatment for supplying oxygen; or heat treatment for supplying oxygen may also serve as heat treatment for dehydration or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0296">As described above, when heat treatment for dehydration or the like, and oxygen doping or heat treatment for supplying oxygen are performed, the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> can be highly purified so as to contain impurities as little as possible.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0297">The gate electrode <b>112</b> <i>a </i>and the electrode <b>112</b> <i>b </i>can be formed in such a manner that a conductive film is formed over the gate insulating film <b>110</b> and then etched selectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0298">Next, an insulating film <b>151</b> and an insulating film <b>152</b> are formed over the gate insulating film <b>110</b>, the gate electrode <b>112</b> <i>a</i>, and the electrode <b>112</b> <i>b</i>. The insulating film <b>151</b> and the insulating film <b>152</b> can be formed by a sputtering method, a CVD method, or the like. The insulating film <b>151</b> and the insulating film <b>152</b> can be formed using a material including an inorganic insulating material such as silicon oxide, silicon oxynitride, silicon nitride, hafnium oxide, aluminum oxide, or gallium oxide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0299">Next, an opening reaching the drain electrode <b>104</b> <i>b </i>is formed through the gate insulating film <b>110</b>, the insulating film <b>151</b>, and the insulating film <b>152</b>. The opening is formed by selective etching with the use of a mask or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0300">After that, an electrode <b>154</b> is formed in the opening, and a wiring <b>156</b> which is in contact with the electrode <b>154</b> is formed over the insulating film <b>152</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0301">The electrode <b>154</b> can be formed in such a manner, for example, that a conductive film is formed in a region including the opening by a PVD method, a CVD method, or the like and then part of the conductive film is removed by etching, CMP, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0302">The wiring <b>156</b> is formed in such a manner that a conductive film is formed by a PVD method such as a sputtering method or a CVD method such as a plasma CVD method, and then the conductive film is patterned. As a material of the conductive film, an element selected from Al, Cr, Cu, Ta, Ti, Mo, and W, an alloy including any of the above elements as its component, or the like can be used. Any of Mn, Mg, Zr, Be, Nd, and Sc, or a material including any of these in combination may be used. The details are the same as those of the source electrode <b>104</b> <i>a</i>, the drain electrode <b>104</b> <i>b</i>, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0303">Through the above process, the transistor <b>120</b> and the capacitor <b>164</b> including the highly-purified oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> are completed. The capacitor <b>164</b> includes the source electrode <b>104</b> <i>a</i>, the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b>, the gate insulating film <b>110</b>, and the electrode <b>112</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0304">Note that in the capacitor <b>164</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A to 7C</figref>, insulation between the source electrode <b>104</b> <i>a </i>and the electrode <b>112</b> <i>b </i>can be sufficiently secured by stacking the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> and the gate insulating film <b>110</b>. Needless to say, the capacitor <b>164</b> without the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> may be employed in order to secure sufficient capacitance. Further alternatively, the capacitor <b>164</b> may be omitted in the case where a capacitor is not needed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0305"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref> illustrates an example of a diagram of a circuit using the semiconductor device as a memory element. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, one of a source electrode and a drain electrode of the transistor <b>120</b>, one electrode of the capacitor <b>164</b>, and a gate electrode of the transistor <b>240</b> are electrically connected to each other. A first wiring (1st Line, also referred to as a source line) is electrically connected to a source electrode of the transistor <b>240</b>. A second wiring (2nd Line, also referred to as a bit line) is electrically connected to a drain electrode of the transistor <b>240</b>. A third wiring (3rd Line, also referred to as a first signal line) is electrically connected to the other of the source electrode and the drain electrode of the transistor <b>120</b>. A fourth wiring (4th Line, also referred to as a second signal line) is electrically connected to a gate electrode of the transistor <b>120</b>. A fifth wiring (5th Line, also referred to as a word line) is electrically connected to the other electrode of the capacitor <b>164</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0306">The transistor <b>120</b> including an oxide semiconductor has extremely low off current; therefore, when the transistor <b>120</b> is turned off, the potential of a node (hereinafter, a node FG) where one of the source electrode and drain electrode of the transistor <b>120</b>, one electrode of the capacitor <b>164</b>, and the gate electrode of the transistor <b>240</b> are electrically connected to each other can be held for an extremely long time. The capacitor <b>164</b> facilitates holding of charge given to the node FG and reading of the held data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0307">When data is stored in the semiconductor device (writing), the potential of the fourth wiring is set to a potential at which the transistor <b>120</b> is turned on, whereby the transistor <b>120</b> is turned on. Thus, the potential of the third wiring is applied to the node FG and a predetermined amount of charge is accumulated in the node FG Here, charge for applying either of two different potential levels (hereinafter referred to as a low-level charge and a high-level charge) is given to the node FG After that, the potential of the fourth wiring is set to a potential at which the transistor <b>120</b> is turned off, whereby the transistor <b>120</b> is turned off. This makes the node FG floating and the predetermined amount of charge is held in the node FG. The predetermined amount of charge is thus accumulated and held in the node FG whereby the memory cell can store data.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0308">Since the off current of the transistor <b>120</b> is extremely small, the charge applied to the node FG is held for a long time. This further can remove the need of refresh operation or drastically reduce the frequency of the refresh operation, which leads to a sufficient reduction in power consumption. Moreover, stored data can be held for a long time even when power is not supplied.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0309">When stored data is read out (reading), while a predetermined potential (a fixed potential) is applied to the first wiring, an appropriate potential (a read-out potential) is applied to the fifth wiring, whereby the transistor <b>240</b> changes its state depending on the amount of charge held in the node FG This is because, in general, when the transistor <b>240</b> is an n-channel transistor, an apparent threshold value V<sub>th</sub> <sub> <sub2>—</sub2> </sub> <sub>H </sub>of the transistor <b>240</b> in the case where a high-level charge is held in the node FG is lower than an apparent threshold value V<sub>th</sub> <sub> <sub2>—</sub2> </sub> <sub>L </sub>of the transistor <b>240</b> in the case where a low-level charge is held in the node FG. Here, an apparent threshold voltage refers to the potential of the fifth wiring, which is needed to turn on the transistor <b>240</b>. Thus, by setting the potential of the fifth wiring to a potential V<sub>0 </sub>which is between V<sub>th</sub> <sub> <sub2>—</sub2> </sub> <sub>H </sub>and V<sub>th</sub> <sub> <sub2>—</sub2> </sub> <sub>L</sub>, charge held in the node FG can be determined. For example, in the case where a high-level charge is given in writing, when the potential of the fifth wiring is set to V<sub>0 </sub>(&gt;V<sub>th</sub> <sub> <sub2>—</sub2> </sub> <sub>H</sub>), the transistor <b>240</b> is turned on. In the case where a low-level charge is given in writing, even when the potential of the fifth wiring is set to V<sub>0 </sub>(&lt;V<sub>th</sub> <sub> <sub2>—</sub2> </sub> <sub>L</sub>), the transistor <b>240</b> remains in an off state. In such a manner, by controlling the potential of the fifth wiring and determining whether the transistor <b>240</b> is in an on state or off state (reading out the potential of the second wiring), stored data can be read out.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0310">In order to rewrite stored data, a new potential is applied to the node FG that is holding the predetermined amount of charge given in the above writing, so that the charge of the new data is held in the node FG Specifically, the potential of the fourth wiring is set to a potential at which the transistor <b>120</b> is turned on, whereby the transistor <b>120</b> is turned on. Consequently, the potential of the third wiring (a potential of new data) is applied to the node FG, and the predetermined amount of charge is accumulated in the node FG After that, the potential of the fourth wiring is set to a potential at which the transistor <b>120</b> is turned off, whereby the transistor <b>120</b> is turned off. Thus, charge of the new data is held in the node FG In other words, while the predetermined amount of charge given in the first writing is held in the node FG the same operation (a second writing) as that in the first writing is performed, whereby the stored data can be overwritten.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0311">The off current of the transistor <b>120</b> described in this embodiment can be sufficiently reduced by using the highly-purified, and intrinsic oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b>. In addition, the oxide semiconductor film <b>108</b> contains excessive oxygen, whereby variation in the electrical characteristics of the transistor <b>120</b> is suppressed, so that the transistor which is electrically stable can be obtained. Further, with the use of such a transistor, a highly-reliable semiconductor device capable of holding stored data for an extremely long time can be obtained.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0312">In the semiconductor device described in this embodiment, the transistor <b>240</b> and the transistor <b>120</b> overlap with each other; therefore, a semiconductor device whose integration degree is sufficiently improved can be realized.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0327">In this embodiment, the transistor described in any of Embodiments 1 to 3 can be applied to the transistor <b>4010</b> and the transistor <b>4011</b>. Variation in electrical characteristics of the transistor <b>4010</b> and the transistor <b>4011</b> is suppressed and the transistor <b>4010</b> and the transistor <b>4011</b> are electrically stable. Therefore, highly-reliable semiconductor devices can be provided as the semiconductor devices illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0328">The transistor <b>4010</b> provided in the pixel portion <b>4002</b> is electrically connected to a display element in a display panel. A variety of display elements can be used as the display element as long as display can be performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0329">Note that an example of a liquid crystal display device using a liquid crystal element as a display element is described in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a liquid crystal element <b>4013</b> which is a display element includes the first electrode layer <b>4030</b>, the second electrode layer <b>4031</b>, and a liquid crystal layer <b>4008</b>. An insulating film <b>4032</b> and an insulating film <b>4033</b> which serve as alignment films are provided so that the liquid crystal layer <b>4008</b> is provided therebetween. The second electrode layer <b>4031</b> is provided on the second substrate <b>4006</b> side, and the first electrode layer <b>4030</b> and the second electrode layer <b>4031</b> are stacked with the liquid crystal layer <b>4008</b> provided therebetween.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0330">A spacer <b>4035</b> is a columnar spacer obtained by selective etching of an insulating film and is provided in order to control the thickness (a cell gap) of the liquid crystal layer <b>4008</b>. Note that the spacer is not limited to a columnar spacer, and, for example, a spherical spacer may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0331">In the case where a liquid crystal element is used as the display element, a thermotropic liquid crystal, a low-molecular liquid crystal, a high-molecular liquid crystal, a polymer dispersed liquid crystal, a ferroelectric liquid crystal, an anti-ferroelectric liquid crystal, or the like can be used. Such a liquid crystal material exhibits a cholesteric phase, a smectic phase, a cubic phase, a chiral nematic phase, an isotropic phase, or the like depending on conditions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0332">Alternatively, liquid crystal exhibiting a blue phase for which an alignment film is unnecessary may be used. A blue phase is one of liquid crystal phases, which appears just before a cholesteric phase changes into an isotropic phase while temperature of cholesteric liquid crystal is increased. Since the blue phase appears only in a narrow temperature range, a liquid crystal composition in which several weight percent or more of a chiral material is mixed is used for the liquid crystal layer in order to improve the temperature range. The liquid crystal composition which includes a liquid crystal exhibiting a blue phase and a chiral agent has a short response time of 1 msec or less, has optical isotropy, which makes the alignment process unneeded, and has a small viewing angle dependence. In addition, since an alignment film need not be provided and rubbing treatment is unnecessary, electrostatic discharge damage caused by the rubbing treatment can be prevented and defects and damage of the liquid crystal display device can be reduced in the manufacturing process. Thus, productivity of the liquid crystal display device can be increased.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0333">The specific resistivity of the liquid crystal material is 1×10<sup>9 </sup>Ω·cm or more, preferably 1×10<sup>11 </sup>Ω·cm or more, more preferably 1×10<sup>12 </sup>Ω·cm or more. The value of the specific resistivity in this specification is measured at 20° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0334">The size of a storage capacitor formed in the liquid crystal display device is set considering the leakage current of the transistor provided in the pixel portion or the like so that charge can be held for a predetermined period. By using the transistor including the highly-purified oxide semiconductor film, it is enough to provide a storage capacitor having a capacitance that is ⅓ or less, preferably ⅕ or less of a liquid crystal capacitance of each pixel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0335">In the transistor used in this embodiment, which includes the highly-purified oxide semiconductor film, the current in an off state (the off current) can be made small. Accordingly, an electrical signal such as an image signal can be held for a long period, and a writing interval can be set long in a state where power is being supplied. Accordingly, the frequency of refresh operation can be reduced, which leads to an effect of suppressing power consumption.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0336">In addition, the transistor including the highly-purified oxide semiconductor film used in this embodiment can have relatively high field-effect mobility and thus is capable of high speed operation. Therefore, by using the transistor in the pixel portion of the liquid crystal display device, a high-quality image can be provided. In addition, since the transistors can be separately provided in a driver circuit portion and a pixel portion over one substrate, the number of components of the liquid crystal display device can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0337">For the liquid crystal display device, a twisted nematic (TN) mode, an in-plane-switching (IPS) mode, a fringe field switching (FFS) mode, an axially symmetric aligned micro-cell (ASM) mode, an optical compensated birefringence (OCB) mode, a ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) mode, an antiferroelectric liquid crystal (AFLC) mode, or the like can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0338">A normally black liquid crystal display device such as a transmissive liquid crystal display device utilizing a vertical alignment (VA) mode may be used. The vertical alignment mode is a method of controlling alignment of liquid crystal molecules of a liquid crystal display panel, in which liquid crystal molecules are aligned vertically to a panel surface when no voltage is applied. Some examples are given as the vertical alignment mode. For example, a multi-domain vertical alignment (MVA) mode, a patterned vertical alignment (PVA) mode, an advanced super view (ASV) mode, or the like can be used. Moreover, it is possible to use a method called domain multiplication or multi-domain design, in which a pixel is divided into some regions (subpixels) and molecules are aligned in different directions in their respective regions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0339">In the display device, a black matrix (a light-blocking layer), an optical member (an optical substrate) such as a polarizing member, a retardation member, or an anti-reflection member, and the like are provided as appropriate. For example, circular polarization may be obtained by using a polarizing substrate and a retardation substrate. In addition, a backlight, a side light, or the like may be used as a light source.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0340">In addition, it is possible to employ a time-division display method (also called a field-sequential driving method) with the use of a plurality of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as a backlight. By employing a field-sequential driving method, color display can be performed without using a color filter.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0341">As a display method in the pixel portion, a progressive method, an interlace method or the like can be employed. Further, color elements controlled in a pixel at the time of color display are not limited to three colors of R, G, and B (R, G, and B correspond to red, green, and blue, respectively). For example, the following can be used: R, G, B, and W (W corresponds to white); or R, G, B, and one or more of yellow, cyan, magenta, and the like. Further, the sizes of display regions may be different between respective dots of the color elements. The present invention is not limited to the application to a display device for color display but can also be applied to a display device for monochrome display.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0342">Alternatively, as the display element included in the display device, a light-emitting element utilizing electroluminescence can be used. Light-emitting elements utilizing electroluminescence are classified according to whether a light-emitting material is an organic compound or an inorganic compound. In general, the former is referred to as an organic EL element, and the latter is referred to as an inorganic EL element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0343">In an organic EL element, by application of voltage to a light-emitting element, electrons and holes are injected from a pair of electrodes into a layer containing a light-emitting organic compound, and current flows. The carriers (electrons and holes) are recombined, and thus, the light-emitting organic compound is excited. The light-emitting organic compound returns to a ground state from the excited state, thereby emitting light. Owing to such a mechanism, this light-emitting element is referred to as a current-excitation light-emitting element.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0344">The inorganic EL elements are classified according to their element structures into a dispersion-type inorganic EL element and a thin-film inorganic EL element. A dispersion-type inorganic EL element has a light-emitting layer where particles of a light-emitting material are dispersed in a binder, and its light emission mechanism is donor-acceptor recombination type light emission that utilizes a donor level and an acceptor level. A thin-film inorganic EL element has a structure where a light-emitting layer is sandwiched between dielectric layers, which are further sandwiched between electrodes, and its light emission mechanism is localized type light emission that utilizes inner-shell electron transition of metal ions. Note that an example of an organic EL element as a light-emitting element is described here.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0345">In order to extract light emitted from the light-emitting element, at least one of a pair of electrodes is transparent. The transistor and the light-emitting element are provided over the substrate. The light-emitting element can have any of the following structures: a top emission structure in which light emission is extracted through the surface opposite to the substrate; a bottom emission structure in which light emission is extracted through the surface on the substrate side; and a dual emission structure in which light emission is extracted through the surface opposite to the substrate and the surface on the substrate side.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0346">An example of a light-emitting device in which a light-emitting element is used as a display element is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. A light-emitting element <b>4513</b> which is a display element is electrically connected to the transistor <b>4010</b> provided in the pixel portion <b>4002</b>. A structure of the light-emitting element <b>4513</b> is not limited to the stacked-layer structure including the first electrode layer <b>4030</b>, an electroluminescent layer <b>4511</b>, and the second electrode layer <b>4031</b>, which is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The structure of the light-emitting element <b>4513</b> can be changed as appropriate depending on a direction in which light is extracted from the light-emitting element <b>4513</b>, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0347">A partition wall <b>4510</b> is formed using an organic insulating material or an inorganic insulating material. It is particularly preferable that the partition wall <b>4510</b> be formed using a photosensitive resin material to have an opening over the first electrode layer <b>4030</b> so that a sidewall of the opening is formed as a tilted surface with continuous curvature.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0348">The electroluminescent layer <b>4511</b> may be formed using a single layer or a plurality of layers stacked.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0349">A protective film may be formed over the second electrode layer <b>4031</b> and the partition wall <b>4510</b> in order to prevent entry of oxygen, hydrogen, moisture, carbon dioxide, or the like into the light-emitting element <b>4513</b>. As the protective film, a silicon nitride film, a silicon nitride oxide film, a diamond like carbon (DLC) film, or the like can be formed. In addition, in a space which is formed with the first substrate <b>4001</b>, the second substrate <b>4006</b>, and the sealant <b>4005</b>, a filler <b>4514</b> is provided for sealing. It is preferable that a panel be packaged (sealed) with a protective film (such as a laminate film or an ultraviolet curable resin film) or a cover material with high air-tightness and little degasification so that the panel is not exposed to the outside air, in this manner.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0350">As the filler <b>4514</b>, an ultraviolet curable resin or a thermosetting resin can be used as well as an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon. For example, PVC (poly(vinyl chloride)), an acrylic resin, a polyimide, an epoxy resin, a silicone resin, PVB (poly(vinyl butyral)), or EVA (ethylene vinyl acetate) can be used. For example, nitrogen is used for the filler.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0351">In addition, if needed, an optical film, such as a polarizing plate, a circularly polarizing plate (including an elliptically polarizing plate), a retardation plate (a quarter-wave plate or a half-wave plate), or a color filter, may be provided as appropriate for a light-emitting surface of the light-emitting element. Further, the polarizing plate or the circularly polarizing plate may be provided with an anti-reflection film For example, anti-glare treatment by which reflected light can be diffused by projections and depressions on the surface so as to reduce the glare can be performed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0352">Further, an electronic paper in which electronic ink is driven can be provided as the display device. The electronic paper is also called an electrophoretic display device (electrophoretic display) and has advantages in that it has the same level of readability as regular paper, it has less power consumption than other display devices, and it can be set to have a thin and light form.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0353">An electrophoretic display device can have various modes. An electrophoretic display device contains a plurality of microcapsules dispersed in a solvent, each microcapsule containing first particles which are positively charged and second particles which are negatively charged. By applying an electric field to the microcapsules, the particles in the microcapsules move in opposite directions to each other and only the color of the particles gathering on one side is displayed. Note that the first particles and the second particles each contain pigment and do not move without an electric field. Moreover, the first particles and the second particles have different colors (which may be colorless).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0354">Thus, an electrophoretic display device is a display device that utilizes a so-called dielectrophoretic effect by which a substance having a high dielectric constant moves to a high-electric field region.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0355">A mixture in which the above microcapsules are dispersed in a solvent is referred to as electronic ink. This electronic ink can be printed on a surface of glass, plastic, cloth, paper, or the like. Furthermore, by using a color filter or particles that have a pigment, color display can also be achieved.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0356">Note that the first particles and the second particles in the microcapsules may each be formed of a single material selected from a conductive material, an insulating material, a semiconductor material, a magnetic material, a liquid crystal material, a ferroelectric material, an electroluminescent material, an electrochromic material, and a magnetophoretic material, or formed of a composite material of any of these.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0357">As the electronic paper, a display device using a twisting ball display system can be also used. The twisting ball display system refers to a method in which spherical particles each colored in black and white are arranged between a first electrode layer and a second electrode layer which are electrode layers used for a display element, and a potential difference is generated between the first electrode layer and the second electrode layer to control orientation of the spherical particles, so that display is performed.</div>

In addition, a sheet with a structure in which an aluminum foil is sandwiched between PVF films or polyester films can be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0361">The insulating layer <b>4021</b> can be formed using an inorganic insulating material or an organic insulating material. Note that the insulating layer <b>4021</b> formed using a heat-resistant organic insulating material such as an acrylic resin, a polyimide, a benzocyclobutene-based resin, a polyamide, or an epoxy resin is preferably used as a planarizing insulating film In addition to such organic insulating materials, it is possible to use a low-dielectric constant material (a low-k material), a siloxane based resin, phosphosilicate glass (PSG), borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG), or the like.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0363">The display device displays an image by transmitting light from a light source or a display element. Therefore, the substrate and the thin films such as the insulating film and the conductive film provided for the pixel portion where light is transmitted have light-transmitting properties with respect to light in the visible-light wavelength range.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0383">The microcrystalline semiconductor belongs to a metastable state of an intermediate between amorphous and single crystalline when Gibbs free energy is considered. That is, the microcrystalline semiconductor is a semiconductor having a third state which is thermodynamically stable and has a short range order and lattice distortion. Columnar-like or needle-like crystals grow in a normal direction with respect to a substrate surface. The Raman spectrum of microcrystalline silicon, which is a typical example of a microcrystalline semiconductor, is located in lower wavenumber than 520 cm<sup>−1</sup>, which represents a peak of the Raman spectrum of single crystal silicon. That is, the peak of the Raman spectrum of the microcrystalline silicon exists between 520 cm<sup>−1 </sup>which represents single crystal silicon and 480 cm<sup>−1 </sup>which represents amorphous silicon. The semiconductor contains hydrogen or halogen of at least 1 at. % to terminate a dangling bond. Moreover, microcrystalline silicon is made to contain a rare gas element such as helium, neon, argon, or krypton to further enhance lattice distortion, whereby stability is increased and a favorable microcrystalline semiconductor film can be obtained.</div>

Further, a hydrocarbon gas such as CH<sub>4 </sub>or C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, a germanium gas such as GeH<sub>4 </sub>or GeF<sub>4</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, or the like may be mixed into the gas containing silicon.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0385">In addition, since the mobility of holes generated by a photoelectric effect is lower than that of electrons, a pin photodiode exhibits better characteristics when a surface on the p-type semiconductor layer side is used as a light-receiving plane. Here, an example in which light <b>622</b> received by the photodiode <b>602</b> from a surface of the substrate <b>601</b>, over which the pin photodiode is formed, is converted into electric signals will be described. Further, light from the semiconductor layer having a conductivity type opposite from that of the semiconductor layer on the light-receiving plane is disturbance light; therefore, the electrode layer <b>642</b> on the semiconductor layer having the opposite conductivity type is preferably formed from a light-blocking conductive film. Note that a surface of the n-type semiconductor layer side can alternatively be used as the light-receiving plane.</div>
