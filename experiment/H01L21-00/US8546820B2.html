<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">This is a continuation application of PCT Application No. PCT/JP09/007118 filed Dec. 22, 2009, designating the United States of America, the disclosure of which, including the specification, drawings and claims, is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</div>
<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The present invention relates to a display device and a manufacturing method thereof, and in particular to a display device provided with an organic light emitting layer and a manufacturing method thereof.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">In recent years, progress has been made in the research and development of display devices that use the phenomenon of electroluminescence occurring in organic material. Each light emitting cell of such a display device is composed of an anode and a cathode with an organic light emitting layer therebetween. When the display device is driven, light is produced when holes and electrons recombine within the organic light emitting layer after injecting holes through the anode and injecting electrons through the cathode.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Banks composed of insulating material partition the organic light emitting layer of adjacent light emitting cells. The organic light emitting layer is formed by dripping ink that includes organic light emitting material into each region partitioned by the banks and drying the ink.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">Maintaining a uniform film thickness in the organic light emitting layer formed in this way, however, is problematic.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">To even out the film thickness of the organic light emitting layer, Patent Literature 1 for example recites an invention to provide a convexity on the inner surface of the bank in order to control the pinning location of the ink. In other words, using the technology suggested in Patent Literature 1, the pinning location when ink is dripped in one light emitting cell can be set to the convexity. To a certain degree, uniform film thickness can thus be guaranteed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">3. Patent Literatures</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2007-311235</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">It is considered difficult, however, to use the technology suggested in Patent Literature 1 over the entire panel of a display device (central region, peripheral region) to form a minute convexity on the inner surface of the bank to a high degree of precision in accordance with each panel region. Therefore, it is not easy to maintain the organic light emitting layer at a uniform film thickness over the entire panel of a display device (central region, peripheral region).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">It is an object of the present invention to solve the above problems by providing a display device, and a manufacturing method thereof, that has a uniform film thickness in the organic light emitting layer in the light emitting cells at the peripheral region of the panel and that has an even luminance within the panel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">In order to solve the above problems, a display device according to an aspect of the present invention has the following structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">A display device according to one aspect of the present invention comprises an array of a plurality of light emitting cells. The light emitting cells are composed of a first electrode, a second electrode, and an organic light emitting layer located between the first electrode and the second electrode. In the display device according to an aspect of the present invention, a plurality of banks is arranged above the first electrode so as to partition the organic light emitting layer into the light emitting cells. The light emitting cells include a peripheral light emitting cell located in a peripheral region of the array (peripheral region of the panel), and the banks include a first bank and a second bank that border the peripheral light emitting cell, the first bank bordering (i.e. being adjacent to) the peripheral light emitting cell on the side of the periphery of the array, and the second bank bordering (i.e. being adjacent to) the peripheral light emitting cell on the side of the center of the array.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">In the display device according to one aspect of the present invention, in the above structure, an inclination angle of a side wall facing the peripheral light emitting cell in the first bank is larger than an inclination angle of a side wall facing the peripheral light emitting cell in the second bank.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">In the display device according to an aspect of the present invention, an inclination angle of a side wall facing a peripheral light emitting cell in a first bank (hereinafter referred to as “first side wall” for the sake of simplicity) differs from an inclination angle of a side wall facing a peripheral light emitting cell in a second bank (hereinafter referred to as “second side wall” for the sake of simplicity). Therefore, when ink is dripped during manufacturing, a pinning location of the ink on the first side wall becomes higher than a pinning location of the ink on the second side wall.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">The film thickness of the organic light emitting layer after drying tends to establish an inverse relationship with the relative size of the inclination angle of the side wall of the bank. Therefore, the film thickness at the location corresponding to the first side wall tends to become thinner than at the location corresponding to the second side wall. Accordingly, in a display device according to an aspect of the present invention, even if a vapor stream is produced during drying, making the film thickness at the first side wall tend to become thicker, the reduction in film thickness due to making the inclination angle of the first side wall larger offsets this tendency. Therefore, it is possible to make the film shape of the organic light emitting layer in the peripheral light emitting cell uniform.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">Accordingly, in the display device according to an aspect of the present invention, the film shape of the organic light emitting layer in the light emitting cell located at the peripheral region of the panel can be made uniform, and luminance can be made even.</div>

<heading>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">A display device according to one aspect of the present invention comprises an array of a plurality of light emitting cells. The light emitting cells are composed of a first electrode, a second electrode, and an organic light emitting layer located between the first electrode and the second electrode. In the display device according to an aspect of the present invention, a plurality of banks is arranged above the first electrode so as to partition the organic light emitting layer into the light emitting cells. the light emitting cells include a peripheral light emitting cell located in a peripheral region of the array, and the banks include a first bank and a second bank that border the peripheral light emitting cell, the first bank being closer to a periphery of the array, and the second bank being closer to a center of the array.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">In the display device according to one aspect of the present invention, in the above structure, an inclination angle of the first side wall is larger than an inclination angle of the second side wall.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">In the display device according to one aspect of the present invention, since the inclination angle of the first side wall is larger than an inclination angle of the second side wall, when ink is dripped during manufacturing, a pinning location of the ink on the first side wall becomes higher than a pinning location of the ink on the second side wall. Specifically, the pinning location on the first wall with a larger inclination angle is higher than the pinning location on the second wall with a smaller inclination angle. The film thickness of the organic light emitting layer after drying has an inverse relationship with the size of the inclination angle of the side wall of the bank. Therefore, the film thickness at the first side wall tends to be smaller than at the second side wall.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">This reduction in film thickness accompanying the change in pinning location by making the inclination angle of the first side wall larger than the inclination angle of the second side wall offsets an increase in film thickness where solvent flows to minimize surface free energy during drying. Therefore, the film shape of the entire peripheral light emitting cell can be made even. Accordingly, in the display device according to an aspect of the present invention, the film thickness of the organic light emitting layer in a peripheral light emitting cell can be made uniform and luminance made even by making the inclination angle of the first side wall larger than the inclination angle of the second side wall in the peripheral light emitting cell.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">The main characteristic of a display device according to an aspect of the present invention is that, by making the inclination angle of the first side wall larger than the inclination angle of the second side wall, a pinning location of the organic light emitting layer in the peripheral light emitting cell becomes higher on the first side wall than on the second side wall. Based on this characteristic, the display device according to an aspect of the present invention has the above effects.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">In the display device according to one aspect of the present invention, in the above structure, the inclination angle of the first side wall may be in a range between 35° and 40° inclusive, and the inclination angle of the second side wall may be in a range between 25° and 30° inclusive. By forming the first side wall and the second side wall with these ranges of inclination angles, the film thickness (film shape) of the organic light emitting layer throughout each peripheral light emitting cell can be reliably made uniform.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">In the display device according to one aspect of the present invention, in the above structure, a central light emitting cell located in the central region of the light emitting cell array may be further considered. In this case, the banks include a third bank and a fourth bank that border the central light emitting cell, the third bank being closer to the periphery of the array, and the fourth bank being closer to the center of the array. In the above structure, an inclination angle of a side wall facing the central light emitting cell in the third bank (hereinafter referred to as “third side wall” for the sake of simplicity) may be equivalent to an inclination angle of a side wall facing the central light emitting cell in the fourth bank (hereinafter referred to as “fourth side wall” for the sake of simplicity).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>, in the central region of the panel (central region of the light emitting cell array), the film thickness of the organic light emitting layer <b>906</b> in the central light emitting cell does not differ greatly at the left and right banks. Therefore, by making the inclination angles of the third side wall and the fourth side wall equivalent, the film thickness of the organic light emitting layer throughout the central light emitting cell can be maintained uniform.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">Note that the term “equivalent” above does not mean exact mathematical equivalence, but rather takes factors such as tolerance when manufacturing the display device into account. Specifically, the term “equivalent” refers to making the inclination angles of the third side wall and fourth side wall equivalent within the range permitted in practice by the difference in luminous efficiency (uneven luminance) between the light emitting cells throughout the panel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">In the display device according to one aspect of the present invention, in the above structure, the inclination angle of the third side wall and the inclination angle of the fourth side wall may be in a range between 25° and 30° inclusive. By forming the third side wall and the fourth side wall with this range of inclination angle, the film thickness in the organic light emitting layer in the central light emitting cells can be made uniform throughout.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">In the above structures, the “inclination angle” is an angle formed by a side wall of the bank and an upper surface of an underlayer on which the bank is provided (the underlayer corresponding to the first electrode, hole injection layer, hole transporting layer, or hole injection transporting layer).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">A manufacturing method of a display device according to an aspect of the present invention is for manufacturing a display device comprising an array of a plurality of light emitting cells, the manufacturing method comprising the following steps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">(Step 1) forming, above a substrate, a functional layer that includes a plurality of first electrodes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">(Step 2) layering photoresist material above the functional layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">(Step 3) forming a plurality of openings corresponding to a plurality of light emitting cells via mask exposure and patterning of the photoresist material, and forming a plurality of banks that partition regions between adjacent openings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">(Step 4) forming an organic light emitting layer by dripping ink that includes organic light emitting material through each of the openings and drying the ink.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">(Step 5) forming a plurality of second electrodes above the organic light emitting layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">Furthermore, in the manufacturing method of a display device according to one aspect of the present invention, the openings include a peripheral opening located in a peripheral region of the array, and the banks include a first bank and a second bank that border a region of the array corresponding to the peripheral opening, the first bank being closer to a periphery of the array, and the second bank being closer to a center of the array.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">Also, in the third step, the first bank and the second bank are formed so that an inclination angle of a side wall facing the peripheral opening in the first bank (hereinafter referred to as “first side wall” for the sake of simplicity) is larger than an inclination angle of a side wall facing the peripheral opening in the second bank (hereinafter referred to as “second side wall” for the sake of simplicity).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">This manufacturing method can be used to manufacture a display device in which the first side wall has a larger inclination angle than the second side wall. In a display device manufactured using this method, as described above, a pinning location when ink is dripped during manufacturing into the peripheral opening is higher at the first side wall than the second side wall. Due to the relationship between pinning location and film thickness described above, the film thickness of the organic light emitting layer becomes uniform, and luminance is made even.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">Accordingly, the manufacturing method of a display device according to an aspect of the present invention can be used to manufacture a display device that has a uniform film thickness in the organic light emitting layer in light emitting cells at the peripheral region of the panel (peripheral region of the light emitting cell array) and that has an even luminance within the panel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">In the manufacturing method of a display device according to one aspect of the present invention, in the above structure, the openings include a central opening located in a central region of the array, and the banks include a third bank and a fourth bank that border a region of the array corresponding to the central opening, the third bank being closer to the periphery of the array, and the fourth bank being closer to the center of the array. In the manufacturing method of a display device according to one aspect of the present invention, in the above structure, when performing the third step, the third bank and the fourth bank may be formed so that a side wall facing the central opening in the third bank (hereinafter referred to as “third side wall” for the sake of simplicity) and a side wall facing the central opening in the fourth bank (hereinafter referred to as “fourth side wall” for the sake of simplicity) have equivalent inclination angles.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">By adopting this structure, the film thickness of the organic light emitting layer at sections corresponding to the third side wall and the fourth side wall can be maintained uniform, making it possible to improve uniformity of the organic light emitting layer at the central opening.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">Note that the meaning of “equivalent” is the same as above.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">As described above, in the manufacturing method of a display device according to one aspect of the present invention, when forming the openings and the banks, by forming the first bank and the second bank so that the inclination angle of the first side wall is larger than the inclination angle of the second side wall, when forming the organic light emitting layer, a pinning location of the ink dripped into the peripheral opening is set higher on the first side wall than on the second side wall, resulting in uniform film thickness in the organic light emitting layer after drying. Accordingly, the manufacturing method according to an aspect of the present invention can be used to reduce variation in the shape of the organic light emitting layer between light emitting cells and to manufacture a display device that has an even luminance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">In the manufacturing method of a display device according to one aspect of the present invention, in the above structure, when performing the third step, the inclination angle of the first side wall may be made larger than the inclination angle of the second side wall by varying, during exposure of the photoresist material, an exposure amount in a section corresponding to the first side wall and an exposure amount in a section corresponding to the second side wall. Specifically, by making the exposure amount in the section corresponding to the first side wall larger than the exposure amount in the section corresponding to the second side wall, the inclination angle of the first side wall can be made larger than the inclination angle of the second side wall.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">In the manufacturing method of a display device according to one aspect of the present invention, in the above structure, when performing the third step, the inclination angle of the first side wall may be made larger than the inclination angle of the second side wall by using, during exposure of the photoresist material, a mask in which a degree of transparency in a section corresponding to the first side wall and a degree of transparency in a section corresponding to the second side wall differ. Accordingly, the inclination angle of the first side wall becomes larger than the inclination angle of the second side wall, making it possible to manufacture a display device with little variety in luminance across the panel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">Specifically, the degree of transparency in the mask may be larger in the section corresponding to the first side wall than in the section corresponding to the second side wall.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067">In the manufacturing method of a display device according to one aspect of the present invention, when performing the third step, after exposing and developing the photoresist material in a section corresponding to the first side wall and a section corresponding to the second side wall, the photoresist material in one of the sections may be additionally exposed. This method may also be adopted to form the first bank and the second bank so that the inclination angle of the first side wall is larger than the inclination angle of the second side wall. Specifically, when performing the third step, the section corresponding to the first side wall may be additionally exposed. In this way, the inclination angle of the first side wall can be made larger than the inclination angle of the second side wall.</div>
<heading>Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068">The following describes an example of an embodiment of the present invention with reference to the drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">Note that the following Embodiment is simply an example to clearly illustrate a structure of the present invention and the effects and advantages thereof. The present invention is in no way limited to the following Embodiment except in its essential characteristic elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0007">(Process by which the Embodiment According to the Present Invention was Achieved)</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0070">As a result of intense study, the inventor of the present invention discovered the following with regard to the organic light emitting display device recited in the Background Art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">Normally, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>, an organic light emitting layer <b>906</b> <i>a</i>, <b>906</b> <i>c </i>is formed between banks <b>905</b> provided above a substrate <b>901</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0072">The inventor determined that in this case, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>, the organic light emitting layer <b>906</b> <i>c </i>at the light emitting cell at the peripheral region of the panel tends to have a less uniform film thickness than the organic light emitting layer <b>906</b> <i>a </i>at the light emitting cell in the central region of the panel (as shown by the lines with alternate long and two short dashes D<sub>1 </sub>and D<sub>2 </sub>in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>). Specifically, in the light emitting cell located at the peripheral region of the panel, the surface of the organic light emitting layer becomes higher as it approaches the outer periphery of the panel. Note that, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref>, the horizontal axis indicates distance from the outer periphery, and the vertical axis indicates the degree of deviance of the film thickness.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0073">After repeated examination of the above phenomenon, the inventor determined that reduction in uniformity of film thickness in the organic light emitting layer causes a non-uniform vapor concentration distribution during ink drying, as described below. Specifically, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the vapor concentration near the light emitting cells <b>900</b> <i>b </i>and <b>900</b> <i>c </i>located at the peripheral region of the panel is lower than the vapor concentration near the light emitting cell <b>900</b> <i>a </i>located at the central region of the panel. This unevenness in the vapor concentration distribution causes the evaporation rate of solvent from ink dripped in the light emitting cells <b>900</b> <i>b </i>and <b>900</b> <i>c </i>in the peripheral region of the panel to become non-uniform (see the lines with alternate long and two short dashes in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0074">By contrast, the evaporation rate of solvent from ink dripped in the light emitting cell <b>900</b> <i>a </i>at the central region of the panel is roughly uniform.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0075">However, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>, solvent in the ink <b>9061</b> <i>c </i>flows during drying as shown by the solid arrow. This is because solvent flows to compensate for solvent that has evaporated (i.e. flows to minimize surface free energy), and along with the flow of the solvent, the solute (organic light emitting material) also flows. Therefore, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19C</figref>, in a light emitting cell at the peripheral region of the panel, an organic light emitting layer <b>906</b> <i>c </i>with a surface profile L<sub>2 </sub>that swells up towards the exterior forms.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0076">The inventor therefore deduced that, in an organic light emitting display device, uniformity of film thickness of the organic light emitting layer decreases due to non-uniformity of vapor concentration distribution during ink drying in the peripheral region and central region of a panel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0077">The inventor also discovered technology to vary, within the panel, the pinning location of ink on a bank side wall by varying the inclination angle of the bank side wall, which improves uniformity of film thickness in the organic light emitting layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0008">1. Configuration of Display Device <b>1</b> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0078">The overall structure of the display device <b>1</b> according to the present Embodiment is described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</div>

An organic light emitting layer <b>106</b> is formed in the region in each light emitting cell <b>100</b> partitioned by the banks <b>105</b>, and an electron injection layer <b>107</b>, cathode <b>108</b>, and passivation layer <b>109</b> are layered above the organic light emitting layer <b>106</b> in this order.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0010">a) Substrate <b>101</b> </div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0088">d) Hole Injection Transporting Layer <b>104</b> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0089">The hole injection transporting layer <b>104</b> is a layer of an oxide such as silver (Ag), molybdenum (Mo), chromium (Cr), vanadium (V), tungsten (W), nickel (Ni), iridium (Ir), etc. A hole injection transporting layer <b>104</b> formed from such a metal oxide has the function of assisting with hole generation and of injecting and transporting holes stably into the organic light emitting layer <b>106</b>. The hole injection transporting layer <b>104</b> has a high work function.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0090">When the hole injection transporting layer <b>104</b> is formed from an oxide of a transition metal, a plurality of levels can be occupied since there are a plurality of oxidation numbers. This makes hole injection easy and allows for reduction of driving voltage.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0091">Note that in addition to forming the hole injection transporting layer <b>104</b> with the above-described metal oxides, PEDOT (an amalgam of polythiophene and polystyrene sulfonic acid) or the like may also be used.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0093">Furthermore, since the banks <b>105</b> are etched and baked when formed, it is preferable that the banks be formed from highly resistant material that will not change in shape or quality during the etching and baking processes. To provide the banks with liquid repellency, the side walls can be fluoridated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0094">Note that as the insulating material used in forming the banks <b>105</b>, any liquid repellent material with a resistivity of 10<sup>5</sup>Ω·cm can be used, starting with the above materials. Using a material with a resistivity of less than 10<sup>5</sup>Ω·cm leads to production of leak current between the anode <b>102</b> and the cathode <b>108</b>, or between adjacent light emitting cells <b>100</b>, which causes a variety of problems such as increased power consumption.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0095">Furthermore, if a hydrophilic material is used to form the banks <b>105</b>, the difference in affinity/liquid repellency between the side wall of the banks <b>105</b> and the surface of the hole injection transporting layer <b>104</b> becomes small, and it thus becomes difficult to selectively maintain the ink, which includes an organic substance for forming the organic light emitting layer <b>106</b>, at the opening of the banks <b>105</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0096">The structure of the banks <b>105</b> need not be a single layer as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, but may adopt a two or more layered structure.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0025">[Verification of Manufacturing Method]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0151">Using a concrete example, the shape of the banks after formation was verified for the manufacturing method according to the above Embodiment and Modifications 1 and 2. The results are described with reference to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0152">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, as the exposure amount increases, the inclination angle of the side wall of the bank that is formed becomes larger. Specifically, when exposure and development take place with an exposure amount of 200 mJ, the inclination angle of the side wall of the bank that is formed is 23°, whereas when exposure and development take place with an exposure amount of 300 mJ, the inclination angle of the side wall of the bank that is formed is 38°. This result was also shown by the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0153">Furthermore, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref>, after light exposure and development take place for the first time with an exposure amount of 200 mJ and subsequently for the second time with an exposure amount of 100 mJ, the inclination angle of the side wall of the bank that is formed is 50°. This corresponds to the manufacturing method according to Modification 2 and is considered to be effective for creating a large inclination angle of the bank side wall.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0154">Note that in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>, the horizontal axis represents the horizontal direction, and the vertical axis represents the direction of height.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="h-0026">[Other Considerations]</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0155">In the above Embodiment and Modifications 1 and 2, structures were adopted by way of example in order to clearly illustrate a structure of the present invention and the effects and advantages thereof. Except for its essential elements, the present invention is not limited to the above structures. For example, in the above Embodiment, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a structure was adopted by way of example in which anodes <b>102</b> are located below the organic light emitting layer <b>106</b> in the direction of the Z axis. The present invention is not limited, however, to this structure; a structure may be adopted in which cathodes <b>108</b> are located below the organic light emitting layer <b>106</b> in the direction of the Z axis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0156">In the case in which cathodes <b>108</b> are located below the organic light emitting layer <b>106</b> in the direction of the Z axis, since the panel is a top-emission structure, a structure is adopted in which the cathodes <b>108</b> are a reflecting electrode layer, above which the electrode coating layer <b>103</b> is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0157">In the above Embodiment and Modifications, a specific example of the appearance of the display device <b>1</b> is not shown. The display device <b>1</b> may be part of a system as shown, for example, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. Note that an organic EL display device does not require a backlight, as does a liquid crystal display device, and is therefore suitable for producing a thinner display, a superior characteristic from the perspective of system design.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0158">Also, in the above Embodiment and Modifications 1 and 2, a so-called line bank structure is adopted as the shape of the banks <b>105</b>, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. However, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, a “pixel bank” <b>305</b> may be adopted in the structure of a display panel <b>30</b>, the pixel bank <b>305</b> being formed by bank elements <b>305</b> <i>a </i>that extend in the direction of the Y axis and bank elements <b>305</b> <i>b </i>that extend in the direction of the X axis.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0159">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, when using the pixel bank <b>305</b>, the same advantageous effects as above can be achieved by enlarging the inclination angle of the side walls on each side in the directions of the X axis and the Y axis of the light emitting cell <b>300</b> at the peripheral region of the panel. Specifically, in the light emitting cell that is located at the corner of the peripheral region of the panel and has side walls indicated by arrows B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b>, B<b>3</b>, and B<b>4</b>, the inclination angle of the side walls indicated by the arrows B<b>1</b> and B<b>3</b> should be made larger than the inclination angle of the side walls indicated by the arrows B<b>2</b> and B<b>4</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0160">In the above Embodiment and Modifications 1 and 2, the inclination angle of the side walls of the banks at the peripheral region of the panel are made larger than the inclination angle of the side walls of the banks at the central region of the panel. However, this relationship may be varied according to the flow of vapor (vapor concentration) during the drying process in the formation of the organic light emitting layer at the time of manufacturing. For example, if the flow of vapor during drying of the ink is from the outer periphery of the panel towards the central region of the panel due to some factor such as the structure of the drying device, then the inclination angle of the bank side walls may be made larger at locations where the film thickness of the organic light emitting layer becomes thicker. The film thickness of the organic light emitting layer can thus be made uniform, which has the advantageous effect of making luminance more even throughout the panel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0161">While no distinction is made between the luminescent colors (red, green, blue) of the light emitting cells in the above Embodiment and in Modifications 1 and 2, the characteristics of the ink included in the organic light emitting material change according to luminescent color. The inclination angle of the corresponding bank side wall can be specified in accordance with the ink characteristics of each luminescent color.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0162">The region in which the inclination angle of the bank side wall is increased may be varied according to the manufacturing process, panel size, etc. It is considered preferable, however, for this region to encompass light emitting cells located, for example, in a range of 0.5% to a few percentage points (e.g. 1%) of the peripheral region of the panel. This range is based on a consideration of variety in film thickness of the organic light emitting layer in a display device according to conventional technology.</div>
<heading>INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0163">The present invention is useful for achieving a display device that exhibits even luminance and is capable of high image quality.</div>
