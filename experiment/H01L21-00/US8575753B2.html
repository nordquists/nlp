In an exemplary embodiment, a conductive pattern may be positioned on the substrate <b>50</b> such that the opening <b>54</b> may expose the conductive pattern on the substrate <b>50</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0090">In an exemplary embodiment, the opening <b>54</b> may have a shape of a contact hole. However, the structure of the opening <b>54</b> may vary in accordance with the configuration of the conductive structure. That is, the opening <b>54</b> may have various shapes so that the structure of the opening <b>54</b> may not be limited to that illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. For example, the opening <b>54</b> may have a trench structure.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0091">A barrier metal layer pattern <b>56</b> <i>a </i>is formed on a bottom and a sidewall of the opening <b>54</b>. The barrier metal layer pattern <b>56</b> <i>a </i>may have a cylindrical structure. The barrier metal layer pattern <b>56</b> <i>a </i>may include at least one of metal or nitride. For example, the barrier metal layer pattern <b>56</b> <i>a </i>may include at least one of titanium (Ti) or titanium nitride (TiNx).

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0096">In an exemplary embodiment, the metal oxide pattern <b>60</b> may have a resistance substantially higher than a resistance of the metal pattern <b>58</b> <i>b</i>. The thickness (t) of the metal oxide pattern <b>60</b> may be adjusted by controlling conditions of an oxidation process in which the metal pattern <b>58</b> <i>b </i>is oxidized to form the metal oxide pattern <b>60</b>. Thus, the resistance of the metal oxide pattern <b>60</b> may also be adjusted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0097">The width (w) of the metal oxide pattern <b>60</b> may be substantially smaller than a critical dimension (CD) of a photolithography process.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0105">The barrier metal layer <b>56</b> may not completely fill up the opening <b>54</b>.

When the barrier metal layer <b>56</b> is formed on the sidewall of the opening <b>54</b>, the opening <b>54</b> may have a width reduced by twice the thickness of the barrier metal layer <b>56</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0106">A metal layer <b>58</b> is formed on the barrier metal layer <b>56</b> to fully fill up the opening <b>54</b>. The metal layer <b>58</b> may comprise, for example, tungsten. In an exemplary embodiment, the metal layer <b>58</b> may have a thickness or a width varied in accordance with the thickness of the barrier metal layer <b>56</b> because the width of the opening <b>54</b> varies by adjusting the thickness of the barrier metal layer <b>56</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0107">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the metal layer <b>58</b> and the barrier metal layer <b>56</b> are partially removed until the insulating interlayer <b>52</b> is exposed.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0108">In the CMP process according to an exemplary embodiment, the insulating interlayer <b>52</b> may be polished so that the preliminary metal pattern <b>58</b> <i>a </i>and the barrier metal layer pattern <b>56</b> <i>a </i>may protrude upward from the insulating interlayer <b>52</b>. For example, each of protruding portions of the preliminary metal pattern <b>58</b> <i>a </i>and the barrier metal layer pattern <b>56</b> <i>a </i>may have a height of about 10 nm. In this case, the preliminary metal pattern <b>58</b> <i>a </i>and the barrier metal layer pattern <b>56</b> <i>a </i>having the protruding portions may be obtained through a single CMP process without an additional etching or planarizing process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0109">In an exemplary embodiment, the preliminary metal pattern <b>58</b> <i>a </i>and the barrier metal layer pattern <b>56</b> <i>a </i>having the protruding portions may be formed by performing more than one CMP process having different process conditions.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0111">When the preliminary metal pattern <b>58</b> <i>a </i>is thermally treated under the oxygen atmosphere, a surface of the preliminary metal pattern <b>58</b> <i>a </i>is reacted with oxygen and thus the surface of the preliminary metal pattern <b>58</b> <i>a </i>is thermally expanded along the sidewall of the opening <b>54</b>.

As a result, an electrical failure caused by the surface roughness of the metal oxide pattern <b>60</b> may be prevented.

For example, oxygen may be reacted with the preliminary conductive pattern <b>12</b> and a reacted portion of the preliminary conductive pattern <b>12</b> may thermally expanded toward the first opening <b>16</b>, thereby forming the lower electrode contact <b>18</b>. The lower electrode contact <b>18</b> may partially occupy the first opening <b>16</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0370">In an exemplary embodiment, the lower electrode contact <b>18</b> may include metal oxide generated from the metal included in the preliminary conductive pattern <b>12</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0371">While thermally treating the preliminary conductive pattern <b>12</b> under the oxygen atmosphere, the exposed portion of the preliminary conductive pattern <b>12</b> is additionally reacted with oxygen, so that the lower electrode contact <b>18</b> may laterally extend along an upper portion of the preliminary conductive pattern <b>12</b>. Thus, the preliminary conductive pattern <b>12</b> is changed into a conductive pattern <b>12</b> <i>a </i>having a recess formed thereon.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0372">As described above, the conductive pattern <b>12</b> <i>a </i>has the recess and the lower electrode contact <b>18</b> has the enlarged lower portion in accordance with a thermal treatment process.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0373">In exemplary embodiments, the thermal treatment process may include a plasma treatment or an RTA process. For example, the conductive pattern <b>12</b> <i>a </i>and the lower electrode <b>18</b> may be formed by the plasma treatment or the RTA process. Alternatively, the conductive pattern <b>12</b> <i>a </i>and the lower electrode <b>18</b> may be obtained by successively performing the plasma treatment and the RTA process.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0374">According to an exemplary embodiment, a thickness of the lower electrode contact <b>18</b> may vary by controlling conditions of the thermal treatment process.

Tungsten oxide may have a resistance substantially larger than a resistance of tungsten, and also may have an etching resistance relative to an etching solution in a wet etching process. To ensure proper resistance and etching durability of the conductive pattern <b>12</b> <i>a </i>and/or the lower electrode contact <b>18</b>, the conductive pattern <b>12</b> <i>a </i>and the lower electrode contact <b>18</b> may include tungsten and tungsten oxide, respectively.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0381">Because of the spacer <b>20</b>, a contact area between the lower electrode contact <b>18</b> and the phase change material layer <b>22</b> is reduced.
