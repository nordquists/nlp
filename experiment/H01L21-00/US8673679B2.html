<heading>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0002">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to a system and process for forming a patterned layer on desired regions of a surface of a substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">2. Description of the Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Solar cells are photovoltaic (PV) devices that convert sunlight directly into electrical power. The PV market has experienced growth at annual rates exceeding 30% for the last ten years. Some articles suggest that solar cell power production world-wide may exceed 10 GWp in the near future. It is estimated that more than 95% of all solar modules are silicon wafer based. The high market growth rate in combination with the need to substantially reduce solar electricity costs has resulted in a number of serious challenges for inexpensively forming high quality solar cells. Therefore, one major component in making commercially viable solar cells lies in reducing the manufacturing costs required to form the solar cells by improving the device yield and increasing the substrate throughput.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">Solar cells typically have one or more p-n junctions. Each p-n junction comprises two different regions within a semiconductor material where one side is denoted as the p-type region and the other as the n-type region. When the p-n junction of a solar cell is exposed to sunlight (consisting of energy from photons), the sunlight is directly converted to electricity through the PV effect. Solar cells generate a specific amount of electric power and are tiled into modules sized to deliver the desired amount of system power. Solar modules are joined into panels with specific frames and connectors. Solar cells are commonly formed on silicon substrates, which may be single or multicrystalline silicon substrates. A typical solar cell includes a silicon wafer, substrate, or sheet typically less than about 0.3 mm thick with a thin layer of n-type silicon on top of a p-type region formed on the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> schematically depicts a standard silicon solar cell <b>10</b> fabricated on a wafer <b>11</b>. The wafer <b>11</b> includes a p-type base region <b>21</b>, an n-type emitter region <b>22</b>, and a p-n junction region <b>23</b> disposed therebetween. An n-type region, or n-type semiconductor, is formed by doping the semiconductor with certain types of elements (e.g., phosphorus (P), arsenic (As), or antimony (Sb)) in order to increase the number of negative charge carriers, i.e., electrons. Similarly, a p-type region, or p-type semiconductor, is formed by the addition of trivalent atoms to the crystal lattice, resulting in a missing electron from one of the four covalent bonds normal for the silicon lattice. Thus the dopant atom can accept an electron from a neighboring atoms covalent bond to complete the fourth bond. The dopant atom accepts an electron, causing the loss of half of one bond from the neighboring atom and resulting in the formation of a “hole”.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">When light falls on the solar cell, energy from the incident photons generates electron-hole pairs on both sides of the p-n junction region <b>13</b>. Electrons diffuse across the p-n junction to a lower energy level and holes diffuse in the opposite direction, creating a negative charge on the emitter and a corresponding positive charge builds up in the base. When an electrical circuit is made between the emitter and the base and the p-n junction is exposed to certain wavelengths of light, a current will flow. The electrical current generated by the semiconductor when illuminated flows through contacts disposed on the frontside <b>18</b>, i.e. the light-receiving side, and the backside <b>19</b> of the solar cell <b>10</b>. The top contact structure, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, is generally configured as widely-spaced thin metal lines, or fingers <b>14</b>, that supply current to a larger bus bar <b>15</b>. The back contact <b>25</b> is generally not constrained to be formed in multiple thin metal lines, since it does not prevent incident light from striking solar cell <b>10</b>. Solar cell <b>10</b> is generally covered with a thin layer of dielectric material, such as Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, to act as an anti-reflection coating <b>16</b>, or ARC, to minimize light reflection from the top surface <b>22</b>A of solar cell <b>10</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">Screen printing has long been used in printing designs on objects, such as cloth or ceramics, and is used in the electronics industry for printing electrical component designs, such as electrical contacts or interconnects on the surface of a substrate. State of the art solar cell fabrication processes also use screen printing processes. In some applications, it is desirable to screen print contact lines, such as fingers <b>14</b>, on the solar cell substrate. The fingers <b>14</b> are in contact with the substrate are adapted to form an Ohmic connection with one or more doped regions (e.g., n-type emitter region <b>22</b>). An Ohmic contact is a region on a semiconductor device that has been prepared so that the current-voltage (I-V) curve of the device is linear and symmetric, i.e., there is no high resistance interface between the doped silicon region of the semiconductor device and the metal contact. Low-resistance, stable contacts are critical for the performance of the solar cell and reliability of the circuits formed in the solar cell fabrication process. To enhance the contact with the solar cell device it is typical to position a finger <b>14</b> on a heavily doped region <b>17</b> formed within the substrate surface to enable the formation of an Ohmic contact. Since the formed heavily doped regions <b>17</b>, due to their electrical properties, tend to block or minimize the amount light that can pass there through it is desirable to minimize their size, while also making these regions large enough to assure that the fingers <b>14</b> can be reliably aligned and formed thereon. The misalignment of the deposited fingers <b>14</b> to the underlying heavily doped regions <b>17</b> due to errors in the positioning of the substrate on an automated transferring device, defects in the edge of the substrate, unknown registration and alignment of the heavily doped region <b>17</b> on the substrate surface and/or shifting of the substrate on the automated transferring device can lead to poor device performance and low device efficiency. Heavily doped regions <b>17</b> may be formed on the substrate surface using a variety of patterning techniques to create areas of heavier and lighter doping, for example by performing phosphorus diffusion steps using a patterned diffusion barrier. A backside contact completes the electrical circuit required for solar cell to produce a current by forming an Ohmic contact with p-type base region of the substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">Therefore, there is a need for a screen printing apparatus for the production of solar cells, electronic circuits, or other useful devices that has an improved method of controlling the alignment of the deposited metal feature(s) (e.g., fingers <b>14</b>) to a heavily doped region using a screen printing or other similar process.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">Embodiments of the present invention provide an apparatus and method for processing substrates in a system that utilizes an improved patterned material deposition processing sequence that can improve the device yield performance and cost-of-ownership (CoO) of a substrate processing line. In one embodiment, the system is a screen printing system that is adapted to perform a screen printing process within a portion of a crystalline silicon solar cell production line in which a substrate is patterned with a desired material and is then processed in one or more subsequent processing chambers. The subsequent processing chambers may be adapted to perform one or more bake steps and one or more cleaning steps. In one embodiment, the system is a module positioned within the Softline™ tool available from Baccini S.p.A., which is owned by Applied Materials, Inc. of Santa Clara, Calif. While the discussion below primarily discusses the processes of screen printing a pattern, such as an interconnect or contact structure, on a surface of a solar cell device this configuration is not intended to be limiting as to the scope of the invention described herein. Other substrate materials that may benefit from the invention include substrates that may have an active region that contain single crystal silicon, multi-crystalline silicon, polycrystalline silicon, or other desirable substrate materials.</div>
<heading>Enhanced Optical Inspection System</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">Embodiments of the invention also generally provide a novel solar cell formation process that includes the formation of metal contacts over heavily doped regions <b>241</b> that are formed in a desired pattern <b>230</b> on a surface of a substrate. Embodiments of the invention also provide an inspection system and supporting hardware that is used to reliably position a similarly shaped, or patterned, metal contact structure on the patterned heavily doped regions to allow an Ohmic contact to be made. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is plan view of a surface <b>251</b> of a substrate <b>250</b> that has a heavily doped region <b>241</b> and a patterned metal contact structure <b>242</b> formed thereon, such as the fingers <b>260</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is side cross-sectional view created at the cross-section line <b>2</b>B-<b>2</b>B shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, and illustrates a portion of the surface <b>251</b> having a metal finger <b>260</b> disposed on the heavily doped region <b>241</b>. As discussed above, the metal contact structure, such as fingers <b>260</b> and busbars <b>261</b>, are formed on the heavily doped regions <b>241</b> so that a high quality electrical connection can be formed between these two regions. Low-resistance, stable contacts are critical for the performance of the solar cell. The heavily doped regions <b>241</b> generally comprise portions of a substrate <b>250</b> that has a sheet resistance of less than about 50 Ohms per square (Ω/□). In one embodiment, the heavily doped region <b>241</b> is formed in a silicon substrate and has a doping level greater than about 10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>. A patterned type of heavily doped regions <b>241</b> can be formed by conventional lithographic and ion implantation techniques, or conventional dielectric masking and high temperature furnace diffusion techniques that are well known in the art. However, the processes of aligning and depositing the metal contact structure <b>242</b> on the heavily doped regions <b>241</b> is difficult using conventional techniques, since there is typically no way to easily detect the actual alignment and orientation of the formed heavily doped region <b>241</b> pattern on the surface <b>251</b> of the substrate <b>250</b> using these techniques. It is believed that the ability to detect the actual alignment and orientation of the formed heavily doped region <b>241</b> pattern is particularly difficult after both heavily and lightly doped regions formed in the substrate <b>250</b> are covered with an antireflective coating layer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">Embodiments of the invention thus provide methods of first detecting the actual alignment and orientation of the patterned heavily doped regions <b>241</b> and then forming patterned metal contacts on the surface of the heavily doped regions <b>241</b> using the collected information. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates one embodiment of an optical inspection system <b>400</b> that is configured to determine the actual alignment and orientation of the pattern <b>230</b> of the heavily doped region(s) <b>241</b> formed on a surface of a substrate <b>250</b>. The optical inspection system <b>400</b> generally contains one or more electromagnetic radiation sources, such as radiation sources <b>402</b> and <b>403</b> that are configured to emit radiation at a desired wavelength and a detector assembly <b>401</b> this configured to capture the reflected or un-absorbed radiation so that the alignment and orientation of the heavily doped regions <b>241</b> can be optically determined relative to the other non-heavily doped regions of the substrate <b>250</b>. The orientation and alignment data collected by the detector assembly <b>401</b> is then delivered to a system controller <b>101</b> that is configured to adjust and control the placement of the metal contact structure, such as fingers <b>260</b>, on the surfaced of the heavily doped regions <b>241</b> by use of patterned metallization technique. Patterned metallization techniques may include screen printing processes, ink jet printing processes, lithographic and blanket metal deposition process, or other similar patterned metallization processes. In one embodiment, the metal contacts are disposed on the surface of the substrate <b>250</b> using a screen printing process performed in a screen printing system <b>100</b>, as discussed below in conjunction with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3D</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">In configurations where the heavily doped regions <b>241</b> are formed within a silicon substrate it is believed that electromagnetic radiation emitted at wavelengths within the ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) wavelength regions will either be preferentially absorbed, reflected or transmitted by the silicon substrate or heavily doped regions. The difference in the transmission, absorption or reflection of the emitted radiation can thus be used to create some discernable contrast that can be resolved by the detector assembly <b>401</b> and system controller <b>101</b>. In one embodiment, it is desirable to emit electromagnetic radiation at wavelengths between about 850 nm and 4 microns (μm). In one embodiment, one or more of the radiation sources <b>402</b> and <b>403</b> are light emitting diodes (LEDs) that are adapted to deliver on or more of the desired wavelengths of light.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">In one embodiment, of the optical inspection system <b>400</b> has a radiation source <b>402</b> that is configured to deliver electromagnetic radiation “B<sub>1</sub>” to a surface <b>252</b> of a substrate <b>250</b> that is opposite to the side of the substrate on which the detector assembly <b>401</b> is disposed. In one example, the radiation source <b>402</b> is disposed adjacent to the backside of a solar cell substrate <b>250</b> and the detector assembly <b>401</b> is disposed adjacent to the front surface of the substrate <b>250</b>. In this configuration, it is desirable to use optical radiation greater than the absorption edge of silicon, such as greater than about 1060 nm to allow that emitted electromagnetic radiation “B<sub>1</sub>” to pass through the substrate <b>250</b> and be delivered to the detector assembly <b>401</b> following path “C”. It is believed that due to the high doping level (e.g., &gt;10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>) in the heavily doped regions versus the typically lightly doped silicon substrate (e.g., &lt;10<sup>17 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>), typically used in solar cell applications, the absorption or transmissive properties will be significantly different for each of these regions within these wavelengths. In one embodiment, it is desirable to confine the emitted wavelengths in a range between about 1.1 μm and about 1.5 μm.

<heading>Solar Cell Formation Process</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">Embodiments of the invention also generally provide a novel solar cell formation process that includes an improved front side metallization process to create a higher performance solar cell device. Conventional front side metallization deposition processes include the formation of a metal contact structure (e.g., fingers and busbars) on heavily doped regions that are disposed within a textured front surface of the solar cell substrate. Typical texturing processes provide a surface having a roughness between about 1 micron (μm) and about 10 μm. The deposition of the metal containing materials used to form the fingers and busbars on the textured surface can greatly affect the electrical resistance of the formed fingers and busbars, due to the increased surface area that the deposited metal must cover versus an untextured surface. Similarly, the roughness of the textured surface will also greatly affect the spatial resolution of the formed heavily doped regions due to the increase in the surface area of these regions through which the dopant atoms will pass during the formation process versus an untextured surface. Also, as noted above, conventional inspection techniques are typically not able to optically determine the position of the heavily doped regions on a substrate surface. Therefore, there is also a need for an improved solar cell formation process that allows for a low resistance metal contact structure to be formed. It is also desirable to reliably position the fingers and busbars on the heavily doped regions to assure full Ohmic contact is created between the heavily doped regions <b>241</b> and the fingers and busbars. It is further desirable to create a solar cell formation process that allows the fingers and busbars to be formed on regions of the front surface that has not been textured.</div>

Therefore, since the first dopant material <b>329</b> is formulated to act as a mask for the texture chemistry, the heavily doped regions <b>241</b> will generally comprise relatively flat regions <b>341</b> that are untextured and easily discernable by optical inspection techniques and even the naked eye.

<heading>Optical Inspection Techniques</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0102">In one embodiment, the process sequence <b>600</b>A includes the formation of one or more alignment marks <b>801</b> that are formed prior to depositing the conductive layer <b>370</b> on the patterned heavily doped regions <b>241</b>. The one or more alignment marks <b>801</b> are used to help the optical inspection assembly <b>200</b> determine the alignment and orientation of the pattern <b>230</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> illustrates one embodiment of the substrate <b>250</b> illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> that has a plurality of alignment marks <b>801</b> and patterned heavily doped region(s) <b>241</b> formed on the surface <b>251</b>. In one embodiment, it is desirable to form the alignment marks <b>801</b> in a known pattern at substantially the same time as the pattern <b>230</b> of heavily doped region(s) <b>241</b> are formed to assure that the marks are properly aligned to the pattern <b>230</b>. In this configuration, the optical inspection assembly <b>200</b> is used to provide information regarding the actual positional offset (ΔX, ΔY) and angular offset ΔR of the heavily doped regions <b>241</b> from an ideal position <b>800</b> on the surface of the substrate <b>250</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>). The actual positional offset and the angular offset of the heavily doped region(s) <b>241</b> on the surface <b>251</b> can thus be more accurately determined by the system controller <b>101</b> and used to more accurately adjust the placement of the conductive layer <b>370</b> on the heavily doped region(s) <b>241</b> in a subsequent step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0103">Typically, the alignment of the pattern <b>230</b> on the surface <b>251</b> of the substrate <b>250</b> is dependent on the alignment of the pattern <b>230</b> to a feature of the substrate <b>250</b>. In one example, the alignment of the pattern <b>230</b> created during box <b>604</b> is based on the alignment of the screen printing device to a feature on the substrate, such as edges <b>250</b>A, <b>250</b>B (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>). The placement of a pattern <b>230</b> will have an expected position X and an expected angle orientation R with respect to edges <b>250</b>A and an expected position Y with respect to an edge <b>250</b>B of the substrate <b>250</b>. The positional error of the pattern <b>230</b> on the surface <b>251</b> from the expected position (X, Y) and the expected angular orientation R on the surface <b>251</b> may be described as a positional offset (ΔX, ΔY) and an angular offset ΔR. Thus, the positional offset (ΔX, ΔY) is the error in the placement of the pattern <b>230</b> of heavily doped region(s) <b>241</b> relative to the edges <b>250</b>A and <b>250</b>B, and the angular offset ΔR is the error in the angular alignment of the pattern <b>230</b> of heavily doped region(s) <b>241</b> relative to the edge <b>250</b>B of the substrate <b>250</b>. The misplacement of the screen printed pattern <b>230</b> on the surface <b>251</b> of the substrate <b>250</b> can affect the ability of the formed device to perform correctly and thus affect the device yield of the system <b>100</b>. However, minimizing positional errors becomes even more critical in applications where a screen printed layer is to be deposited on top of another formed pattern, such as disposing the conductive layer <b>370</b> on the heavily doped region(s) <b>241</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0104">In an effort to improve the accuracy with which the conductive layer <b>370</b> is aligned with the heavily doped region(s) <b>241</b>, embodiments of the invention utilize one or more optical inspection devices, the system controller <b>101</b>, and one or more alignment marks, which are formed on the surface <b>251</b> of the substrate <b>250</b> during the formation of the heavily doped region(s) <b>241</b> so that the correct alignment of the conductive layer <b>370</b> to the heavily doped region(s) <b>241</b> can be created. In one embodiment, the conductive layer <b>370</b> is aligned in an automated fashion to the heavily doped region(s) <b>241</b> by use of the information received by the system controller <b>101</b> from the one or more optical inspection devices and the ability of the system controller <b>101</b> to control the position and orientation of the screen printing mask relative to heavily doped region(s) <b>241</b> using the one or more actuators <b>102</b>A found in the screen print chamber <b>102</b>.

The alignment marks <b>801</b> may be formed on unused areas of the surface <b>251</b> of the substrate <b>250</b> to prevent the alignment marks <b>801</b> from affecting the performance of a formed solar cell device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0105">In some solar cell processing sequences, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, at least a portion of a surface of the substrate <b>250</b> is coated with an obscuring material <b>805</b> that blocks the optical inspection assemblies <b>200</b> ability to detect the pattern <b>230</b>. In one example, a metal coating is disposed on the surface <b>252</b> opposite the surface <b>251</b>, thus affecting the ability of the optical inspection assembly <b>200</b> to directly determining the pattern <b>230</b> of heavily doped region <b>241</b>. In on example, an optical inspection system <b>400</b> is prevented from transmitting the electromagnetic radiation from the radiation source(s) <b>402</b> through all regions of the substrate <b>250</b>. Therefore, in one embodiment, it is desirable to selectively remove portions of the obscuring material <b>805</b> from one or more regions <b>806</b> (e.g., edge regions) and position one or more alignment marks <b>801</b> over or within the one or more regions <b>806</b> so that the pattern <b>230</b> of heavily doped regions <b>241</b> can still be determined or inferred from the position of the alignment marks <b>801</b>.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0111">In one embodiment, during processing, the inspection assembly <b>200</b> and system controller <b>101</b> capture images of at least two of the alignment marks <b>801</b> formed on the surface <b>251</b> of the substrate <b>250</b>. The images are read by the image recognition software in the system controller <b>101</b>.

The system controller <b>101</b> then determines the offset of each of the three alignment marks <b>801</b> from the theoretical reference frame and uses a coordinate transfer algorithm to adjust the position of the screen printing device within the printing chamber <b>102</b> to an ideal position for subsequently printing the conductive layer <b>370</b> with significantly more accurate alignment with respect to the heavily doped region(s) <b>241</b>. In one embodiment, the method of ordinary least squares (OLS) or a similar method may be used to optimize the ideal position of the screen printing device for printing the conductive layer <b>370</b>. For instance, the offset of each of the alignment marks <b>801</b> from the theoretical reference frame may be determined, and the ideal position of the screen printing device may be optimized according to a function that minimizes the distance between the actual position of the alignment marks <b>801</b> and the theoretical reference frame. The alignment mark position information received by the system controller <b>101</b> during the position capturing process is thus used to orient and position the conductive layer <b>370</b> relative to the actual position of the alignment marks <b>801</b> created during the formation of the heavily doped region(s) <b>241</b>. Therefore, the error in the placement of the conductive layer <b>370</b> is reduced, since the placement of the conductive layer <b>370</b> relies on the actual position of the heavily doped region(s) <b>241</b>, and not the relationship of the heavily doped region(s) <b>241</b> to a feature of the substrate <b>250</b> and then conductive layer <b>370</b> to the feature(s) of the substrate <b>250</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0115">In one embodiment, the alignment mark <b>1102</b> comprises a pattern of nested features, such as the outer feature <b>1110</b>, middle feature <b>1111</b>, and inner feature <b>1112</b> that are formed on the substrate <b>250</b> using the steps discussed above in conjunction with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5G</figref>, <b>6</b>A and <b>7</b>. The process of forming the alignment mark <b>1102</b> and heavily doped region(s) <b>241</b> on the surface of the substrate <b>250</b> may include the use of a patterned mask and conventional doping process(es). In one example, the pattern masking process may include patterning an oxide layer, or a photoresist material, and the conventional doping process may include an ion implantation process or a diffusion furnace type doping process. In one example, the process of forming the alignment mark <b>1102</b> and other heavily doped region(s) <b>241</b> includes the following steps. First, a dielectric layer (e.g., silicon oxide, silicon nitride) is deposited on the surface <b>251</b> of the substrate. Next, a pattern is formed in the dielectric layer using one or more patterning techniques, such as laser ablation, patterned etchant materials, and/or conventional photolithography and wet or dry etching techniques. An example of a patterned etchant material process is further described in the commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/274,023, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Finally, the heavily doped region(s) <b>241</b> are formed using a high temperature diffusion furnace type doping step (˜T≧800° C.), in which components of a doping gas (e.g., POCl<sub>3</sub>) are driven into the exposed surfaces of the substrate formed during the prior patterning step. In some cases, an optional clean step may be performed after the doping step to remove the pattern dielectric layer and exposed substrate surfaces.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0116">In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11D and 11E</figref>, the position and/or angular orientation of a screen printing mask <b>102</b>B (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) is aligned relative to the alignment mark <b>1102</b> using the optical inspection system <b>400</b>, one or more actuators (e.g., substrate movement actuator, actuator <b>102</b>A) and system controller <b>101</b>. In this configuration, the alignment of the screen printing mask <b>102</b>B relative to the alignment mark <b>1102</b> is determined by use of the emitted radiation from the radiation source <b>402</b>, which is projected through the features <b>102</b>C formed in the screen printing mask <b>102</b>B and is collected by the detector assembly <b>401</b>. In one example, the feature <b>1110</b> in the alignment mark <b>1102</b> has an outer dimension in the x-direction and/or in the y-direction that is about 1 mm in size, while the width W<sub>1 </sub>of each of the features <b>1110</b>, <b>1111</b> and/or <b>1112</b> are between about 100 and 120 μm. In one configuration, the outer feature <b>1110</b>, middle feature <b>1111</b>, and inner feature <b>1112</b> are all equally spaced in a nested pattern relative to each other. The outer feature <b>1110</b>, middle feature <b>1111</b>, and inner feature <b>1112</b> may each be separated by a gap G (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</figref>) formed there between. In one embodiment, the features <b>102</b>C in a screen printing mask <b>102</b>B are configured so that at least one feature <b>102</b>C is nominally positioned at the center line of each of the nested features, and each feature <b>102</b>C are about 20-40 μm smaller in width W<sub>2 </sub>than the width W<sub>1</sub>. It is believed that by configuring the features <b>102</b>C so that they are smaller in width than the alignment mark features, it will generally be easier to reliably align the printing mask <b>102</b>B to the alignment mark <b>1102</b>. In one example, the width W<sub>2 </sub>is between about 60 and about 80 μm. In general, the screen printing mask <b>102</b>B to heavily doped region <b>241</b> alignment can be detected by the optical contrast formed between the heavily doped regions <b>241</b> found in the alignment mark <b>1102</b> and the substrate <b>250</b> material which are viewed through the features <b>102</b>C formed in the screen printing mask <b>102</b>B. In one example, if the features <b>102</b>C are desirably aligned relative to the alignment mark <b>1102</b>, no optical contrast will be seen by the detector assembly <b>401</b> and system controller <b>101</b>, since each of the features <b>102</b>C will be positioned over its respective nested features <b>1110</b>, <b>1111</b> and <b>1112</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11E</figref> is a close-up plan view illustrating a configuration where the features <b>102</b>C in the screen printing mask <b>102</b>B are mis-aligned relative to the alignment mark <b>1102</b> prior to any adjustment being made by the actuators <b>102</b>A and system controller <b>101</b>. In this configuration, the detector assembly <b>401</b> can be used to detect the variation in intensity of the electromagnetic radiation passing through the features <b>102</b>C and received by that detector assembly <b>401</b>, due to the interaction of the electromagnetic radiation with portions of the alignment mark <b>1102</b> (e.g., nested features <b>1110</b>, <b>1111</b> and <b>1112</b>) and adjacent regions of the substrate <b>250</b> (e.g., non-heavily doped regions). In one embodiment, the system controller <b>101</b> is used to adjust the orientation and/or position of the screen printing mask <b>102</b>B relative to the substrate <b>250</b> until the variation in intensity across at least two or more parts of the image formed by a camera in the detector assembly <b>401</b> is within a desirable range. In one example, the variation in intensity across at least two or more parts of the image formed by a camera is adjusted until the variation is minimized, which may coincide with the features <b>102</b>C, which have a width W<sub>2 </sub>smaller than the Width W<sub>1</sub>, being positioned directly over and oriented with the nested features <b>1110</b>, <b>1111</b> and/or <b>1112</b>.</div>
