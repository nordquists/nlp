<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Taiwan application Serial No. 99129126, filed Aug. 30, 2010, the subject matter of which is incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<heading id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to the field of semiconductor packaging, and, more particularly, to thermal management of stacked-chip packages.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0006" num="0005">In stacked-chip packaging, multiple integrated circuit chips can be packaged in a single package structure in a vertically stacked manner. This increases stack density, making the package structure smaller, and often reduces the length of the path that signals must traverse between chips. Thus, stacked-chip packaging tends to increase the speed of signal transmission between or among chips. Additionally, stacked-chip packaging allows chips having different functions to be integrated in a single package structure. Use of through silicon vias (TSV) has been a key technology in realizing stacked-chip packaging integration due to the ability to provide short vertical conductive paths between chips.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0007" num="0006">However, thermal management of 3-D designs has been challenging. To maintain normal operation of the chip, the chip must be maintained within a limited operation temperature range. Operating temperatures in excess of the limited operation temperature range results in chip performance drop, reduced reliability or damage. Existing stacked-chip packages usually include a heat sink, which is bonded to a lower chip using adhesives and that covers the upper chips of the package.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0008" num="0007">In current chip processing the surface of the chip is covered with a protective layer, which has a low thermal conductivity and therefore hinders conducting of the heat from the chip interior, where it is produced, to the surrounding environment. Even if the heat sink is disposed on the lower chip of the stacked-chip package structure, the protective layer likewise hinders thermal conductance between the lower chip and the heat sink, thus affecting operation and reliability of the stacked-chip package structure.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0015" num="0014">Common reference numerals are used throughout the drawings and the detailed description to indicate the same elements. The present invention will be more apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</div>
<heading id="h-0005">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a semiconductor structure <b>100</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention. The semiconductor structure <b>100</b> includes a first chip <b>110</b> having a plurality of through silicon vias (TSV) <b>112</b> in the semiconductor substrate thereof. It is to be appreciated that although silicon is the preferred semiconductor substrate material, the invention applies to any semiconductor material used in semiconductor chip fabrication, such as germanium, silicon germanium, gallium arsenide, or other III-V and II-IV compounds and the term is used generically throughout the disclosure regardless of the semiconductor material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0017" num="0016">TSV fabrication can be placed into two main categories: “Via-First” processing and “Via-Last” processing. Via-First processing means that the through silicon vias are formed early in the manufacturing process, before the “back-end-of-line” (BEOL) processing. For Via-Last processing, the through silicon vias are fabricated after the BEOL processing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0018" num="0017">For Via-First, since the through silicon vias are buried inside the substrate material before the BEOL processing, the wafer requires an additional thinning process to expose the vias on the wafer back surface and an additional passivation step to isolate the substrate material from an electrical redistribution layer on the back surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0019" num="0018">A first wiring layer <b>120</b> or redistribution layer, commonly referred to as “RDL” is disposed on an active surface <b>110</b> <i>a </i>of the first chip <b>110</b>. The various wiring layers or RDL disclosed below are typically include one or more layers of dielectric or passivation material and one or more layers of conductive material for routing, and under bump metallurgy. The first wiring layer <b>120</b> includes a first interconnect <b>122</b>. The first interconnect <b>122</b> may, for example, be an interconnect formed during the back end of line of the wafer process. The first interconnect <b>122</b> is, for example, connected between end <b>112</b> <i>a </i>of each of the through silicon vias <b>112</b> and a second bump <b>184</b> disposed at a bottom side of the first chip <b>110</b>. In addition, other active or passive elements (not shown) may exist in the first chip <b>110</b> and, therefore, the first interconnect <b>122</b> may be also connected with these active or passive elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0020" num="0019">A second wiring layer <b>130</b> or RDL is disposed at a back side <b>110</b> <i>b </i>of the first chip <b>110</b>. The second wiring layer <b>130</b> includes a second interconnect <b>132</b> and a plurality of thermal vias <b>134</b>. The second interconnect <b>132</b> is connected to the other end <b>112</b> <i>b </i>of each of the through silicon vias <b>112</b>. As shown, the thermal vias <b>134</b> are electrically insulated from the second interconnect <b>132</b> and contacts the back side <b>110</b> <i>b </i>of the first chip <b>110</b>. Here, the thermal vias <b>134</b> are mainly used for thermal conduction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0021" num="0020">A plurality of bump pads <b>142</b> is disposed on the second wiring layer <b>130</b>. Each bump pad <b>142</b> is connected to the second interconnect <b>132</b>. In addition, a heat dissipation layer <b>144</b> is disposed on the second wiring layer <b>130</b> in the area where the bump pads <b>142</b> are not located. The heat dissipation layer <b>144</b> is connected to the thermal vias <b>134</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0022" num="0021">A second chip <b>150</b> is disposed above the first chip <b>110</b> and is connected with the bump pads <b>142</b> via a plurality of first bumps <b>182</b>, such that the second chip <b>150</b> is electrically connected to the through silicon vias <b>112</b> of the first chip <b>110</b> via the first bumps <b>182</b>, the bump pads <b>142</b> and the second interconnect <b>132</b>. In order to protect the first bumps <b>182</b>, a first underfill <b>162</b> is filled between the second chip <b>150</b> and the second wiring layer <b>130</b> to enclose the first bumps <b>182</b>. The second chip <b>150</b> may also have an RDL formed on the active surface to facilitate patterning of the bumps.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0023" num="0022">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the foregoing structure may be disposed on a carrier substrate <b>170</b>. The carrier substrate <b>170</b> may, for example, be a common printed circuit board, a ceramic substrate, a metal substrate, or another suitable type of carrier substrate for supporting the first chip <b>110</b>. A plurality of second bumps <b>184</b> is disposed between the first wiring layer <b>120</b> and the carrier substrate <b>170</b> to electrically connect the first wiring layer <b>120</b> to the carrier substrate <b>170</b>. In order to protect the second bumps <b>184</b>, a second underfill <b>164</b> may be filled between the first wiring layer <b>120</b> and the carrier substrate <b>170</b> to enclose the second bumps <b>184</b>. In addition, a plurality of solder balls <b>186</b> may be disposed on a bottom of the carrier substrate <b>170</b> as a path along which the entire semiconductor structure <b>100</b> is connected to an external circuit.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0024" num="0023">A heat sink <b>190</b> may be disposed on the first chip <b>110</b> to enhance heat dissipation efficiency. The heat sink <b>190</b> covers the second chip <b>150</b> and is coupled to the heat dissipation layer <b>144</b> on the first chip <b>110</b>, such that heat generated by the first chip <b>110</b> and second chip <b>150</b> during operation can be dissipated to the surrounding environment by the heat sink <b>190</b>. In order to position the heat sink <b>190</b> and enhance the efficiency of thermal conduction between the heat sink <b>190</b> and the first chip <b>110</b>/second chip <b>150</b>, a first thermally conductive adhesive <b>192</b> may be disposed between the heat sink <b>190</b> and the heat dissipation layer <b>144</b>, and a second thermally conductive adhesive <b>194</b> may be disposed between the heat sink <b>190</b> and the second chip <b>150</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0025" num="0024">In the present embodiment, the second wiring layer <b>130</b> is provided with the thermal vias <b>134</b>, such that a large part of the heat generated by the first chip <b>110</b> can be transferred to a thermal conductive path comprising the thermal vias <b>134</b>, the heat dissipation layer <b>144</b>, and the heat sink <b>190</b>, without being hindered by the dielectric material, having a lower thermal conductance, in the second wiring layer <b>130</b>. As a result of adding the thermal conductive path, the semiconductor structure <b>100</b> of the present embodiment has improved heat dissipation efficiency and operation reliability in comparison with existing structures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0026" num="0025">In addition, in the present embodiment, the heat dissipation layer <b>144</b> and the bump pads <b>142</b> may be fabricated using the same or similar materials. For example, the surface layer of the bump pad <b>142</b> can be a nickel-gold stack layer <b>140</b> <i>b</i>, which has good wettability. Likewise, the heat dissipation layer <b>144</b> also can have this nickel-gold stack layer <b>140</b> <i>b </i>as its surface layer, thus improving the solderability between the heat sink <b>190</b> and the heat dissipation layer <b>144</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" id="p-0027" num="0026">Furthermore, in the present embodiment, a thermal path which includes the heat sink <b>190</b>, the heat dissipation layer <b>144</b> and the thermal vias <b>134</b> can also form a ground path through additional TSV's in the first chip <b>110</b> (not shown) so as to electrically interconnect with the substrate <b>170</b> and a ground plane external to the structure <b>100</b> thereby forming an electromagnetic interference shield and preventing external electromagnetic fields from interfering with electrical performance of the first chip <b>110</b> and the second chip <b>150</b>.</div>
