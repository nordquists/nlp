<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">Embodiments of a lamphead having improved cooling efficiency and apparatus for processing substrates utilizing the improved lamphead are provided herein. In some embodiments, the lamphead includes a monolithic member having a plurality of coolant passages disposed therein. At least one heat transfer member extends from the monolithic member into each coolant passage. The at least one heat transfer member disposed in each coolant passage may advantageously facilitate the rapid cooling of the monolithic member during a rapid thermal process (RTP), and may further limit cyclical fatigue cracking in the coolant passages. In some embodiments, the lamphead is disposed in an apparatus comprising a process chamber having a substrate support for supporting a substrate disposed therein, wherein the lamphead is disposed in a position opposing the support to facilitate heating the substrate during processing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">In the following description, the term substrate is intended to broadly cover any object that is being processed in a thermal process chamber and the temperature of the substrate is being measured during processing. The term substrate may include, for example, semiconductor wafers, flat panel displays, glass plates or disks, plastic workpieces, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a rapid thermal processing system (RTP) in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention. The RTP system may include a processing chamber <b>100</b> having a lamphead <b>200</b> for processing a substrate <b>106</b>. In some embodiments, the substrate <b>106</b> may be, for example, a disk-shaped, eight inch (200 mm) or twelve inch (300 mm) diameter silicon substrate. The substrate <b>106</b> is mounted inside the chamber <b>100</b> on a substrate support <b>108</b> and is heated by the lamphead <b>200</b>, which is disposed in a position opposing the substrate support <b>108</b>. The lamphead <b>200</b> generates radiation <b>112</b> which is directed to a front side of the substrate <b>106</b>. Alternatively (not shown), the lamphead <b>200</b> may be configured to heat the back side of the substrate <b>106</b>, for example, such as by being disposed below the substrate <b>106</b>, or by directing radiation to the back side of the substrate <b>106</b>. The radiation enters the processing chamber <b>100</b> through a water-cooled quartz window assembly <b>114</b>. Beneath the substrate <b>106</b> is a reflector <b>102</b>, which is mounted on a water-cooled, stainless steel base <b>116</b>. The base <b>116</b> includes a circulation circuit <b>146</b> through which coolant circulate to cool the reflector <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, the reflector <b>102</b> is made of aluminum and has a highly reflective surface coating <b>120</b>. Water, which may be above 23 degrees Celsius, may be circulated through the base <b>116</b> to keep the temperature of the reflector <b>102</b> well below that of the heated substrate <b>106</b>. Alternatively, other coolants may be provided at the same or different temperatures. For example, antifreeze or other heat transfer fluids may be circulated through the base <b>116</b> and/or the base <b>116</b> may be coupled to a chiller (not shown). An underside or backside <b>109</b> of the substrate <b>106</b> and the top of the reflector <b>102</b> form a reflecting cavity <b>118</b>. The reflecting cavity <b>118</b> enhances the effective emissivity of the substrate <b>106</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">In some embodiments, the separation between the substrate <b>106</b> and the reflector <b>102</b> may be approximately 0.3 of an inch (7.6 mm), thus forming the reflecting cavity <b>118</b> which has a width-to-height ratio of about 27. In processing systems that are designed for eight-inch silicon wafers, the distance between the substrate <b>106</b> and the reflector <b>102</b> is about 3-9 mm. The width-to-height ratio of the cavity <b>118</b> should be larger than about 20:1. If the separation is made too large, the emissivity-enhancement effect that is attributable to the virtual blackbody cavity that is formed will decrease. If the separation is too small, for example less than about 3 mm, then the thermal conduction from the substrate <b>106</b> to the reflector <b>102</b> will increase, thereby imposing a large thermal load on the heated substrate <b>106</b>, since the main mechanism for heat loss to the reflecting plate will be conduction through the gas. The thermal loading will depend upon the type of process gas and the chamber pressure during processing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">The temperatures at localized regions of the substrate <b>106</b> are measured by a plurality of temperature probes, such as <b>152</b> <i>a</i>, <b>152</b> <i>b</i>, and <b>152</b> <i>c</i>. Each temperature probe includes a sapphire light pipe <b>126</b> that passes through a conduit <b>124</b> that extends from the backside of the base <b>116</b> through the top of the reflector <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, the sapphire light pipe <b>126</b> is about 0.125 inch in diameter and the conduit <b>124</b> is slightly larger. The sapphire light pipe <b>126</b> is positioned within the conduit <b>124</b> so that its uppermost end is flush with or slightly below the upper surface of the reflector <b>102</b>. The other end of light pipe <b>126</b> couples to a flexible optical fiber that transmits sampled light from the reflecting cavity <b>118</b> to a pyrometer <b>128</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">The pyrometer <b>128</b> is connected to a temperature controller <b>150</b> which controls the power supplied to the lamphead <b>200</b> in response to a measured temperature. In some embodiments, such as for a 200 mm wafer, the lamphead <b>200</b> may use 187 lights to deliver highly collimated radiation from tungsten-halogen lamps to the processing chamber <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, such as for a 300 mm wafer, the lamphead <b>200</b> may use 409 lights. The number and configuration of the lights disclosed herein are exemplary and other numbers and configurations may also suitably be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">The lamps may be divided into multiple zones. The zones can be individually adjusted by the controller to allow controlled radiative heating of different areas of the substrate <b>106</b>. Such a control system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,755,511, assigned to the assignee of the present invention, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">As indicated above, the described embodiments use measurement or temperature probes distributed over the reflector <b>102</b> so as to measure the temperature at different radii of the substrate <b>106</b>. During thermal processing, the substrate <b>106</b> is rotated, for example, at about 90 RPM. Thus, each probe actually samples the temperature profile of a corresponding annular ring area on the substrate <b>106</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">The substrate support <b>108</b> which rotates the substrate <b>106</b> includes a support or an edge ring <b>134</b> which contacts the substrate <b>106</b> around the substrate's outer perimeter, thereby leaving the entire underside of the substrate <b>106</b> exposed except for a small annular region about the outer perimeter. The support ring <b>134</b> is also known as the edge ring <b>134</b> and these two terms can be interchangeably used within the specification. In some embodiment, the support ring <b>134</b> has a radial width of approximately one inch (2.5 centimeters (cm)). To minimize the thermal discontinuities that will occur at the edge of the substrate <b>106</b> during processing, the support ring <b>134</b> is made of the same, or similar, material as that of the substrate <b>106</b>, for example, silicon or silicon carbide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">The support ring <b>134</b> rests on a rotatable tubular quartz cylinder <b>136</b> that is coated with silicon to render it opaque in the frequency range of the pyrometer <b>128</b>. The silicon coating on the quartz cylinder <b>136</b> acts as a baffle to block out radiation from the external sources that might contaminate the intensity measurements. The bottom of the quartz cylinder <b>136</b> is held by an annular upper bearing <b>141</b> which rests on a plurality of ball bearings <b>137</b> that are, in turn, held within a stationary, annular, lower bearing race <b>139</b>. In some embodiments, the ball bearings <b>137</b> are made of steel and coated with silicon nitride to reduce particulate formation during operations. The upper bearing <b>141</b> is magnetically coupled to an actuator (not shown) which rotates the cylinder <b>136</b>, the edge ring <b>134</b> and the substrate <b>106</b> during the thermal processing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">A purge ring <b>145</b>, which is fitted into the chamber body, surrounds the quartz cylinder <b>136</b>. In some embodiment, the purge ring <b>145</b> has an internal annular cavity <b>147</b> which opens up to a region above the upper bearing <b>141</b>. The internal cavity <b>147</b> is connected to a gas supply (not shown) through a passageway <b>149</b>. During processing, a purge gas is flowed into the chamber through the purge ring <b>145</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">In some embodiments, the support ring <b>134</b> has an outer radius that is larger than the radius of the quartz cylinder <b>136</b> so that it extends out beyond the quartz cylinder <b>136</b>. The annular extension of the support ring <b>134</b> beyond the cylinder <b>136</b>, in cooperation with the purge ring <b>145</b> located below it, functions as a baffle which prevents stray light from entering the reflecting cavity <b>118</b> at the backside of the substrate <b>106</b>. To further reduce the possibility of stray light reflecting into the reflecting cavity <b>118</b>, the support ring <b>134</b> and the purge ring <b>145</b> may also be coated with a material (for example, a black or gray material) that absorbs the radiation generated by the heating element <b>202</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">During processing, a process gas can be introduced into the space between the substrate <b>106</b> and the window assembly through an inlet port. Gases are exhausted through an exhaust port, which is coupled to a vacuum pump (not shown).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">The lamphead <b>200</b> is illustrated with the RTP chamber in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and in an enlarged view in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The lamphead <b>200</b> includes a monolithic member <b>202</b> having a plurality of coolant passages <b>206</b> and a plurality of lamp passages <b>208</b> and reflector cavities <b>204</b> formed therein, and at least one heat transfer member <b>211</b> extending from the monolithic member <b>202</b> into each coolant passage <b>206</b>. A plurality of lamp receptacles <b>214</b> are coupled to the monolithic member <b>202</b>, where each lamp receptacle <b>214</b> is adapted to conform to the base of a lamp <b>212</b> and each reflector cavity <b>204</b> is shaped to act as a reflector for the lamp <b>212</b>. In some embodiments, the reflector cavity <b>204</b> may be shaped to receive a replaceable reflective piece (not shown) to act as a reflector for the lamp <b>212</b>. In some embodiments, each lamp receptacle <b>214</b> may be coupled to each reflector cavity <b>204</b> via the lamp passage <b>208</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">The monolithic member <b>202</b> may be formed from materials having high thermal conductivity. In some embodiments, materials may include at least one of stainless steel, copper, or aluminum. The thermal conductivity of such materials may be about 10-1000 W/mK. In some embodiments, the monolithic member is formed from copper, having thermal conductivity of about 400 W/mK. In some embodiments, the monolithic member <b>202</b> may be substantially circular in shape. The monolithic design of the lamphead <b>200</b> eliminates the need for reflector sleeves, thereby facilitating closer lamp-to-lamp spacing. In some embodiments, the lamp-to-lamp centerline distances may be reduced from 0.75 inches to 0.63 inches, thereby facilitating the use of more lamps, which increases power.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">Each reflector cavity <b>204</b> may further include an inner surface coated with a light reflecting material. The light reflecting material may include any suitable light reflecting material, such as gold or a dielectric quarter-wave stack formed on top of a gold layer. The plurality of reflector cavities <b>204</b> and lamps <b>212</b> may be arranged in the monolithic member <b>202</b> in any desired pattern. The lamps may be arranged, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,155,336. The number of lamps, as noted above, may vary. In some embodiments, the plurality of reflector cavities <b>204</b> may be arranged in parallel rows, wherein the reflector cavities in adjacent rows are staggered.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">Each lamp receptacle <b>214</b> may be coupled to each reflector cavity <b>204</b> via each lamp passage <b>208</b>. Each lamp receptacle <b>214</b> and each reflector cavity <b>204</b> may be disposed at opposing ends of each lamp passage <b>208</b>. Each lamp passage <b>208</b> may be sized to accept a press seal (not shown) of a lamp <b>212</b>. Alternatively, a lamp shrink seal may also be used or each lamp passage <b>208</b> may accommodate each lamp base. Light from each lamp <b>212</b> is directed toward the substrate <b>106</b> in the process chamber <b>100</b> through each reflector cavity <b>204</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">Each lamp receptacle <b>214</b> is adapted to receive a lamp socket or a lampholder <b>216</b>. Each lampholder <b>216</b> has an interface (not shown) that can receive lead pins <b>220</b> of the lamp <b>212</b>. The lamp leads <b>220</b> are electrically connected via the interface to respective wires of wiring pairs <b>215</b>, which provide power to the lamp <b>212</b>. The lamp receptacles <b>214</b> may support the lamps <b>212</b> when the lamps <b>212</b> are plugged into the lamphead <b>200</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">Each lamp <b>212</b> may have no base other than the press seal <b>210</b> or shrink seal <b>210</b> (not shown), depending on which one is used, although in other embodiments, the lamp may have a base (as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2B</figref>). In some embodiments, each lamp lead <b>220</b> engages directly into each lampholder <b>216</b> to complete the electrical circuit. The outer lead or lamp seal can include features to enable a sound mechanical retention of the lamp, such as indents, which engage spring-loaded pins in the lampholder <b>216</b>. A support plate <b>203</b> can be secured to the uppermost surface of the monolithic member <b>202</b> to hold each lampholder <b>216</b> within each lamp receptacle <b>214</b>. The support plate <b>203</b> may facilitate limiting deformation (or bowing) of the monolithic member <b>202</b>. The support plate <b>203</b> may be secured by epoxy, or other such materials having suitable thermal properties to function at temperatures in the lamphead <b>200</b>. In some embodiments, the support plate <b>203</b> comprises stainless steel.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">An alternative configuration of a lamphead <b>250</b> is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. The lamphead <b>250</b> includes the monolithic member <b>202</b> having the plurality of coolant passages <b>206</b> and the plurality of lamp passages <b>208</b> and reflector cavities <b>204</b> formed therein, and at least one heat transfer member <b>211</b> extending from the monolithic member <b>202</b> into each coolant passage <b>206</b>. The support plate <b>203</b> can be secured to the uppermost surface of the monolithic member <b>202</b> and a printed circuit board (PCB) <b>252</b> may be disposed above the support plate <b>203</b>. The PCB <b>252</b> may be configured to provide power to each lamp <b>212</b>. The PCB <b>252</b> comprises a plurality of connectors <b>254</b> disposed above each lamp passage <b>208</b>, and capable of interfacing with each lamp <b>212</b> at the base to provide power to each lamp <b>212</b>. The connectors <b>254</b> may comprise power lines, a plug which interfaces with the lamp pins of the lamp <b>212</b>, or the like. Each connector <b>254</b> may be surrounded/covered with a flexible insulating plug <b>256</b>. The plug <b>256</b> may insulate the connector <b>254</b> from, for example, shorting with the PCB <b>252</b>. Further, the plug <b>256</b> may form a gas tight seal, for example, insulating the PCB <b>252</b> and connector <b>254</b> from any gas that may seep up through the reflector cavity <b>204</b> and lamp passage <b>208</b>. A more detailed of a lamphead configured similarly to the lamphead <b>250</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> may be found in U.S. Pat.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">Returning to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the plurality of coolant passages <b>206</b> are formed into the monolithic member <b>202</b> and disposed proximate to the plurality of reflector cavities <b>204</b>. In some embodiments, a coolant passage <b>206</b> may be disposed on either side of each lamp <b>212</b>. Each coolant passage <b>206</b> may have dimensions suitable for maximizing heat transfer between the monolithic member and a coolant fluid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">In some embodiments, and as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, each coolant passage <b>206</b> may be a channel formed into a side (e.g., a top side) of the monolithic member <b>202</b> with a cap <b>221</b> disposed atop each channel. In some embodiments, the cap <b>221</b> may be coupled to the monolithic member <b>202</b>. For example, the cap <b>221</b> may be coupled to the monolithic member <b>221</b> by gluing, soldering, or brazing with at least one of a solder or a eutectic alloy. The cap <b>221</b>, the glue, the solder, or the eutectic alloy may be formed of materials having coefficients of thermal expansion substantially consistent with that of the materials forming the monolithic member, thereby limiting leakage of coolant fluids due to cyclical fatigue cracking of the seal between the cap and the monolithic member that may be caused by mismatched coefficients of thermal expansion.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">The lamphead <b>200</b> further includes at least one heat transfer member <b>211</b>. The at least one heat transfer member extends from the monolithic member <b>202</b> into each coolant passage <b>206</b>. The at least one heat transfer member <b>211</b> may facilitate improved heat transfer between the monolithic member <b>202</b> and a coolant fluid disposed therein and flowing therethrough each coolant passage <b>206</b>. The heat transfer member <b>211</b> may comprise the same materials as the monolithic member <b>202</b> or may be different. The heat transfer member <b>211</b> may comprise suitable materials compatible with and bondable to the materials forming the monolithic member <b>202</b> and compatible with the process (e.g., resistant to galvanic corrosion). The heat transfer member <b>211</b> may comprise suitable materials having a high thermal conductivity.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">Although illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref> as extending about half of the height of each coolant passage <b>206</b>, each heat transfer member <b>211</b> can extend other distances, such as lesser distances and greater distances including up to the full height of each coolant passage <b>206</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">In some embodiments, and as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, the heat transfer member <b>211</b> may have a wider cross section at the base of each coolant passage <b>206</b> to facilitate robust coupling thereto, improved stability, and/or improved thermal conduction between the monolithic member <b>202</b> and the heat transfer member <b>211</b>. In embodiments wherein the heat transfer member <b>211</b> is a separate component, the heat transfer member <b>211</b> may be coupled to the base of each coolant passage <b>206</b> in a suitable manner, such as by gluing, welding, ultrasonic welding, explosive welding, brazing, interference fitting, or the like. In some embodiments, the heat transfer member <b>211</b> may be coupled to the base of each coolant passage <b>206</b> by brazing using a solder, a eutectic alloy, or the like. In some embodiments, the heat transfer member <b>211</b> may be coupled to the base of each coolant passage <b>206</b> using a eutectic foil to facilitate coupling with little or no air voids disposed therebetween, thereby enhancing robust thermal coupling between the monolithic member <b>202</b> and the heat transfer member <b>211</b>. In some embodiments, the heat transfer member <b>211</b> may be coupled to the base of each coolant passage <b>206</b> using an adhesive.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">The materials forming the monolithic member <b>202</b>, the solder or eutectic alloy, and the at least one heat transfer member <b>211</b> may have substantially similar coefficients of thermal expansion such that a joint formed between the heat transfer member <b>211</b> and the base of the coolant passage <b>206</b> via brazing will be resistant to cyclic fatigue cracking brought on by rapid heating and cooling of the joint. In embodiments wherein the heat transfer member <b>211</b> extends the full height of the coolant passage <b>206</b>, the heat transfer member <b>211</b> can have a cross section similar to that described above for the base and may be adhered to the cap <b>211</b> by similar methods.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">The heat transfer member <b>211</b> may be spaced apart from the sidewalls of the coolant passage <b>206</b>, or to other heat transfer members <b>211</b> within the same coolant passage <b>206</b> by any suitable distance that maintains suitable flow of the heat transfer fluid therebetween. In some embodiments, the heat transfer member <b>211</b> may be spaced apart from the sidewalls of the coolant passage <b>206</b> by about 1 mm. Of course, the spacing may vary depending upon the size of the coolant passage, and the size and number of the heat transfer members disposed therein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">The heat transfer member <b>211</b> may extend the length of the coolant passage <b>206</b> for a distance at least sufficient to be disposed adjacent the lamps <b>212</b>. The heat transfer member <b>211</b> may have a longitudinal profile (e.g., along the length of the coolant passage <b>206</b>) that is straight, angled, wavy, or the like. For example, as illustrated <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the heat transfer member <b>211</b> may further comprise at least one fin having a linear profile (e.g., fin <b>301</b>), a sinusoidal profile (e.g., fin <b>303</b>), or other suitable profile. In some embodiments, a non-linear profile, such as the sinusoidal profile, may facilitate improved heat transfer between the surface of the fin and a coolant fluid flowing therethrough the coolant passage <b>206</b>, for example, by minimizing the boundary layer of the coolant fluid proximate the surface of the fin, and thus improving the heat transfer therebetween.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">In some embodiments, and as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A-B</figref>, the at least one heat transfer member <b>211</b> may comprise a plurality of fins <b>301</b> (as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>), or a plurality of fins <b>303</b> (as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). In some embodiments, the plurality of fins <b>301</b> or <b>303</b> comprise two fins having a longitudinal axis substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the coolant passage <b>206</b>. In some embodiments, each fin in the plurality is substantially parallel to an adjacent fin in the plurality. For example, fins <b>301</b> (<b>303</b>) is considered to be substantially parallel to an adjacent fin <b>301</b> (<b>303</b>). Although two fins are shown in the Figures, any suitable number of fins may be provided and the spacing between each fin may be utilized to facilitate improved heat transfer between each fin and the heat transfer fluid. The profiles of the heat transfer members disclosed herein are exemplary and may have other geometries while still providing the benefits disclosed herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">Although shown above as fins, or fin-like structures, the at least one heat transfer member <b>211</b> may have a variety of other forms as well. For example, alternative, non-limiting embodiments of the at least one heat transfer member <b>211</b> are described below with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-5</figref>. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the at least one heat transfer member may comprise a plurality of solid bodies <b>400</b> disposed within each coolant passage <b>206</b>. The solid bodies <b>400</b> may be spherical, as shown, or may have any other shapes (regular or irregular). The solid bodies <b>400</b> may further be of the same size or of different sizes. Each body <b>400</b> may be pressed against or bonded to an adjacent body and/or to the walls of the coolant passage <b>206</b> to facilitate robust heat transfer between the coolant passage <b>206</b> and bodies <b>400</b>. A coolant fluid may flow through the coolant passage <b>206</b> between interstitial spaces <b>402</b> formed between the bodies <b>400</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">Alternatively, as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the at least one heat transfer member may be a plurality of tubes <b>404</b> extending along the coolant passage <b>206</b> for flowing a coolant fluid therethrough. The plurality of tubes <b>404</b> may be pressed together, brazed together, or otherwise bonded for good thermal contact. The tubes <b>404</b> may be substantially parallel and aligned with the longitudinal axis of the coolant passage <b>206</b>. The tubes <b>404</b> may also be stacked in an ordered pattern as shown to maximize contact area between the tubes and each other and between the tubes and the walls of the coolant passage <b>206</b>. Any suitable stacking pattern and tube configuration may be utilized that provides sufficient heat transfer between the coolant passage <b>206</b> and a coolant fluid flowing through the tubes <b>404</b>. In some embodiments, interstitial spaces <b>406</b> between each tube <b>404</b> may be filled with a suitable material that improves thermal contact between adjacent tubes <b>404</b>, such as the material used for brazing or bonding the tubes <b>404</b> together.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">In embodiments where the at least one heat transfer member <b>211</b> is a fin, or fin-like member (e.g., as depicted in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-B</figref> and <b>3</b>A-B), features may be added to each member to preserve the gap between adjacent heat transfer members and, optionally, between heat transfer members and the sidewalls of the coolant passage <b>206</b>. Such features may include dimples, bumps, bonded shapes, bends in the member, or the like. For example, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, in some embodiments, adjacent heat transfer members (e.g., <b>500</b>, <b>502</b>) are formed of one-piece construction such that a beam <b>504</b> is formed between the heat transfer members <b>500</b>, <b>502</b>. In some embodiments, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, adjacent heat transfer members (e.g., <b>506</b>, <b>508</b>) are formed individually include one or more horizontal elements <b>510</b>, <b>512</b> separating adjacent heat transfer members. Although shown as formed on each heat transfer member <b>506</b>, <b>508</b>, the horizontal element may be provided solely between adjacent heat transfer members. In some embodiments, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, one or more of adjacent heat transfer members (e.g., <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>) may include one or more features (e.g., <b>518</b>, <b>520</b>) disposed in a vertical portion of the heat transfer member for facilitating separation therebetween. Such features may be a dimple or protrusion formed in the heat transfer member, or a separate component that may be bonded to the heat transfer member to form the protrusion. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, such features <b>518</b>, <b>520</b> on adjacent heat transfer members <b>514</b>, <b>516</b> can oppose each other thus facilitating separation of the adjacent heat transfer members. Other geometries and configurations of the heat transfer members and separation features may be satisfactorily utilized to maintain a desired spacing between adjacent heat transfer members (and, optionally, between heat transfer members and the sidewalls of the coolant passage).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">In some embodiments, the coolant passage <b>206</b> and/or the at least one heat transfer member <b>211</b> may be coated, or clad, with materials that may facilitate limiting the erosion and/or corrosion of the coolant passage <b>206</b> and/or the at least one heat transfer member <b>211</b>. Such materials may include polymeric coatings, electroless deposited nickel, a stainless steel layer hydrostatically pressed or brazed into the coolant passage <b>206</b>, a thin stainless steel tubing having the coolant passage formed thereabout, diamond-like carbon coatings, or the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">In operation, and referring to FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>A-B, heat transfer fluid enters the monolithic member <b>202</b>, and ultimately, the coolant passages <b>206</b>, via an inlet <b>154</b>, and exits via an outlet <b>156</b>. In some embodiments, the heat transfer fluid may contain little or no dissolved oxygen or oxidizing agents contained therein, thereby limiting erosion and/or corrosion of the coolant passage <b>206</b> and/or the at least one heat transfer member <b>211</b> contained therein. In some embodiments, the heat transfer fluid contains less than about 0.1 ppm oxygen equivalent of oxidizing agents. Water with reduced dissolved oxygen may be obtained by vacuum degassing, boiling, membrane filtration, and nitrogen sparging. In some embodiments, the heat transfer fluid may include reducing agents, such as tannis, hydrazine, hydroquinone/progallol-based derivatives, hydroxylamine derivatives, ascorbic acid derivatives, and other materials generally known in the boiler water treatment industry. The heat transfer fluid may be part of a closed loop, wherein the heat transfer fluid exiting the outlet <b>156</b> is cooled and reintroduced to the inlet <b>154</b>. Alternatively, new heat transfer fluid may be delivered to the inlet <b>154</b> continuously or mixed with recycled heat transfer fluid.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">The inlet <b>154</b> and the outlet <b>156</b> are fluidly coupled to each other via the plurality of coolant passages <b>206</b>. In addition, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each coolant passage <b>206</b> comprises an inlet <b>302</b> (coupled to the inlet <b>154</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and an outlet <b>304</b> (coupled to the outlet <b>156</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The heat transfer fluid enters each coolant passage <b>206</b> via the inlet <b>302</b> and exits each coolant passage via the outlet <b>304</b>. The inlets <b>302</b> and outlets <b>304</b> of the coolant passages <b>206</b> on each side of the plurality of lamps <b>212</b> may be respectively grouped into inlet and outlet plena (not shown) that are coupled to the inlet <b>154</b> and the outlet <b>156</b> of the lamphead to facilitate flowing the heat transfer fluid therethrough. The coolant passages <b>206</b> may be arranged in a parallel flow configuration such that heat transfer fluid enters each inlet <b>302</b> and exits each outlet <b>304</b> in a controlled fashion, thus facilitating uniform heat transfer in the monolithic member <b>202</b>. For example, the flow in each coolant passage <b>206</b> may be controlled by respective orifices or by flow controllers (not shown) coupled to one or more coolant passages.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">The flow rate of heat transfer fluid may be any suitable flow rate for controlling the heat transfer between the surface of the heat transfer members <b>211</b> (e.g., the fins <b>301</b>, <b>303</b>) and the heat transfer fluid flowing through the coolant passage <b>206</b>. In some embodiments, the flow rate is about 2 to about 3 meters per second. In some embodiments, the flow rate facilitates a laminar flow regime, which may facilitate a lower pressure drop across each coolant passage, thus requiring less energy for flow therethrough, and may minimize erosion and corrosion of the at least one heat transfer member <b>211</b> (e.g., the fins <b>301</b>, <b>303</b>) caused by turbulent flow. Thus, a laminar flow regime facilitates an improved temperature gradient between the surface of the at least one heat transfer member <b>211</b> (e.g., the fins <b>301</b>, <b>303</b>) and the heat transfer fluid, thereby improving heat transfer therebetween, while minimizing turbulence and minimizing the pressure drop across the coolant passage. The flow rate may be adjusted to facilitate laminar flow through each coolant passage <b>206</b> based on the configuration of the at least one heat transfer member <b>211</b> disposed therein. For example, the flow rate may be adjusted based on factors including the number of heat transfer members <b>211</b>, the spacing between each heat transfer member <b>211</b>, the profile of each heat transfer member <b>211</b>, and the like.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">In some embodiments, laminar flow may be desirable in embodiments of heat transfer members <b>211</b> having sinusoidal profiles (for example, fins <b>303</b>). For example, the heat transfer fluid may include impurities such as oxygen, which may react with the heat transfer member <b>211</b> via, for example, a turbulent flow of the heat transfer fluid proximate a bend in the sinusoidal profile. This reaction may form, for example, a metal oxide on the surface of the heat transfer member <b>211</b>, which may undesirably facilitate at least one of reduced heat transfer between the surface of the heat transfer member <b>211</b> and the heat transfer fluid, or erosion of the heat transfer member <b>211</b> due to loss of material via the metal oxide formation and removal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">Thus, embodiments of a lamphead and apparatus for processing a substrate have been provided herein. The lamphead includes a monolithic member having a plurality of coolant passages disposed therein and least one heat transfer member extending from the monolithic member into each coolant passage. The at least one heat transfer member disposed in each coolant passage may advantageously facilitate the rapid cooling of the monolithic member during a rapid thermal process (RTP), and may limit cyclical fatigue cracking in the coolant passages.</div>
