<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">For user verification and other purposes, many devices such as portable computers and cellular telephone include a fingerprint sensor. A fingerprint sensor, sometimes called a biometric sensor, senses a fingerprint of a finger place on the fingerprint sensor. The obtained fingerprint is compared to an authorized user's stored fingerprint. If there is a match, the user is verified.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">There are two commonly used fingerprint sensors in consumer applications. The first type of fingerprint sensor is a silicon die fingerprint sensor. The sensing element that senses the fingerprint is located on an active surface of the silicon die fingerprint sensor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">The second type of fingerprint sensor is a sensing element on flex fingerprint sensor. The sensing element that senses the fingerprint is located on a flexible dielectric substrate.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">To reduce the cost of the devices in which the fingerprint sensors are used, it is desirable to package the fingerprint sensors at low cost.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">Now in more detail, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a bottom plan view of a full cavity fingerprint sensor package <b>100</b> in accordance with one embodiment. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> are cross-sectional views of full cavity fingerprint sensor package <b>100</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> along lines II-II, III-III, IV-IV, respectively, in accordance with various embodiments. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a top plan view of full cavity fingerprint sensor package <b>100</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in accordance with one embodiment. Although <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>5</b> are referred to as bottom and top plan views, respectively, full cavity fingerprint sensor package <b>100</b> can be used in any orientation without respect to gravity. Accordingly, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</figref> are sometimes called the finger side plan view and the interconnect side plan view, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">Full cavity fingerprint sensor package <b>100</b>, sometimes called an electronic component package, includes a substrate <b>102</b> having a lower, e.g., first, surface <b>102</b>L and an upper, e.g., second surface <b>102</b>U.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">Upper traces <b>110</b> include terminals <b>114</b> upon which interconnection balls <b>116</b>, e.g., solder balls, are formed. Although not illustrated in the figures, substrate <b>102</b> can further include an upper solder mask on upper surface <b>102</b>U that protects upper traces <b>110</b> while exposing terminals <b>114</b>. In one embodiment, interconnection balls <b>116</b> are distributed in an array thus forming a Ball Grid Array (BGA).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">Lower traces <b>108</b> also include terminals <b>118</b>, sometimes called bond fingers. Although not illustrated in the figures, substrate <b>102</b> can further include a lower solder mask on lower surface <b>102</b>L that protects lower traces <b>108</b> while exposing terminals <b>118</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">Although a particular electrically conductive pathway is described above, other electrically conductive pathways can be formed. For example, contact metallizations can be formed between the various electrical conductors.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">Further, instead of straight though vias <b>112</b>, in one embodiment, substrate <b>102</b> is a multilayer substrate and a plurality of vias and/or internal traces form the electrical interconnection between upper traces <b>110</b> and lower traces <b>108</b>. Further, instead of a BGA, full cavity fingerprint sensor package <b>100</b> can be formed as a Land Grid Array (LGA) or other style package.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">Paying particular attention now to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> together, full cavity fingerprint sensor <b>100</b> further includes a silicon die fingerprint sensor <b>120</b>. Silicon die fingerprint sensors are well known to those of skill in the art, accordingly, only a brief description of silicon die fingerprint sensor <b>120</b> is provided below.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">Silicon die fingerprint sensor <b>120</b> includes an active surface <b>122</b>, an opposite inactive surface <b>124</b>, and sides <b>126</b> extending perpendicularly between active surface <b>122</b> and inactive surface <b>124</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">Silicon die fingerprint sensor <b>120</b> further includes a sensing element <b>128</b> and bond pads <b>130</b> on active surface <b>122</b>.

Bond pads <b>130</b> are electrically connected to the internal circuitry of silicon die fingerprint sensor <b>120</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">Silicon die fingerprint sensor <b>120</b> is mounted within fingerprint sensor cavity <b>104</b> of substrate <b>102</b>. More particularly, active surface <b>122</b> is parallel to and coplanar with lower surface <b>102</b>L of substrate <b>102</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">In one embodiment, a removable tape is applied to lower surface <b>102</b>L of substrate <b>102</b> and seals fingerprint sensor cavity <b>104</b> at lower surface <b>102</b>L. Silicon die fingerprint sensor <b>120</b> is placed, active surface <b>122</b> down, upon the removable tape.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">A package body <b>132</b>, e.g., mold compound, epoxy or other reliable material, is formed around silicon die fingerprint sensor <b>120</b> and fills fingerprint sensor cavity <b>104</b>. More particularly, package body <b>132</b> encapsulates, sometimes called encloses, covers or encases, inactive surface <b>124</b> and sides <b>126</b> of silicon die fingerprint sensor <b>120</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">Further, package body <b>132</b> encapsulates fingerprint sensor cavity sidewall <b>106</b> and a portion of upper surface <b>102</b>U of substrate <b>102</b> adjacent fingerprint sensor cavity <b>104</b>.

Accordingly, the removable tape is removed thus exposing active surface <b>122</b> including sensing element <b>128</b> and bond pads <b>130</b>. Thus, active surface <b>122</b>, lower surface <b>102</b>L of substrate <b>102</b>, and a lower, e.g., first, surface <b>132</b>L of package body <b>132</b> are parallel to and coplanar with one another.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">Bond pads <b>130</b> are electrically connected to terminals <b>118</b> of lower traces <b>108</b> by bond wires <b>134</b>.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">A protective coating <b>136</b> is applied to cover the lower surface <b>100</b>L of full cavity fingerprint sensor <b>100</b>. More particularly, protective coating <b>136</b>, e.g., a dielectric protective epoxy or nonconductive ink, is applied to cover active surface <b>122</b> including sensing element <b>128</b> and bond pads <b>130</b> of silicon die fingerprint sensor <b>120</b>. Further, protective coating <b>136</b> is applied to lower surface <b>132</b>L of package body <b>132</b>. Further, protective coating <b>136</b> is applied to cover lower surface <b>102</b>L of substrate <b>102</b> including lower traces <b>118</b>.

In either case, bezel <b>138</b> can be colored as desired by selecting an appropriately colored conductive ink.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">Bezel <b>138</b> is electrically connected to vias <b>112</b>. During use, the respective interconnection balls <b>116</b> are electrically connected to a reference voltage source, e.g., ground. Accordingly, bezel <b>138</b> is electrically connected to the reference voltage source, e.g., ground. Thus, bezel <b>138</b> discharges electrostatic discharge (ESD) from a finger contacting full cavity fingerprint sensor package <b>100</b>.</div>
