<heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Market demand for smaller and more functional electronic devices has driven the development of semiconductor devices, including semiconductor packages, and entire systems including multichip packages or stacks of packages. The space available inside the electronic devices is limited, particularly as the electronic devices are made smaller. Stacked packages, especially package-on-package (PoP) techniques are one approach in today's packaging technology to cope with reduced board space.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">Both the manufacturers and the consumers of electronic devices desire devices that are reduced in size and yet have increased device functionality.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. In this regard, directional terminology, such as “top,” “bottom,” “front,” “back,” “leading,” “trailing,” “upper,” “lower,” etc., is used with reference to the orientation of the figure(s) being described. Because components of embodiments can be positioned in a number of different orientations, the directional terminology is used for purposes of illustration and is in no way limiting. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural or logical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following detailed description, therefore, is not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">It is to be understood that the features of the various exemplary embodiments described herein may be combined with each other, unless specifically noted otherwise.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">As employed in this specification, the terms “coupled” and/or “electrically coupled” are not meant to mean that the elements must be directly coupled together; intervening elements may be provided between the “coupled” or “electrically coupled” elements.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">Packages and devices with semiconductor chips are described below. The semiconductor chips may be of different types, may be manufactured by different technologies and may include for example, integrated electrical, electro-optical or electro-mechanical circuits and/or passive devices. The semiconductor chips may, for example, be designed as logic integrated circuits, analog integrated circuits, mixed signal integrated circuits, memory circuits or integrated passive devices. They may include control circuits, microprocessors or microelectromechanical components. By way of example, a semiconductor chip may be a baseband chip used in mobile communications devices. Further, they may include power semiconductor devices, such as power MOSFETs (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors), IGBTs (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors), JFETs (Junction Gate Field Effect Transistors), power bipolar transistors or power diodes. In particular, semiconductor chips having a vertical structure may be involved, that is to say that the semiconductor chips may be fabricated in such a way that electric currents can flow in a direction perpendicular to the main faces of the semiconductor chips. A semiconductor chip having a vertical structure may have contact elements, in particular, on its two main faces, that is to say on its top side and bottom side. In particular, power semiconductor chips may have a vertical structure. By way of example, the source electrode and gate electrode of a power MOSFET may be situated on one main face, while the drain electrode of the power MOSFET is arranged on the other main face. Furthermore, the devices described below may include integrated circuits to control the integrated circuits of other semiconductor chips, for example, the integrated circuits of power semiconductor chips. The semiconductor chips need not be manufactured from specific semiconductor material, for example, Si, SiC, SiGe, GaAs, AlGaAs and, furthermore, may contain inorganic and/or organic materials that are not semiconductors, such as, for example, insulators, plastics or metals.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">The devices described below include external contact pads on the package. The contact pads may represent external terminals of the package. They may be accessible from outside the package and may thus allow electrical contact to be made with the semiconductor chips from outside the package. Furthermore, the (external) contact pads may be thermally conductive and may serve as heat sinks for dissipating the heat generated by the semiconductor chip. The contact pads may be composed of any desired electrically conductive material, for example, of a metal, such as copper, aluminum or gold, a metal alloy or an electrically conductive organic material. Solder material, such as solder balls or solder bumps, may be deposited on the external contact pads.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">The semiconductor chips, or at least parts of the semiconductor chips, are covered with an encapsulant which may be electrically insulating. The encapsulant may be a dielectric material and may be made of any appropriate duroplastic, thermoplastic or thermosetting material or laminate (prepreg). The encapsulant may contain filler materials. After its deposition, the encapsulant may be only partially hardened and may be completely hardened after application of energy (e.g., heat, UV light, etc.). Various techniques may be employed to cover the semiconductor chips with the encapsulant, for example, compression molding, injection molding, powder molding, liquid molding, dispensing or laminating.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">The encapsulant may be used to produce so-called fan-out type packages. In a fan-out type package, at least some of the external contact pads and/or conductor tracks electrically connecting the semiconductor chip to the external contact pads are located laterally outside of the outline of the semiconductor chip or at least intersect the outline of the semiconductor chip. Thus, in fan-out type packages, a peripherally outer part of the package of the semiconductor chip is typically (additionally) used for electrically bonding the package to external applications, such as, e.g., application boards or, in stacked package applications, other packages. This outer part of the package encompassing the semiconductor chip effectively enlarges the contact area of the package in relation to the footprint of the semiconductor chip, thus leading to relaxed constraints in view of package pad size and pitch with regard to later processing, e.g., second level assembly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022">Portions of the encapsulant may be removed, for example, in order to create one or more recesses, through-holes or trenches in the encapsulant. Removing the encapsulant may be carried out by using a laser beam or a water jet, mechanical sawing using a saw or a cutter, chemical etching, milling or any other appropriate method. In the recesses, through-holes or trenches, electrically conductive material may be deposited, for example, in order to create one or more through-connections. The through-connections may extend from a first face of the encapsulant to a second face of the encapsulant. The through-connections are electrically conductive and may electrically couple an electrically conductive layer on the first face to an electrically conductive layer on the second face of the encapsulant of the package. The through-connections may, for example, be vias (vertical interconnect access).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">The recesses, through-holes or trenches may, for example, be filled with a paste containing metal particles. The metal particles may, for example, be made of silver, gold, copper, tin or nickel. The metal particles may be dispersed in a suitable liquid or solvent. After their application, the metal particles may be heated and thereby sintered. Apart from the recesses, through-holes and trenches, the metal particles may be deposited onto any other surface of the encapsulant.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">One or more metal layers may be placed over the encapsulant and/or the semiconductor chip embedded in the encapsulant. The metal layers may, for example, be used to produce a redistribution layer within a conductive redistribution structure. The metal layers may be used as wiring layers to make electrical contact with the semiconductor chips from outside the package and/or to make electrical contact with other semiconductor chips and/or components contained in the package. The metal layers may be manufactured with any desired geometric shape and any desired material composition. The metal layers may, for example, be composed of conductor tracks, but may also be in the form of a layer covering an area. They may be used to provide the contact pads of the package. Any desired metal, for example, aluminum, nickel, palladium, silver, tin, gold or copper, or metal alloys may be used as the material. The metal layers need not be homogenous or manufactured from just one material, that is to say various compositions and concentrations of the materials contained in the metal layers are possible. Thin-film technologies may be applied to generate and/or structure the metal layers. Furthermore, the metal layers may be arranged above or below or between electrically insulating layers forming part of the conductive redistribution structure. An insulating layer overlaying a metal layer may be used as a solder stop of the contact pads.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1F</figref> schematically illustrate a method of manufacturing a semiconductor package <b>100</b> (see also <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). In a first step (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>), a (temporary) carrier <b>1</b> is provided. The carrier <b>1</b> may be rigid or may be flexible to a certain degree and may be fabricated from materials such as metals, metal alloys, silicon, glass or plastics. An adhesive tape <b>2</b> may be laminated on the carrier <b>1</b>. The adhesive tape <b>2</b> may be a double sided sticky tape. Alternatively, a glue material or any other adhesive material or mechanical securing means (such as a clamping device or a vacuum generator) may be associated with the carrier <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">At least two semiconductor chips <b>10</b> are provided and placed on the carrier <b>1</b>. Further, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, via bars <b>11</b> may be placed on the carrier <b>1</b> in spacings between adjacent semiconductor chips <b>10</b>. The via bars <b>11</b> may include an envelope <b>11</b> <i>a </i>which may be made of an insulating material and at least one conducting element <b>11</b> <i>b </i>running through the envelope <b>11</b> <i>a</i>. By way of example, PCB (printed circuit board) via bars <b>11</b> may be used. In PCB via bars <b>11</b>, the insulating material of the envelope <b>11</b> <i>a </i>may be made of epoxy resin. The semiconductor chips <b>10</b> and the via bars <b>11</b> are fixed on the carrier <b>1</b> by means of the adhesive tape <b>2</b> or other appropriate equipment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">The distance between neighboring semiconductor chips <b>10</b> may be in the range of between 200 μm and 10 mm. It is to be noted that throughout <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1F</figref>, only a partial section of a semiconductor chip array or “artificial wafer” is illustrated, that is to say in practice, typically many more than two semiconductor chips <b>10</b> are placed on the carrier <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">Semiconductor chips <b>10</b> may have contact elements <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> on a lower main chip surface <b>12</b> facing the carrier <b>1</b>. If the semiconductor chip <b>10</b> is a logic integrated circuit, typically several tens of contact elements <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> are arranged on the lower main chip surface <b>12</b>. The lower main chip surface <b>12</b> typically forms the active surface of the semiconductor chip <b>10</b>. If the semiconductor chips <b>10</b> are power transistors, the contact element <b>14</b> may, e.g., be a source terminal and the contact element <b>15</b> may, e.g., be a gate terminal.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">An electrically insulating molding material or encapsulant <b>18</b> is applied to the semiconductor chips <b>10</b> and the carrier <b>1</b>, see <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. The encapsulant <b>18</b> may be used to encapsulate the semiconductor chips <b>10</b> except their lower main chip surfaces <b>12</b> containing the contact elements <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>. The encapsulant <b>18</b> may be an epoxy or another appropriate material used in contemporary semiconductor packaging technology. It may also be a photoresist such as SU8, which is epoxy-based. The encapsulant <b>18</b> may be composed of any appropriate thermoplastic or thermosetting material. After curing, the encapsulant <b>18</b> provides stability to the array of semiconductor chips <b>10</b> and via bars <b>11</b>. Various techniques may be employed to cover the semiconductor chips <b>10</b> and via bars <b>11</b> with the encapsulant <b>18</b>, for example, compression molding or injection molding.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">By way of example, in a compression molding process the liquid encapsulant <b>18</b> is dispensed into an open lower mold half of which the carrier <b>1</b> forms the bottom. Then, after dispensing the liquid encapsulant <b>18</b>, an upper mold half is moved down and spreads out the liquid encapsulant <b>18</b> until a cavity between the carrier <b>1</b> forming the bottom of the lower mold half and the upper mold half is completely filled. This process may be accompanied by the application of heat and pressure. After curing, the encapsulant <b>18</b> is rigid and forms a molded body. The larger the lateral size of the molded body (“molded reconstituted wafer”) and the number of embedded chips <b>10</b>, the more cost efficient the process will typically be.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">As may be seen from <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the semiconductor chips <b>10</b> may be completely overmolded, i.e., completely covered by encapsulant <b>18</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">In a subsequent step, the encapsulant <b>18</b> is released from the carrier <b>1</b>. To this end, the adhesive tape <b>2</b> may feature thermo-release properties, which allow the removal of the adhesive tape <b>2</b> during a heat treatment. The removal of the adhesive tape <b>2</b> from the encapsulant <b>18</b> including the semiconductor chips <b>10</b> and via bars <b>11</b> is carried out at an appropriate temperature which depends on the thermo-release properties of the adhesive tape <b>2</b> and is usually higher than 150° C., in particular, approximately 200° C. The encapsulant <b>18</b> is also referred to as an “artificial wafer” or “reconstituted wafer” in the art. The encapsulant <b>18</b> may, e.g., be disc-shaped having a diameter of, e.g., 200 or 300 mm, or may have any other shape such as a polygonal shape and the same or other lateral dimensions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">Further to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, the molded body is thinned (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>). Thinning is usually performed after the release of the encapsulant <b>18</b> from the carrier <b>1</b>. Grinding or lapping machines may be used that are similar or identical to the machines used for semiconductor wafer grinding or lapping in frontend technology. Alternatively, etching may be used to reduce the thickness of the encapsulant <b>18</b>. Thinning of the encapsulant <b>18</b> may be continued at least until the upper main surface of the via bars <b>11</b> is exposed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">By way of example, the encapsulant <b>18</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> may have a thickness of about a couple of hundred micrometers, e.g., more than 300 μm, 500 μm, 800 μm or even more than 1000 μm. The thickness of the encapsulant <b>18</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is greater than the thickness of the semiconductor chips <b>10</b>. As semiconductor wafers are often fabricated with a thickness of about 500 μm or 1000 μm, and may be ground in frontend processes to be as small as about 200 μm or even less, the thickness of the semiconductor chip <b>10</b> may be, e.g., in a range of about 100 μm to 1000 μm. As an specific example, the encapsulant <b>18</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> may have a thickness of about 800 μm, the semiconductor chips <b>10</b> may have a thickness of about 250 μm and the via bars <b>11</b> may have a thickness of about 300 μm. After thinning (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>), the thickness of the encapsulant <b>18</b> may be reduced to about 280 μm, and the upper surface of the encapsulant <b>18</b> may be planar.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1D to 1F</figref> illustrate method steps to produce conductive redistribution structures <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> on both main faces of the encapsulant <b>18</b>. First, the conductive redistribution structure <b>20</b> on the lower main face of the encapsulant <b>18</b> and the lower main surface <b>12</b> of the semiconductor chip <b>10</b> may be generated. These surfaces may be arranged flush with each other, that is the conductive redistribution structure <b>20</b> may be generated on a planar surface. The conductive redistribution structure <b>20</b> may include a first polymer layer <b>21</b>, a second polymer layer <b>22</b> and a metal layer <b>23</b> arranged between the first polymer layer <b>21</b> and the second polymer layer <b>22</b>, see also <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">The first polymer layer <b>21</b> may be deposited to cover the lower main face of the encapsulant <b>18</b> and the lower main faces <b>12</b> of the semiconductor chips <b>10</b>. The thickness of the first polymer layer <b>21</b> may be between 2 and 10 μm, typically about 5 μm. A standard CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) process or spin coating process may be used. The first polymer layer <b>21</b> may be made of a photoresist or of any other etching resist.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">The first polymer layer <b>21</b> is structured. Structuring may be accomplished by photolithographic techniques known in the art. During structuring, through-holes <b>21</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>21</b>.<b>2</b> and <b>21</b>.<b>3</b> are generated in the first polymer layer <b>21</b>. At the bottom of through-holes <b>21</b>.<b>1</b> and <b>21</b>.<b>2</b>, the chip contact elements <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> are exposed. At the bottom of through-hole <b>21</b>.<b>3</b>, the conductive element <b>11</b> <i>b </i>of the via bar <b>11</b> is exposed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">In a next step, the metal layer <b>23</b> is applied onto the first polymer layer <b>21</b> and structured. In through-holes <b>21</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>21</b>.<b>2</b> and <b>21</b>.<b>3</b>, the metal layer <b>23</b> makes contact to the chip contact elements <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> and the conductive element <b>11</b> <i>b</i>, respectively.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">Many techniques are available to generate the structured metal layer <b>23</b>, inter alia galvanic deposition, electroless deposition, printing etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">The second polymer layer <b>22</b> is deposited over the metal layer <b>23</b>. The second polymer layer <b>22</b> may be made of the same material as the first polymer layer <b>21</b> and the thickness of the second polymer layer <b>22</b> may be in the same range as the thickness of the first polymer layer <b>21</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">The second polymer layer <b>22</b> is then structured by, e.g., photolithographic techniques to provide for openings <b>22</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>22</b>.<b>2</b>. The external contact members <b>25</b>, e.g., solder balls, are then applied (e.g., so-called solder ball attach). Through the openings <b>22</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>22</b>.<b>2</b>, contact is made between external contact members <b>25</b> (e.g., solder balls) and the metal layer <b>23</b>. The metal layer <b>23</b> connecting the contact elements <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> of the semiconductor chips <b>10</b> to the external contact members <b>25</b> of the semiconductor package <b>100</b> is often referred to as a redistribution layer in the art.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">The conductive redistribution structure <b>30</b> on the upper main face of the encapsulant <b>18</b> may be generated the same way as the conductive redistribution structure <b>20</b>. Similar to the lower main face <b>12</b>, the upper main face of the encapsulant <b>18</b> may be planar. The conductive redistribution structure <b>30</b> may include a metal layer <b>33</b> (corresponding to the metal layer <b>23</b>) and a polymer layer <b>32</b> (corresponding to the second polymer layer <b>22</b>) overlying the metal layer <b>33</b>. The metal layer <b>33</b> may be made of the same materials as and structured similar to the metal layer <b>23</b>. The metal layer <b>33</b> includes structures which are electrically connected (e.g., through via bars <b>11</b>) to contact elements <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> of the semiconductor chip <b>10</b> and may form contact pads <b>50</b> of the semiconductor package <b>100</b>. The polymer layer <b>32</b> includes openings <b>32</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>32</b>.<b>2</b> through which the contact pads <b>50</b> may be electrically connected to external contact members (e.g., solder balls) <b>35</b> of another semiconductor package <b>300</b> to be mounted on semiconductor package <b>100</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The polymer layer <b>32</b> may optionally form a solder stop layer which may be effective in a reflow process when mounting the semiconductor package <b>300</b> on semiconductor package <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">It is to be noted that the method steps used to generate the conductive redistribution structures <b>20</b>, <b>30</b> may be thin-film processing steps using techniques such as CVD, spin coating, galvanic plating, electroless plating, printing, photolithography etc. These steps form part of the so-called backend fabrication process, i.e., are fabrication steps which are applied after the integrated circuits of the semiconductor chips <b>10</b> have been finished and tested on wafer level (so-called frontend processing). It is to be noted that the backend processing steps illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1D and 1E</figref> may still be performed on an artificial wafer level, i.e., before the separation of the artificial wafer into single semiconductor packages <b>100</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">The separation of the artificial wafer into single semiconductor packages <b>100</b> may be performed along dicing lines or dicing streets <b>60</b>. Each semiconductor package <b>100</b> may contain one or more semiconductor chips <b>10</b>. By way of example, separation may be performed by mechanical dicing (e.g., blade sawing, cutting, water-jet separation), chemical dicing (e.g., etching) or laser dicing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2E</figref> schematically illustrate one embodiment of a method of manufacturing a semiconductor package <b>200</b>. In a first step, semiconductor chips <b>10</b> are placed and fixed on a carrier <b>1</b> and are overmolded by an encapsulant <b>18</b>. Optionally, the encapsulant <b>18</b> may then be thinned. In order to avoid reiteration, reference is made to the description of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref>. The method steps used for generating the overmolded array of semiconductor chips <b>10</b> shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> may only distinguish from the method steps shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref> in that no via bars <b>11</b> are used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">The dielectric material of the encapsulant <b>18</b> may be structured as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. A plurality of recesses <b>18</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>18</b>.<b>2</b>, <b>18</b>.<b>3</b> (or cutouts or through-holes or trenches) are created in the dielectric material of the encapsulant <b>18</b> to expose at least portions of contact elements <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> of the semiconductor chip <b>10</b>. The contact elements <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, <b>16</b> are contact pads of the semiconductor chip <b>10</b> and may be located at the upper main surface of the semiconductor chip <b>10</b>. Further, a recess <b>18</b>.<b>4</b> (or cutout or through-hole or trench) may be created in a region outside of the outline of the semiconductor chip <b>10</b> and may extend through the encapsulant <b>18</b> from one main face to the other main face thereof. Removing the encapsulant <b>18</b> may be carried out by using a laser beam or a water jet, mechanical sawing using a saw or a cutter, chemical etching, milling or any other appropriate method. If the encapsulant <b>18</b> includes photo-active components, the encapsulant <b>18</b> may also be photo-lithographically structured.

The seed layer may consist of a barrier layer and a starting layer for the electroplating. An electroless deposition method may be used to produce the seed layer as well. The seed layer may have a thickness of up to 1 μm and may, for example, be made of titanium, titanium containing alloy or chrome as barrier layer and, for example, copper as starting layer. The electrical conductivity of the seed layer may be used to galvanically deposit an electrically conductive layer, for example, a copper layer, on the seed layer. The copper layer may have virtually any desired thickness depending on the application and current requirements. By way of example, the thickness of the copper layer may be in a range between 2 μm and 15 μm. As an alternative to the galvanic plating process describe above, an electroless plating process such as electroless nickel-palladium plating may be used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">The conductive layer <b>40</b> may also be created by depositing a paste containing fine metal particles in the recesses <b>18</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>18</b>.<b>2</b>, <b>18</b>.<b>3</b>, <b>18</b>.<b>4</b> and on the planar upper surface of the encapsulant <b>18</b>, possibly after application of a seed layer. The seed layer allows a low resistance interconnection to the aluminum of the contact pads of the chip. The metal particles may, for example, be made of copper, silver, gold, tin or nickel or a metal alloy. The metal particles may be dispersed in a suitable liquid or solvent. The application of the paste containing the metal particles dispersed in the liquid may be performed by stencil printing, screen printing, ink-jet printing or other suitable printing technologies. As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the conductive layer <b>40</b> is a patterned layer, wherein patterning may be performed during deposition of the paste. After the application of the paste, the paste may be exposed to an energy (e.g., elevated temperature, etc.). If elevated temperature is used, it may be in the range from 100 to 300° C. and in particular in the range from 100 to 200° C. This temperature step causes the liquid in the paste to evaporate. Furthermore, the applied temperature may be lower than the melting temperature of the metal (when provided in macroscopic dimensions) of which the metal particles are made. Due to the temperature step, the metal particles may sinter and may thus form a solid metal conductive layer <b>40</b>. If a seed layer was applied prior to application of the metal particles it is removed by suitable process steps, using the possibly sintered metal particles as a mask for the seed layer.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">It is to be noted that packages <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> are fan-out type packages.

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">The semiconductor packages <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, or any other semiconductor packages having contact pads <b>50</b> on the upper semiconductor package surface, may be used for establishing package-on-package (PoP) devices. PoP devices typically include two or more packages, which are stacked one on top of the other. Packages <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> may be used as the lowermost or bottom package.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">PoP devices may be manufactured by the following process steps. First, the bottom semiconductor package <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> is placed into pre-applied solder paste on a mounting platform, e.g., a board (not shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Flux is applied to the contact members (e.g., solder balls) <b>35</b> of the upper or top semiconductor package <b>300</b>, and the top semiconductor package <b>300</b> is then placed on the bottom semiconductor package <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> such that the contact members <b>35</b> of the top semiconductor package <b>300</b> are aligned to contact pads <b>50</b> formed on the upper main face of the bottom semiconductor package <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>. During a reflow process, this package stack is then subjected to a temperature which is high enough to liquefy both contact members <b>25</b> and <b>35</b>. The bottom semiconductor package <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> is mounted on the mounting platform such as, e.g., a PCB by reflow soldering. Simultaneously, the top semiconductor package <b>300</b> is mounted to the bottom semiconductor package <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> by reflow soldering. The assembly of PoP devices is referred to as second level assembly in the art. It is often, but not necessarily, performed by a customer of the manufacturer of the bottom semiconductor package <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">The top semiconductor package <b>300</b> may be of various types and/or designs. It may include another semiconductor chip (not shown) and an encapsulant embedding this top package semiconductor chip. Further, it may include top package contact pads (not shown) on a lower main face of the top semiconductor package <b>300</b>, wherein the contact members <b>35</b> of the top semiconductor package <b>300</b> are attached to these top package contact pads.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">It is to be noted that when being placed on the bottom semiconductor package <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, typically not all of the contact members <b>35</b> of the top semiconductor package <b>300</b> will be in touch with the respective contact pad <b>50</b> beneath before the beginning of the reflow process. This is due to inevitable warpage of the bottom semiconductor package <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, the top semiconductor package <b>300</b> or different sizes of the contact members <b>35</b> (that is, e.g., variations in ball diameter). However, since those contact members (e.g., solder balls) <b>35</b> which are in touch with their respective contact pads <b>50</b> will collapse during the reflow operation, the top semiconductor package <b>300</b> will lower down by a certain extent during the reflow operation, causing all contact members <b>35</b> to get in touch with their respective contact pads <b>50</b> beneath to establish secure electrical contact in each case.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">Substantial warpage of the bottom and/or top semiconductor package <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> during reflow, however, may inhibit secure electrical contact between all of the contact members <b>35</b> of the top semiconductor package <b>300</b> and the respective contact pads <b>50</b> of the bottom semiconductor package <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a situation in which the bottom semiconductor package <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> and the top semiconductor package <b>300</b> show warpage of the same type, that is warpage in the same direction, whereby, however, the warpage of the top semiconductor package <b>300</b> is greater than the warpage of the bottom semiconductor package <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>. As a result, as the lower main face of the top semiconductor package <b>300</b> is more curved than the upper main face of the bottom semiconductor package <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, the gap between the two semiconductor packages <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> has a greater spacing at edge regions of the semiconductor packages <b>100</b>, <b>300</b>, <b>200</b> than at a central region of the semiconductor packages <b>100</b>, <b>300</b>, <b>200</b>. As a result, prior to the reflow operation, only the central contact member <b>35</b>.<b>1</b> (in practice, typically a number of central contact members <b>35</b> which, however, are represented in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> by one central contact member <b>35</b>.<b>1</b> for the sake of simplification) is in touch with the respective central contact pad <b>50</b> of the bottom semiconductor package <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>. After the reflow operation, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, although this contact member <b>35</b>.<b>1</b> has been collapsed to a spacing S<sub>min</sub>, the spacing S<sub>max </sub>at an edge region of the semiconductor packages <b>100</b>, <b>300</b>, <b>200</b> may still remain so large that the contact members <b>35</b>.<b>2</b>, <b>35</b>.<b>3</b> at the edge region will not make contact to the respective contact pads <b>50</b> on the bottom semiconductor package <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> during the reflow operation. As a result, a faulty PoP device is assembled.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">Similarly, contact failure may also occur if the bottom semiconductor package <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> and the top semiconductor package <b>300</b> show warpage of different type (e.g. the top semiconductor package <b>300</b> shows warpage in the other direction than the bottom semiconductor package <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>). In this case, the outermost contact members <b>35</b>.<b>2</b>, <b>35</b>.<b>3</b> may provide secure electrical contact with the respective contact pads <b>50</b> whilst the central contact member(s) <b>35</b>.<b>1</b> will not get in touch with the respective contact pad(s) <b>50</b> during the reflow process and will thus not establish electrical contact(s).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">It is to be noted that in practice, the type and degree of warpage of the top semiconductor package <b>300</b> is typically unknown to the manufacturer of the bottom semiconductor package <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>. By way of example, the top semiconductor package <b>300</b> may be a memory package, i.e., a semiconductor package embedding an integrated memory circuit such as, e.g., a RAM (random access memory). Although the functionality of this integrated memory circuit is well-known to the manufacturer of the bottom semiconductor package <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, and also some of the package specifications (e.g., the positions of the contact members <b>35</b>) of the top semiconductor package <b>300</b> are predetermined by the design of the bottom semiconductor package <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> and are thus known to the manufacturer of the bottom semiconductor package <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, the package type and/or the particular package design of the top semiconductor package <b>300</b> is typically unknown to the manufacturer of the bottom semiconductor package <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>. By way of example, the top semiconductor package <b>300</b> may, e.g., be designed as a flip-chip BGA (Ball Grid Array), a BoC (Board on Chip) wirebonded type package or a WLP (Wafer Level Packaging) fan-in or fan-out type package. These and other types and designs of packages exhibit quite different warpage behavior during reflow soldering, but may all be available as top semiconductor packages <b>300</b> for assembling PoP devices. That is, the manufacturer of the bottom semiconductor package <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> often has no influence on or knowledge of which type or design of top semiconductor package <b>300</b> will be used (e.g., by a customer or even by the manufacturer itself for future second level assembly). In other words, the manufacturer of the bottom semiconductor package <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> often may not predict the type and degree of warpage of the top semiconductor package <b>300</b> to be used and thus the variation of the spacing S between the stacked semiconductor packages <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> and <b>300</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">According to one aspect, the geometry of the spacing S between the bottom semiconductor package <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> and the top semiconductor package <b>300</b> is influenced by the size of the exposed contact pad area of the contact pads <b>50</b> at the upper main face of the bottom semiconductor package <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the relationship between the exposed area of a contact pad <b>50</b> and the collapsing height H (over contact pad <b>50</b>) of a solder ball <b>35</b> attached to the contact pad <b>50</b>. The exposed contact pad areas are given by the diameters d<b>1</b>, d<b>2</b> of the openings <b>32</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>32</b>.<b>2</b> of the polymer layer <b>32</b>, respectively. The larger the diameter d of the exposed contact pad area, the larger is the area which can be wetted by the liquid solder during reflow, and the lower is then the height of the collapsed contact member <b>35</b>, provided identical solder ball volumes are used. In other words, by increasing the diameter d of the exposed contact pad area, the spacing S between the bottom and top semiconductor packages <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> may be decreased. In other words, the top semiconductor package <b>300</b> will be brought down nearer to the bottom semiconductor package <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> when the diameter d of the exposed contact pad area is increased, that is H<b>2</b>&lt;H<b>1</b> if d<b>2</b>&gt;d<b>1</b>. By way of example, it has been found that an increase in diameter d from, e.g., d<b>1</b>=240 μm to d<b>2</b>=260 μm may yield a decrease in the spacing S of about 8 μm, that is H<b>1</b>−H<b>2</b>≈8 μm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">As stipulated in JEDEC, the Global Standards for the Microelectronics Industry, specific package specifications should be met by bottom semiconductor packages <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> of PoP devices. In the following, the exposed contact pad area is also referred to as a “landing pad.” Typical landing pad diameters d as of today are set out in Table 1.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">According to one aspect, the diameter d in micrometer of an exposed contact pad area of the contact pads <b>50</b> on the upper main face of the bottom semiconductor package <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> is designed to satisfy the relationship
<br/>
<i>d</i>≧(8/25)<i>x+</i>142 μm,  (1)
<br/>
wherein x is the pitch of the contact pads <b>50</b> in micrometer (see also the illustration of x in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>). Pitch x is also referred to as “ball pitch” in the art.
</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">According to relationship (1), the diameter d of the exposed contact pad area is significantly larger than the diameter d set out in Table 1 and recommended in the JEDEC standard. As a result of the increase of the diameter d of the exposed contact pad area, the collapsing height H of the contact members <b>35</b> is lowered during the reflow operation. More specifically, the difference between the two collapsed heights H<b>1</b> (when using today's small diameter d<b>1</b>) and H<b>2</b> (when using enhanced diameter d<b>2</b> according to relationship (1)) is the additional tolerance in warpage and contact member height (e.g., solder ball height), which can be compensated during second level assembly of the top semiconductor package <b>300</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">The effect is illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> the warpage of the bottom semiconductor package <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> and the top semiconductor package <b>300</b> is identical to the warpage of these packages in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The diameter of the openings <b>32</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>32</b>.<b>2</b> of the polymer layer <b>32</b> has been increased from d<b>1</b> to d<b>2</b>. As a result, the minimum spacing S<sub>min </sub>between the semiconductor packages <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> is reduced by H<b>1</b>-H<b>2</b>. The maximum spacing S<sub>max </sub>is reduced by the same quantity H<b>1</b>-H<b>2</b>. As a consequence, the outermost contact members <b>35</b>.<b>2</b>, <b>35</b>.<b>3</b> may come into contact with the respective contact pads <b>50</b> during the solder reflow operation. Therefore, as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, secure electrical contacts are established between all contact members <b>35</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>35</b>.<b>2</b> and <b>35</b>.<b>3</b> and the respective contact pads <b>50</b>, in particular, also at the edge regions of the stacked PoP device. The interconnect yield during second level assembly is significantly improved, because larger warpage may be compensated.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">The PoP device may have a spacing S between the lower main face of the top semiconductor package <b>300</b> and the upper main face of the bottom semiconductor package <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> that varies by more than 8 μm, in particular, 10 μm, more in particular, 12 μm across the lateral extension of the spacing S. Generally, warpage of the upper main face of the bottom semiconductor package <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> and warpage of the lower main face of the top semiconductor package <b>300</b> may both contribute to the variation in spacing S of the PoP device. More specifically, the lower main face of the top semiconductor package <b>300</b> may, e.g., have a warpage height of at least 8 μm, in particular, 10 μm, more in particular, 12 μm across the lateral extension of the lower main face. Further, the upper main face of the bottom semiconductor package <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> may, e.g., have a warpage height of at least 8 μm, in particular, 10 μm, more in particular, 12 μm across the lateral extension of the upper main face.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067">This concept of increasing the diameter of the exposed contact pad areas <b>50</b> on the upper main face of the bottom semiconductor package <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> is likewise applicable for any type of warpage behavior. By way of example, if the top semiconductor package <b>300</b> exhibits a warpage in the reverse direction as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>, the outermost contact members <b>35</b>.<b>2</b> and <b>35</b>.<b>3</b> are those contact members <b>35</b> which are initially in touch with the respective contact pads <b>50</b> beneath, and will collapse down during reflow to a smaller height compared to the situation when a standard diameter of the exposed contact pad areas is used, resulting in that the contact member(s) <b>35</b>.<b>1</b> in the central region of the semiconductor package stack will then come in touch with the respective contact pad(s) <b>50</b> beneath and will thus provide secure electrical and mechanical contact therewith.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068">As known in the art, the TCoB (Temperature Cycling on Board) reliability of interconnect members (e.g., solder balls) will usually significantly impair on the reduction in height of these members. The reduction in TCoB reliability of interconnect members is caused by an increase of shear stress, which occurs when the height of the interconnect members between two bonded systems of a given difference of CTEs (Coefficient of Thermal Expansion) is reduced. As a matter of fact, the constraint of sufficient TCoB reliability typically severely limits the possibility of decreasing the height of interconnect members between bonded systems. However, regarding second level assembly of PoP devices, the difference between the CTEs of two semiconductor packages is typically small, even for semiconductor packages of different type or design (e.g., BGA, eWLB, BoC). Therefore, when reducing the spacing S between the bottom and top packages <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, <b>300</b> and thus the height of the (collapsed) contact members <b>35</b>, the TCoB-reliability is expected not to be significantly reduced compared to conventional PoP devices using standard landing pad areas as set out in Table 1.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a sectional view of a bottom semiconductor package <b>100</b> in which the diameter d of the exposed contact pad area is defined by the diameter of the openings <b>32</b>.<b>1</b>, <b>32</b>.<b>2</b> of the polymer layer (solder stop layer) <b>32</b>. This type of contact pad <b>50</b> is also referred to as solder mask defined contact pad.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0070">A non-solder mask defined contact pad <b>50</b> is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Here, the diameter d of the exposed area of the contact pad <b>50</b> is defined by the lateral dimensions of the metal layer <b>33</b> forming the contact pad, that is by the shape of the metal layer <b>33</b> itself. By way of example, the metal layer <b>33</b> may exhibit a circular region <b>33</b>.<b>1</b> of diameter d, which is connected to a conductor trace <b>33</b>.<b>2</b> of significantly smaller width than d. The circular region <b>33</b>.<b>1</b> of the metal layer <b>33</b> then defines the exposed area of the non-solder mask defined contact pad <b>50</b>. Throughout the specification and claims, the term “exposed contact pad area” and derivations thereof may relate both to a solder mask defined contact pad and a non-solder mask defined contact pad.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">In all embodiments, the exposed contact pad area must not be of circular shape but may be of any other suitable geometry, e.g., rectangular, polygonal etc. In this case, the meaning of d as used herein is to identify an exposed contact pad area of size (π/4)d<sup>2</sup>, i.e. a contact pad having the same exposed area as a circular exposed contact pad area of diameter d. As can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in non-solder mask defined contact pads <b>50</b> the polymer layer <b>32</b> does not overly the metal layer <b>33</b> at the circular region <b>33</b>.<b>1</b>, and thus does not define the size of the exposed contact pad area <b>50</b>. Especially if non-solder mask defined contact pads <b>50</b> are used (on the upper surface of the bottom semiconductor package <b>100</b>, <b>200</b> or on the lower surface of the top semiconductor package <b>300</b>), TCoB-reliability may not be reduced compared to the standard approach. The interconnect yield is then improved without any decrease in the TCoB-reliability.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0072">Possible diameters d of the exposed contact pad area are given in Table 2.
