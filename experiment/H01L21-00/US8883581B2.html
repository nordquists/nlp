<heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">Nitride semiconductor devices featuring high saturated electron velocities and wide band gaps have been actively developed as semiconductor devices of high voltage resistance and high output. A large number of reports have been made regarding nitride semiconductor devices such as field effect transistors, in particular, high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs). AlGaN/GaN HEMTs that use GaN in the electron transit layer and AlGaN in the electron donating layer are drawing much attention. According to AlGaN/GaN HEMT, strain attributable to the difference in lattice constant between GaN and AlGaN occurs in AlGaN. Piezoelectric polarization caused by the strain and spontaneous polarization of AlGaN generate high-concentration two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). Thus, high voltage resistance and high output are realized.</div>

<heading>DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">Embodiments will now be described with reference to the drawings. In the embodiments described below, the structures of compound semiconductor devices and the methods for manufacturing the compound semiconductor devices are both described.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">In the drawings referred to in the description below, the size and thickness of some constitutional components may not be relatively illustrated accurately for the sake of convenience.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0037">First, problems that typical nitride semiconductor devices face are discussed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038">In the cases where nitride semiconductor devices are used in power applications, the devices are desirably of a normally off mode in order for the devices to be compatible with existing systems and from the viewpoint of safe operation. However, for example, electron transit layers of AlGaN/GaN HEMTs have a very high electron concentration due to actions of strong piezoelectric polarization and spontaneous polarization and thus it is relatively difficult to form normally off AlGaN/GaN HEMTs. Presently, various techniques have been studied to make normally off devices. For example, various structures have been proposed such as a gate recess structure in which a gate electrode is formed so as to fill a recess formed in a compound semiconductor layer and a p-GaN cap structure in which a p-GaN layer is formed between the compound semiconductor layer and the gate electrode. Among these, a p-GaN cap structure is considered to be suitable for making normally off devices since the shift in threshold in the positive direction is large because of the p-type semiconductor layer that has an ability to lift the energy band.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">However, in a p-GaN cap structure, the presence of the p-GaN layer increases the distance between the gate electrode and the portion in which 2DEG is formed. Thus, problems arise such as deterioration of pinch off characteristics and a decrease in gm. Moreover, in order to ensure the electrical conductivity in the horizontal direction, parts of the p-GaN layer not located directly below the gate electrode are removed. Due to etching damage inflicted by the removal, deterioration of characteristics caused by traps such as current collapse has become a problem.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">The above-described problems are solved by compound semiconductor devices described as embodiments below. The compound semiconductor devices achieve a highly reliable normally off characteristic and a high gm characteristic without deterioration of characteristics caused by traps such as current collapse</div>
<heading>First Embodiment</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">In a first embodiment, a Schottky-type AlGaN/GaN HEMT is described as an example of the compound semiconductor device.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 2C</figref> are schematic cross-sectional views that sequentially illustrate the steps of a method for manufacturing an AlGaN/GaN HEMT of the first embodiment.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">First, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a semi-insulating SiC substrate <b>1</b> is used as a substrate for growing semiconductor layers of the HEMT. An i (intentionally undoped)-GaN layer <b>2</b> <i>a </i>and a p-GaN layer that forms a p-GaN portion <b>2</b> <i>b</i> <b>1</b> are sequentially formed on the SiC substrate <b>1</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">The substrate for growing the semiconductor layers of the HEMT may be a Si substrate, a sapphire substrate, a GaAs substrate, a GaN substrate, or the like instead of the SiC substrate. The substrate may be semi-insulating or electrically conductive.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">The i-GaN layer <b>2</b> <i>a </i>and the p-GaN layer that forms the p-GaN portion <b>2</b> <i>b</i> <b>1</b> are sequentially grown on the SiC substrate <b>1</b> by, for example, a metal organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) method. A molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) method may be employed instead of the MOVPE method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046">The i-GaN layer <b>2</b> <i>a </i>is formed by growing i-GaN to a thickness of about 3 μm, for example. The p-GaN layer that forms the p-GaN portion <b>2</b> <i>b</i> <b>1</b> is formed by growing p-GaN to a thickness of about 50 nm.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047">A mixed gas of a trimethyl gallium (TMGa) gas which is a Ga source and an ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) gas is used as a source gas for growing GaN. The flow rate of the TMGa gas is appropriately set and the flow rate of the NH<sub>3 </sub>gas is set to about 100 sccm to 10 slm. The growth pressure is about 50 Torr to 300 Torr and the growth temperature is about 1000° C. to 1200° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048">In growing p-type GaN, in other words, in forming a p-GaN layer that forms the p-GaN portion <b>2</b> <i>b</i> <b>1</b>, a p-type impurity, Mg, C, Zn, or the like is added to the source gas of GaN. For example, Mg is added to the source gas. In this example, a Cp2Mg gas containing Mg is added to the source gas at a particular flow rate so as to dope GaN with Mg. The Mg dopant concentration is about 1×10<sup>16</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>to about 1×10<sup>21</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, e.g., about 1×10<sup>19</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">After the p-GaN layer is formed, the p-GaN layer is heat-treated at about 400° C. to 1200° C., for example, at about 800° C. to activate the p-type impurity, Mg.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050">Next, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a back barrier layer <b>2</b> <i>b </i>is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">First, a resist is applied to the p-GaN layer and lithographically processed. As a result, a resist mask that covers a portion in the p-GaN layer (the portion that will form the p-GaN portion <b>2</b> <i>b</i> <b>1</b>) aligned with and below the position where a gate electrode is to be formed and that leaves the rest uncovered is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052">An impurity, such as argon (Ar), that deactivates the p-type impurity of p-GaN is ion-implanted through the resist mask at an acceleration energy of 15 keV and a dose of 1×10<sup>14</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>. The impurity that deactivates the p-type impurity may be boron (B), oxygen (O), phosphorus (P), iron (Fe), or the like instead of Ar. This ion implantation deactivates all parts of the p-GaN layer except in the position where the gate electrode is to be formed and produces p<sup>−</sup>-GaN to thereby make p<sup>−</sup>-GaN portions <b>2</b> <i>b</i> <b>2</b> and <b>2</b> <i>b</i> <b>3</b>. The ionized acceptor concentration in the p<sup>−</sup>-GaN portions <b>2</b> <i>b</i> <b>2</b> and <b>2</b> <i>b</i> <b>3</b> is lower than that of the p-GaN portion <b>2</b> <i>b</i> <b>1</b>. The resist mask is removed by an ashing process or a wet process that uses a particular chemical solution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053">A back barrier layer <b>2</b> <i>b </i>that includes the p-GaN portion <b>2</b> <i>b</i> <b>1</b> formed in the portion aligned with and below the position where the gate electrode is to be formed and the p<sup>−</sup>-GaN portions <b>2</b> <i>b</i> <b>2</b> and <b>2</b> <i>b</i> <b>3</b> formed on either side of the p-GaN portion <b>2</b> <i>b</i> <b>1</b> is thereby formed through the processes described above. In the back barrier layer <b>2</b> <i>b</i>, the p-GaN portion <b>2</b> <i>b</i> <b>1</b> contains a larger amount of ionized acceptor than the p<sup>−</sup>-GaN portions <b>2</b> <i>b</i> <b>2</b> and <b>2</b> <i>b</i> <b>3</b> in a unit area. That is, the p-GaN portion <b>2</b> <i>b</i> <b>1</b> is a portion with a high ionized acceptor concentration.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054">Next, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, an electron transit layer <b>2</b> <i>c</i>, an intermediate layer <b>2</b> <i>d</i>, and an electron donating layer <b>2</b> <i>e </i>are sequentially formed on the back barrier layer <b>2</b> <i>b. </i> </div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">Compound semiconductors that respectively form the electron transit layer <b>2</b> <i>c</i>, the intermediate layer <b>2</b> <i>d</i>, and the electron donating layer <b>2</b> <i>e </i>are sequentially grown on the back barrier layer <b>2</b> <i>b </i>by a MOVPE method. The electron transit layer <b>2</b> <i>c </i>is formed by growing i-GaN to a thickness of about 100 nm. The intermediate layer <b>2</b> <i>d </i>is formed by growing i-AlGaN to a thickness of about 5 nm. The electron donating layer <b>2</b> <i>e </i>is formed by growing n-AlGaN to a thickness of about 30 nm. The intermediate layer <b>2</b> <i>d </i>may sometimes be omitted. The electron donating layer <b>2</b> <i>e </i>may be formed of i-AlGaN.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">A mixed gas of a trimethyl gallium (TMGa) gas which is a Ga source and an ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) gas is used as a source gas for growing GaN. A mixed gas of a TMAl gas, a TMGa gas, and an NH<sub>3 </sub>gas is used as a source gas for growing AlGaN. Whether to supply TMAl gas or TMGa gas and the flow rate thereof are appropriately set in accordance with the compound semiconductor layer to be grown. The flow rate of the NH<sub>3 </sub>gas, which is a common material, is about 100 sccm to 10 slm. The growth pressure is about 50 Torr to 300 Torr and the growth temperature is about 1000° C. to 1200° C.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057">In growing n-type AlGaN, for example, in forming the electron donating layer <b>2</b> <i>e </i>(n-AlGaN), an n-type impurity is added to the source gas of AlGaN. In this example, a silane (SiH<sub>4</sub>) gas containing Si is added to the source gas at a particular flow rate, for example, so as to dope AlGaN with Si. The Si dopant concentration is about 1×10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>to about 1×10<sup>20</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>, for example, about 5×10<sup>18</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058">As a result, a compound semiconductor composite structure <b>2</b> including the sequentially stacked i-GaN layer <b>2</b> <i>a</i>, back barrier layer <b>2</b> <i>b</i>, electron transit layer <b>2</b> <i>c</i>, intermediate layer <b>2</b> <i>d</i>, and electron donating layer <b>2</b> <i>e </i>is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059">Next, an element isolation structure is formed. In particular, argon (Ar) is implanted in an element isolation region of the compound semiconductor composite structure <b>2</b>, for example. As a result, an element isolation structure is formed in the compound semiconductor composite structure <b>2</b> and a surface layer portion of the SiC substrate <b>1</b>. The element isolation structure defines the active region in the compound semiconductor composite structure <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">The element isolation may be conducted through a shallow trench isolation method, for example, instead of the implantation method.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">Next, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a source electrode <b>3</b> and a drain electrode <b>4</b> are formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">Ta/Al (Ta in the lower layer and Al in the upper layer) is used as an electrode material. In forming the electrodes, an overhang structure double layer resist suitable for a vapor deposition method or a lift-off method is used, for example. The resist is applied to the compound semiconductor composite structure <b>2</b> and a resist mask having openings at positions where the source electrode and the drain electrode are to be formed is formed. Then Ta/Al is deposited by, for example, a vapor deposition method, through the resist mask. The thickness of Ta is about 20 nm and the thickness of Al is about 200 nm. The overhang structure resist mask and Ta/Al deposited on the resist mask are removed by a lift-off method. Then the SiC substrate <b>1</b> is heat-treated in, for example, a nitrogen atmosphere at 400° C. to 1000° C., for example, at about 550° C., so as to cause the remaining Ta/Al to be in ohmic contact with the electron donating layer <b>2</b> <i>e</i>. In the cases where the Ta/Al and the electron donating layer <b>2</b> <i>e </i>are in ohmic contact with each other without conducting heat treatment, the heat treatment may be omitted. As a result, the source electrode <b>3</b> and the drain electrode <b>4</b> each constituted by Ta/Al are formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063">Next, as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, a protective film <b>5</b> that has an opening <b>5</b> <i>a </i>is formed on the surface of the compound semiconductor composite structure <b>2</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">In particular, first, SiN is deposited over the entire surface of the compound semiconductor composite structure <b>2</b>, the source electrode <b>3</b>, and the drain electrode <b>4</b> to a thickness of about 2 nm to 200 nm, for example, about 20 nm, by a plasma CVD method, a sputtering method, or the like to form a protective film <b>5</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">Next, a resist is applied over the entire surface of the protective film <b>5</b> and lithographically processed. As a result, a resist mask having an opening that exposes the position in the protective film <b>5</b> where the gate electrode is to be formed is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066">The protective film <b>5</b> is dry-etched through the resist mask by using, for example, a fluorine-based gas as the etching gas. As a result, the opening <b>5</b> <i>a </i>is formed at the position in the protective film <b>5</b> where the gate electrode is to be formed. The resist mask is removed by an ashing process or a wet process that uses a particular chemical solution.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067">Next, referring to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, a gate electrode <b>6</b> is formed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068">Ni/Au (Ni in the lower layer and Au in the upper layer) is used as an electrode material. In forming the electrode, an overhang structure double layer resist suitable for a vapor deposition method or a lift-off method is used, for example. The resist is applied to the protective film <b>5</b> and in the opening <b>5</b> <i>a </i>and a resist mask that has an opening that exposes the position where the gate electrode is to be formed as well as the opening <b>5</b> <i>a </i>is formed. Then Ni/Au is deposited by, for example, a vapor deposition method, through the resist mask. The thickness of Ni is about 30 nm and the thickness of Au is about 400 nm. The overhang structure resist mask and Ni/Au deposited on the resist mask are removed by a lift-off method. As a result, a gate electrode <b>6</b> that makes Schottky contact with the surface of the compound semiconductor composite structure <b>2</b> and fills the interior of the opening <b>5</b> <i>a </i>with the gate metal is formed. The gate electrode <b>6</b> is formed to have an overhang shape constituted by Ni that fills the interior of the opening <b>5</b> <i>a </i>and extends over the protective film <b>5</b> and Au deposited on Ni.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">Then electrical connection and the like are established among the source electrode <b>3</b>, the drain electrode <b>4</b>, and the gate electrode <b>6</b> so as to form a Schottky-type AlGaN/GaN HEMT.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0070">According to the AlGaN/GaN HEMT of this embodiment, the back barrier layer <b>2</b> <i>b </i>is formed below the portion of the compound semiconductor composite structure <b>2</b> where the 2DEG is generated. Because of the p-GaN portion <b>2</b> <i>b</i> <b>1</b> having a relatively high ionized acceptor concentration in the back barrier layer <b>2</b> <i>b</i>, a normally off mode is reliably realized. Moreover, since the position where the back barrier layer <b>2</b> <i>b </i>is formed is below the portion where 2DEG is generated, the distance between the gate electrode <b>6</b> and 2DEG is short and gm is improved. Since the surface of the compound semiconductor composite structure <b>2</b> is not dry etched, no etching damage occurs. Accordingly, the phenomenon (current collapse etc.) induced trapping caused by etching damage is suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">The back barrier layer <b>2</b> <i>b </i>includes the p<sup>−</sup>-GaN portions <b>2</b> <i>b</i> <b>2</b> and <b>2</b> <i>b</i> <b>3</b> on either side of the p-GaN portion <b>2</b> <i>b</i> <b>1</b>. According to a typical p-GaN cap structure, i.e., a structure in which p-GaN is embedded directly below the channel so as to form a concentration gradient in a horizontal direction, a process of re-growth is performed and a regrowth interface is generated. This interface is often exposed to the atmosphere outside the crystal growth system and causes various defects. During high-voltage operation of the device, these defects form leak paths, and there is a risk that the leak current may increase when power is switched off. In this embodiment, the p<sup>−</sup>-GaN portions <b>2</b> <i>b</i> <b>2</b> and <b>2</b> <i>b</i> <b>3</b> that are aligned below the spaces between electrodes (i.e., at positions other than that directly below the gate electrode <b>6</b>, for example, a position between the source electrode <b>3</b> and the gate electrode <b>6</b> and a position between the gate electrode <b>6</b> and the drain electrode <b>4</b>) are present. Thus, the semiconductor layer containing leak paths becomes depleted in regions in contact with the p<sup>−</sup>-GaN portions <b>2</b> <i>b</i> <b>2</b> and <b>2</b> <i>b</i> <b>3</b> and the electrons are excluded. Accordingly, the number of leak paths at the re-growth interface is reduced and satisfactory pinch-off characteristics can be obtained.</div>

<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0073">In the comparative example, the leak current is high during pinch-off and the maximum drain current (Id<sub>max</sub>) is low.
