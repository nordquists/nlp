<heading>BACKGROUND</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0003">The present invention relates to vapor deposition techniques for material growth and in particular relates to chemical vapor deposition growth of epitaxial layers of semiconductor materials.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0004">The term “vapor deposition” is used to refer to a number of techniques in which gas phase precursors condense or react to form a layer of a desired material on a substrate. Similarly, the phrase “chemical vapor deposition” (“CVD”) is often used to refer to a growth technique in which gas compositions react on a substrate surface to produce a desired product in the form of a high purity, high crystal quality epitaxial layer. Such layers are required for a number of semiconductor devices including, but not limited to, light emitting diodes (“LEDs”).</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0005">The physical and chemical characteristics of many semiconductor materials requires that their growth using CVD or related techniques be carried out at relatively high temperatures. For example, semiconductors such as gallium nitride (GaN) and associated Group III nitrides typically require CVD growth temperatures of at least about 600° C. Accordingly, the equipment used to carried out epitaxial growth must be able to generate, control and withstand such temperatures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0006">In relatively broad (but not limiting terms) a CVD reactor for epitaxial semiconductor growth typically includes a reaction chamber that can be evacuated to produce and control low gas pressures; a heating system; an inlet for reactant gases and an outlet for product gases; and some physical support (often a rotating support) for the substrate wafer(s) or wafer carrier(s) upon which growth will take place.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0007">Several broad categories of heating techniques and systems are typically used for chemical vapor deposition. These include, but are not limited to, radio frequency (induction) heating; radiative heating; and resistive heating. The present invention relates to resistive heating.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0008">Resistive heating is carried out by passing a current through a conductive filament, typically formed of particular metals, alloys, or other satisfactory materials (e.g. graphite). Although conductive, the filament is also selected so that a sufficient voltage applied to it will generate a current that heats the filament to relatively high temperatures. The filament will in turn heat the reactor, the growth substrate, and the reactants to the desired or necessary deposition temperatures.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0009">Each of these heating techniques has inherent advantages and disadvantages. Ease of application is one advantage provided by resistive heating. The resistive element—i.e., the filament—is placed in close proximity to the sample to be heated (typically a semiconductor wafer or a carrier for semiconductor wafers). Direct or alternating current is applied to the filament and, as noted above, the element becomes hot as a function of the resistance of the filament and the current flowing through it. As the filament increases in temperature, it in turn heats the sample based upon the temperature of the filament and the distance between the filament and the sample.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0010">Nevertheless, resistive heating also presents some inherent disadvantages. First, the filaments tend to expand at the high temperatures typically required for CVD. Such expansion frequently leads the filament to become distorted because of the difference in thermal properties (including coefficient of thermal expansion) between the filament and the various other components in the reactor. Such deformation can change the characteristics of the reactor's behavior from run to run and can reduce the lifetime of the heating assembly.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0011">Second, resistive heating often creates large thermal gradients across portions of the reactor assembly. For example, in resistive heated deposition reactors, temperature changes of 500° C. or higher can occur across distances as small as 3 inches (75 mm). These large gradients can lead to cracking in the components.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0012">Third, the electrodes that carry current to the filament are typically exposed to the growth environment and thus to the reactants, products, and by-products at high temperatures. As a result, undesired materials can accumulate on the electrodes and the electrodes can become electrically shorted to one another or to other components of the reactor.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0013">Fourth, in some types of systems, the filaments are permitted to move inside of the growth apparatus as they expand and can form undesired electrical shunts (short circuits) with other components in the reactor. Additionally, such expansion can cause undesired contact between different portions of the same filament. Although not necessarily causing a short circuit, such filament self-contact can change the current flow (and thus the temperature) though the filament and lead to loss of temperature control or early degradation. These problems can become exacerbated when, as is typical in many reactors, more than one filament is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0014">As another factor, the number of components required in a resistive heating assembly is relatively high providing a corresponding set of opportunities for component failure and overall difficulty.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0015">As a specific example, resistive-heated chemical vapor deposition is one technique used to grow epitaxial layers of Group III nitrides on silicon carbide (SiC) substrates. In turn, such multiple epitaxial layers of Group III nitrides form the basis for light emitting diodes and diode lasers that, because of the wide bandgap of the Group III nitrides, can produce high frequency emissions in the blue, violet and ultraviolet portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. In turn, the ability to produce light at these frequencies offers the further opportunity to either drive phosphors that will emit white light or to combine blue emitting diodes with those emitting red and green light to produce white light within the visible spectrum.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0016">In typical (but not limiting) techniques for growing Group III nitrides layers, a CVD reactor is typically used for between about four and five hours at a time to produce the desired layers of epitaxial growth. When one set is complete, the wafers or wafer carriers are removed from the chamber and are replaced with the next set of wafers upon which deposition is to be carried out. Each such cycle is commonly referred to as a “run,” and in conventional resistive-heated deposition reactors, between about 20 and 100 runs can be carried out before the chamber and its components must be cleaned, replaced, or both. Ordinary cleaning takes at least about two hours and more complex maintenance,</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0017">As in any production technique, of course, reducing the frequency of disassembling, cleaning, or maintaining equipment corresponds to an increase in productivity and efficiency.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0018">Accordingly, increasing the efficiency and throughput of such vapor deposition systems, and decreasing the frequency of maintenance and downtime, while maintaining the advantages of resistance heating, remains a worthwhile and desired goal.</div>
<heading>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">In one aspect, the invention is a conductive filament for resistive heating in vapor deposition that comprises a cathode contact and an anode contact, a plurality of concentrically adjacent arc-shaped portions between the contacts that define corresponding arc-shaped openings therebetween, a plurality of respective turns connecting pairs of the arc-shaped portions, with at least one of the turns having a width across the filament at the turn that is less than the width across the adjacent arc-shaped portions for reducing the difference in resistance between the inner and outer edges of the turn as current flows through the filament between the contacts.</div>

<heading>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0038"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a vapor deposition reactor broadly designated at <b>20</b>. Although the invention will be described with respect to the figures, those of skill in this art will recognize that a number of variations on the exact type and style of the reactor can be used while still incorporating the claimed invention. Accordingly, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and the other figures herein, are exemplary rather than limiting of the invention.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0039">The reactor <b>20</b> is generally cylindrical in shape and includes annular walls <b>21</b>, a circular floor or base plate <b>22</b>, and a circular top portion <b>23</b> that together define a chamber <b>28</b>. In the style of reactor illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the top portion <b>23</b> also includes a gas inlet <b>24</b> and a manifold broadly designated at <b>25</b> (sometimes referred to as a “shower head”) for more evenly distributing incoming gases into the chamber <b>28</b> and across the substrates <b>26</b> upon which deposition growth is to take place.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0040">The substrates <b>20</b> typically rest on a substrate support <b>27</b>, and because the substrates <b>26</b> are usually semiconductor wafers, the support <b>27</b> is a typically a wafer carrier (with indented portions to maintain the wafers in place). In turn, the wafer carrier <b>27</b> is supported on a spindle <b>30</b> that is driven by a motor <b>31</b> to rotate the wafer carrier <b>27</b> and the wafers <b>26</b> during deposition growth. Again, those of skill in this art are familiar with this technique, and will recognize that the rotation takes place over a wide range of speeds, from a few tens of revolutions per minute (rpm) to several thousand rpm, with 1000 rpm being typical.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0041">In order to heat the wafers <b>26</b>, the reactor includes at least one conductive filament <b>32</b> in the chamber <b>28</b> that is defined by the reactor walls. Although the term filament will be used herein, those of skill in this art will recognize that other terms such as “heating element” are likewise used to describe the same part and its same function.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0042">As illustrated herein, the filaments are substantially planar and circular in an overall (but not exact) sense. The planar design provides efficient heat transfer between the filament and the items or materials being heated, and the circular shape both matches the parameters of the reaction chamber and helps current flow more efficiently though the filament.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0043">At least one heat shield <b>33</b> (perhaps best illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>) is present in the chamber <b>28</b> between the filament <b>32</b> and the floor <b>22</b> of the reaction chamber <b>28</b> for reducing heating away from the growth area of the chamber. The heat shield <b>30</b> is thermally and chemically inert with respect to the other materials in the reactor, including the gas-phase reactants, products, and by-products. In one embodiment of reactors according to the invention the heat shield <b>33</b>, and typically a plurality of heat shields as described below, is supported by a plurality of heat shield supports <b>34</b>, which can also be referred to as “stand-offs.” The heat shield supports <b>34</b> are fixed, although not necessarily permanently, to the floor <b>22</b> of the reaction chamber <b>28</b> and to the heat shield or shields <b>33</b> for limiting the temperature-induced expansion movement, either horizontally or vertically, of the heat shield in any manner that prevents the heat shield <b>33</b> from coming into undesired contact with the filament <b>32</b> or with other portions of the reactor <b>20</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0044">In preferred embodiments, the reactor <b>20</b> will include at least two heat shields each of which may be formed of a material different from the other in order to obtain desired composite properties. For example, the heat shield closest to the filament <b>32</b> is selected or tailored for its heat resistance or reflectance properties, while those beneath and supporting the upper heat shields can be selected for other structural advantages. The heat shields are preferably formed of materials selected from the group consisting of molybdenum, titanium zirconium molybdenum alloy (“TZM”), tungsten, quartz, boron nitride, sapphire, and silicon carbide. The heat shields are placed in close proximity to one another with a 0.05-0.1 inch (1.2-2.5 mm) separation being typical. Spacers (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 4</figref>) between the heat shields maintain them in the desired positions.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0045">As at least partially illustrated by <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, reactant gases flowing into the chamber <b>28</b> through the inlet <b>24</b> and the manifold <b>25</b> are heated by the filament <b>32</b> as are the wafers <b>26</b>. Following the appropriate reaction and deposition, the by-product gases can exit the chamber <b>28</b> through a gas outlet <b>35</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0046"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also illustrates that each filament <b>32</b> in the chamber is in electrical contact with a respective pair of electrodes <b>36</b> and <b>37</b> that are also illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and other of the drawings. In normal fashion, one of the electrodes serves as the anode and the other as the cathode for applying either a direct or alternating current to the filaments to create the desired heating effect. In turn, the electrodes <b>36</b>, <b>37</b> are connected to an appropriate power supply (not shown) through the conductive fasteners <b>40</b> and <b>41</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0047"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also illustrates respective ceramic insulating covers <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> on portions of the electrodes <b>36</b> (which are typically formed of copper). The ceramic covers <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> on the electrodes prevent deposition reactants, products and by-products from undesirably contacting the electrodes during growth processes. By avoiding such contact, the covers <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> help prevent the creation of undesired shunts or short circuits between and among the electrodes and other items in the reactor <b>20</b> and thus increase the lifetime of the reactor between cleaning cycles and similar maintenance. Exemplary (but not limiting) materials for the covers <b>42</b>, <b>43</b> can include alumina, sapphire, and boron nitride.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0048"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the ceramic electrode covers as being a single piece that extends from the portions inside the chamber <b>28</b> through the floor <b>22</b> and toward or to the flanges <b>45</b>, <b>46</b>. It will be understood, however, that the ceramic insulators can also be comprise several separate portions, for example a portion inside the chamber <b>28</b> combined with a vacuum seal at the floor <b>22</b> to accomplish the same purpose.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0049">Although not illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, those of skill in this art recognize that chemical vapor deposition, particularly for high quality epitaxy, is carried out in optimized and carefully controlled reaction environments at both low and high pressures. Thus, the reactor <b>20</b> must be able to contain and withstand such low pressures and in turn the elements of the reactor <b>20</b> that have portions both inside and outside of the chamber <b>28</b> (such as the electrodes <b>36</b>, <b>37</b> and the spindle <b>30</b>) must be carefully sealed to avoid loss of control over the desired low-pressure environment. Accordingly, a vacuum collar <b>44</b> surrounds the spindle <b>30</b> to maintain the vacuum integrity of the chamber <b>28</b> and the flanges <b>45</b> and <b>46</b> are used for similar purposes to control pressure at the electrodes <b>36</b> and <b>37</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0050"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates these and other aspects of the invention in different and additional detail. First, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows that the reactor <b>20</b> typically includes at least two, and sometimes up to five, filaments. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an outer filament <b>47</b> and an inner filament <b>50</b> (the outer filament is also illustrated in more detail in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 11</figref>). The outer filament <b>47</b> includes respective anode and cathode contacts <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> and the inner filament includes anode and cathode contacts <b>53</b> and <b>54</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0051">The contacts in turn are physically and electrically connected to respective conductive straps, all of which are designated at <b>55</b>. The straps <b>55</b> provide a physical and electrical contact between the respective filaments <b>47</b> and <b>50</b> and the electrodes <b>36</b> and <b>37</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the conductive straps <b>55</b> have respective horizontal and vertical portions that form an L-shape for positioning the filaments <b>47</b>, <b>50</b> in electrical contact with the electrodes <b>36</b>, <b>37</b> other than in direct alignment with the electrodes <b>36</b>, <b>37</b>. This enables different sizes of filaments to be used in the same reactor without requiring the electrodes to be permanently or temporarily repositioned. In particular, the size and shape of the straps <b>55</b> can be selected to match a variety of filament sizes and shapes and to connect them with the electrodes <b>36</b>, <b>37</b> with relative ease. In preferred embodiments, the conductive straps <b>55</b> can be rigid or flexible and are formed such that they are of lower resistance than the filaments <b>47</b>, <b>50</b>. Since resistance is a function of both resistivity and geometry of the strap material, the low resistance is achieved through proper selection of material as well as proper design of the straps. Such low resistance of the straps in comparison to the filaments helps minimize excessive heating in the growth chamber at regions other than the growth area without the addition of water or other cooling to portions of the heating assembly within the growth chamber. Preferred strap material includes tungsten, molybdenum, and rhenium. Preferred materials include tungsten or rhenium.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0052"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also illustrates the heat shield supports <b>34</b> which in the illustrated embodiment are fastened to a mounting plate <b>57</b> that is annular in shape and that can be removed (along with the supports <b>34</b>) from the floor <b>22</b> of the chamber <b>28</b>. This permits another mounting plate that is otherwise of the same size, but that carries different heat shields and filaments, to be readily substituted in the reactor <b>20</b>. In another embodiment, the heat shield supports <b>34</b> may be connected directly to the floor <b>22</b> of the chamber <b>28</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0053"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also illustrates appropriate openings <b>60</b> through which bolts or other fastening devices can be inserted to fix the floor <b>22</b> of the reactor <b>20</b> to the annular walls <b>21</b> in the relationship illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The floor <b>22</b> may also be attached to the chamber <b>28</b> by means of clamps, straps, or other appropriate attachment mechanism.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0054"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates one embodiment of an outer filament <b>47</b> in greater detail. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the outer filament <b>47</b> in context above a plurality of heat shields <b>33</b>, three of which are illustrated. The filament <b>47</b> includes a cathode contact and an anode contact which are formed of openings adjacent one another in the annular filament <b>47</b>. In this embodiment, the filament <b>47</b> forms most of a continuous circle while defining a small gap illustrated at <b>60</b> along the circumference of the circle that separates the contacts from one another and provides a current path between the contacts when a voltage is applied to the filament <b>47</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0055">As is illustrated with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> and some of the other drawings, the contacts are in the form of small openings <b>61</b>, <b>62</b> through which conductive bolts <b>63</b> and <b>64</b> (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) are inserted to complete the electrical contact. As can be seen in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3.1</figref>, a cross-sectional view of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> taken along line <b>5</b>-<b>5</b>, the filament is bolted to the conductive strap via a conductive bolt. This assembly is isolated from the heat shields either via a suitably selected insulating material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0056">Also as illustrated with respect to <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> and some of the other drawings, the movement of the filament <b>47</b> is selectively restricted through the appropriate use of pins <b>67</b> inserted through holes <b>65</b> in the filament <b>47</b> and into insulating anchors <b>69</b> fixed loosely to one or more of the supporting heat shields <b>33</b>. In the combination of pins <b>67</b> and anchors <b>69</b>, one of the pin/anchor pair can be conducting, but not both. Some of these aspects are also illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> in which one of the pins <b>67</b> is shown in a cross-sectional view taken along lines <b>4</b>-<b>4</b> of <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, together with <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates that the filament <b>47</b> defines a plurality of closed plane curved openings <b>65</b>. These openings (which are curved, but do not necessarily form a single geometric curve such as an ellipse or a circle), receive the pin <b>67</b> therethrough. Because each opening <b>65</b> is bigger than the corresponding pin <b>67</b>, the plurality of openings <b>65</b> permit the filament <b>47</b> to move against but not beyond the pins <b>67</b> as the filament <b>47</b> expands and contracts. In a preferred embodiment, these openings are non-circular with the specific shape chosen by the ultimate filament temperature and filament geometry. The material of the pin/pin anchor combination should be chosen to prevent current from flowing from the filament, through the pin and the pin anchor, and subsequently into the heat shield. Accordingly, at least one of the pin and pin anchor pair should be made of an insulating material such as alumina, boron nitride, or sapphire. The other component may be made of a conductive material such as tungsten, TZM, molybdenum, or rhenium.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0057"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> also illustrates that the heat shields <b>33</b>, <b>33</b>′, and <b>33</b>″ are spaced apart from one another (to avoid conducting heating among them) and are maintained in the spaced relationship by respective insulating supports <b>38</b>. The pin <b>67</b> (which in other embodiments may be in the form of a nut and bolt) is also insulated with an insulating cover <b>39</b>. Alternatively, the pin <b>67</b> itself may be formed of an appropriate insulating material.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0058"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> illustrates the conductive connection in cross section and shows the conductive pin (or bolt) <b>63</b> along with the filament <b>47</b> and the heat shields <b>33</b>, <b>33</b>′, and <b>33</b>″. The conductive pin <b>63</b> is in contact with the strap <b>55</b> and is electrically insulated from the heat shields by the insulating cover <b>48</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0059"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates that in one embodiment, the filament <b>47</b> includes a plurality of tab portions <b>66</b> that extend outwardly from the perimeter of the annular filament <b>47</b> and with the non-circular closed plane curved openings <b>65</b> being located in the tabs for providing a less complex current flow path through the filament <b>47</b> in the presence of the openings <b>66</b>. Although in the illustrated embodiment (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) the filament <b>47</b> has four of the pin holes, it will be understood that this is illustrative rather than limiting and that a larger or smaller number of holes and pins can be used consisted with the function of permitting some, but not unlimited, free expansion of the filament during heating.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0060">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and elsewhere, in most embodiments the conductive filaments of the invention will have a flat rectangular cross-section. Although the invention is not limited to the flat cross-section, and other shapes can be used, the flat rectangular cross section provides an efficient structure for radiating heat towards the growth substrate, particularly in the presence of the heat shields.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0061">Similarly, filaments according to the invention are typically formed of a material selected from the group consisting of (but not limited to) tungsten, rhenium, graphite, boron nitride, nickel chromium, iron nickel chromium, and silicon carbide.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0062">The contacting pins <b>63</b> and <b>64</b> are formed of an electrically conductive material, while the pins <b>67</b> used to constrain expansion are preferably heat-resistant and electrically insulating to avoid interfering with current flow through the filament <b>47</b> and they likewise electrically insulate the filament <b>47</b> from the heat shield <b>33</b> and from other portions of the reactor <b>20</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0063"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> also illustrates some of the potential relationships between the heat shields <b>33</b> and the pins <b>67</b>. In particular, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a stack of three heat shields <b>33</b>, <b>33</b>′, and <b>33</b>″. These are also illustrated in cross-section in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. For a number of reasons, in the illustrated embodiments the top heat shield <b>33</b> is not physically attached to the pins <b>67</b>, but instead includes the numerous openings illustrated at <b>38</b> (only some of which carry reference numerals for clarity's sake) through which the pins <b>67</b> supporting the filaments extend. Not all of the openings <b>38</b> are necessarily associated with pins <b>67</b> whose purpose is to restrict the motion of the filament. Some of them are present to locate filament supports to physically support the filament in the vertical direction while having no intentional effect on the horizontal movement of the filament. In the locations <b>38</b> whose purpose is to fix the motion of the filament in the horizontal direction, the pins <b>67</b> can comprise the rivet-like arrangement (<figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) that passes through all three of the heat shields. Alternatively, (and not illustrated), one of the lower two heat shields <b>33</b>′ or <b>33</b>″ can form a structure in which the desired number of pins are fixed to its surface and extend upwardly. In either case, the top heat shield <b>33</b> fits over the upwardly extending pins <b>67</b> and rests upon the lower heat shields <b>33</b>′ and <b>33</b>″.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0064">There is no particular theoretical limit to the number of heat shields, but from practical standpoint two or three usually suffice to provide the desired combination of properties with five being a typical (but not absolute) maximum.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0065">Similarly, although there is no theoretical limit to the number of filaments in the chamber <b>28</b>, practical limitations make the use of between two and five most convenient. If each individual filament is individually controlled, the thermal profile generated by the filaments can likewise be controlled to in turn help control the overall thermal profile of the chamber during deposition growth. Such arrangements and adjustments are well understood by those of ordinary skill in this art and will not the otherwise described in detail herein.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0066"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates additional aspects of the invention, including the outer <b>47</b> and inner <b>50</b> filaments, the electrodes <b>36</b>, <b>37</b>, and the conductive straps <b>55</b>. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> also illustrates a pair of insulating strap covers <b>57</b> that are positioned on the horizontal portions of the conductive straps <b>55</b>. The insulating strap covers <b>57</b> protect the straps <b>55</b> from coming into contact with undesired materials that might otherwise cause a shunt or short circuit between the straps <b>55</b> themselves (and thus between the electrodes <b>36</b>, <b>37</b>) or between the straps and other electrically conductive portions of the reactor. In particular, given the rotation speed of typical wafer supports as described above, wafers can occasionally become dislodged from the wafer carrier. Given that such wafers are usually either conductive or semiconductive, they can strike the electrodes <b>36</b>, <b>37</b> or the straps <b>55</b> and create the undesired shunts or short circuits. Such a short circuit, of course, immediately ruins the ongoing run and can damage the straps, the electrodes or other parts of the reactor. The insulating strap covers <b>57</b> can be designed so as to insulate the vertical parts of the conductive straps <b>55</b> and electrodes <b>36</b>, <b>37</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0067"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates one embodiment of a conductive filament according to the present invention. The filament includes the cathode and anode contacts <b>53</b> and <b>54</b> in the form of small holes through which electrical contact can be made to the filament <b>50</b>. The filament is formed of a plurality of generally concentric and adjacent arc-shaped portions <b>70</b> between the contacts <b>53</b>, with the arc shaped portions <b>70</b> defining arc shaped openings in between.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0068">A plurality of turns <b>71</b> connect respective pairs of the arc shaped portions <b>70</b>. Each of the turns has a width across the filament <b>50</b> at the turn <b>71</b> that is less than the width across the adjacent arc-shaped portions <b>70</b> for reducing the difference in resistance between inner and outer edges of the turn <b>71</b> as current flows through the filament <b>50</b> between the contacts <b>53</b>, <b>54</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0069">Stated differently, because in most circumstances the filament <b>50</b> has a uniform composition throughout, the resistance through any portion of the filament is directly proportional to the length of that portion. As a result, because the length around the inner circumference of a turn <b>71</b> is less than the length around the outer circumference of a turn <b>71</b>, the resistance at the inside circumference of the turns <b>71</b> is less than the resistance at the outside circumference. As a result, current flows more easily along the inner circumference of the turns <b>71</b> than it does along the outer circumference. The difference in current flow can be significant and can cause a correspondingly significant temperature difference. In turn, the temperature difference across the turn <b>71</b> can cause the expansion, distortion, damage and degradation problems that the invention moderates or eliminates. Accordingly, incorporating the larger inner circumference indicated at <b>72</b> in each of the turns reduces the resistance difference, the current flow difference, and the temperature difference across the turn <b>71</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0070">As <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates, in typical embodiments the anode and cathode contacts <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> comprise openings adjacent one another and adjacent a small gap that defines the two ends of the filament for current flow purposes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0071">Accordingly, in the illustrated embodiment, which is exemplary rather than limiting, the filament includes eleven (depending upon how they are arbitrarily defined and counted) arc-shaped portions <b>70</b> and nine of the turns <b>71</b> with their enlarged openings <b>72</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0072"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> also illustrates that the conductive filament <b>70</b> has a cross-section in the form of a flattened rectangle and that the arc-shaped portions <b>70</b> are in a generally concentric arrangement with one another even though they do not necessarily define concentric circles in the absolute sense of that word.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0073"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> also illustrates that the filament <b>50</b> includes a plurality of pin openings <b>73</b> for receiving mounting pins therethrough that limit, but do not proscribe, the expansion movement of the filament <b>50</b> at high temperatures under the influence of current flowing through the filament. As set forth elsewhere herein, one of the problems in resistive heating is the distortion that results when filaments are completely fixed in place or completely free to expand in an uncontrolled manner. By incorporating the pin openings and pins (as described elsewhere herein), the present invention allows the filament to expand and contract in a controlled fashion that avoids the problems of both fixed filaments and unrestrained filaments.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0074"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 through 10</figref> illustrate other embodiments of the filament. In particular, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> illustrate filaments that are symmetric in some fashion. For example, in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> the filament <b>68</b> is symmetric across a mirror plane passing perpendicularly through the electrode openings <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> and the respective turns <b>71</b>. A symmetrical filament offers the advantage of reducing the number of different shapes of electrode material through which current must flow. This correspondingly reduces the number of different current paths and thus reduces the resistance differences as current flows through different portions of the filament. In turn, in a manner discussed above, minimizing the resistance differences as current flows through the design correspondingly directly minimizes the resulting temperature differences. This in turn minimizes the distortion and degradation problems associated with conventional filament designs.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0075">As illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and elsewhere, the edges of the filaments adjacent the electrode contact openings <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> are typically formed into oblique geometries rather than rectangular ends. In a manner similar to the effect of the turns <b>71</b> in the filaments, these oblique ends help reduce localize resistance differences and thus in the current flow at these portions of the filament. This is also helpful given that current will tend to flow predominantly in one direction with respect to the electrode holes <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> and is less likely to flow in the small portion between the electrode hole and the absolute end of the filament.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0076"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is an example of another filament design <b>77</b> according to the invention that has the anode and cathode contacts <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> as described earlier. With the exception of the contacts <b>53</b>, <b>54</b>, the filament <b>77</b> has a rotational symmetry of order n, where in is at least 2 for minimizing the number of shapes the filament presents to current flowing therethrough during resistance heating. In particular, the metal filament illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> has a rotational symmetry of order <b>8</b>, with the exception of the portion where the electrodes <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> are present. Stated in different terms, the filament <b>77</b> in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is formed of two types of shapes: the longer U-shaped sections <b>80</b> and the shorter U-shaped sections <b>81</b>. As just described with respect to other filament designs, reducing the overall number of different shapes in a given filament design correspondingly reduces the variation in current flow through the filament thus reduces the variations in thermal expansion and thus increases the lifetime of the filament and potentially of the reactor in which the filament is used.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0077"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is another example of a filament designated at <b>83</b> that has a high order of rotational symmetry. The filament <b>83</b> again includes the anode and cathode contact openings <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> and likewise is highly symmetrical and presents only the large U-shaped portions <b>84</b> and the intermediate linear perimeter or portions <b>85</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0078"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is another example of a filament designated at <b>87</b> that has respective concentric portions <b>70</b> and turns <b>71</b> as previously described. This pattern, although not of high order symmetry, provides consistently arranged concentric portions that also reduce the current flow variations and thus reduce the temperature variations across this filament.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0079">In typical embodiments, the filaments illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 through 10</figref> all include the pin openings <b>73</b> so that the respective filaments can be mounted for controlled, but not unlimited, movement during expansion and contraction.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0080"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates an outer filament <b>90</b> functionally very similar to the one illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, but with the closed curve plane openings <b>65</b> being positioned more along the center line of the filament.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0081">In another aspect, the invention comprises a resistive-heated vapor deposition reactor formed of the reaction chamber <b>28</b> the gas inlets and outlets <b>24</b>, <b>35</b>, the filaments (e.g. <b>47</b>, <b>50</b>), and means for preventing the conductive filaments from unrestricted expansion and from contacting undesired portions of the reactor, heating assembly, or wafer carrier, when the filament expands and contracts under the influence of applied current in resulting temperature changes.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0082">As illustrated for example in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, in some embodiments the preventing means comprises the plurality of fixed pins <b>67</b> in the chamber and the plurality of pin openings <b>65</b> or <b>73</b> in the filaments for receiving the pins <b>67</b> in the openings <b>73</b> to thereby limit the movement of the filament when the filament is heated by the application of the current therethrough. In preferred embodiments and as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the reactor <b>20</b> typically includes at least the heat shield <b>33</b> with the pins <b>67</b> either fixed to or extending from the heat shield <b>33</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0083">Alternatively, and as illustrated in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the preventing means can comprise the upwardly projecting tabs or cradles <b>92</b> that are positioned in the openings between the arc-shaped portions <b>70</b> of the filament <b>50</b>. It will be understood that the shapes and positions of the tabs <b>92</b> can be selected to complement individual filaments and that the relationship among the illustrated filament <b>50</b>, its arc-shaped portions <b>70</b> and the illustrated tabs <b>92</b> is exemplary rather than limiting of this structural feature and its function. The tabs <b>92</b> are formed of an insulating material with alumina being satisfactory in many cases.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0084">In another aspect the invention is a method of increasing the lifetime and productivity of filament based resistive heated vapor deposition system. In this aspect, the method comprises heating the filament while permitting the filament to move as it expands under the effect of increasing temperature while limiting the movement of the filament to an amount that prevents the expanding movement of the filament from creating undesired contact with any portions of the reactor, including undesired expanded contact with itself across the gaps. The method prevents both undesired physical and electrical contact with other portions of the reactor and the filament.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0085"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates that the anode or cathode contacts on the filament <b>47</b> can be designed in a plurality of geometries in order to increase the filament lifetime and to enhance the process performance. <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref> (A, B, and C) is, of course, exemplary of these designs (as are for example <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>) rather than limiting.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0086">Similarly, <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14</figref> (A, B, and C) respectively illustrates additional embodiments of the turns in the filaments <b>47</b>. It will likewise be understood that the turns can be optimized to minimize warping and increase the uniformity of the heating step.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0087">In the drawings and specification there has been set forth a preferred embodiment of the invention, and although specific terms have been employed, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation, the scope of the invention being defined in the claims.</div>
