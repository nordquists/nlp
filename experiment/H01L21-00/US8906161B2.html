<heading>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0019">One embodiment of the present invention is hereinafter described while referring to the accompanying drawings.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0020">In the present embodiment, the semiconductor producing device of this invention is comprised of a plasma processing device (hereinafter referred to as an MMT device) utilizing a modified magnetron typed plasma source for generating high-density plasma by means of an electrical field and a magnetic field. The MMT device of this embodiment is configured to perform plasma processing of a semiconductor wafer (hereafter, called wafer) on which integrated circuit devices including semiconductor devices are produced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0021">A wafer is loaded in a processing chamber maintaining air-tight integrity in the MMT device. The reactive gas is fed via the shower plate into the processing chamber. The pressure within the processing chamber is maintained at a specified pressure, high frequency electric power is supplied to the discharge electrode, and along with forming an electrical field, a magnetic field is formed and magnetron discharge then occurs. The electrons emitted from the discharge electrode perform a continuous cycloid movement along the circumference while drifting, increasing the generation rate of ions due to long-life span to allow generation of high-density plasma. By exciting and breaking down the reactive gas in this way, the MMT device can subject the wafer to different types of plasma processing such as diffusion processing by oxidizing or nitriding the surface of the wafer, forming a thin film on the wafer surface and etching the wafer surface.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0022"> <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic structural diagram showing the MMT device for plasma processing of a wafer.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0023">The MMT device of this embodiment contains a processing chamber <b>201</b>. The processing chamber <b>201</b> includes a lower side container <b>211</b> as a second container and, an upper side container <b>210</b> as a first container covering the lower side container <b>211</b> from above. The upper side container <b>210</b> is formed in a dome shape from aluminum oxide or quartz, and the lower side container <b>211</b> is formed from aluminum. Incidentally, forming a susceptor <b>217</b> serving as the heater type substrate holding means described later, from quartz or aluminum nitride reduces metal contamination of the film during processing.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0024">A shower head <b>236</b> forming a buffer chamber <b>237</b> serving as the gas dispersion space, is provided in the upper side of the upper side container <b>210</b>. A gas feed port <b>234</b> serving as a gas feed port is provided on the upper wall of the shower head <b>236</b>. The lower wall of the shower head <b>236</b> is formed by a shower plate <b>240</b> containing gas spray holes <b>234</b> <i>a </i>as the spray outlet for spraying gas. The gas feed port <b>234</b> is connected via a gas supply pipe <b>232</b> serving as a supply pipe for supplying gas to the gas bomb (not shown in drawing) of a reactive gas <b>230</b>. A valve <b>243</b> <i>a </i>serving as a switching valve, and a mass flow controller <b>241</b> serving as the flow regulator means are installed on the gas supply pipe <b>232</b>. A gas exhaust port <b>235</b> serving as the exhaust port for evacuating gas is provided on the side wall of the lower side container <b>211</b> for allowing the reactive gas <b>230</b> supplied from the shower head <b>236</b> to the processing chamber <b>201</b> and the gas after processing, to flow to the bottom of the processing chamber <b>201</b> from the periphery of the susceptor <b>217</b>. The gas exhaust port <b>235</b> is connected via a gas exhaust pipe <b>231</b> serving as an exhaust pipe for evacuating gas, to a vacuum pump <b>246</b> serving as an exhaust device. A pressure controller (hereafter called APC) <b>242</b> and a valve <b>243</b> <i>b </i>as a switching valve are installed on this gas exhaust pipe <b>231</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0025">The MMT device contains a first electrode <b>215</b> as a discharge means for excitation of the reactive gas <b>230</b>. The first electrode <b>215</b> is formed in a tubular or preferably a cylindrical shape. The first electrode (hereafter called tubular electrode) <b>215</b> is installed on the outer circumference of the processing chamber <b>201</b>, and enclose a plasma generating region <b>224</b> within the processing chamber <b>201</b>. A high frequency power supply <b>273</b> for applying high frequency electric power is connected to the tubular electrode <b>215</b> via a matching transformer <b>272</b> for matching the impedance.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0026">The MMT device contains a pair of permanent magnets <b>216</b> above and below as a magnetic field forming means. The permanent magnets <b>216</b> are formed in a tubular or preferably a cylindrical shape. The pair of permanent magnets (hereafter called tubular magnets) <b>216</b>, <b>216</b> are installed near the upper and lower ends of the external surfaces of the tubular electrode <b>215</b>. These upper and lower tubular magnets <b>216</b>, <b>216</b> respectively possess poles on both ends (inner circumferential end and outer circumferential end) along the radius of the processing chamber <b>201</b>. These poles of the tubular magnets <b>216</b>, <b>216</b> are set facing each other in opposite directions. The poles on the inner circumferential section are therefore of different polarities. Magnetic lines of force are therefore formed towards the cylindrical axis along the inner circumferential surface of the tubular electrode <b>215</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0027">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the susceptor <b>217</b> is installed in the center on the bottom side of the processing chamber <b>201</b> as a substrate holding means for holding the substrate for processing. The detailed structure of the susceptor <b>217</b> is shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The susceptor <b>217</b> is supported by a cylindrical shaft <b>6</b>, and a cover <b>7</b> covers the bottom end opening of the shaft <b>6</b>. The susceptor <b>217</b> is formed from quartz. Forming the susceptor <b>217</b> from quartz yields superior resistance to heat and prevents metal contamination of the wafer <b>200</b>. The shaft <b>6</b> is also formed from quartz. Forming the shaft <b>6</b> from quartz yields superior resistance to heat and prevents metal contamination of the wafer <b>200</b>. Moreover, the effect is obtained that the shaft <b>6</b> can be easily welded to the susceptor <b>217</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0028">A heater <b>3</b> is installed inside the susceptor <b>217</b> as a heating means for heating the substrate for processing. In other words, a heater installation space <b>11</b> is formed in the interior of the susceptor <b>217</b>, and the heater <b>3</b> is installed with a specified clearance within the heater installation space <b>11</b>. The heater installation space <b>11</b> connects to the atmosphere by way of a heater wire insert hole <b>12</b>. By connecting the heater installation space <b>11</b> to the atmosphere, the effect is obtained that a sealed structure for the susceptor <b>217</b> can be easily formed. The heater <b>3</b> is formed from silicon carbide (SiC). By forming the heater <b>3</b> from silicon carbide, anti-oxidizing properties can be maintained even at high temperature regions of approximately 700 to 750° C. Consequently, the heater installation space <b>11</b> can be connected to the atmosphere. If the heater <b>3</b> is formed for example, from carbon (C) or nickel (Ni), then in the high temperature region, heat damage will occur due to a reaction with oxygen in the atmosphere and so the heater installation space <b>11</b> can not be connected to the atmosphere. The heater <b>3</b> can be used in the high temperature region if formed from platinum (Pt) which possesses anti-oxidizing properties. However, platinum possesses little resistance, so forming the heater <b>3</b> in a thin film shape is necessary in order to set a larger resistance or setting the electric power higher to cause a large electrical current flow is necessary, sometimes causing the problem that the thin section of the heater <b>3</b> melted.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0029">A heater wire <b>5</b> serving as a power supply element and connecting to the heater <b>3</b> is inserted through a heater wire insert hole <b>12</b>. Supplying electric power to the heater <b>3</b> from the heater wire <b>5</b> allows heating the wafer <b>200</b> up to approximately 300 to 900° C. The heater wire <b>5</b> is formed from silicon carbide as the same material as structural material for the heater <b>3</b>. Forming the heater wire <b>5</b> from silicon carbide as the same material as the heater <b>3</b> structural material, allows connecting the heater wire <b>5</b> to the heater <b>3</b> by welding and also yields the effect that the heater wire <b>5</b> can be exposed to the atmosphere, the same as the heater <b>3</b>. The heater wire <b>5</b> along the interior of the shaft <b>6</b> extends outward to the outside from the cover <b>7</b>, and connects to external wire (wiring harness, etc.) by way of the connecting element (terminal) on the outer side of the cover <b>7</b>. By inserting the heater wire <b>5</b> along the interior of the shaft <b>6</b>, the interior of the shaft <b>6</b> is isolated from the processing chamber <b>201</b> so that the effects caused by the reactive gas <b>201</b> in processing chamber <b>201</b> on the heater wire <b>5</b> can be prevented. The interior of the shaft <b>6</b> is connected to the atmosphere so that there is no need to construct an air-tight structure within the interior of the shaft <b>6</b> and therefore air-tight terminals such as hermetic terminals need not be utilized to connect the heater wire <b>5</b> to the external wire and costs can be reduced. The heater wire <b>5</b> made of silicon carbide is connected to external wire on the outer side of the cover <b>7</b> as the low temperature region, and by inserting it through the interior of the shaft <b>6</b> and connecting it to the heater <b>3</b> in the susceptor <b>7</b>, the complete heater wiring system can be protected from heat damage without providing a cooling structure and therefore costs are reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0030">An electrode (hereafter called the second electrode) <b>2</b> for varying the impedance is installed inside the susceptor <b>217</b>. In other words, an electrode installation space <b>13</b> is formed in the interior of the susceptor <b>217</b>, and the second electrode <b>2</b> is installed with a specified clearance in this electrode installation space <b>13</b>. The electrode installation space <b>13</b> is connected to the atmosphere by way of an electrode wire insert hole <b>14</b>. By connecting the electrode installation space <b>13</b> to the atmosphere, the effect is obtained that the sealed structure of the susceptor <b>217</b> can be made a simple structure. The second electrode <b>2</b> is made from platinum. By forming the second electrode <b>2</b> from platinum, anti-oxidizing properties can be maintained even at high temperature regions of approximately 700 to 750° C. Consequently, the electrode installation space <b>13</b> can be connected to the atmosphere. Platinum possesses little resistance, so adverse effects from generating heat can be avoided even if a change occurs in the quantity for controlling the high frequency electric power on the second electrode <b>2</b>. Consequently, effects exerted on the wafer <b>200</b> from the heating temperature can be suppressed.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0031">An electrode wire <b>4</b> serving as the power supply element is inserted in the electrode wire insert hole <b>14</b> and connects to the second electrode <b>2</b>. Supplying high-frequency electric power to the second electrode <b>2</b> from the electrode wire <b>4</b> allows regulating the impedance. The electrode wire <b>4</b> is formed from platinum and is same material as the structural material for the second electrode <b>2</b>. Forming the electrode wire <b>4</b> from platinum as the same material as the second electrode <b>2</b> structural material, allows connecting the electrode wire <b>4</b> to the second electrode <b>2</b> by welding and also yields the effect that the electrode wire <b>4</b> can be exposed to the atmosphere, the same as the second electrode <b>2</b>. The electrode wire <b>4</b> along the interior of the shaft <b>6</b> extends outward to the outside from the cover <b>7</b>, and connects to external wire (wiring harness, etc.) by way of the connecting element (terminal) on the outer side of the cover <b>7</b>. By inserting the electrode wire <b>4</b> along the interior of the shaft <b>6</b>, the interior of the shaft <b>6</b> is isolated from the processing chamber <b>201</b> so that the effects caused by the reactive gas on the electrode wire <b>4</b> in the processing chamber <b>201</b> can be prevented. The interior of the shaft <b>6</b> is connected to the atmosphere so that there is no need to construct an air-tight structure within the interior of the shaft <b>6</b> and therefore air-tight terminals such as hermetic terminals need not be utilized to connect the electrode wire <b>4</b> to the external wire and costs can be reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0032">The electrode wire <b>4</b> made of platinum is connected to the external wire on the outer side of the cover <b>7</b> as the low temperature region, and by inserting it through the interior of the shaft <b>6</b> and connecting it to the second electrode <b>2</b> in the susceptor <b>217</b>, the complete wiring system for the second electrode <b>2</b> can be protected from heat damage without providing a cooling structure and therefore costs are reduced.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0033">As shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the electrode wire <b>4</b> for the second electrode <b>2</b> is connected to a reference potential via a variable impedance mechanism <b>274</b>. The variable impedance mechanism <b>274</b> is comprised of a coil and a variable condenser. The potential of the wafer <b>200</b> can be controlled by controlling the number of coil patterns and the capacity of the variable condenser via the second electrode <b>2</b> and the susceptor <b>217</b>. The second electrode <b>2</b> may be connected to the high frequency power supply side, and may be connected to the reference potential side, and needless to say can be selected if necessary.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0034">A processing furnace <b>202</b> for processing the wafer <b>200</b> by magnetron discharge from a magnetron typed plasma source is comprised at least of the processing chamber <b>201</b>, the susceptor <b>217</b>, the tubular electrode <b>215</b>, the tubular magnet <b>216</b>, the shower head <b>236</b> and the exhaust port <b>235</b>. The processing furnace <b>202</b> is capable of plasma processing of the wafer <b>200</b> in the processing chamber <b>201</b>.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0035">A blocking plate <b>223</b> is installed for blocking the electrical field and magnetic field on the periphery of the tubular electrode <b>215</b> and tubular magnet <b>216</b>. This blocking plate <b>223</b> is structured to prevent the magnetic field and electrical field formed by the tubular electrode <b>215</b> and tubular magnet <b>216</b> from exerting adverse effects on the external environment and other processing furnaces, etc.</div>
<div class="description-paragraph" num="p-0036">The susceptor <b>217</b> is insulated from the lower side container <b>211</b>. A susceptor elevator mechanism <b>268</b> in the susceptor <b>217</b> is installed as a lifting/lowering means for lifting or lowering the susceptor <b>217</b>. The susceptor elevator mechanism <b>268</b> is comprised of the shaft <b>6</b> as shown in <figref idrefs="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and a drive mechanism (not shown in drawing) for driving the shaft <b>6</b> up and down.
